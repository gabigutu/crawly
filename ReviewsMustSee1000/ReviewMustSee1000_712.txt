		<shortDescription>You live in prison and what you live isn't giving any concessions to reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Un proph?te" tells the story of a somewhat naive but intelligent young inmate from Arabic origins who rises through the criminal ranks to become a big boss. Serve with an outstanding cast and an almost exclusively males and non-professional actors, the film of Jacque Audiard manages to prove that you don't need a so called bankable actor/actress in order to make a masterpiece. What you need is a vision, an excellent scenario and a perfect casting. Set mainly within prison walls, the film depicts the prison "career" of Malik el Djebena, a 19-year-old man of North African origin who was sentenced to six years in prison. At his arrival in prison, Malik (wonderfully played by Tahar Rahim) is forced by Cesar Luciani, a Corsican kingpin (played by the excellent Niels Arestrup) to kill a prisoner named Reyeb. What follows is a powerful film that grabs your attention from beginning to end. The film works on so many levels and yet achieves excellence in all of them. "Un proph?te" works as a social description of the hellish atmosphere one could encounter in prison. The promiscuity, the dirtiness, the drug, the sex, the corruption are detailed through very well drawn out characters and situations. You live in prison and what you live isn't giving any concessions to reality. "Un proph?te" is a thrilling gangster film deprave of any sort of Manichaeism. Between the buildings of a drug business, the contract to assassinate a mafia kingpin, the negotiation with a local mobster and the rise to power of a young bandit or "racaille", the film manages to link every single story and wrap them all in one big and dark vision of what the French society can also produce. Eventually the film triggers so many emotions; in 150 minutes the audience balances from bitterness to injustice and from violence to peace. Jacques Audiard and Stéphane Fontaine (director of photography) controlled with mastery both the "mise en sc?ne" and the cinematography. Using here stop motion there torch like effect and opposing darkness to light they cut out possible definitions for the words loyalty or betrayal, friendship or servitude, destiny or curse. The director of the excellent "de battre mon coeur s'est arr?té " and the very good "sur mes l?vre" signs here a haunting movie a unique cinematographic and emotional experience, a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Un Proph?te :: Jacques Audiard :: France :: 2008 : 2h35A young man is being admitted into prison. The scars on his body and face betray a violent past. He can barely read and write. He has no friends. Malik (Tahar Rahim) is 19 years old. Out on the concrete courtyard, he is recruited by the ruthless Corsican mafioso César (Niels Arestrup) to kill a rival passing through their prison. Malik is beaten into submission. His life could have ended right there and then. But that is not how it was to be. Malif comes out the corner fighting. Most of the film is concrete slabs and dirt. There is the constant murmur of the rumours passed around in Arabic and Corsican if it is not in banlieue slang French. And then there is the violence. Nobody gets punished because nobody interferes. Even when inmates get killed there is no indication that they are being investigated. The detainees are all on their own. We do see the state's legal machinery operating in the background with lawyers and judges shifting paper. We see the inmates work in the prison factory sowing clothes. We see the willing bullies being schooled. But the penitentiary staff shine mostly in their absence. Malik knows it is going to be a long 6 years. He takes what he can get, and tries to make the best of himself. He could have made an excellent career for himself in the army, if life had been different. He has the adaptability, the patience, the dedication, the intelligence and the lack of moral restraint to make it far, in the right framework. If only he had been in an organisation which could contain and direct him, rather than unleash him, as prison did. We see him slowly becoming a man to be reckoned with, creating his own new order. Make no mistake, this young man is taking you along to the bitter end. Un Proph?te is a tough film to watch, but immaculately constructed. I can not claim to have captured the full finesse of the all the criminal dealings, but it does not matter. The audience is thrown into the story as the young Malik is. Thrown in, to live it with him. And live it, you will. It is a masterfully made film with a clever script, an excellent cast and a surprising attention to detail. A rare pearl in the genre, bound to be as rewarded as director Audiard's previous De Battre mon coeur s'est arr?té, which won no less than 8 Césars! (incitatus.org)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the Renaissance of French Cinema - a Must-See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the biggest surprises of 2009, Jacques Audiard's 'Un Proph?te' is the best French film in a decade, garnering strong critical and word-of-mouth support and winning the Grand Prix in Cannes (which for years now means that it's the actual festival winner). The surprise is that the story is far from being original: a young Arab sentenced to (adult) prison for the first time is forced by a Corsican mafia boss running the strings there to do his bidding. By and by, he manages to use his underling position to his own advantage. So it's a typical hard-boiled underdog story - what makes it so great then? 'Un Proph?te' doesn't differ much in style from the French films of late, which were often so hell-bent on displaying life as a gritty and boring affair, and resorted to radical violence to underscore this point, that spectators were almost forced to feel disgusted, which was then claimed to be a denominator of the film's artistic success. This phenomenon has been called 'New French Extremity'. What Jacques Audiard has done is to combine the aesthetics of this trend with the traditions which once made the French film industry the most power- and meaningful in Europe, namely to focus on the relationship of the leading actors. The result is a film that is totally engaging from the first minute, because it entrusts the actors with the task of transforming the script into something of their own making.And boy oh boy, Tahar Rahim does that job. A newcomer with a little bit of TV experience, his performance carries 'Un Proph?te' with amazing vigor. It's a big chance, and he takes it. Would this be an English-language film, he'd be a surefire contender for the awards. His nemesis is portrayed by Niels Arestrup in an equally flawless, yet much more routinized way, which juxtaposes the two characters perfectly. Add to this the sophisticated editing already present in Audiard's last film 'De battre mon coeur s'est arreté' (2005), and you have the best European film of 2009, in spite of a story that you will most likely have seen dozens of times already.If you usually don't like European movies, or if you have only time to see one a year, watch this one - you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the first French film I have ever watched. I decided to give it a go.Initially I wasn't holding out much hope when I placed the DVD into my drive, I was wrong.The film is a hard hitting which keeps you gripped and awaiting the clever plot, it doesn't not disappoint and the way in which the plot unfolds is clever as well as realistic. The actors do a very good job and the main actor is especially good, the white mob boss is also a superb actor.The film is about an Arab who enters jail after a life of trouble. He soon becomes gripped into the underworld of gang violence, he then joins a white gang whilst carrying out jobs for them. Whilst he cleverly starts to build his own empire.Go watch this film now, sometimes I don't watch films if I have not seen reviews or thousands of votes here on IMD. Trust me on this film, one of the best films I have seen in a long time and I am sure you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2009</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 19-year-old man of North African origin is sentenced to six years in prison for assaulting a police officer. When he enters prison, he is na?ve, shy, and almost withdrawn and cannot read or write. When he leaves six years later, he has become a self possessed, educated individual, capable of controlling his own destiny as well as that of others. Jacques Audiard's (Read My Lips, The Beat That My Heart Skipped) A Prophet, winner of the Grand Prix Award at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, is an engrossing coming-of-age drama set in a French prison in which Malik el Djebena (Tahar Rahim), a Muslim estranged from his own community, is recruited into the ruling Corsican Mafia and eventually becomes a gang leader himself. Though deeply involved in nefarious and often bloody activities, the genuineness of his personality makes him an appealing and sympathetic character and adds depth to a riveting experience.Based on a story by screenwriter Abdel Raouf Dafri, the film clocks in at a lengthy 150 minutes but never feels padded or stretched out. Unable to film in an actual prison location (because they were all being used), Audiard had his own prison built in an industrial area of Paris. As he explains, "Watching it take shape helped us build the prison in our minds, as well." When Malik first arrives, he is singled out by Corsican Mafia boss César Luciani (Niels Arestrup) and told to kill a fellow Muslim prisoner Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi) by slitting his throat with a razor blade. If he refuses, he will be killed himself.Once the job is done in as brutal a killing scene as you will ever witness or want to witness, Malik is put under César's protection, becoming the Corsican's Arab who carries out menial tasks for him inside the prison. Beset by visions of the deceased Reyeb, Malik, however, soon begins to educate himself on many levels, not only learning to read, but teaching himself Corsican and learning details of Luciani's business. More importantly for his survival, he learns how to operate among the various prison subcultures with their various rituals and codes of honor though he is still an outsider, not fully trusted by either group.There is no shortage in the film of details involving drug traffic, sex, payoffs, and general prison corruption, things we have seen before, yet the level of our personal involvement remains high due to the heart pounding set pieces and the compelling performances of the lead actors. Slowly, César raises the level of jobs given to Malik, affording him the opportunity to leave the confinement of the prison on several day passes, one involving his first ever flight to Marseilles to negotiate with another Mafia kingpin. Little by little, Malik sets up his own enterprises with his friend Ryad (Adel Bencherif) who is suffering from cancer, and begins to establish his independence from the Corsicans. He becomes known as a prophet when he survives a bizarre car crash, an incident that has been foretold in a fantasy sequence.Supported by a compelling original score by Alexandre Desplat and brilliant cinematography by Stéphane Fontaine, A Prophet is violent, often ugly and difficult to watch, but is redeemed by the quality of the direction, the outstanding performances by Rahim and Arestrup and the honesty in which it handles the conflicts among ethnic groups, conflicts that mirror French society as a whole. Tahar Rahim is little more than a cipher at the beginning, yet acquires considerable strength of character by the end of the film. According to Audiard, "When I looked into his eyes there was no melancholy, no tragedy, just someone very open, very light, very full of life." A mixture of gritty reality, flights of fancy, identity exploration, and psychological character study, A Prophet is one of the best films of 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>where did the time go?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline of this film is well documented by other reviewers. I read the reviews at 2.30 this afternoon and by 5 PM I was in the local cinema. I wondered if I could survive 150 minutes but I found myself at the end wishing to know more, and rather regretting the end of this fascinating movie. I am not an expert review writer but I found the character portrayals so realistic that they nearly jumped out of the screen. Yes there is violence, bloody in parts, but it is so monumentally well filmed I could look away from the gore and towards the film as a work of art. If there was a mixture of amateur and professional actors, I could not tell the difference.The names and functions of some of the various characters were lost on me but I got the general gist of it and I was motivated to consider the effect on the psychology of an unremitting regime of politics and violence. There is much food for thought here and I can unreservedly recommend it to all but the most squeamish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Requiem for a prophet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A juvenile delinquent named Malik (Tahar Rahim) goes to prison after spending most of his up-growing in juvenile correctional facilities. Malik soon learns that he's no longer a small fish in an aquarium, but a fry in an ocean. And swimming with the big fish is quite a different state of affairs as he is bound to discover.Pic's protagonist is recruited by the Corsican gang and being an Arab by appearance (granted, apparently not religiously), he continues to live as an outsider of not only society but also fellow inmates as he has done most of his life. But he continues to float and find his way behind the bars.In the exquisite direction of Jaques Audiard, the film accelerates well through good character development and profound script. The education of Malik is in my opinion one of the main pillar of the film because it is an education on so many levels. Of least to get ahead in business. Dirty business, granted, but it is business nonetheless.It's the small things that distinguishes this little gem from many other movies on prison culture. It has to be, Audiard knows this and has created yet another great piece of cinema for his fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2009, a landmark film for French Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes this movie is violence. Yes this movie contains racism and some unpleasant actors, but prisoners usually aren't stand up citizens. And these characters and location of the film are essential to the core message of the film, I guess if you don't know at least the basics of Islams or some of its myths then maybe the movie might go over your head. But I wouldn't dare spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet. But this movie is a modern work of art (and I adhere to a very strict definition of art) and even if you might not "get it" it should be thoroughly enjoyable, the cast does a marvelous job (a testament to the director's skill), and it's marvelously shot and cut. This is the kind of movie where you can't look away, every scene flows seamlessly into the next. So yeah, go watch it as soon as you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the same league as Gomorra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read that this movie has more nominations than any other film for the European Film Awards (even more than Slumdog Millionaire) I decided to go and see it. I don't regret this decision and I hope the movie wins all six awards it has been nominated for.This movie, about a young hoodlum who in prison becomes a dangerous criminal, is in the same league as last years's Gomorra. It shows the life of criminals as it is: tough, merciless and unscrupulous. This film is miles away from the romantic image of maffia-style crime gangs we know from Hollywood. There is no honour here, no attachments, no loyalty. Only self-interest. The style of the film reflects the rawness of its subject. The photography is meant to show life in a prison, not to please our sense of aesthetics.Why is this such a good film? Because of the radical approach to show us nothing but the raw underbelly of France, but also because of the story which has many aspects. Malik, the central character, has no true identity at all: he is not a religious Muslim (he eats pork), but he is neither French nor Corsican. The members of the Corsican clan to which he is being attached despise him because he is not one of them, and so do the religious Muslims ('les barbus'). Another interesting aspect is the development of the relationship between Malik en the Corsican capo Cesar, with a very powerful apotheosis. And there is the changing of Malik himself of course, who in the beginning of this film seems to be devoid of any emotion at all, but in the end is capable of warm feelings towards his godson and the wife of his terminally ill friend.After having seen Un Proph?te, I regret not having seen Jacques Audiards other films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the truly great films of 2010, "A Prophet" is an unforgettable account of a young man's experiences in a French prison.Malik El Djebena is only 19 when he's sentenced to six years in prison for a crime he claims he didn't commit. Though an Arab, Malik becomes the cat's-paw for an aging Corsican mob boss named Cesar Luciani whose influence in the prison has begun to wane as more and more Muslims are brought in to swell the prisoner ranks. Eventually, the ever-resourceful Malik finds a way to straddle the lines separating the various factions in the prison, while at the same time partnering with his buddy to run a hashish operation when he's out on his frequent 24-hour leaves.The beauty of "A Prophet" is that we really get the sense that, had he been dealt a halfway decent hand in life, Malik might have actually been a kind, caring person, instead of the lost soul that he's become. But the lack of any parental influence in his life, his illiteracy, and now his consignment to prison life have left him with few viable options other than to become involved in mayhem and crime. He's horrified by the fact that, as a kind of loyalty test early on, Luciani forces him to murder in cold blood a man he doesn't know and might even like under other circumstances. And there are heartbreaking moments throughout where we sense the goodness in Malik's tortured soul. His appreciation of simple kindnesses, his attempts at learning to read, his childlike wonder as he looks out of a plane window for the first time, his tenderness with a buddy's newborn son - all go a long way towards mitigating some of the truly despicable acts of violence and murder he's called upon to do. The brilliant screenplay wisely refuses to judge Malik; it simply presents the options and parameters that have been given to him by fate, society, nature, what have you - and watches as he maneuvers through, in and around them in order to survive.Harsh and brutal as this film can be at times - for it never shies away from portraying what life is like in a prison setting - it is in those more lyrical moments, the ones in which we are allowed to see into the heart of this young man, that "A Prophet" achieves true masterpiece status.Tahar Rahim rises to the challenge in a brilliantly understated, award-worthy performance as Malik, capturing our sympathy and concern throughout. Niels Arestrup is also outstanding as the brutal and demanding Luciani, as is Adel Bencherif as Malik's one friend from prison who serves as both a positive and a negative influence on the young man.Directed with unerring conviction and power by Jacques Audiard, "A Prophet" is a cinematic work of art - and a movie not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish and engaging crime story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with praise is that so much is said and so much is built up that at times it can be quite imposing for me to approach a film to watch it for what it is. This happened with A Prophet, which is why it took me over a year to get around to watching it. The uniformly great praise and the awards all built this film up in my head as something that would be worthy, perhaps a little arty and maybe even deliberately inaccessible (which can be the case with some films that critics gush over ? partly I think it makes them appear smart). Also, lest we forget, it is also in French and runs to almost two and a half hours long. However I decided it had been on my queue for far too long as it was and recently I sat to watch it.What I found was not an art film, not a pretentious film, not a "foreign" film but rather just a really well told story of a young man falling into a life of crime but then climbing and scheming his way up it. The rather breathless manner in which the film has been discussed doesn't do it any favours because, if you ignore all the words, the film is just this and it does it very well indeed. The Malik at the start of the film is very different from the Malik in the later stages, even though only a few years have passed. The difference is very well handled and we see him grow in his abilities, his confidence and also his ruthlessness. All of this occurs in a consistent flow of narrative that begins with him being forced into a violent act (one that stays with him) but then making himself useful and starting his own things on the side. In terms of narrative events it is very well structured and easy to follow, but it is the emotional journey that adds layers to it.I read one critic compare the journey from (comparative) innocence to that taken by Michael Corleone in The Godfather and, while the details are more low-key and grubby, it is a fair comparison. Malik is fascinating as he stresses himself sick over his first kill, but just as fascinating when playing the odds with the various factions he straddles with influence. He is never free of beatings or risk, but he engages in the way he deals with it all with confidence and a growing willingness to do what is required. Director Audiard delivers it all with a range of styles ? most of which work. At times it feels very seedy and grey in colour, particularly at the start and the camera sits in corners and watches from afar; this then contrasts with other scenes where it owes a debt to Scorsese in the use of music and montages (Malik being put in role of porter to the sound of Nas being a sudden but effective change in style). I wasn't really feeling the use of words on the screen ? it didn't seem to add much and it did feel a bit too derivative, but other than this I had no complaints.The performances are mostly very strong. The standout is of course Rahim in the lead role; he convinces in his journey and he pitches his development just right across the film ? never going too far from who he is, not becoming a different person, but just showing growth and change in small but important ways. Arestrup is nearly as good as the cruel but fading lord of the prison while Bencherif, Yacoubi and many others make convincing supports. The world of the prison also feels very real and very threatening and even the extras add to the feeling of the place.A Prophet is a great film: a crime story with strong characters, well developed plot and a constant feel of risk and threat without being over the top or losing touch with the gritty real feel of the prison world. Directed with style (but not too much style) the film uses the cast well and produces a roundly engaging and satisfying story. Perhaps a bit too over-hyped and made out to be way more than it is, it is still very much seeing and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Goodfellas and other such crime stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch Prison Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prophet is a major epic set in a French prison in which a young Muslim man is recruited into the ruling white mafia and ultimately plays everyone in order to become a gang warlord of sorts for himself. What I liked about this film is that there wasn't one reference to 9/11. I've seen (of course) Italian gangster movies, Irish gangster movies, Cuban and African American and Puerta Rican gangster movies, but a Muslim gangster movie, well, how refreshing! The plot is thickened a little with just a touch of the supernatural (prophesy of course) to keep us interested for two and a half hours. I have to admit it was hard to keep track of some of what was going on simply because this movie was subtitled and had a lot of characters, but I got the overall gist despite it all and I enjoyed it. Not as dark as Midnight Express and not as corny as Shashawk Redemption, this is definitely worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An example of how prison serves as an education for criminals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨In exchange I offer you protection; If you don't kill him, I'll kill you. ¨ Jacques Audiard directs this great French prison film which is perhaps the best gangster movie I've seen since The Goodfellas. It has some great scenes combining violent action sequences with a character driven plot. Audiard has created a masterpiece; the entire film takes place mostly in the prison and he worked with ex convicts in order to set the right mood. Un Prophete (A Prophet) was nominated for Best Foreign Film in the Oscars and lost to the Argentinean movie, El Secreto de Sus Ojos, which was also a great character driven film. Audiard not only directed the film, but he also co-wrote the adaptation of the script along with Thomas Bidegain. It is an interesting character study on how an innocent man gets involved with the wrong people and becomes entangled in a life of crime. There is something symbolic about his illiteracy as he learns how to read in prison, and he also learns how the mob works by serving and getting involved with them, therefore the prison became his school both in a positive and negative way. When I watched this movie I couldn't help but compare several scenes with such classic movies as Scarface, The Godfather and The Goodfellas. This movie does have its flaws, for instance, women are depicted poorly as the few female characters are either prostitutes or weak minded, but the story makes up for it along with the lead actors who give terrific performances.A nineteen year old Franco-Arab, named Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim), has just been sent to prison for six years in Brecourt for assaulting a police officer. He is alone in prison without any friends and has to learn how to survive. At first he tries to stay in the down low, but solitary convicts are the easiest prey. The prisoners are divided in two groups, the Muslims on the one hand and the Corsicans, who seem to be in control of the prison because they have several connections with the guards, on the other. Malik is an Arab, but he doesn't practice their religion so he doesn't seem to fit with the Muslims and he isn't Corsican either. Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup) is the leader of the Corsicans inside the prison and after a new Arab prisoner arrives who happens to be a key witness against one of them, Cesar has to find a way of killing him before the trial. The problem is that since he is an Arab he can't get to close to him and therefore realizes that Malik is the right person for the job. The Corsicans force Malik to kill him and offer protection in return, although Malik doesn't really have an option because if he doesn't comply they will kill him. Malik, despite being an Arab, begins serving the Corsicans and little by little wins the confidence of Cesar, although he is seen by the rest of the mobsters as a dirty Arab. Malik begins learning how to read and befriends his teacher, Ryad (Adel Bencherif), and at the same time he begins learning Corsican and the mobster lifestyle. Little by little Malik begins to learn more about criminal life and slowly begins to rise. He is not the same person he was when he arrived at the prison.Un Prophete has a very interesting plot, but it works in the most part because of the great performances given by the lead actors Tahir Rahim and Niels Arestrup who are just outstanding and very believable in their roles. The success of a character driven movie depends most of the time on the actors, and newcomer Tahir Rahim gives an Oscar worthy performance. The movie is about two and a half hours long and requires your full attention because of the parallel action sequences, but the movie doesn't seem to drag at any point and it never gets to a point where you begin to lose interest. Un Prophet is an excellent film and one you will enjoy. It is definitely worth your time so I recommend you check this movie out.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Represents gritty film-making at its most uncompromising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malik (Tahar Rahim) is a nineteen-year-old Arab boy, thrown into a French prison to serve a six-year sentence. He is alone without any friends, contacts or relatives. Inside the prison is an ongoing feud between the Corsican and the Arab prisoners. Malik cannot read or write but he is able to speak Arabic, making him an asset to César Luciani (Niels Arestrup), a criminal who has the guards in his pocket and seemingly unlimited power in the prison. César wants to use Malik to infiltrate the Arab cellblock and kill someone. He offers him protection but also brutally threatens to kill him if he refuses or does not comply. Malik's attempts to escape his first assignment are futile because of the power the Corsican gangsters hold and ultimately his murder of the inmate becomes just one chapter in a lengthy career of organised crime.Last year director Jacques Audiard was awarded the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival for A Prophet and his film was also nominated for the Golden Palm as well. More recently, the film was named Best Foreign Film at the BAFTA Awards, certifying its contentions for Oscar glory too. There are enormous expectations when a film is surrounded by these sorts of accolades, which makes it disappointing to say that this is film that one would like to love, rather than having complete admiration for everything that it does. Regardless, Audiard's film is still inspired by a number of qualities that immerse one into the callousness of gangsters and prison life. The film has been photographed for maximum authenticity and realism, with the muted colours a reflection of the raw grittiness of the prison but also the isolation of Malik himself too. The attention to detail in each of the scenes, from the containment of the tiny cells, the graphic violence or even the way the guards thoroughly strip-search prisoners, represents gritty film-making at its most uncompromising.The films narrative commences in the most fascinating way, demonstrating the unflinching power of the mob, even in confinement. The tension that is developed from Malik's preparation of his first task is quite extraordinary. The vision of him holding a razor blade in his mouth and then spitting blood in a sink is filmed with such clarity and dread that it becomes mesmerising in its brutality. What climaxes at the end of this task is as suspenseful as it is disturbing. It is odd then that the rest of the film is muddy and fails to reach the heights of intensity of this previous scene. While there are some satisfying moments showing Malik growing in his stature, the film becomes increasingly bogged down and confusing in its details about deals and double-crosses and the business aspects of drug running. It is with this convoluted narrative, a contrast to the early parts of the film, that a lot of the power of A Prophet is diminished, making it harder to care about what is going on.Aside from the confusing storytelling, one of the most consistent aspects of the film is the very strong performance by Tahar Rahim as Malik. The decision to use a lesser known actor is a smart one because Rahim is able to build a completely assured reality about this character. His appearance convinces as much as his emotions. He has scars all over his back but one can also envision the internal trauma he suffers, given the blood on his hands. He grieves prior to his assignment and then afterwards he is regularly plagued by the ghost of the man he murdered. He gradually grows in confidence over the years, becoming a more efficient criminal, but he is also frustrated by his feebleness at the hands of César. It is quite an accomplished performance for a relatively young actor. César is a thoroughly interesting character as well, because while he is selfish, brutal and intolerable to Malik, there is also one part in the film where he shows a hint of vulnerability as he sits alone in his cell, following the transfer of a number of his men. This is again another really strong performance by an actor who is not particularly recognisable, allowing for a complete sense of immersion into the performance.A Prophet could be a film that improves on multiple viewings if one is able to obtain a greater understanding of the plot and the interplay between the gangs. On initial viewing some will feel they are completely out of the loop and others might be deterred by the infrequent but highly graphic violence and difficult subject matter. These issues aside though, Audiard's film still possesses a gritty, authentic visual style along with a complex and layered performance by Rahim, who will in time become a powerful contributor to foreign cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surviving and Graduating in Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The illiterate eighteen year-old Franco-Arab Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) is sent to Brécourt prison sentenced to six years for assaulting police officers. Alone and without money, Malik finds unprotected in an environment of corruption and violence divided by the Corsican and Muslim gangs. The powerful Corsican mobster César Luciani (Niels Arestrup) forces him to kill the Muslin Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi) and then gives support and protection to him in his gang. Malik befriends Ryad (Adel Bencherif) that teaches him how to read and write and they become best friends. Meanwhile César uses Malik to help him outside prison in his dirty business with casinos. Malik also learns how to deal drugs and climbs positions in the hierarchy of César's mafia."Un Proph?te" is the story of a smalltime punk that leans how to survive in a French prison and graduates in crime in the end. The acting is great; the story is very realistic; but this film is overrated in IMDb. The title "A Prophet" is never clear and the director Jacques Audiard uses the surrealistic vision of Reyeb to give the status of cult to this film that is in the end, a good movie about prison. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Profeta" ("The Prophet")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best crime sagas ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very rewarding second viewing. On paper it's kind of a typical rise of a gangster story, but when you get involved it's something entirely unique. Jacques Audiard is an immensely talented director and he creates an ambiance here that is chilling and intense all the way through. Few filmmakers can create action scenes that get a lump in your throat the way that he does here. Every time a knife or a gun comes on screen there's that feeling that anything can happen, it's all so gritty and real. Even some of the most skilled directors can't manage to create something that feels so real in this current state of cinema where everything is so sensationalized and the most brutal violence has become commonplace. But it never feels like the stakes are low here and nothing feels run of the mill. From the first killing until that final shootout in the SUV, every scene of violence had my blood pumping, even on a second viewing.What's most impressive about the film though is the journey that Malik goes through. For a film that takes place primarily inside a prison, the scope here is really epic. Spanning several years, it takes us on Malik's journey from this scared, uneducated thug with no friends into a bonafide crime lord with fleets at his back. It's a powerful tale, there are so few films that have created such a transformation like this. Most powerful of all is the fact that you don't even realize the scope of that evolution of character until the very end. Audiard, and Tahar Rahim in a breathtaking performance, make this journey so authentic and genuine that you just coast on this path with him without even realizing how different he becomes by the end. When the final credits roll and you look back at the young man that we started the film with, it's absolutely astonishing the evolution the character has gone through over the past two and a half hours. Audiard and Rahim create one of the finest character studies in one of the most impressive crime films of the past decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The French/Arab Racial Conflict in Microcosm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fascinating look into the French prison system.A terrific young actor named Tahar Mahim plays Malik, an Arab teenager sentenced to six years in prison. He's drafted by a Corsican gang that practically runs the prison to kill a fellow Muslim inmate who plans to act as a witness as part of a plea bargain. Once he does that he earns protection from the Corsicans, even though they continue to treat him like a servant because he's Arab, but because of their protection he's able to use his wiles to rise through the criminal ranks and emerge from the prison a major crime boss."Un Prophete" uses the prison setting to serve as a microcosm of French culture and current racial conflicts between the French and Arab immigrants. Mahim isn't educated, but he's smart, and he knows that to declare allegiance to either side is to limit his ultimate potential. Mahim gives an amazing, unshowy performance; it's largely because of him that the scene in which he carries out the hit is such a nail biter.One brief scene late in the film suggests that there might be a literal meaning to the film's title, but overall the meaning is thematic -- Malik becomes a prophet to his people, but his story illustrates that not all messages carried to us from prophets are necessarily positive ones.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Predict This Won't Get Half The Commercial Recognition It Deserves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Un prophete", released in the United Kingdom only this passed week, is an epic crime drama told about a young Arab sent to prison who works, fights and schemes his way to the top of the pecking order in a French prison. Expertly filmed by Jacques Audiard (The Beat That My Heart Skipped), it hallmarks a return to form for contemporary French cinema, headed by a director who has carved himself quite the career, with this being his magnum opus to date. "Mesrine", a French gangster film released in 2009, was a stylised tale of a mans descent into the criminal underworld, but lacked a certain gravitas when needed to push itself into iconic status. Where "Mesrine" failed, "Un Prophete" has excelled. The cinematography is a gritty affair, told in faded greys and blues managing to highlight the drab and claustrophobic nature of incarceration. Jacques Audiard knows how to captivate his audience, from the opening sequence of our protagonist, Malik El Djebena, being taken to jail, peering out onto the world from behind the police vans bars, to feeling surrounded by the prisons inmates, he makes you feel as trapped as the one we are watching. The notable lack of primary colours, while perhaps unoriginal, is pivotal in hammering home the violence and its impact when it does start. Thankfully, there aren't ridiculously over the top shootouts as there were in "Mesrine", which manages to maintain a sense of realism, a sense of believability which in a film such as this the audience desperately needs to feel. "Un prophete", however, is decidedly non-"Hollywood" and will have many not used to "European" cinema claiming it to be a dull, overly-long affair, yet it is because of its more languid tendencies, that it resonates more. None of the events in nor outside the prison would matter if Audiard did not develop the characters he has on screen sufficiently enough for us to connect with any of them on any emotional level. In "The Beat That My Heart Skipped" Romain Duris' performance carries what is a good yet occasionally uneven film, so it comes as no surprise that the leading men in "Un Prophete" powerfully command the screen with their presences leaving the viewer in no doubt that Audiard has a gift as a director for bringing out an actors' full talent. Tahar Rahim (Malik El Djebena) and Niels Arestrup (Cesar Luciani) play their leading roles perfectly, both carrying off the naiveté and hauteur respectively required for their ying and yang roles.There are several themes running throughout "Un Prophete" the most obvious being a subtle social commentary on multiracial interaction in France. There is a keen sense of the director commenting on the strained relationships between the Caucasian French and their Arabic cohabitants, deliberately remarking on the way the Arabic population are deliberately looked down upon as inferior beings. This is brought up on numerous occasions with the Corsicans open distaste for the Arabic inmates but Audiard shows their racial prejudice to be their downfall as the population swells and their faith becomes a binding force, perhaps in itself a call to arms for French politicians to address what is a time bomb in their own country. Another theme is a keen sense of old replacing the new it terms of crime syndicate circles. Luciani is the Godfather of the Corsicans, though is never called as such. His position and means of dictation hallmark Pacino's "Godfather", to a time of crime which in a contemporary setting seems outdated. This point is again made when Malik is asked to be the Godfather of his friend Reyeb's child, yet the terminology is meant in its religious sense as opposed to the mafia one. "Un Prophete" is a stunningly good film full of crisp, composed, cinematography that moves at a good rate, developing and fleshing out characters while being able to keep the story flowing. Audiard has his audience engrossed from the opening sequence and never lets go, from Malik's "induction" into the Corsican camp through to the protagonist sense of bewilderment and awe on his first flight and visit to a beach, that is almost childlike in its innocence. Unfortunately, "Un Prophete" while making all the right critical noises will never have the same impact on the cinematic masses that films such as "Avatar" are having and is somewhat disheartening, despite its Cannes "Grand Prize de Jury". Purchasing a ticket for the screening I was "warned" the film was subtitled to which I replied "do you have to warn us that it's not in 3D as well?", which may have been a jokingly snide quip but is a sad indictment of the times. Nevertheless, for those that get the opportunity to view this film you will not be disappointing as "Un Prophete" is a powerful production carrying some stellar performances from both cast and director. It is an engrossing crime drama that manages to be both brutal and shocking yet humane and heart warming that will convert even the most ardent disbeliever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's the second time I watch this very very powerful crime drama. What a jewel, the perfect example of Hollywood industry will never - and I mean it - never make. That's the perfect "anti SCARFACE" movie. The best example of what the ambitious thugs in prison have to do in order to succeed in the crime world. SCARFACE was somewhere a very moral film, where the ending showed the audiences that crime never pays. In this movie, that's just the contrary. Everyone, well nearly everyone, can identify himself in the main character. The common petty hoodlum who is ready to anything to become a gang leader. Anything. That's not the hero type. No, folks. Sometimes, he may make you feel dizzy, especially in the murder sequence, in the cell, when he cuts his mate's throat, only to save his own life, threaten by the Corsican mob. And afterwards, he also may look like a good guy, brave and so on, but he still remains a bastard. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERAnd at the end, he survives and you guess he will become a real lead in the crime industry. Only because he was a ruthless guy. The real, cruel face of reality. And appreciate the nearly finale scene, where the former Corsican gang leader falls, suddenly becomes no one, the exact character the lead was at the beginning of the film. This made me think, think, think, long after the viewing of this absolute superb french crime drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spellbinding character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most compelling about this film is the protagonist's transformation from a frightened, rootless and illiterate juvenile to an intelligent and powerful man taking charge of his personal destiny. I think the movie needed to be two and a half hours long in order for such dramatic character development to be believable, and for an underdog with so many disadvantages to turn into the top dog in the yard. The emotional justice of the ending was as satisfying as it gets. I also appreciated how the film gets the viewer to root for a Arab Muslim. As an American, I've received so many negative stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims as terrorists, this film provided a helpful shift in perspective. The Arab prison gang and organized criminals were no better or worse, no more or less greedy or brutal, than the Corsicans, or any other gangsters. The protagonist and his friend who died of cancer were well-rounded, complex and recognizable human beings, and the fact that they were Arabs was ancillary to their character development. All this helped dismantle stereotyped prejudice, and portray human life in more realistic complexity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>much more than meets the eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of this film and I have read more or less every review available on it. I find it extremely frustrating that I seem to have noticed something about it that NOBODY else seems to. I thought the director in a subtle, covert way indicates the guy WAS some kind of a prophet indeed, someone destined maybe to unite various nationalities there etc, and therefore immune to failure. Hence his incredible success every time he gets a permission to leave the prison for a few days, he was accomplishing amazing things like to murder a tough criminal in a broad daylight and return to his cell unscratched and unsuspected. There is a moment in that scene when the bodyguard of his mark is emptying his magazine on the him inside the car and yet he is strangely smiling, as if in a trance, as if knowing no bullet can get him? He undertakes education and self-illumination in prison, he gets to marry someone else's widow to take care of his family... He also kills left and right but all of this killing is to not perish himself.. He gets more and more ethnically and religiously aware... he has visions of the inmate he murdered and these visions are almost poetic and place him in a near-trance state... When the car is about to hit a deer crossing the road he has a vision of that too. It is reminiscent vaguely of the life of... prophet Mohammed, yes yes, or at least some other kind of prophet that is a real prophet, with visions and all. He starts off as an uneducated, simple street animal, illiterate and he cannot know what's in store for him. But he embarks on a spiritual discovery, changes during the film, becomes more political, mature and ... charismatic. By the end of the film, when he gets out, he is known and even the mysterious imam took notice. What exactly is the meaning of the very final shot, when he is walking with his future wife and adopted child and a column of elegant cars is following him slowly? They seem to have waited for his release from prison! For me it is the imam's parade, the religious and political Islamic people who want him in, because there is something special about the young fellow. Maybe the film is not really only about prison realism, it is how a religious/ political future leader can be born out of sheer violence and social injustice? I would understand that the director never mentions it in interviews and all, why would he want to risk the wrath of overzealous, oversensitive religious fanatics??</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Un Proph?te: A Worthwhile Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard positive reviews and opinions, and with the award hype attributed to it, Un Prophéte was a film I was eager to see. Providing an interesting look at issues of race within the penal system, the film is certainly not without merit.The film follows the story of Malik, a young man imprisoned for an unclear crime who soon learns that survival in prison is much different to survival in the outside world. He struggles to find himself between the Muslims and the Corsicans, both of which reject him as a member of the other.From its beginning, Un Proph?te offers an interesting look at prison life and the stigma of entering it. Although it starts strong, it's not long before things become problematic. While it is indeed interesting, entertaining, and engaging, the film left me with the impression that it was missing something important. The transition the main character undergoes as part of the film is the centerpiece of the work, and it is the ease and rapidity with which it is undergone that caused this problem with my viewing. Though it does not go unmentioned, the moral implications of some of Malik's acts seem underplayed and almost forgotten, doing little to endear me to this character. His smooth transition to criminal mastermind was just a little too smooth for my tastes, and I soon found my faith in the character, and the film, lost. Aside from this, the plot is entertaining and keeps the pace well. Tahir Rahim and Niels Arestrup each provide strong performances, Arestrup's fading glory conveyed with a glorious subtlety.Benefiting from a good cast, Un Proph?te provides a range of fine performances. Though the central character is lacking and, for me, unrelatable, the plot of the film manages to carry it along nicely, ensuring it is a worthwhile watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Criminal Education</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From France comes one of the finest crime movies I've seen in recent times. I wouldn't hesitate to put it alongside a modern masterpiece like City of God. Jacques Audiard's is not as technically inventive as Fernando Meirelle's movie, but in its linear plot it also tells a brutal story about a man who has nothing else to hold on to other than a life of crime.Malik El Djebena is a young Arab man who arrives at a penitentiary without knowing anything about prison life, without connections inside and without friends outside. In short, prison is about to become a manual for life. And what he learns is how to kill people, outguess inmates, mediate between gangs, set up his own drug business and other useful knowledge that will be useful in his future life of crime outside. Because in spite of his corruption, Malik is an exemplary inmate, protected by other inmates and with certain perks, like having half a day outside prison to work in an honest job, as part of his rehabilitation process.Outside prison he performs missions for the prison Kingpin, a Corsican named César, who's taken Malik under his wing after he killed a snitch for him. César, like the other racist Corsicans who run the prison, thinks Malik is just an ignorant Arab and yet as time goes by he becomes the only person the kingpin can trust. Entrusting him with secret knowledge about his operations, César cannot see his impending downfall as Malik negotiates with his business partners.A Prophet portrays the world as a ruthless place without real friendship or love, just business transactions, fear, useful alliances and the pretence of trust when it suits someone. It's a world where people have to be outsmarting each other all the time, and it's a game at which Malik excels as he learns everything about everyone while keeping a low profile as a worthless, dumb Arab. Finally, it's a world where old debts aren't forgotten and where revenge is always at the back of one's mind.Tahar Rahim steals the show as the initially confused and fragile Malik, who slowly becomes the ruthless, hardened leader of a criminal organisation. Niels Arestrup plays the old César, a top criminal who's slowly losing all the influence and power inside his prison without realising it. The two actors had an amazing chemistry and the viewer can't help wondering if there was any genuine trust or friendship between the two, or if they simply used each other, so complex and nuanced were their performances.A Prophet is an outstanding movie, an example of the good cinema still made nowadays, amidst all the mediocrity. It's intelligent, brutal, funny, exciting and sad. In sum, it's a complete and perfect cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed, crime pays in "A Prophet," the most widely valued French underworld thriller in decades, recognized as one of the best-developed crime dramas, and one of the most compelling crime figures in recent cinema history. "A Prophet" is the kind of film that makes you remember why going to the movies can be a thrilling experience.The film tells the story of how a 19-year-old Arab youth with no family or relatives who enters a French prison as a scared, illiterate young man and emerges six years later as the area's indisputable mob kingpin. It's a hard-won journey and a metamorphosis of dubious merit that creates a tone that is both inspirational and terrifying. "A Prophet" follows the life of Malik (Tahar Rahim), a young Frenchman of Arab descent, who enters prison as an outsider and is shaped into an adult criminal from the inside. He is a blank slate who has been disposed of by proper society, yet able to rise within the prison hierarchy due to his innate intelligence and sheer will to survive. The prison is under the control of, in essence, by a Corsican gang of inmates headed by César Luciani (Niels Arestrup), whose word is law. César sees everything but expresses little. Shortly after his arrival, Malik is ordered by César to murder of another prisoner, an action that grants him protection. The murder sequence is absolutely gripping from his preparation for the act, to how Malik finally pulls it off. His reaction to this brutal initiation is stunningly depicted as it forever haunts Malik. In the years the to come, Malik transforms before our very eyes. Malik's rise to power is chronicled in a logical and believable manner. His ascension through the ranks comes primarily from careful observation and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. He also manipulates; when he learns that César thinks all Arabs are stupid, he uses the revelation to his advantage.Director Jacques Audiard effortlessly constructs a foreboding landscape with complicated rules, and developing characters that are compelling and empathetic, even as they commit heinous acts. Rahim perfectly telegraphs his maturation from petty thief to major player in a brilliant performance that relies much less on words, than the confidence he exudes in his actions. He doesn't need to tell us that he is taking charge of the prison, or surpassing Cesar, we just watch it happen. The film's brutal, realistic violence is not for the faint for heart, but fans of raw, gripping cinema shouldn't be put off; "A Prophet" demands to be seen. "A Prophet" was a 2010 Academy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, and winner of the 2010 London Film Critics Award for Best Picture of the Year. The film won a total of nine César Awards in 2010 (the French equivalent of the Oscar), including best actor (Rahim), best director, and best picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A compelling and powerful movie. An interesting character study of how prison made Malik a criminal. Excellent &amp; charismatic lead performance by Tahar Rahim. And Neils Arestrup complements him perfectly in terms of acting. "A Prophet" beautifully shows the dark side of the French penal system and the viciousness that the inmates go through each day. Malik's transformation from being a petty, nervous boy to a mastermind criminal is entirely convincing- the cumulative effect of Malik's endurance shown by various events in the movie, make us feel like the movie ain't too far from reality. This can in fact happen to anyone who endures so much. In fact, he's taught crime inside the prison, day in and day out. And Malik is a fast learner at that.The film really gets brutal and violent at times and that too seems realistic. The sudden burst of loud music at times and the cinematography is good too. One of the best French films I've seen and one of the best prison dramas. A very much accomplished and ferocious movie. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

What people so far have missed out on, is the non-ass-rape stories of prisons outside of the US' perverted prison system. This movie is delivering the gap. The movie lives from its good actors, which are not Val Kilmer or Johnny Depp. It also constantly keeps the tension which is rising until the end. But sometimes things just work out for some and not for others. That is the whole truth. There is no deeper meaning needed. Watch it and forget about Fellon, Donnie Brasco, or alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Credit IMDb Nineteen year-old Franco-Arab Malik El Djebena is just starting his six year prison sentence in Brécourt. Although he has spent the better part of his life in juvenile detention, this stint is his first in an adult prison. Beyond the division of Corsicans and Muslims in the prison (the Corsicans who with their guard connections rule what happens in the prison), he has no known friends or enemies inside. He is just hoping to serve his time in peace and without incident, despite having no prospects once he's out of jail since he's illiterate and has no support outside of the prison. Due to logistics, the head of Corsican inmates, a sadistic mafioso named César Luciani, co-opts Malik as part of the Corsicans' activities, not only regarding what happens inside the prison, but also continued criminal activities outside. The innocent Malik has no idea what to do but cooperate. This move does not sit well with the other Corsicans...After the acclaim this movie has received, I was anxious to view it for myself, and it didn't disappoint. Yes, it's a long movie, but the excellent pace, the gripping storyline, and the lead performance from Tahar Rahim is Oscar Worthy. He was likable, powerful, and conniving all in one. This deserves its acclaim.Performances. Tahar Rahim gives an Oscar worthy performance here. He is dangerous, emotional, yet vulnerable and sympathetic at the same time. He was the movie in every sense of the word, and he truly made me feel all these emotions.Bottom line. A powerful foreign film in every sense of the word. For the running time, it flew by.

		<shortDescription>Good, gritty prison experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Prophet is a movie that really gives one a very dark and somewhat disturbing picture of prison life. Even if the story is pretty clearly fiction maybe something that doesn't make sense, the settings and representation of the prison scenes feel very realistic. However does this make it a great film? I had heard how awesome it was, that it had got several awards and praised by critics. Still I can't help but feel a bit disappointed.So the technical aspects are just brilliant. The feel one pretty soon gets is that this is not the usual prison movie experience. The scenes are so dirty and brutal to the level that one might get a unpleasant feel when seeing this picture of prison life. The violence is just as though, bloody and brutal. Very impressive, this is not a film for the weak.The sounds and music contribute well to create the right feel. Still the music is not that special on it's own, I feel it's just the same over and over so afterwards I can't recall any of it.So the outside of the movie is just brilliant but still A Prophet doesn't grip hold of me like this kind of dramatic films should. The problem is that the story just feels far away from me as a viewer. Quite soon into the film it starts to get a bit hard to keep track of what is going on, but it is not because it's flawed story telling, sadly the reason is that the plot does just not grip my interest. Soon I'm just watching it with one eye. The acting is also very good, Niels Arestrup was great. Though just like the plot I get no real relation to the characters which I guess should be blamed on the script. Some of the scenes where some character development is supposed to be done just feel kind of forced. When the ending comes I not much more than shrug the shoulders and consider it was a well made movie but nothing much more. This also brings me to the running time around 150 min which feel kind of long and even more so since I have a hard time keeping my interest up anyway.Maybe I'm alone in feeling A Prophet is somewhat overrated.

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2009</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in a French prison, the central character Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) undergoes a process of self-discovery. Malik, born in France to Arab parents, is sentenced to six years for an assault on policemen. He soon becomes the servant of a sadistic Corsican gangster, César Luciani (Niels Arestrup), who virtually runs the jail. Divisions exist between the Corsicans who run the prison, and the Muslim inmates. César gives Malik an ultimatum; killing Reyeb, a gay Arab who's shortly to give evidence in a mob trial, or be killed himself. The corrupt authorities won't help him, since César controls them.Malik relents, befriends and kills Reyeb. His first prison initiation complete, Malik becomes César's eyes and ears whilst secretly learning Italian and Corsican. Malik is given increasingly greater responsibilities. César manages to get Malik a day's leave, to prepare him to take his place again in society but in fact used to run criminal errands. Unbeknown to Cesar, Malik has found other allies in and out of prison. Malik steadily leaves his mentors behind as he learns to play both sides against each other, manipulating racial tensions, becoming as ruthless and decisive as his enemies.However many prison clichés exist in the movie, Audiard's forceful direction turns this prison-crime thriller into a thoughtful, brutally moving film. The ongoing physical and mental education of the initially illiterate and naive Malik is profoundly told, and Tahar Rahim is a revelation. Rahim's moving portrayal illustrated the vulnerability and loneliness Malik felt throughout his incarceration. Niels Arestrup conversely mirrors Rahim's performance with the same brutish subtlety, a hopeless, simmering realisation that his dominance may be on the wane. N. Not to mention an unparallelled sequence involving a razor blade which you are unlikely to forget, the best film of the year</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not 'THE GODFATHER' but it is a good gangster / prison film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'A PROPHET': Four Stars (Out of Five) One of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year and nominee for Best Foreign Language Film at last year's Academy Awards is this French prison / gangster film directed by Jacques Audiard. It's written by Audiard as well as Thomas Bidegain, Abdel Raouf Dafri and Nicolas Peufaillit and has impressive acting turns from Tahar Rahim and Niels Arestrup as the two leads. The film has appeared on many critics top ten lists this year and has been compared to such great crime films as 'THE GODFATHER'. The film is almost entirely set in a prison though and at 2 hours and 30 minutes it's packed with a great deal of action and character development as well as moves along at a fairly brisk pace.Rahim stars as Malik, a 19 year old French Arab who's sent to prison for six years for attacking police officers. In prison he draws the attention of Corsican mafia leader Luciani (Arestrup) who decides to bring him under his wing and use him to his advantage in exchange for protection. His first assignment is to kill a fellow inmate named Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi). Malik objects to the order but is told if he doesn't kill this man he will be killed himself and the Coriscans pretty much run the prison, due to their guard connections, so Malik is left with no option but to kill Reyeb or be killed. He completes the assignment (in a brutally violent scene) and is intrusted into the Coriscan mafia prison gang which lead to more assignments including outside day leave furlough jobs. He's constantly haunted by Reyeb's soul and other visions as he gets dragged further and further into the crime world.The movie, like I said, is fast paced (especially for two and a half hours) and involving. It's well written and executed with great visual flare by Audiard's impressive direction. The acting is all top notch, especially Rahim, who is the heart of the movie, and Arestrup who gives one of the more impressive and memorable supporting turns this year. The film is very violent and hard to watch at times (definitely not for the faint of heart) and it is a very dark and somewhat disturbing tale. It's very similar to a lot of other epic gangster films that have came and went throughout the years but still has it's own somewhat unique style and flare. Not a great film in my opinion (I'm not a huge fan of gangster films though, I don't even count 'THE GODFATHER' as one of my favorite films) but it is a very good and memorable one.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gem about the conquest of a soul over insurmountable obstacles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a real gem. A saga. Just over two and a half hours, worth it. A story of determination and conquest over insurmountable obstacles And the flouring of a soul. The transition this guys makes in this film is gradual and powerful. By the end you see that it was in him all the time, it was like watching a bud unfold into a flower. He does the unexpected. He never ever gives up, he never surrenders to the inescapable insanity of his life. He escapes the inescapable. And with his soul intact. It's really a story about a miracle. I was roped in by the intensity of the photography and of the depiction. You are forced to root for this guy even though you don't see where he's going. His game becomes too deep to unravel, you're just dragged along by both the impossibility of his situation and yet the sense that he might just escape it all. The characterizations are strong and simple. There is beauty mixed in with the madness and brutality. It's a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inside (Drama)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty sure that I had written a review for this, but seems it got lost. I have seen quite a few good prison dramas (apart from the Stephen King/Darabont one, there are also Against the Wall, Animals and of course quite a few TV Shows), but all were American based and produced of course! This is the first non-English feature that I am aware of that has such a high quality.While the title might be misleading (it was somewhat to me), don't let yourself get confused by that. This is high performance/great acting, with a powerful, if somewhat slim, story. While we never get the (entire) background of our main character, we get to know him quite well, once the movie starts. And that is what counts. A great powerful french entry into a "subgenre" (if you wanna call it that), that was controlled by American movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Untypical prison film; a growth story, an allegory for the ethnic conflicts of our world.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Un proph?te (A Prophet) is a prison film with a basic dramaturgical model, which surprisingly managed to be a non-stereotypical description of prison. So don't worry about seeing a lot of prison clichés, because you won't with this. A Prophet is directed by Jacques Audiard, who was a new name for me. I hadn't seen anything by him before this. The film is basically a growth story but it also deals up with social themes.Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) is a 19-year-old youngster who gets sentenced to prison. The prison is ethnically divided to Corsicans and to Arabs. It doesn't take long when a gangster boss, César Luciani (Niels Arestrup) takes Malik to his side. When Malik has to do a tragic task for Luciani, he gets an extraordinary gift, he starts seeing vision, he becomes a prophet.A Prophet basically shows Malik's growth from a little criminal to an influential gangster (a bit like in Scarface). When young people get sentenced to prison they usually get drawn into the world of crime. But A Prophet brings up a question; Can you avoid getting drawn into it? Which is unusual for prison films. It's usually an absolute fact. Not only the people get into the world of crime, but the lower-class also often resort to religion. From religion people find their place, a society they belong. This is exactly what happens in the prison. Both Corsicans and Arabs have their own groups. The individual's place is not guided by who you are, but by the ethnic group you belong to. This is an allegory to the ethnic issues of the world we live in.In the film Malik becomes A Prophet, because he is in between of two worlds the Corsicans &amp; the Arabs, since he can speak both languages. So he's able of bringing messages from the highest mob-boss to the prisoners. A prophet can see into the future, as can Malik, but what is more important is that he can detach from his ethnic group. He can understand the world around him without the guidance of his ethnic group. And this is where the title comes in my opinion. The gift of understanding the world without the guidance of your ethnic group, is as supernatural as seeing into the future is.A great film. Not a typical prison film, full of many symbolic meanings, an allegory, gets down on social issues; a treat for your brain. There are few great directors out there today who have the guts of doing something special (for instance the Dardenne brothers). Even that this film had the basic elements (the suspense &amp; the mystery), the narrative is traditionally based on dialog and it follows a basic dramaturgical model, I still think it succeed well in creating something original. The camera-work is quite typical, but also interesting. The camera takes a lot of close-ups of the characters' faces, it hardly takes distance to the characters at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French prison drama without a purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to see this after the rave reviews. However it's actually not that great. In fact, it's a very muddled film: there's no sense of identification with the quiet, cunning lead, Malik. By the time he's released from prison, at the end of the film, he has a gang of henchman that follow him in a car and van at a respectable distance.What goes on in between is his rise to power, playing off the Corsicans (who he works for initially) and the Arabs (who are his kinsmen). It is definitely gritty, and the scene that stands out most is him practising putting a razor blade in his mouth for one of the earlier scenes. The prison life is also 'grim grim' (not 'clean grim' like The Shawshank Redemption!). It is also a crime film about the rise of a nobody through the ranks, via his own ingenuity and networking.But so what? It's not as entertaining a crime film as many others. The actors aren't fleshed out memorably, including the lead, who broods a lot and talks little, so who knows what he feels (except for scenes when you see the first person he murdered, haunt him again). It just isn't all that exciting after being told it was.One point that sums it up: he is called a 'prophet' on his way to meet a drug dealer in a car, when he shouts out to stop after seeing a warning sign by the roadside for deer. A deer then leaps out a second or two later and hits the car. That's it. No other explanation, and one of the guys in the car nicknames him 'The Prophet'. It's not even alluded to again later on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suprizingly boring and unoriginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this what gets Academy awards, Golden Globe, etc. etc. then woe on our cinema. This film is full of prison tropes, excruciatingly long and pointless. After reading a positive review of MANOHLA DARGIS in the Times, who's not often complementary and is not afraid of controversy, I invested two and a half hours of my time and left disappointed. What Dargis praised is in the murder scene where main character notices fancy shoes in the vitrine, while he should be preparing for the kill and his emergence after committing the murder as if being reborn (being in a haze as if in the womb) as a committed killer. This was indeed interesting solution, but what about other 2 hours and 20 minutes? The film feels like an average student's work.There is an element of 'strangeness' in the film because of twice removed language-culture: in the framework of French state and language we see French-Arabs and French-Corsicans with Italian flavor and also some French-Africans. This is unusual for average American viewer, however overwhelming majority of action is taking place in the prison, all you see is concrete of the cells and the shower room.Characters and action are very poorly developed. Malik's motivation is not clear. He does not seem at first to be a killer, then succumbs to the pressure, kills his fellow Arab, then becomes good at scheming and moves into a leadership position. Interestingly, the apparition of his fellow Arab he kills, appears to him in the guise of a spiritual adviser and Koran teacher. As a result, Malik emerges as a positive character, finally becoming Arab again (this is after all his betrayals) and the wife of his deceased friend seems to offer herself and her child to him. The implication perhaps that Malik, who was an animal, now has connection with the child...? I give up.In summary, the story line is a kind of lunacy, amateurish and embarrassing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique and startling crime tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frenchman Jacques Audiard's Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated 2009 prison opus is a startlingly original tale that 4 years down the track still packs an almighty punch both emotionally for the viewer and as a work of art.The story of A Prophet to an outsider would seem slight but in the finalized package it is anything but. With a true girth of talent on camera from Niels Arestrup's crime matriarch Cesar Luciani through to cancer suffering criminal Ryad played by Adel Bencheriff, every actor makes their character memorable. The multi-layered story centers upon young and uneducated criminal Malik El Djebena played by a freakishly good Tahir Rahim. The film charts a truly believable and fascinating rise of Malik a man that we as an audience root for from frame one until the films perfectly fitted conclusion. Malik's time in this particular French prison transcends it's genre however thanks to Audiard's brave and beautiful direction.Wowing audience's the world over last year with his haunting tale Rust and Bone Audiard here in A Prophet showcased an impressive feat to create a movie that at times is chillingly violent (a scene with a razor blade comes to mind here) and starkly beautiful. Audiard's direction is a that of a filmmaker in complete control of his material, not afraid to mix in on paper odd song choices, scenes of the titular prophetic visions and one of the movies strongest and haunting elements that of a ghost of Malik's past that accompanies him on his prison sentence. These elements plus many more unmentioned make A Prophet the experience it is and we as a cinema loving people should be thankful that these pieces came together the way they did for us to sit back and partake in.A Prophet hit a chord with audiences so much so that it was almost immediately commissioned for an English language remake that just recently was announced to be scripted by Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River author Dennis Lehane. Whatever this remake ends up being one thing is for sure, it has mighty prison boots to fill for this version of the story is about as perfect as you'd ever hope for and a movie that will continue to be found and adored by movie lovers the world over.5 razor blades out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie. Shows a period in the development of a young criminal, outsider, who makes some difficult choices, simply, because he has nothing to lose.When a dangerous mafia boss offers him a kind of job that involves stepping outside of the prison during the day, he takes it, for he understands that being outside and trying some action is a good value for a huge risk that he takes. The class, race, ethnic and other components of difficult life situations and rotten system in France are efficiently entangled. The hero is just nobody, youngster who has no opportunity to survive unless he takes his own destiny in his own hands and takes a huge risk. He obviously crave for simple pleasures of regular people, but the only way for him to get to it is a crime. The movies is full of crazy exciting details, still the motivation is bitterly realistic and convincing. The movie holds a nice dynamics between the scenes in the gloomy prison environment and sunny wide landscapes, indicating the uniqueness of the hero's position: he can be both in and out, so he can see how the world is outside. Highly recommended. I will watch other films by this director, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly impressive modern day gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has revived a dying genre that ceased to exit in most parts of Europe and was on the verge of extinction in France.Jacques Audiard has made a modern day gangster masterpiece that is appreciated by people from all walks of life and especially by those who miss great films of the genre 'Crime' and 'Gangster'. The movie is based on the life of an Arab in a French prison. He is shifted to a prison after he comes off age at a juvenile home. He's hired by a gang to terminate the life of a member of the opposite gang and when he fulfills his duty, he receives accolades and trust of the gang leader, whose gang terrorizes the prison. He becomes involved in their business outside the prison and he slowly gains control over the gang by deceiving them by being obsequious. He carefully maneuvers a plan to eliminate the gang and he succeeds and walks free after his term in the prison comes to an end.The movie was the critics' favorite to win the Academy award for the Best Foreign language film but it lost out to an equally good 'The Secret in Their Eyes'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A cross between The Godfather an Oz, A Prophet begins with an Algerian French guy, Malik(Tahar Rahim) beginning a six year prison sentence for fighting with the police. He cannot read or write and in order to survive he befriends the Corsican inmates. Cesar Luciani(Niels Arestrup) is the mob boss who sets up Malik in the killing of a fellow Muslim, Reyeb. He gains the respect of Cesar but the other mobster dislike him because of his race. He becomes more and more useful to the gangsters, especially when he gets periodical furloughs from the jail. He learns the ways of the syndicate very rapidly and is taught how to read by Ryad, another Muslim. Malik learns more about his culture and also the drug trade where he gains power within the Muslims. His people convince him to oppose the Corsicans in a bloody battle. It leads to a showdown with his mentor Cesar. Rahim and Arestrup are riveting as the two criminals from such different backgrounds. I rate The Prophet on a level with The Godfather; it is that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically marvelous though story not entirely credible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a cliché by now that prison life is a mirror image of life on the outside. Everything is reversed. What is condemned in "normal" society--duplicity, violence, theft--is essential, even rewarded in a prison setting. This is a sort of perverse Horatio Alger story. A boy, innocent if any crime, starts out as a nobody, a friendless target for assaults by everyone, and within a few years rises to gang boss, powerful, feared and respected within--and outside-- the walls of the prison. Of course, several of the incidents along the way require a large suspension of disbelief. Even in France, the penal system could not be SO corrupt or indifferent that sentenced inmates could be directly involved in drug trafficking and murder while on temporary release, or that a witness in a major rackets case would spend even a few days in the general prison population.Despite these weaknesses, the physical atmosphere of a large penal institution is recreated with often sickening realism. The constant shouting and clanging, the grime and squalor of men forced to close and unpleasant contact. Another cliché borne out here is that it is the inmates who actually run the prison while the authorities stand back and interfere as little as possible. Though to be fair, the film does portray efforts to rehabilitate the prisoners and prepare them for life after completion of sentence. There are literacy classes and a sort of high school for those who never went--such as the protagonist.Even if one understands French, much of the dialog will be utterly incomprehensible to one who has not recently lived in France--or better yet in one of the immigrant suburbs or **cites** (housing projects) which exploded in riots three years ago. Additionally, a number of the inmates lapse into **Corsu**, a sort of bastard Italian and the secret language of the Corsican mafia. There is also some North African Arabic spoken in the film.Acting, directing and, again, the sets and photography are on a high level. The director has a taste for contemporary American music, like rap and country, which pop up in the original as a counterpoint to the action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just watched this on recommendation of a friend. The lead, Tahar Rahim, is mind blowingly good, and the script seamlessly blends the juxtaposition of his inner mind with the harsh realities of French prison life. Niels Arestrup portrays the ageing gangster holding onto power flawlessly and this in turn adds to the tapestry of loneliness that is so effectively laid out throughout the prison. The pacing is very fresh as well, cuts are minimal and the camera often feels like it is trying to find itself, looking for answers along with the inmates. This could well have slowed the narrative drive of the movie but the decisions and dilemmas faced by the characters serve as the real drive of the story as opposed to a more conventional use of mise en scene. Please watch this movie if you haven't already - it's a beauty : )</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immersive and quite mesmeric crime film; a fierce character study on top of what is a confrontational piece about a young man's inception into a criminal lifestyle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Audiard's 2010 prison drama A Prophet is a really involving crime drama set predominantly within the walls of a French prison; a wonderful ground zero character study about a young man arriving at a locale, with no sense of identity and no real past to speak of, before being actually transformed into something through prison life. The film's lead is a clean slate upon which the chalks of many therein, in the form of both specific people and certain events, put down their desires and wants thus turning him into the young man he eventually becomes. Like some of Audiard's previous work, specifically his 2005 film The Beat That My Heart Skipped, A Prophet covers the exploits of a young France based male on the cusp of some kind of life of crime as he hobbles his way through a dangerous; enclosed and bubbled world full of dangers and lowlifes - this, as he attempts to hold down some kind of relationship with that of a fatherly figure-come-mentor with another, more older man whom knows his time's coming to an end.The lead is an Arab named Malik (Rahim), someone whom appears to have outgrown whatever jail he's presently in and is therefore transported to a bigger prison with bigger stakes. The man is a ghost, with no friends or family; no religious orientation; an inability to read as well as little little knowledge of Arabs, Arabic culture or the Arabic language. Malik stands in the warden's office as it is deduced he's a blank board, Audiard implying that sense of alienation he has with his locale-to-be as Malik gazes out of the office window and into the prison proper in precisely the same manner he does to the real world, to which he is similarly estranged from, when looking out of the slats built into the side of the prison van he was transported in. The film takes its time to attune Malik to prison life, the anonymity of the man highlighted in his gradual coming to master more intricate skills such as reading and sewing; several sequences and locations within the prison shot in a specific manner so as to get across a sense of awe or rawness Malik has towards it all, later replaced with a more normalised aesthetic when we feel he's got used to everything a little more.Malik comes to interact with an elderly man whom heads up a small clan of Corsican mobsters within the jail, the man is César Luciani (Arestrup), and through him the brutal initiation of becoming attuned to not only prison life as a methodically functioning zone full of trust and loyalties, but to life as a criminal overall, is played out. That wonderful exchange in 1994's The Shawshank Redemption between the two main characters saw Robbins' character, Andy, talk about how on the outside he was a law abiding citizen and that prison has come to attune him to living as a criminal through means of a corrupt system functioning within. A similar sense of irony in the overall path the lead takes is very much evident here, as Malik goes on to integrate with other men of Muslim origin which in turn leads to extracurricular criminal activity beyond the walls. While the charge of having assaulted a police officer initially lands Malik his jail-time sentence, the life he forges out of being incarcerated with the people he is appears to be the sort of arc accessible only by these means; in society wanting to correct the man, they have sadly served only to further his criminal education.Audiard directs his tale with aplomb. Where scathing comments on how French prisons are overcrowded; rife with corruption and that multiculturalism in contemporary France can do nothing but fail while most probably lead to ill-informed influence and interior hatred amongst the many differing groups feels evident, you do get the sense he is more interested in telling a gripping, often pulpy crime story more than all else. Malik's walking into a more criminal orientated way of life arrives in the form of a somewhat brutal attack he's hired to carry out on another Arab, a homosexual drug-dealer whom Malik is required to effectively seduce so as to execute. A Prophet is not shy in regards to its content revolving around this, from popular culture we can deduce the hardest part of prison life is probably the early stages or the first few weeks in which initiation and adapting is the order of the day. Bedding oneself into a film such as A Prophet has a similar feel to the above, in that the worst of it is going to be the early exchanges; a watching experience that Audiard attempts to mirror that of prison life in that getting through the parts in which practising with the implement of death before carrying it out must be gruelled through.The whole thing is really well played, the director's ability to shift between overlying atmospheres of fear; regret; relief and realisation as well as the eye he has in being able to get across a real feeling of inside prison and outside prison being of two totally different animals in terms of their existences feels prominent. The acting from those principally involved in Rahim and Arestrup is quite wonderful, their interplay coming to form the nucleus of Malik's hierarchical journey upwards into the Corsican's trust following the removal of his other Corsican cohorts away from the prison; a journey of which is highlighted in the musical track which plays as Malik is moved into another cell next door to César: a song which speaks of being from the somewhat lowly perceived state of Mississippi before getting out and moving onwards and upwards to New York. Audiard's film is engrossing and striking, with a number of items ranging from its brutal content to its methodical character studies propping up some wonderful acting and cinematography to create a memorable piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Un proph?te - A Prophet ? CATCH IT (A+) Un proph?te is a brilliant brilliant and a brilliant French movie about a young Arab man who is sent to a French prison where he becomes a mafia kingpin. From beginning to end, it's an incredible and brutal look inside the prisons in general and shows how it works and even if mafia people are in prisons how they control their business. The brutality of the Un proph?te is beyond expressed in words. Watching Malik (Tahar Rahim) trying to adjust blade in his mouth to cut some one's neck has to be one of the most gruesome self inflicted act of valance I have seen on cellulite. And not to mention almost taking out the eyeball with the spoon, Oh I was on edge of my seat holding my head with the shock. Tahar Rahim as young Arab man becoming French mafia's right hand in the prison is absolutely brilliant. There are no better words to describe his performance as Malik. Niels Arestrup is outstanding, I saw him recently in War Horse as old grandfather but watching him here as leading the French mafia in prison is amazing. Wow this man is truly a legend when you GooGle him. Each and every supporting cast is great in their respective French and Arab's criminal part. In the Un proph?te is a remarkable movie, which may have lost Oscar but it deserves all the accolades. Highly recommended and remember not for the faint hearted people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic crime film prison drama see this guys other films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At age 19, Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) is just beginning a six-year prison sentence in this drama from THE BEAT THAT MY HEART SKIPPED director Jacques Audiard. (Niels Arestrup &amp; Gilles Cohen, as well as that film's director of photography, Stéphane Fontaine, &amp; its composer, Alexandre Desplat all return from that film to this one) Though he cannot read or write, Malik soon figures out the politics of the prison system, giving him a prime spot in the power struggle between two battling groups of prisoners. Malik el Djebena (Rahim) is a 19 year old who is imprisoned for alleged violence against the police. Shortly after he arrives in jail, he is chosen by the prison boss Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup) to kill a prisoner named Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi). Reyeb is currently in prison &amp; is awaiting his turn to testify against the mob. Malik does as he is asked &amp; kills Reyeb, &amp; because of Luciani's power &amp; control, there are no repercussions to the action. This initiation of sorts allows Malik to become a high ranking member of the Corsican gang in the prison. Malik learns to read while in prison, which helps him to learn &amp; understand the inner workings of the gang. He befriends prisoner Ryad (Adel Bencherif), &amp; after a time, is granted some time away from the prison, thanks to Luciani. While his time out is supposed to be to fulfill missions for Luciani, Malik also starts up a drug trade, with the help of Ryad. While the dangers he faces are many, Malik always seems to get out of trouble unscathed. Will his charmed life continue, or will his luck eventually run out? Though it had received rave review I did not expect much upon viewing. Boy was I wrong this is a truly gripping prison drama but long at 2 hrs 35 min; The film was one of this year's foreign film Oscar nominees. This is a new crime classic which speaks in a universal language about the ways power corrupts the human condition-yes even in prison; it is an atmospheric, tense and often violent film. 5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Survival of the fittest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jacques Audiard's A Prophet takes us into a Parisian prison where the guards and even the warden have been bought out by a powerful prisoner, Cesar, who essentially runs the prison. He and his gang run operations in the prison amongst the prisoners and also to their people on the outside. When Malik, a young prisoner, is transferred to the prison, he immediately tries to hide. Unfortunately, he is spotted by Cesar and his crew. He is given the choice to either kill another man they want bumped or he will be killed.Given those choices, Malik does must choose his life or the other man's. To kill or be killed. It doesn't get more basic than that. This is a principal that traces back to the beginning of time. Though our species has evolved quite a lot since then (depending on what you believe), deep down we still have the desire and the will to survive. Some stronger than others. Malik soon finds out what it takes to survive in the prison and how far he is willing to go.It's a gritty film with a lot to absorb. I was happy that it's not just a straight story with nothing to think about. Prison movies or heist movies tend to be one dimensional or just leave you hanging until the end when you have to (or already have) put it together. There is a lot to ponder, especially the short, quick scenes in Malik's cell where he talks to someone whose significance is sort of unclear or unexplained. It adds to the mystery.I thought the film carried on a little too long and a few scenes seemed a bit repetitious, but overall it's a fascinating story. I was particularly interested in the relationship between Cesar and Malik. Cesar is a Corsican while Malik is Muslim. Neither sides get along yet Malik doesn't seem to care. To both sides of the prison he is the enemy. He is merely adapting, something neither side is willing to do.A large portion of the film is devoted to exploring this subject. I think it might explore a little too much considering how little the conflict progresses. That might be the point, I just wanted a little more explanation. Either way, it's an interesting theme.It's a long movie and does drag once or twice, but overall it's a very interesting story with a lot of interesting ideas and situations. A good movie with excellent character development and storytelling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Prophet is the perfect example of why we go to the movies. It is a flawless, beautiful looking and beautifully told story, bringing to memory such films as The Godfather and such shows as Oz. As a fan of both The Godfather and Oz, I can honestly tell you that this is my favorite film of the past couple of years. The film starts out with Malik (Tahar Rahim), a prison inmate who's just trying to get through his 6-year sentence. He then meets Cesar (Niels Arestrup) who makes him an offer. Not giving anything away, Malik kills a fellow prisoner. As the film goes on, the murder haunts Malik. The man Malik murders also follows him around as a spirit. It is then that the film gets twisty, as Malik is forced through risky and even dangerous tasks. The film's prison setting is excellent, but the film doesn't get too contrived with the setting, as Malik gets to go outside the prison walls at certain points, so this is one of the rare prison films that takes place outside the prison walls at a lot of points. The running time of the film might be a turn off for some people. There's nothing that should be taken out of this film, so I not only didn't mind the running time but thoroughly enjoyed every second of this film. For anyone who can get past the running time and not make it a turn off, you must see this masterpiece that shows the reasons people go to the movies in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen many prison-themed movies, but few as brutal as "Un prophete". The film focuses on Malik, a young Arab-Frenchman in a hellish jail. The French prisoners view Malik as "the other", and he doesn't get much sympathy from the ethnic prisoners either, and he ends up in the employment of a Corsican gangster.The movie reminded me a little bit of "Angel-A", about an Algerian man in France, and how he doesn't quite fit in with the world around him. Of course, this one depicts drastically different results, as the protagonist gets drawn into France's criminal underworld. Even the most hardened person will probably have a hard time not flinching at some of the squirm-inducing scenes here.I definitely recommend this movie. Not simply because it shows the horrors of prison life, especially for an outsider, but it also poses questions about an individual's role in society, whether that means Malik's place in prison, or in France overall. A very good film.PS: Speaking of the Corsican mafia, they were apparently the biggest heroin traffickers in the world during the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honor among thugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his first two films, Jacques Audiard made me want to really like him, and while the world went a bit gaga for "De battre mon Coeur s'est Arrete" (and I enjoyed it well enough), I felt something just missing for me. I therefore may have approached "Un Prophete" with more than a bit of anxiety. I needn't have for within a single minute I fell headlong into the dangerous world of one of 2009's most powerful films.Aduiard draws us into the life of 19 year old French/Arab Malik El Djebena, a street kid, now incarcerated for the first time in an adult prison. Malik wishes nothing but to be left alone and serve his six years without incident. He never gets that chance. For two and a half hours, we ar mesmerized as we witness Malik's journey from innocence and subservience to the most powerful king pin in the prison.Tahar Rahim's performance is nothing short of astonishing, making the morose and frightened Malik a character you can only route for throughout his tortured six year stint. Uneducated, but wise beyond his years, the young prisoner improves himself through education, craft, cunning allowing his restlessness to steer him in whatever direction it needs in order to survive. As César Luciani, overlord of the prison, Niels Arestrup's is the perfect foil to Rahim's Malik and the scenes between Corsican master and Arab servant crackle with a nervous energy while Aduaiard keeps layering tension, mistrust, honor, privilege and loyalty into the mixture leading everything to a predictable, but wholly satisfying conclusion.Audiard's style makes life in this prison alternately real and surreal tossing in elements of fantasy and madness which coalesce with a beautifully disturbing madness, such as Malik's repeated visitations of his first victim, a man he was forced by Luciani and his thugs in order to justify his own existence. You cannot make a prison movie without kindness and brotherhood entering into the equation and the friendship between Malik and fellow Arab prisoner, Ryab (a terrific performance by Adel Bencherif) establish a bond that will be not only far reaching but ultimately the salvation for both men.Racism, too is ever a present guest here and I could only watch in wonder and respect as Malik moves between the Muslims, Egyptians, Italians, Corsicans and French judging the worth of each on their own merits (or how he can best use them) rather than the prejudice the others use to define their worlds.Dark, gritty, powerful yet full of hope, "Un Prophete" beats just about any U.S. studio made film last year and I hope it receives the recognition it deserves Stateside. A truly remarkable and emotionally rewarding movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film made for with precise execution and a model film about gangsters.I have to admit that everything that is praised about this film is true. It's accurate and it's vibrant. It has the same core style as Gomorrah, but The Prophet is better executed in cinematography and rhythm.The main actor is astounding and he doesn't even act. He just lives the part or he is like that in real life.But my biggest mouth opener comes from the role of the Corsican gangster, played by Niels Arestrup. His persona reminds me of the best years of Humphrey Bogart. He is still like a volcano ready to explode.The film is definitely a masterpiece following the foot steps of Melville. I often dislike the usage of a documentary style camera in fiction. Because often it is just an attempt to make the film more "real", even the story structure or the characters are far from it. In the Prophet, this all works as it should work. The style of acting and the reality of the story go together with the camera work.It becomes more than life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>staying alive (or dying) in this unique prison-crime film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half hour or so of A Prophet, the new film from Jacques Audiard (of the brilliant The Beat That My Heart Skipped), looks like a good prison movie. Better than that, it looks rough, raw, gritty, a French variation of the HBO series from the late 90's, Oz, that showed prison life as its own living, frightening organism of human horror. A young man who committed a crime that is never revealed to us, Malik El-Djebena (Tahar Rahim) is nineteen and in for six years at a French prison, with a mostly Muslim population. He, too, is an Arab, though mixed with French, and is picked out of the pack- as he's a nervous, small little guy- by the Corsicans, who have the dominant control of the prison (albeit smaller but stronger numbers). He's charged to kill a prisoner in transit who is supposed to testify against them. He refuses, but, as happens, is told if he doesn't he'll die. He gets up the nerve to do it, however clumsily and gushing blood all over, and gets their protection.From here it turns into something else I wasn't quite expecting, which was a crime saga. There's echoes of The Sopranos, The Godfather, hard-boiled stories of family and loyalty, only in the case of A Prophet put into the context of prison life. How this happens is that Malik gets a little more prominent with the Corsicans, specifically the boss, Luciani (Arestrup), who seems to make a path anywhere he goes and has that kind of calm but angry form of expression that seems much more realistic than we see in many crime movies (or, to put it another way, like the aging bulldog who is usually just watchful and mindful, but has a bark as bad as his bite). Malik becomes his right-hand man practically, but Malik also gets wrapped up in drug dealing in the prison, becomes friendly with a prisoner who helps him how to read (he's later released and also has cancer off and on), and gets 'leave' days here and there, where he's tasked on missions for Luciani as a foot-soldier. And meanwhile, he's plotting, like a game of hidden chess, in moves that will help that he'll stay alive.It's a staggering work of plotting in its script, but also character development. We always believe that Malik is capable of what he's doing because he's a learner and smart enough to know the angles he's playing at. When he goes on a mission for Luciani on one of his days, going all the way to Marseilles, and nearly gets killed, he somehow gets out of it through dumb luck, and in the process gets to have some terms of his own with another mob boss. The director, Audiard, has a big running time to lay out six years of prison life - 155 minutes give or take a few in all - and it's loaded with memorable characters and performances, most especially by Arstrup (previous in 'Beat'), who makes for a subtly imposing figure, a lion of a man, with a face that hides many things, like a poker face.Rahim, in a breakthrough performance, is also completely engaging. He makes for a vulnerable character early on, and then transforms into a Michael Corleone but with more street savvy and guts. The actor also plays well in some surreal situations, like the here-and-there scenes when Reyeb, the man he first killed with the razor, keeps appearing to him with conversations obscure and familiar all at once (he even gets Malik to dance by himself). While a few of these surreal touches from Audiard don't quite work, such as the dream scenes with the deer and its wrap-around in Marseilles, when the director keeps it focused on the story and characters, he gets solid acting and a fearless sense of style.Some of the film isn't easy to take, like that murder scene or another later on with Malik and some other gangsters in a black SUV, but for all the right purpose. Going in to the film I almost expected it to be more focused on the Muslim angle, that Malik rises to be a kingpin in the Nation of Islam in prison or something. There is a distinction of class that Audiard touches on often, mainly about the reversal of power over time from the Corscicans to the Muslims, but it's secondary really to the genre concern. This is a memorable prison-crime hybrid, full of intrigue and surprise, occasionally very funny, surprisingly heartfelt (i.e. scenes between Malik and his cancer-stricken friend) and sometimes deliberately paced. It's also, surprisingly for something as early 70's Scorsese inspired, subdued in a way of approach to its characters and setting. Which is really the rich choice to make in order to not overstep into lurid melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Universal problems of prison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because I am not particularly au fait with the ins and outs of the scriptural references in 'Un Proph?te', I will concentrate on the what I see the film to be - a critique of the prison system in France. For a country which claims to be the 'homeland of human rights' the French prison system must be a thorn in the side of the French authorities, with suicide rates twice as high as its European neighbours and 63,000 prisoners in a 53,000 capacity system. The gritty oppressiveness is effectively captured in 'Un Proph?te', as it should be in any credible prison film.However, where I think the film differs from other prison films is in its protagonist Malik El Djebena. Our first encounter shows him to be already hardened by years in institutions, yet lacking the pathological violence of fellow inmates. But this changes; by the end of the film he has killed, and has enjoyed killing. His rise up the criminal food chain is not a Machiavellian one though, there is no forethought is his progress; from the offset we see, and Malik explicitly declares, that he just wants to do his time and get out. Malik had no masterplan to be a kingpin and throughout the film he only reacts (intelligently) to external forces - to the gypsy, to the Corsicans, to the Muslims in the prison, to the Arabs in Marseille (that he only met because of being forced to by the Corsicans), and if he had not been approached by the Corsicans at the beginning maybe he would still be keeping himself to himself.In essence, the film is telling us what we already know - that the prison system does not convert criminals into citizens, but vulnerable citizens into criminals. Audiard leaves the viewer with a question at the end due to final scene, does Malik leave this world of gangsterism or does he support his dying friend's wife and child in an honest way. Audiard's critique of prison points in neither direction, which is what makes the film so great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, but</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great overall story, no major twists but still not predictable, well done. I'll focus on the bad things though: Soundtrack/score - I don't remember any of it (I just watched this film an hour ago). There aren't that many great dialogues. Talk is mostly business.There's not much to the people in the film other than their prison life and crime. No one, with one exception, seems to have an outside life, a life they want to get back to. People want to get out of prison and go back to crime. Although in real life prison is a criminal factory, making one-time criminals into career criminals, lone criminals into gangsters and so on, even the most hardened criminals have other interests in life, have other lives and think and talk of other things. In that sense, the film's characters are a little underdeveloped.The film is a little long.Malik is also a little one dimensional. He's a cut-throat career criminal who just wants to go up the food chain. Other than brief flashes where he looks at a Playstation 2 in a supermarket, his porn collection, a conjugal visit and the moment where he enjoys the beach, he does not seem to want anything other than rise and become a boss. He shows no interest in having his own girlfriend, his own family, apartment, or any plans with the money he starts making. In that sense, his single-mindedness is one-dimensional.In a way, it is a coming of age film. Some reviewers see this as a story of a man who rediscovers his Arab identity in prison after affiliating himself with Corsicans, but that's not what the story is at all. He's a man who kept to himself and was forced to do work for the Corsicans. He used the Corsicans just as they used him and then caused an internal civil war that left them all dead, all but Cesar. He used the Arabs as well as pawns in his scheme. One of them said "You're just using us" to which he answered "So what? What's wrong if we all benefit?" He admits to using people. His loyalty is to himself as he sees first hand that there is no loyalty in the world of crime - the Corsicans have their own issues of trust, loyalty and betrayal within their own ranks and the bosses are pragmatic and know when to use small fish like Malik and deal with big fish like Brahim Latrache.The whole film is a long game of chess. Malik is forced to think quick and adapt, and so he becomes a pragmatic opportunist that thrives in the underworld.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first movie I saw of 2016. I certainly hope that it's not prophetic. I think that movies depicting people being locked up in prison hold us in rapt attention because most of us have conscious and sub- conscious fears of being locked up. I certainly identified with the prisoner in this movie because of my fear of being locked up and my fear of people in authority. They're all copies of an authority figure which my father represented to me. Every scene shows the prisoner interacting with authority figures and throws him into deeper complications with authority. His first struggle against authority is striking a blow at a policeman. For this he is convicted to spend the next 6 years in prison. Here he encounter a worse authority figure than the policeman, who is a criminal authority figure, namely of the underworld who makes harsher demands on his obedience than the authority of the law. His obedience to underworld authority ends when he's ordered to murder a Moslem leader. This and the illness of his best friend, also a Mowlem bring him to a realization that there is, after all only one authority to whom he must show obedience and that is Allah. In fact this movie shows the path followed by a prophet according to the Koran: 'We hear, and we obey. We seek Thy forgiveness, Our Lord, and to Thee is the end of all journeys.'" (2:285) The message of the movie is obey and seeing that you must obey someone it might as well be Allah, otherwise you'll find yourself having to obey murderous commands given to you by law enforcement personnel or by criminals.</fullReview>

The prison population is split between whites Corsicans and Muslims. Ruthless Corsican mobster Cesar Luciani forces Malik to kill Muslim witness Reyeb. Despite being a Muslim himself, Luciani takes Malik in as a lowly grunt under his protection.This is a French prison personal epic. It is one of the better prison movies around. The only drawback for me is that I don't really root for Malik and Tahar Rahim never got my sympathies. I don't think the movie gives him the opportunity. I'm a little detached from his character.

		<shortDescription>Engaging characters with an interesting insight into French prison.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malik is portrayed as a pretty innocent character throughout the film, even as he is climbing up the ladder and becoming (ironically) more of a criminal in prison. Rahim plays him well, and perhaps it is because the character is used to acting subservient so that he holds this poker type face as a reflex. Ultimately making others underestimate him and he is able to use that to his advantage. Reyeb was a pretty haunting character seeing as he was Malik's 'spirit' hallucination. Yacoubi also doesn't play his character with much emotion, but this makes more sense since his character is supposed to be dead.The story is like an American hood film with the protagonist growing up to be like his master, but in the context of a prison. A French prison to be more exact. I don't think this film is meant to portray a correct representation of French disciplinary institutions, but it definitely depicts a unique system. The prison guards are corrupt, prisoners wear casual clothes, and seemingly walk around wherever they want - with Malik even getting multiple furloughs. What's more, the cells look very similar to that of a college dorm with a table, mini-fridge and whatever else.The violence in this film is very explicit and gruesome. There isn't a lot of fighting, but more of gun violence and of course the scene where Malik kills Reyeb. Quite gory stuff. Also, homosexuality is strongly dismissed, as is common in most gangster films as part of 'masculinity'. On that note, there are only two female characters in this film who appear quite briefly. One to satisfy Malik's sexual needs, and another the wife of Reyeb (also seen as a mother because they have a child). This contrast of the whore and mother figure in films with emphasis on masculinity is getting tiring. Having females in these roles depicts that they are owned by men and have no other purpose but to serve them.Overall a thoughtful film that shows how having no identity could act in favour of a character. Malik is not seen as a very violent person (though he does kill), and instead uses his interpersonal skills and brains to get his success. The film does stall quite a bit in the middle, and I feel that it could have been cut shorter without it affecting the film.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That proverb applies to young Malik (Tahar Rahim) a young convict with confused eyes, a young man whose life took a rendezvous with a place called jail, and where what was left from his innocence will forever be buried in the deepest depths of human vileness.As soon as he enters the jail, Malik is like a cub who's just lose his herd, he's nowhere and everywhere in the same time, and he becomes a moving target. We've seen enough prison movies ("The Shawshank Redemption" came to my mind first) to know that it's a matter of very short time before things get rough for Malik, especially, since he doesn't have the expansive physique to impress the other inmates. He looks more like a small-time delinquents from Parisian suburbs than a gangster. Much later, this youngish look will become his one saving grace.As for the present, he's instantly bullied by a prisoner, his shoes are stolen, and later in the shower, someone proposes a deal involving drug from one side and from the other... well think Shawshank and shower, and you'll get the picture. But this isn't only a starter, the worst is yet to come. Malik's misadventures caught the eye of Cesar Luciani (Niels Arelstrup) a sort of Don Corleone-like figure Corsican style, a fitting plot device since Corsicans carry are pretty much to France what Sicily is to Italy. The old man with glorious blonde hair that give him the aura of a lion reigning over his jungle proposes another deal to Malik. And like Vito Corleone, he literally made him an offer he couldn't refuse.The reasons he couldn't refuse the offer is because he would either kill or get killed, and he couldn't seek help from any authority for Cesar WAS the authority. Malik had to kill the inmate from the shower, learn how to hide a razor in his mouth and use it in the most gruesome way. From our viewers' experience, we know the killing won't lead to any form of punishment, that the guards would close this eye. But it's all in the killing, Malik, the rookie is all shaky and nervous, and I think I felt for the first time, the same sensation than Michael Corleone in the restaurant scene. But that killing, masterfully directed by Jacques Audiard, turned my blood to ice, and proved me that European Cinema, Hollwyood's eternal disciple started to surpass its master.Indeed, maybe Scorsese lost his touch but the Scorsesian touch wasn't lost, and Jacques Audiard resuscitated the best of American stylistic depiction of the gangster world with a new fresh environment : France. The rivalry went from Italians and Blacks to Corsicans and Arabs. Watching "A Prophet" had the suspenseful thrills of "The Godfather" and the exhilaration of "Goodfellas" with a naturalness all the more European. It's an extraordinary movie with a documentary-like realism that will satisfy all the fans of the crime genre in the world, and it's one of the best French movies of the last decade.It swept off all the major César in 2010 especially Niels Arelstrup who embodied the old-school gangster charisma, a mix of intimidation and fatherly tenderness, and Tagar Rahim who played Malik like a never-ending enigma. We could never penetrate his thoughts, was he proud of earning his protection to men treating him like an 'Arab', or being seen with contempt by his fellow Arabs. As much a gangster film "A Prophet is", it's also a wonderful character study where we follow each step of Malik's evolution without feeling the rush. He grows hair, learns to read, learns Italian, learns to observe, to talk, to tell the truth, to bluff, and to finally ooze enough respect so he can, when his turn comes, dismiss his own mentor.And at the end, when he walks away from the jail, with charismatic confidence, followed by his men driving expensive cars, as he finally become a prophet in his own 'country', yes I could buy it, with the same excitement when I first saw Michael Corleone's bad-ass strut after he killed his brother-in-law. "A Prophet" is of that caliber, a must-see gangster movie, one the French can be proud of.</fullReview>

This french movie is one of the better "prison" movies that I saw lately. The main actor Tahar Rahim did a great job playing the Arab going to jail, starting at the bottom, needing protection, and making his way up in the criminal world. A hard movie about how prisons are supposed to rehabilitate people but most of the time you just start as a low criminal, meet the wrong people in jail, and then climb up the ladder with your criminal offenses. The whole movie is quite long but you won't get bored for a second as you are completely in the story from beginning till the end. Excellent directing by Jacques Audiard and very good performances by all the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember a quote from an international trailer: 'Epic as the Godfather'. It made me laugh. This film is everything I (never knew) I missed from the Godfather. Or any other 'epic life- career drama' I have seen before. As a realized that I was watching the protagonist's way of 'making it', where normally making it would mean getting from 0 to 10, but in this case it's more like from -3 to 10, I also realized I cannot predict anything. If you watch it as a thriller, it's amazing: there is not one predictable moment in this film. And when the cathartic moment came, I couldn't count on it. There is an epic moment in this film, when you see him smiling in a somewhat, well startling situation, and your mind runs crazy to put it together. And then, you go 'Oh my God, he did it! He did it!'But then again: it's not a thriller :) Seriously. I consider this effect as an extra. Even weeks later I caught myself thinking of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People love a movie if there is at least one character deeply falling in love and another character to hate. You will find both of these characters in this masterpiece from the director Jacques Audiard. Terrific performances from Malik (Tahar Rahim) and Luciani (Niels Arestrup). The relationship between Malik and Luciani reminded me of another duo of Luis Tomar and Alberto Ammann from the prison drama "Cell 211". This movie has everything in the process of an alone and illiterate 19 year old French guy of Algerian descent entering to the prison to becoming a mafia kingpin when he returns after 6 years.Every time someone asks Malik El Djebena whom does he work for, he answered "I work for me". You will realize after the ending why does he say that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good prison movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Prophet is a French gangster film set in a prison divided largely by Corsicans and Arabs in a fight for power. Director Jacques Audiard gives a gritty and authentic look at prison life and that is full of racism and crime. The film does a good job on putting some original touches on a familiar story, making it a solid French film to see.Malik (Tahar Rahim) is a nineteen year old who was just sentenced for six years in prison for presumably attacking cops, which he will be the first to deny. He cannot read and barely can write but can speak both French and Arabic. He comes to prison scared and timid but he does not leave that way.Out of the blue he gets bribed with a cigarette to meet up in the yard with a man named Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup). Cesar Leds the Corsican gang and acts as the Don Corleone inside the prison. Because of his Arab ethnicity, people assume he is a practicing Muslim, even though he is not. But that is precisely why he is sought after by Cesar and the Corsicans, a way to infiltrate the other Arabs.This effectively means he is claimed by the Corsicans as part of their society. Without choice, Malik is told that he needs to kill a Muslim inmate and if he does not, he will be killed. Naturally, Malik is reluctant and had a few failed attempts to get out of it but Cesar and his men make it very clear that they run the place.The next few scenes are incredibly intense as he is instructed as to how to kill the Muslim. They show him exactly how to strike him and even give him a razor blade to do it. He must hold the razor secretly in his mouth and wait for the right time to strike the victim directly across his throat. Horrific as those scenes may be, they ended up being the best in the entire film.Over a year later he is still doing hacks for Cesar. It is clear that is has started to transform into a new person. The transformation is easy to see physically; as he gains some weight, his hair is longer and he even grows a mustache. But he also grows as a person; he learns how to read, speaks Corsican and is fearless.After serving three of his six years, Cesar decides it is time for Malik to have a leave day. Which is a day where Malik is able to leave prison from 7am and stay out until 7pm. Cesar is powerful enough to pass the paperwork through the prison with priority and bypass the judge. The leave day is not for leisure however, Cesar has business for Malik to do on the outside for him.What Malik does with his 12 hours of prison leave is not all just for Cesar though. He ends up scoring some drugs and makes plans with Ryad (a friend he met in prison) for selling it. He wisely does not tell Cesar this, as Cesar made it very clear that prison leave should only be for his business only. It is at this point that we truly see Malik creating his own independence and start to slowly drift away from the Corsicans. Cesar sees it too.A Prophet is somewhat of a lengthy film, coming in at 155 minutes. There are parts that definitely drag on a bit, mostly in the middle act. But the beginning sucks you in and there is enough going on to get you through the middle until you come to the excellent conclusion. The film itself seemed is well constructed and carefully executed. Therefore, I was not surprised to find out that Jacques Audiard hired former convicts to his crew in order to get the real prison experience.Audiard's work did not go unnoticed. This film was nominated for an Oscar and an Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film. It won the Grand Prize of the Jury at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and swept all of the major categories (9 in total) at the Cesar Awards, which is the French equivalent of the Academy Awards.All said and done, A Prophet is a compelling coming of age story of a man that came from the outside world with very little and over time prison taught him how to not only read and write but the politics and economics of gangster life. It is an epic crime saga that provides a great story and amazing acting. Just be ready to devote some time for it, the 2 and a half hour runtime does drag a little bit in the middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Prophet--But Not in His Own Land</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This French film, winner of the 2009 Grand Prix at Cannes and France's official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, is a prison drama in the same league as "Shawshank Redemption" and secondarily "Goodfellas": raw, intense, and violent. It works largely because Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim), a 19-year-old French youth of Algerian origins, finds himself in horrific circumstances far exceeding the crime of resisting arrest for which he was found guilty and sentenced to a harsh six-year prison sentence. Having to face situations in which both choices will destroy his soul but save his life, he watches and listens, learning to read from a fellow Muslim prisoner, and eventually becoming all he thought he would never be.

		<shortDescription>A Prophet (2009)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Prophet contrasts between gritty prison drama and romanticism of crime's luxuries. A Prophet in despite of this contradiction in terms was an engaging film whose atmospheric and hard-hitting qualities on prison life were transfixing.A Prophet's atmospheric qualities lied with Malik's experiences, a fresh prisoner transferred from youth offender to adult prison. A Prophet was decisive in establishing prison's harsh environment with Malik experiencing numerous harrowing moments which are bleakly toned, essential for A Prophet's narrative style. Such scenes' tone were perfected as they were left to settle for audiences to contemplate Malik's scenario. The hand-held cinematography's irregularity personified Malik's humiliation and anxiety within prison. Yet A Prophet also focused on other aspects of Malik's life. Malik lacked formal education which makes his prison life more difficult, adding to the tragedy of his situation. A Prophet again perfected bleak atmospheric tones to let audiences contemplate Malik's lack of formal education as a tragedy. It showed great direction from Jacques Audiard as capturing a bleak atmosphere effectively.A Prophet's representation on crime was mostly direct and brutal. Malik's time throughout prison involved him in various horrendous and dangerous tasks which were horrific not only for audiences but to Malik himself. Later Malik is shown to be increasingly haunted by his actions giving consequence to criminal activity. However A Prophet somewhat contradicted its' representation on crime as Malik became established into criminality, there were certain scenes of sensationalism. This dented A Prophet's representation of crime through taking away the gritty realism previously conveyed.A Prophet in regards to sensationalism was familiar by delving into such territory. Yet A Prophet's atmosphere and skillful direction concluded it to be a hugely satisfying drama capitulating the difficulties of prison life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Prophet. SilverRating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Prophete (Un Proph?te), France's official 2010 Academy Awards. Directed by Jacques Audiard. And staring Tahar Rahim as a kid, petty criminal who goes to jail for one reason or another. At first he is trying to take it easy and just make it through his six years smooth (and not be raped). But soon, he is "forced" into organized mafia crime in the prison system. He works his way up in the ranks. This movie was great because it felt like a foreign revelation of "Foreign Shawshank Redemption" and how it is really less of a "innocent serene life" in prison and more of a "Do anything to get by" attitude. Our antihero protagonist, Malik, earns his movie title name "Prophet" in this weird sequence of events. That was the only confusing part of the movie. Besides that, the movie was a fantastic ride through the hierarchy of and French-Arab through the prison system. Audiard wrote this screenplay with 3 other people I believe. The film was great although it follows the "Play-it-Safe" Criteria of camera angles, steady-cam movements, and 1st person narrative film perception. I loved the story, the way the characters progress and the film ends, how the characters increase in tension and digress in trust. The watch-ability is high. around 8.75/10. The SilverRating is: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable, not many like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I created this account alone to comment on this film, as through recent months of watching films, I purchased this DVD as an additive to my shelf collection. Let me say this film deserves its own shelf. I really have not been blown away from a film like this in quite a while. Expecting another repeated prison movie perhaps focusing on prison life themes not focused on in the likes of Shawshank Redemption. (Which I am not a big fan of and feel is one of the most over rated films of all time). While perhaps "A Prophet" is not the most original film in terms of storyline, a rising gang member facing racial confrontations from all sides and never truly belonging anywhere. It offers something I can't quite describe in words. The acting is impeccable, Tahar Rahim is amazing, never slipping of his public facade and private duties, he transforms Malik into one of the most manipulative yet remaining likable characters of all time. "I work for myself" and he really did, throughout for himself. Though constantly he had me believing otherwise. His decisive yet well thought out actions make him so believable to the heights he achieves. The internal racial conflicts is never exaggerated, never loses its genuine touch and is loyal to mundane prison reality. It stands alone as easily Greatest Prison Film I have ever seen. ( I have seen a few.) If you are not a fan of foreign films and despise subtitles, understand I was once like you, but if you remain this way you lose out on this and many other of the true cinematic greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>French screenwriter and director Jacques Audiard's fifth feature film which he co-wrote with French screenwriters Thomas Bidegain, Abdel Raouf Dafri and Nicolas Peufaillit, premiered In competition at the 62nd Cannes International Film Festival in 2009, was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 34th Toronto International Film Festival in 2009, was shot on locations in France and is a France-Italy co-production which was produced by producers Martine Cassinelli, Marco Cherqui and Antonin Dedet. It tells the story about a nineteen-year-old French citizen named Malik who enters the prison gates to serve a six-year sentence with nothing more than his clothes to show for. Malik's limited adaptation skills doesn't fall in his favour when he is approached by the Corsican mafia, but then one day he meets an experienced inmate who is their boss named César Luciani.Distinctly and masterfully directed by French filmmaker Jacques Audiard, this finely paced fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints though mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a progressively involving and riveting portrayal of a young adult's life-altering relationship with a middle-aged Don and his ways of surviving in a new, restricted and patriarchal society. While notable for its distinctly naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, distinct cinematography by French cinematographer Stepháne Fontaine, production design by production designer Michel Barthélémy, film editing by French film editor Juliette Welfling and use of sound, colors and light, this character-driven and narrative-driven story about organized crime, hierarchical fragments within a prison and the rites of passage, depicts an in-depth and revealing study of character and contains a great and timely score by French composer Alexandre Desplat. This authentic, psychological, gracefully atmospheric and cinematic epic and majestic prison drama from the late 2000s which is set in France in the 21st century and where a criminal gradually starts realizing the invaluable significance of learning how to read, is impelled and reinforced by its stringent narrative structure, substantial character development, efficient continuity which is increased by the dense plot and the abrupt film editing, archetypal character drawings, poignant dialog, versatile perspectives created by the brilliant hand-held directing, unprecedented depiction of a 19-year-old's transcending transformation through six years behind prison walls, striking scenes between Malik and César and the engaging and prominent acting performances by French actors Tahar Rahim and Niels Arestrup. A stoic, concentrated and reflective narrative feature which gained, among numerous other awards, the Grand Prix at the 62nd Cannes Film Festival in 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Arresting, Explosive &amp; Potent Film About Prison &amp; Power.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Winner of Grand Prix at 2009 Cannes Film Festival, A Prophet is a hard-hitting prison drama that borrows elements from various classics of its genre, is absolutely unflinching in both its content &amp; narration, introduces the vastly talented Tahar Rahim in his breakthrough role, and is aggressive enough to rank amongst the most potent gangster flicks out there.The story of A Prophet (also known as Un proph?te) follows Malik El Djebena; a 19-year old petty criminal who's sentenced to six years in prison but soon finds himself caught between the two main factions, the Corsicans &amp; the Muslims, until forced to side with the former. The plot covers his rise in the inmate hierarchy as he slowly gains the respect of both sides despite his Algerian origin.Co-written &amp; directed by Jacques Audiard, A Prophet is brutally engaging from its opening moments, and is arguably the finest work of his directional career so far for it presents the acclaimed filmmaker in firm control of his craft and even though not all aspects work out in the film's favour, its remarkable attention to detail &amp; expert handling of characters is one element that cannot be downplayed.The technical aspects are nicely executed for the sets resonate the grim atmosphere of the prison, is made all the more gruesome by its raw, gritty cinematography which is effectively handled but the plot does end up running longer than it needs to be and could've benefited from a few trims but it's the explosive performances from Tahar Rahim &amp; Niels Arestrup that makes it an experience worth your time &amp; money.On an overall scale, A Prophet is an original, intense &amp; thrilling piece of powerful filmmaking that has all the ingredients of a great feature film, benefits immensely from Rahim's strong input, and would've been amongst the finest examples of its genre if it wasn't lacking in its pacing &amp; a tighter narrative. A rewarding experience despite its shortcomings, this fabulous journey of a vulnerable outsider from a nobody to a fearsome crime lord comes thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

If you enjoyed these films, you will most definitely enjoy Un Prophete. That is, unless you find reading subtitles extremely annoying and a deal breaker when choosing a film. Personally, I don't do subtitles. I watched the movie On-Demand because I am bilingual and knew nothing of its cast, crew, reviews, or perceptions; just the subject matter and language. Previously I had watched only 'Life is Beautiful' and 'City of God' so I know that it can be a distraction, but some movies transcend. By pure luck I landed a gem! I liked this one more than both of the others, and that is saying a lot. It is worth the price of paying attention to the subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure if I read or saw any reviews for this French/Arabic film during the time it was released, but I definitely heard the title in places, and after reading about the plot and seeing positive critical reviews it sounded like something I would certainly like to watch. Basically Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) is the nineteen year old Franco-Arab who is sentenced to six years in prison for assaulting police officers in Brécourt, prior to this he spent most of his life in juvenile detention, and matured into a man it will be his first stint in an adult prison. The prison has two main factions that are divided, the Corsicans and Muslims, the young man keeps to himself and has no known enemies or friends amongst the inmates, he just wants to serve his time without any problems and get back out into the world, but this would be difficult with his illiteracy and having no outside support. After some time sadistic mafia type and head of the Corsican inmates César Luciani (Niels Arestrup) wants Malik to become part of his inside gang and help with their activities, not just with what goes on in the prison, but also assisting criminal activity outside. All he can do cooperate with whatever these gangster-like people tell him, the other Corsicans are not happy with him having any part of their schemes, they just see him as a dirty Arab, and he is not trusted by the Muslim inmates either, but as time goes on these opinions change. While in prison Malik works his way into their consciousness and in the process save himself from situations, soon enough it appears like he is becoming the new don type, or like a prophet, running the show on his own terms. He is allowed on occasions to leave the prison and do his dirty work away from the eyes of the law, and it seems that justice is not served when the day of his release there is no concern, and Malik walks away a free and discharged man, with many new gangster colleagues following his lead. Also starring Adel Bencherif as Ryad, Reda Kateb as Jordi the gypsy, Hichem Yacoubi as Reyeb, Jean-Philippe Ricci as Vettori , Gilles Cohen as Teacher and Antoine Basler as Pilicci. Rahim gives a good bold performance as the adolescent criminal turned small-time mastermind, I admit some of the story of where he was in and out of prison I found hard to understand, but his innocent nature becoming darker and determined to take control has thrilling moments, it does make for an interesting prison drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

		<fullReview>This is a movie with one of the most profound depiction of the underworld politics with a superb character development flow. I mean, come on, beginning as a victim (who did not belong to any race/religion/eats pork/weak and was considered an outcast), survived with sheer wits and willpower while switching sides here and then, and does not mind being used as a puppy in the middle of gang violence as long as that allows him some chance to wiggle his way through and all the way to being a hero of the community.No clichés, no romanticization of the whole gangster-style flamboyance whatsoever. What I saw was a pure raw form of a dog-eat-dog world where only self-interests matters. The only thing I regretted after watching for the first time is my lack of understanding of the Islamic characters in the film, which I cant help but feel that I am missing something here.</fullReview>

Malik (portrayed with a brilliantly subtle nuance by Tahar Rahimand) was a interesting and compelling character while Cesar Lucian (played with a methodical ruthlessness by Niels Arestrup) is the perfect foil to Malik's character. a 2,5h epic about the rise of a small-time crook thrown in a prison system marked by ethnic and cultural diversity. The protagonist arrives as a 19-year-old teen, convicted of beating up some cops, but as time goes by he manages to rise in the prison hierarchy.

		<fullReview>I am quite selective in watching prison-related films as life in there is either glorified or gloomy; in most cases, the "starring inmate" is, in fact, not guilty. As to Un proph?te, this is not the case: Malik El Djebena (giftedly performed by Tahar Rahim) was sentenced to six years in prison for attacking police officers. Life is tough due to corruption, ethnic gangs, overall brutality and harsh living conditions - apart from selected bosses... But life goes on and everyone has to adapt themselves, and that of Malik's is depicted in a thrilling and realistic way. The viewers may share the feelings, but there is hardly compassion available. And I hope that many potential crooks would consider if they are eager to enter such kind of institution... Prisons in Nordic countries, for example, are more or less holiday homes with barred windows.It is a good film and no wonder that it was won so many acclaimed awards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read somewhere that in directing A Prophet, Jacques Audiard wanted to create an "Arab Scarface". While the premise is somewhat comparable, the rise of a small-time criminal, both films don't have much else in common. A Prophet is much more modest, or humble, more psychological, dirtier, and dare I say, better.Jacques Audiard directed a genuine masterpiece which surely will stand the test of time. A Prophet's style is gritty and feels real, and the actors are all fantastic, especially the main character, Malik, played beautifully by Tahar Rahim. The plot is quite diverse, but I don't feel I need to delve too much into it since many here already have. Some have criticized the rather out of place supernatural element in the movie, which is hardly addressed although it inspired the title of the film. I like the fact that it stayed humble in that way, adding a touch of mystery and bizarre in an otherwise realistic movie.If you want to see a modern serious French film, A Prophet is the one to see. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jacques Audiard's 'Un Heros Tres Discret' is a brilliant, under-rated film, and I've also enjoyed some of his other work. It was only with 'A Prophet', however, that he attracted widespread international acclaim. In some ways, this is a conventional story, albeit an uncompromising one, a tough and compelling tale of prison life and gang warfare. It's given a distinctive twist by being seen through the lens of French racial politics; yet the broad scope of the movie is familiar. That doesn't mean it isn't good; it's well acted, avoids giving in to easy sentiment at every point, and the plot doesn't feel rushed. The latter merit is perhaps unsurprising given it's two and a half hour length; at least as pertinent is the fact that, despite this duration, it never drags, although the end doesn't quite have the sheer kick of the start. It's nice to see Audriad get some much deserved credit; but check out his earlier films as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main character's transformation from beginning to end is what makes this film a 10/10. Every minute of it was worth it. A teenage nobody from the streets commits a petty crime and lands himself in jail. He's got no one to miss him outside and no connections in jail to protect him. Told by the most prominent gang in prison "to kill (for them) or be killed". For a new kid who enter the prison system, this is reality. What would you do? Were this a Hollywood movie, he would have started out as already strong, found a way out of the dilemma without having to kill somebody who tried to befriend him and even gave him advice. This movie is no Hollywood movie, however, so indeed our hero first and foremost, murdered an innocent in cold-blood, just to save himself. He then spent years playing servant to the Corsican gang who gave him protection but never respected him nor treated him as an equal, for being a 'filthy' Arab.But you see him get stronger, smarter and becoming more and more unafraid to take risks and take the lead. You see many instances throughout the movie where he's just winging it and coming out successful, hence the title, "A prophet". Tahar Rahim nailed the role, he not only delivered what was expected of him to make it a good film but gave it so much extra. The greatest parts of a movie are the ones that take you by surprise and there were many in this movie.In a way, you could say he even avenged the death of the guy he had to kill by bringing an end to the Corsican mafia's reign, both in jail, and outside. He ruined them for life. The day he achieved this, he stopped seeing the dead guy hanging around him.</fullReview>

A young, blank slate 19 year old Muslim is put in prison with hardened lifers and mobsters. In keeping alive and making connections he grows ever smarter but ever colder. Some truly disturbing scenes, and the implied political issues of immigrants and people who fit in nowhere bring a different twist to the gangster epic, while commenting a lot of current issues in society at large.I also admired Audiard finding a unique style in a genre that has been done so many times. And the performances by the two leads are truly striking.At 155 minutes the film feels a bit long, and the 2nd half has a few needlessly confusing twists and turns on a plot level, but all that faded on 2nd viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Subtly boasting to international audiences a harvested praise and Oscar nomination, the events within A Prophet neither gleam with the flamboyant optimism of Amelie (bad example though it is, only comparable in the fact they are French and superior) nor the opening purity of The Godfather, which was followed by a rise and fall process in domination.Comparable to the latter, A Prophet takes route z, beginning with a dysfunctional portrayal of prison corruption/life then making the lead character, Malik, become a man who would not recognise his pre-prison self after he falls under the, racially narrow Corsican mafia.Throughout this unstable relationship A Prophet invests a portion of Malik's life to his brotherly relationship with Ryad, his inmate friend, opening the door to a small but definitely welcome sub-plot that levels out the gritty, harsh blanket of his mafia encounter in the prison.At times the assignments Malik takes under his belt may seem extreme, but the film doesn't rely on a sloppy narration to explain when you can see this process of power gradually happening for yourself. The film also leaves the ending vaguely ambiguous rather than closing the book definitively, making it a detachable change from other gangsters which take the more conventional clean cut finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The rise of a young mafia boss, Corsican style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Prophet" chronicles the rise of an initially rather na?ve and unsophisticated inmate from prison patsy to prison powerhouse. Nineteen years old when he's first incarcerated in a French prison, Malik is conscripted by the Corsican mafia to kill a newly arrived Arab inmate. Faced with the option of acquiescing or being killed himself, Malik manages to get the job done and, in turn, falls under the protection of the imprisoned Corsican capo. Complicating matters for Malik is his liminal identity. The Corsicans consider him an Arab, but the Arabs consider him a Corsican?and although he grew up speaking French and Arabic, Malik's ethnicity is never clearly defined. Through a series of connections with other inmates and cohorts on the outside, Malik evolves into a powerful crime boss. When his Corsican capo arranges for a number of day passes for Malik, he carries out his boss' wishes and even manages to pull off some deals of his own. "A Prophet" is ultimately more than just your typical prison movie?it examines issue of innocence, haunting guilt, ethnicity, and identity, and offers for our consideration a morally complex criminal?a murderer and a thief whom we come to like and root for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, gripping movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whereas Audiard's two previous movies ? the similarly crime-based and emotionally gripping 'Read my Lips' and 'The Beat that my Heart Skipped' ? focused primarily on the protagonists' moral dilemmas, this movie offers the viewer a broader spectrum to consider. 'A Prophet' manages to successfully create a surrounding world (a bit paradoxical maybe, considering it's mainly a prison drama) thanks to some naturalistic performances by convincing supporting actors, a claustrophobic, at once realistic and magical cinematography that truly communicates the psychological consequences of incarceration, and - perhaps most of all - a powerful, masterful lead performance by newcomer Tahar Rahim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A realistic and chilling look into life within the walls of a French prison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget recidivism. "A Prophet" shows us how prison generates new hardcore criminals, as evidenced by the protagonist Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim in his superb film debut) and his unexpected rise to power within prison. Director Jacques Audiard is in his element, crafting a realistic and chilling look into life within the walls of a French prison where gang-related and racial tensions permeate the facility, rising to a head in a few notable instances which result in a change in the prison hierarchy and Malik's standing within the prison. Malik uses the most of his prison furloughs to do dirty work for Luciani (the in-prison boss, played brilliantly by Niels Arestrup) while also organizing other "business" for himself. By the time he is set to leave prison, he has positioned himself in such a way that it is easy (and scary) to see that prison might have been the best thing that ever happened to him.</fullReview>

I kept hoping Malik would make different choices, even if they were dangerous, but he ran true to form.What could have been a decent, if uninspiring, life if Malik had just done his six years, becomes a tense, survive-in-the-jungle nail-biter. When Malik emerges at the end, a free man and lord of his own crime syndicate, the director seems to want us to cheer.I didn't cheer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Move Over Scorcese, the French Are Coming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I waded through a couple of "Best of 2010" lists until I clicked on Newsweek 's picks and found A Prophet at the top. I read the short paragraph about it and they had me with "prison movie." For some strange, inexplicable reason I love prison movies. I suppose that it has something to do with prison being some sort of ultimate challenge for a man. It just happens that I was also looking for something to watch in French, not that I understand film French all that much. Movies are always very difficult for the student. The Arabic was very difficult and my skill in that language has been languishing for years. Malik al Djebena (Tahar Rahim) enters the prison for what we learn will be a six year sentence. He looks as frightened and alone as anyone could possibly be in this impossible environment but his tattered body testifies that he's not really new to hardship and crime. I like how the director doesn't insult us by interfering with the beginning of the film by showing scenes from Mali's tragic childhood. Instead we just see the result of his youth, a body covered in scars and a 19 year old boy who knows he needs to learn fast to survive inside. His first opportunity to prove himself?to make his bones, as they say in gangster movies?comes all too soon. In the prison yard we see two uneven sides of prisoner affiliation. The Muslims on one side represent the majority, albeit unorganized and directionless. On the other side are the heavily-outnumbered Corsicans who are organized, violent, and well-connected with the prison administration. Malik is singled out by the Corsican boss, César Luciani (Niels Arestrup) to perform a rather tricky assassination for them. Their first meeting together isn't a job interview; it's a threat of kill or be killed. If you get one thing from this film it's that movie stars are not only unnecessary to make a great film, but that they are often a huge impediment. I couldn't imagine this movie with the usual Hollywood stars in the leading roles. Think about what a complete piece of crap The Departed was mainly because of the ridiculous cast of superstars. For all I know this actor playing Malik is a Franco-Arab criminal and I sure as hell believe that the Corsican boss is the thug he portrays in the film. The realism in this movie is unparalleled, unmatched in any movie I have ever seen depicting prison life. It's more life-like than any documentary could be, if that makes sense.Scorsese has nothing on Jacques Audiard and he had better be studying this guy because the stakes have been raised in the crime film genre. Save your money on Jack Nicholson and other has-beens, forget about chase scenes and explosions, and try to keep your story as close to the truth as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films like 'un Prophete' benefit from their simplicity. The story is told in chronological order, straight, to the point, not wavering from the brutal point of view of its character. It didn't necessarily need to be told this way. The story is so rich and intricate that it could have been told many different ways from a myriad of angles and always would have been as fascinating and thrilling as this one is. But Un Prophete transcends because it plays simple, straight and true. The main character - an uneducated, murderous criminal by the name of Malik is portrayed by actor Tahar Rahim in one of the best performances I have seen in a movie. It's not even a performance, really, it's empathy. Excellent, haunting film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time since i've been completely baffled after a film. Truly one of the best in it's genre. The film intentionally contains gaps, not everything is explained to the core, which lets the audience use some imagination, without losing focus of the main subject, the question if our rehabilitation standards are efficient. In theory, when a person does something wrong, he should be punished and indeed, being in prison for god knows how long is a punishment. But do we ask ourselves what these prisons provoke? When you put people, who are on the wrong track, together in a populous space, will this have a positive effect on them? The film is really about a boy going to prison at the age of 19 for a "minor" error. Eventually he grows up to be a powerful man with a whole lot of connections. Ater 6 years he's released and he's supposed to be ready to fit into society... Absolutely splendid cinema!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent film, no doubt. The acting, the direction, the camera work, etc. We are immerse in this underworld among delinquents of all sorts and immediately start getting acquainted with their dirty ways, their dealings with contacts outside --inside too-- favors of different kinds are asked for and offered (without asking too...).This film lasts TWO AND A HALF hours..., I don't know, maybe these scum types are not my cup of tea..., after a while, and no matter how excellent the film (this one couldn't possibly be better), I get tired and restless at all that misery, human misery, miserable human beings, no redeeming qualities whatsoever, no light, no nothing.Who cares about this scum material within society? Are we going to do something to help them? I doubt it. Studies conducted (many) have shown that prison is not a redeeming factor, on the contrary, almost all of them come back to it --and soon-- because they leave the prison much worse as a person than when they entered it (our "hero" the best example).It called my attention that at least in France prisons have workshops and schools, where these people could learn some skill and round it up with some education. That's great! but most of them --if one believes these movie scripts-- prefer to endanger their lives getting into all sorts of trouble (could that show us a microcosm of the idiocy of life outside?). Well, as I said before, great film, but not my favorite type of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A French Gangster Epic That Really Excels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally am a big fan of gangster epics and films, however now I am disappointed with the latest ones coming out of the US and Hollywood. The classics are great, but the newer titles don't match up. A Prophet is in many perspectives a solid classic gangster film from France, and even in subtitles it blew away some of the more recent gangsters films i've seen lately. Its hard and gritty and at times closely true to fact on the French underworld.Violent, doesn't really hit to the bone as sometimes A Prophet in some scenes took me by surprise with its brutality and violence. As the main character of the film, slowly but surely breaks away to build his own crime network and empire. Also what caught my eye with A Prophet, was the solid acting and performances all round from the cast, even in such scenes they held it well together.A Prophet alike to Mesrine, but still totally apart captures French gangsterism and its underworld very well for us and for many of us not French we see another world of violent men. Again A Prophet is another great example of the potential of World Cinema.</fullReview>

The film tells a story a young Arabic criminal who is sent to prison. At first, he stands well back from everyone and keeps himself to himself. But when the Corsicans find out he can speak Arabic , he is forced to do a hit on a fellow Muslim.The film at parts can be slow but not once is it ever boring. We watch this young kid grow up behind bars . We watch him gaining an education all through willpower. Everything he does , he does for himself and all in the name of business.The directing is great with many scenes being truly memorable . The film tries it best to be different from other prison films and at the final product ends up to be a compelling story set in a unique prison scenario . Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. This was France's entry, and one of the odds-on favorite to win Best Foreign Language Film at this year's Academy Awards (it did not win). Director Jacques Audiard brings us the gritty realism of power within the walls of a prison. We even get a glimpse into how power inside the walls translates into power in the outside world.Tahan Rahim stars as Malik, a young, shy, weak boy (apparantly) wrongly sentenced for striking a police officer. Malik is quickly abused and taken advantage of by the stronger, seasoned convicts. Ahh, but young Malik is a quick study and is dragged under the control of the powerful Corsican group led by Cesar Luciana (played by Niels Arestoun). He studies Cesar's process and moves and quickly learns to run his own side businesses by walking a fine line between the various groups in prison.See, Malik is a French born Arab who becomes a trusted adviser to the Corsican crime boss. Although, the Corsicans call him a dirty Arab and the Arabs don't trust him because of his affiliation with the Corsicans. What a mess for Malik. But he is quite the opportunist and makes the best of his situation.Some of the story lines are brutal, while others are quite clever. This adds to the realism and makes this an intense story to follow. Jacques Audiard also directed the fine "The Beat that My Heart Skipped" and that film also featured Niels Arestoun, who flashes some evil eyes and plays his low key power to the hilt. He is great fun to watch here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply the best movie in the last 10 years since America History X. A mark of a good film is the effect it has on you after you watched it, some films you enjoy but you forgotten all about it the next day. This movie occupied my mind for weeks after. The acting is the best you going to see, I think we have a star of the future in Tahar Rahim and the combination of his acting with Niels Arestrup is probably the best performance you see in a cinema this year. Story line is gripping and the tension is unbearable at times, you feel the misery, hope and desperation with all the characters and live the story for the 2 and half hours its on. Its well directed and a very deep storyline, something Hollywood is really short of at the moment, Jacques Audiard has a fan for life with me now. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Et tu, proph?te?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story, let's begin there. It's just too incredible how this fresh young criminal finds ways to outsmart them all. 'Un proph?te' seems to be a 'hopeful' tale for young French-Arabic people caught in the middle between two worlds - but I might be out on a limb there. Maybe the title says it all; Malik is no less than some sort of holy, visionary man eventually ending up on the Arabic side, leaving César (what's in a name) betrayed on his knees in the prison yard.Then there's the freeze-frames with some characters' names in big print on the screen, but why? If you pay attention, it's easy enough to keep track of them. There's the 'soul' of Reyeb who Malik murdered, who keeps hanging around; again, to what avail? It's no more than a supernatural touch that intrigues (as do some words that appear on the screen, such as 'read' and '40 days, 40 nights', or the scenes with the prophecy) but there isn't an actual point to it - or I've missed it. It's 'just' a rise-and-fall crime story, except here, Malik falls at first, then he only rises.Having said all that, I díd very much enjoy other aspects of it. The acting and atmosphere feel very true-to-life and though the story isn't believable, it is mostly very entertaining (and well told) - but I'm not sure if that was the main goal...? Let's make it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable and memorable film experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was watching A Prophet, I could not avoid the comparisons to the also recently released straight-to-DVD in my country film Cell 211, since both take place in a prison.However, it is very clear that they are two very different films, because even though both denounce the corruption, internal management and injustices from the nightmarish setting, A Prophet is an undoubtedly much more mature film, because its ambitions go beyond the suspense seasoned with social commentary from Cell 211.The external drama from the main character of A Prophet could have been the subject of a more traditional story, but co-screenwriters Jacques Audiard (who was also the director) and Thomas Bidegain preferred to focus into the internal evolution, something which makes the story to be more intimate and satisfactory.The point from A Prophet is not to make us ingratiate with the main character, but to show us his methodic development, which in many aspects seems to celebrate the ascent of a young man, who discovers his potential behind a lacking of any opportunities life; but on the other hand, it is a sordid visit to the reality of a penitentiary, where the concept of "rehabilitation" is completely ignored in favor of the training of new criminals in a vicious circle of ambition and survival.That ambivalence of tone is the main element which makes this film to be deep, disturbing and absolutely fascinating, because its realism is not based on the typical devices from the "prison cinema", but on a sober and natural style which does not make any traps to express its message, or is worried by commercial requirements.The same criterion is extended to Tahar Rahim's performance as the main character.In the past, I have mentioned that I like the actors who are able to express a lot saying little; however, Rahim is the opposite, since his impassive face makes the thoughts and feelings his character experiments to be indecipherable.Far away from damaging the movie, that curious acting decision makes the film to be even more intense, by forging a character of unpredictable reactions who surprises us with every revelation from his character, even if it is emotional or rational.And that performance, plus the brilliant screenplay and the perfect direction, make A Prophet to be an extraordinary film, which brought me an unforgettable experience.In summary, this movie absolutely deserves all the acclamation it won around the world, and also a very enthusiastic recommendation from my part, because this film is an authentic gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes with foreign films, you might be reluctant to take a chance. Deal with subtitles, adapt to the different cinematic style. As much as I love films, I grapple with this skepticism myself but have always been rewarded when I overcome it and give myself over. This is an exceptional film and you will be enthralled.Comparisons to The Godfather are valid. A Prophet follows the maturation of a kid, a 19-year old petty thief, French of Arab descent, an orphan and illiterate, who finds himself sentenced to 6 years in a very brutal prison environment. Initially he thinks he can do his time without engaging with the gangs around him, but he discovers right away that to survive he'll have to fight for his life. Right away the Corsican Prmafia grabs him, headed by boss Cesar Luciani, a brutal psychopath. He is ordered to kill another Arab, a rat who could put Corsicans in jeopardy. He whimpers, "I can't kill anybody," and tries to get out of it by telling the warden only to learn that the prison is run by the criminals and he has no one to protect him. So he learns, he is tutored in killing and he succeeds in a sloppy way, the first step in his transformation.Malik becomes a slave for the Corsicans, doing their bidding, washing their floors. But like deNiro's Godfather, Malik is an observer, he listens and learns, and he is patient. He acquires skills but always flies under the radar. Soon he begins to partner with others outside the Corsicans. Audiard, the director, made another movie I adore--The Beat that My Heart Skipped; the Hollywood remake was Fingers with Harvey Keitel. A Prophet is gritty and very un-Hollywood. There are no pretty people in this film but they are fascinating and Malik sneaks up on you as his inner and outer power grows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prison education: a coming-of-age crime epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Prophet is about 'formation'- which simply means 'training' in French. Prison turns nineteen-year-old Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) from a shapeless blob, a young Arab who can barely even read, to a deft manipulator of power who leaves after serving part of a six-year sentence with the world open to him. Circumstances have molded him. But he in turn has learned to mold them. Malik isn't religions or bearded (the slang prison term for Muslims is "the bearded ones"). He's light-skinned and light-voiced. He speaks softly and respectfully. But he can be aggressive and violent if crossed. He's a tabula rasa that's been written on: he grew up speaking both Moghrebi Arabic and French, probably French more but he isn't sure; he quite school at eleven.French director Jacques Audiard (best known for A Self-Made Hero, Read My Lips, The Beat My Heart Skipped) chooses to work with genre but, as good directors can do -- and he is clearly now one of the best -- he alters and transcends it. Yes, he's the reigning French polar (film noir, crime thriller) director, but he reigns by exploding the conventions he works with. Un proph?te is a coming-of-age movie, a prison story, a crime saga with Godfather-like echoes, even, in part, a Western, one in which an Indian takes over from the Cowboys.Malik El Djebena, technically a French Arab from a Muslim family, himself transcends categories. When sent to the big central prison near Paris, Malik, whose identity is already minimal (especially to him), is stripped and humbled, his little hidden wad of money taken. He's forced to spread his cheeks, cough, stick out his tongue. Given a job, he learns to sew jeans. He floats, not hanging in the yard with anyone. Cesar Luciani (the fabulous Niels Arestrup), capo of the group of Corsican mafiosi who control the prison population and many of the guards, spots Malik and gives him a choice. He wants Malik to kill another Arab prisoner, a snitch about to testify at a trial. If Malik does it, he'll get the Corsican's protection. His choice is do it or die himself.It may have helped Tahar Rahim, a greenhorn actor whose performance here won him two Césars for Best and Most Promising Actor, that he was almost as terrified of undertaking this demanding role as Malik, as Malik the character is of immediately being pushed into the role of an assassin who, after being let into his cell for sex, must slit the throat of Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi) with a razor blade hidden in his cheek. This trick works because Malik is young and angel-faced. The sequence both convinces us of Malik's potential and earns the film's credentials as an actioner -- one that's methodical, intimate and harrowing. Malik was not raised by his own parents. On the outside, he has no one. Now he gets a new parent, a 'chef', a boss, Cesar Luciani. He becomes the Corsicans' Arab, making coffee, running errands. He goes to classes and learns to read. Later, he studied economics. Unbeknownst to the Corsicans, he picks up and studies their dialect of Italian. The 'chef' is angry and mistrustful: "You spy on us!" but then he makes Malik his spy on his associates.After a year or so a board grants Malik occasional brief furloughs for good behavior. It's never for a full day, but each time this is engineered by Luciani and Malik has a job to do. But as Malik grows more adept at the violent chess game of crime, drugs, prison, murder, he begins to play a double game and on these furloughs he's not just running errands for his Corsican. He's linked up with another French Arab he's met in the yard, a tall man they call Le Gitane, The Gypsy, Jordi (Reda Kateb), who deals hash brought in from outside. Malik sets up hash shipments too.Malik having been trained by a master (Luciani), he eventually breaks loose and assumes power on his own. He is thrown into one more challenging test after another, but he seems to lead a charmed life and even convinces some men on the outside that he's psychic: hence the title "a prophet." In this brief but epic narrative Audiard makes masterful use of cinema's ability to convey rapid information thorough image alone. A gesture at airport security, a slo-mo of jumbled bodies in an SUV, a new cell that shows Malik's more preferred status, the practicing Muslims he does not associate with, but who fall in line at a meeting with him; jogging around a large cell that symbolizes impending freedom -- these show the craftsmanship that make A Prophet remarkable, a film whose team formed as deftly in the broad strokes as in the fine details. A Prophet is one of those films you remember in black and white. it's all about action and milieu, and despite being two and a half hours long it is tight and economical. You walk out of it a little bit dazed.A Prophet is about identity and ethnicity. It's about playing by the rules and rising above them. It is, of course, less "pleasurably offbeat" than Audiard's earlier films (as Variety's Justin Chang puts it), and it grows more conventional in its second half, but everything is handled with freshness.Credit is due to all the writers, Abdel Raouf Dafri Nicolas Peufaillit, and Thomas Bidegain, who worked with Audiard on the final rewrites. There are a host of other good actors involved: Rahim's and Arestrup's work wouldn't look so good without them. The d.p. Stéphane Alexandre Desplat's music is surging and powerful at times, but can't overpower the action.Though Haneke's White Ribbon won the top prize at Cannes and this came in second, it understandably reigned supreme at the French C&#x15b;ars. Not surprisingly, it's received universal acclaim both with French and, six months later, with US critics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love these kind of of films. Oscar nominated foreign films are like little hidden gems . Films that the majority of English speaking countries avoid like the plague because they are subtitled ( a phobia i can never understand) . There are have been some amazing films in recent years such as "The Kite Runner" and " The Lives of Others" and although " A Prophet" is not as good as those , it is still a film that should be seen by far more people than sadly i fear it will.Sentenced to six years in prison, Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim) is alone in the world and can neither read nor write. On his arrival at the prison, he seems younger and more brittle than the others detained there. At once he falls under the sway of a group of Corsicans who enforce their rule in the prison. As the 'missions' go by, he toughens himself and wins the confidence of the Corsican group. Very quickly, Malik uses all his intelligence to discreetly develop his own network. French film is going through a bit of a renascence . At the moment the gangster movie is being done better in France than anywhere in the world . A Prophet is a gritty prison drama that pulls no punches. The first hour is the best . Malik's initiation into the world of prison gangs is amazing and very tense , especially the scene where he has to kill a fellow inmate . My only criticism is that at times is does get a little confusing as to who is who and which faction they belong to and because of that this does not get top marks from me but thanks to superb performances from Tahar Rahim and Niels Arestrup this a film that is highly watchable and stands a good chance of winning the Oscar for best foreign language film.</fullReview>

Do not let that put you off.The story is compelling, the direction sublime and the acting magnificent.I predict big things from Tahar Rahim (Malik in the film) as his portrayal of a teen who learns what he has to become to survive is jaw droppingly astounding.I just hope that America doesn't feel the need to do a remake in the English language. It's not needed or wanted. This is a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece. I really hope this film isn't overlooked come February. I must say that I thought this was brilliant. A low budget piece of excellence, that surely must be recognised for an Academy Award nomination. The story was gripping, the acting flawless and the direction was on point. The best thing about this movie is the character Malik. He starts off as a teenager, sentenced to 6 years, in a corrupt gangster ridden prison. Afraid, alone and lost, in the sense he has no idea what kind of man he is or will become. He is then forced to kill a recognised criminal and that's what makes him. As the years go on he learns from his fellow criminals the rules of the game. He learns another language, how to survive, to adapt, negotiate drug deals, and how not to get caught. In doing soon he compromises his heritage and faith to be accepted. Soon he's running his own criminal enterprise from within prison and kills anyone who gets in the way of his survival. Tahir Rahim is brilliant and you gradually see the change in Malik, from a scared clueless teenager to a man who becomes respected in the French underworld. Probably the most human portrayal of a criminal, I've ever seen in a movie. Not for everyone I would say. But for those who love foreign language cinema, it's definitely a must. Go see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Affecting and compelling French prison drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With two strong central performances and an involving story that paints mostly morally grey characters, it's with great interest that I watched this.As aforementioned, Rahim plays his character's illiterate, boyish and wary tough-nut role with aplomb which is well balanced by the powerhouse performance of Arestrup as Corsican crime boss Cesar. He's ruthless and frightening.The plot basically follows the rise of Malik through the violent hierarchy in the crime world. It pulls no punches - murders are hard to watch as you see what the character has to to survive. Parts of the plot weren't as well explored, like the moments of surrealism but maybe they'll make more sense after a re-watch. I'd have liked to get more of the complexities of the criminal systems shown as Malik's rise seems to lack aspects of this, to me.Characters are introduced with their names by freeze frames (which is also used for certain important plot points etc too). The score is simple and affective and I heard the use of some rap songs too which was fitting.Overall, a very well acted, thrilling, coming of age, rites of passage tale which illustrates the dangerous and seductively powerful world of crime and how one young man eventually found his place in it. Essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Typical Film About Prison Life Elevated By Its Lead Actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Un Prophete" is the Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film from France. Along with "The White Ribbon" from Germany, this is one of the front-runners for the prize, only to be upset by the entry from Argentina.For me, "Un Prophete" is just an ordinary film about prison life as it focused on the journey of a 19 year-old young man Malik who graduated from juvenile confinement to enter an adult penitentiary as he reached the age of maturity. We see his transition from a virtual nobody to a trusted gofer of a crime lord to a bonafide leader of his own operations.Unfortunately for me, I thought this process was told in a very long and slow manner. This film unfolds his story very methodically for about 2 and a half hours! Many parts of the film were scenes we have all seen before in previous prison films. There were several promising scenes of a mystical nature which unfortunately led to nowhere. It is not really clear to me why the whole movie was entitled "A Prophet," when there is only one scene in the whole long course of the movie that even mentions it. I also get the feeling that a lot is lost in the translation of the dialog into the English subtitles.The best feature that elevates this film to the next level above the ordinary prison film is the star-making performance by its young lead actor, Tahar Rahim. Despite his limited acting experience before this, Rahim was able to charismatically convey the growth of his character Malik with all the grit and fervor of a veteran. His riveting and challenging performance deserved to have been nominated for Best Actor in the Oscars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal prison drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In film, prison creates opposites. If you're nice when you go in you'll come out as a psychotic killer, If you're a brutal murderer you'll turn out as saccharine as a game show host. The amount of time spent inside is irrelevant. There are a few exceptions, and they all abide by The 1st law of Andy Dufresne, which is that you only remain the same if you escape. Director Jacques Audiard's Un prophete (which after studious translation turns out to be 'A prophet' in English) deals with the French penal system and its affects on a supposedly innocent young man, Malik El Djebena, played by Tahar Rahim. Malik is a half-Arab half-Corsican boy of 19 who has been in and out of various detention facilties since he was very young. However, he's far from a hardened criminal and his introduction to the prison where the film is set is a real shock to the system. As the film progresses he becomes wise about life inside, becoming the assistant to mafioso César Luciani, played by Niels Arestrup, who protects him in return for 'favours'. Malik's mixed lineage causes him a lot of trouble in prison and neither of the main gangs, the muslims or Corsicans, truly accept him. So he decides he's going to become the big boss.Almost three hours later and you'll feel like you've been in there doing time with him. It is vicious and violent in the extreme, although not in the traditional pressups-in-solitary kind of way, lending it a twisted credibility. Having said that A prophet could have been an hour shorter and a lot less introspective on Malik's part, especially with respect to some of the unrelated dream sequences he has every few minutes. Of course it doesn't help that if you don't speak french and you're having to reading it as subtitles it loses a lot, especially with so much riding on Malik's character to develop the film. While it may have been hailed as a masterpiece by many, and it certainly is a visually brilliant, Audiard tries to cover too much ground, involving too many different plot points, and as a result ends up exhausting the audience. Still, it is definitely a welcome break from a lot of the hypermacho Hollywood takes on the same genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Prophet: 9/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Prophet is about a young Arab man sent to a French prison where he became a drug kingpin. Malik is Arabian (Muslim), most of his inmates are Corsicans so there was a big separation. Malik is known for siding with the enemies. He works for the Corsicans but at the same time bond with the Muslims. Malik is illiterate and has no support outside of prison so his life in jail is all he has. It seems as though Malik has a struggle of character once every five minutes of the film. If he's now doubting his decisions, he's getting his ass kicked by a Corsican. Director Jacques Audiard has done a fine job of creating this complicated yet fragile character that even if you can't understand him, you side with him. The film also demonstrates how a prison might make you do things that you'd never imagined. Filled with violence and gory details, finely crafted, and beautifully cinematographed, A Prophet is one of the best that the French film industry has to offer. (not to mention impressive performances out of the cast)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I watched this movie, I expected to see a thug turn into a spiritual man in prison. I mean, the film's title implies something in this direction. Ever was I wrong. The film is about a guy who trough violence rises to the top in the underworld and pulls it off in the end, by licking upwards and kicking downward - I would guess this is quite realistic for being a criminal gangs and perhaps for ambitious organizations in general. It is also a story of a failed justice system, who only serves to embrace crime, instead of destroying it. At a distance I can see the film as an unvarnished prison drama, though viewing it was not a pleasant experience. I don't know what provokes me the most, it's excessive use of violence, which actually pays off for the protagonist in the end, or his Islamic spiritual guidance in by his haunting murder victim. And yet, neither is quite unrealistic, for a person as psychologically and emotionally disturbed as the main role in this movie. In the end, the movie manage to pi** in two directions, on the french justice system and on Islam. In my humble opinion more movies should do the first and less movies should to the last. In the end I did not like the feel bad flick, but I give it a 7, for making me abandon my shelved crime ambitions for good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, Un Proph?te was a personal experience. Having been in prison for some time I felt inside the movie from the first frame. I found myself jailed again. My experience was different from Malik's day to day but there were many similarities in the environment. Like him I was in a prison where racism was the basis of the interrelation between prisoners (in my case Jews and Arabs). Feeling so involved it is difficult for me to write an unbiased review. It is a strong movie, a crude portrait of a brutal reality. Fear and violence are well outlined. The story is secondary but a good plot. In the raw atmosphere, the story is somehow unexpectedly intelligent and sophisticated. Time flies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Prophet is a French 2009 Oscar nominee for best foreign language Film that deserves that praise as a study of the Darwinian jungle a gritty prison can be and the way to survive even in the face of overpowering power plays.Nineteen year old Malik (Tahir Rahim) does big time for the first time in a French prison run by Corsicans and threatened by Muslims. After doing a requisite murder ordered by the Corsicans, he learns how to become a leader himself and even set up his life for the sweet hereafter prison.The film is entirely too long but absorbing as a deconstruction of the culture. It is a character study of Malik satisfying in its claustrophobic framing and unforgiving close-ups. Malik becomes a smooth Harvey Keitel, and the film itself is grim enough to make Birdman of Alcatraz look like Mamma Mia!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lowest common denominator of Life. "Tabula rasa" of a young punk thrown in contemporary jail in France. "The population" reflects the society as a skeleton of it. This film is a masterpiece, which presents a reality of the struggle between group of interests for profit, power, privileges, comfort etc. The "Big Zone" is reflected in a "Small Zone". The world outside is a continuation of the "inside system" and visa versa. In a rather simple and almost minimalist style Jacques Audiard paints with a technique resembling etching. Interesting how the jail milieu dominated by quest for sex, food, some degree of comfort are not the realm of interest for César Luciani - the organized crime boss. He is interested in power only. Malik - with his agility and instinct for survival of a sewer rat - turns out to be the ruthless wheeler/dealer/murderer capable of camaraderie and spirit of friendship, compassion and pride. Good, but hard and sobering film.</fullReview>

The way the movie ended seemed a little implausible, and it took so long to get there that I stopped caring after a while.

		<shortDescription>Overlong, ice-cold prison drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to A PROPHET, a much raved-about French prison film that had critics salivating and reviewers going wild when it came out. Having just watched it, I'm left feeling a little deflated. Disappointed. Because the film I just watched is very much an ordinary sort of prison movie that covers very familiar ground with little of the high drama that I was expecting considering all the praise it received.Tahar Rahim, who underplays his role quite considerably, stars as a young Arab male who's sent to a notoriously tough prison. Once inside, he soon falls under the spell of a seasoned gangster, played by an excellent Niels Arestrup. The film that follows charts Rahim's eventual rise to become a notable gangster in his own right.There's no denying that this film is well made: good shooting is employed throughout and there's a high level of grittiness to the realism that never lets up. The cast, although subdued, put in decent turns and the script has a tendency to avoid cliché wherever possible, making this an inventive viewing experience. There are some moments of intense drama and horror that'll have you watching between splayed fingers.But such incident comes too little and too infrequently. The two-and-a-half-hour running time is at least half an hour too long, with lots of slow, drawn out scenes that feel repetitive and don't add much to either the plot or to character development. I've seen a fair few prison dramas, and the really good ones ? ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ, PRISON ON FIRE ? just feel more involved than this.There's a level of iciness to this movie, a kind of clinical detachment that makes it a virtually emotion-free ride, and it's hard to warm to any of the characters. Even in a film like SCARFACE, where the lead was a very bad man indeed, Al Pacino brought vivacity and charisma to the part that made audiences immediately engage with his character. A PROPHET is the kind of film that looks impressive but fails to engage the senses too much. There's no denying that it's a very well-crafted movie, but it lacks the heart that would have made it a classic.</fullReview>

It's good, it' not super good, nor "wow that was so amazing" good, nor "one of the best movies I've ever seen" good. The movie is way too long. After around 1h38, I thought it was the end. I checked the time and there was still one hour to go...It's good, not breathtaking. It doesn't deserve more than a 7. Don't watch thinking it's gonna blow your mind. Just watch a good movie, which is already fine.NB : I put a 6 cause this movie is overrated. It's good but not impressive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very superior "French mafia" type film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the ending: the three cars. From what I understand the three cars represent the three drug gangs that Malik has united: the Arabs, the Egyptians and the Corsicans. Their ominous presence also suggests that Malik will live the life of a drug lord and die the life of a drug lord., which of course is his fate and what he deserves. There is also the echo from Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) with Michael at the end.Now to the idea that Malik is "a prophet." I can only guess that he is a prophet in the world of drug lords. There is the possibility that director Jacques Audiard, who has written twenty-some films and directed half a dozen including two very good ones that I've seen, Read My Lips (2001) and The Beat that My Heart Skipped (2005), meant to disparage (celebrate?) The Prophet by comparing his illiterate and up-by-his bootstraps hero Malik to Allah's Messenger--but I'll pass on that.The real philosophic question to be answered in this most arresting film is does Malik represent what we might call "Existential Man" in his struggle to prevail in life after being dumped on this planet and told to sink or swim? Certainly to the drug gangs he is heroically triumphant, and to most of the audience as well. Malik represents a new kind of hero, a naturalistic creation who doesn't make judgments about good or bad, or question the way the world is run (or the way the prison is run), but makes the best of what life has thrown at him and learns not to be squeamish about what he has to do to prevail. French existential novelist Albert Camus famously said that the only important philosophic question is that of suicide. Malik chooses murder over suicide, but we cannot help but identify with him since his choices were indeed just those.Malik's character combines underprivileged raw youth with something beyond street smarts, with the kind of courage war heroes can only envy. That is how he wows his home boys and others. This is what they respect. But, looking around at all the dead bodies, and especially at Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup), the once powerful war lord who bows out of the movie a beaten old man, one can see that Malik will die by today's equivalent of the sword as did the ancients who lived the life of the war lord. Tahar Rahim, who plays Malik, would seem to have a great future as a film star. He does an outstanding job here in a very demanding role.What I found most arresting about this film is the way the French prison system is depicted. Apparently corruption is rampant with the inmates in significant control of the guards and the prison officials. Luciani runs his drug empire from within the prison. Prisoners favored by the drug lord powers that be get special privileges and are allowed to control the other prisoners. I understand that Audiard studied the French prison system before making this film. The film is an indictment of that system, which makes me wonder how they feel about this sensational film in France.Also interesting is how the various ethnic gangs in French prisons relate to one another. Luciani's Corsicans were mostly in charge as the film begins with Malik just a low-level forced funky. By the end of the film the Muslim gang is mostly in charge it appears. I wonder if this reflects the reality in French prisons.Finally, this is a brutally realistic film in which humans are seen primarily as animals. Even Malik's love for his teacher's child can be seen as unconsciously acting out a communal role that will result in his having many reproductive tries?indeed how sweet is the mother already on him as they walk together to the bus stop and presumably to her bed. The only law that seems to exist is that of the jungle, that of the stronger, with the laws of the state as kind of fact of nature that must be overcome or subverted, never respected. And the values of the larger society are irrelevant, immaterial, nonexistent and mute. This is a naturalistic film for the twenty-first century.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>The best mafia movie ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Step over, "The Godfather". Move a bit to the side, "Goodfellas". The world has found a new contemporary classic to name THE best crime movie ever...and it's not an American film, you know. It's Jacques Audiard's "A Prophet" which (having come out only a year ago) has already established itself as a perennial classic and as a gang movie that will be remembered for ages to come. It's not like Coppola's "The Godfather" or Scorsese's "Goodfellas" will move on to oblivion, no; they remain in their altars, but "A Prophet" manages to take the mafia genre to new, modern heights and an equally or more profound level of storytelling. It's that kind of a film you're extremely thankful to have watched before dying.It takes place in a French prison. Malik (Tahar Rahim) has just turned 19 and must be moved from a juvenile penitentiary to complete the remainder six years of his sentence in a gritty, high-security jailhouse where the most dangerous gangs orchestrate their outside shady deals. He's an arab, which means that he comes into instant trouble with the French-borns, and being but a sapling to the overgrown lawn of crime, he is in need of protection and maturity if he expects to survive; not only that but he hardly knows how to read and write, so he's basically screwed.Upon his arrival, his lack of social skills and obvious alienation drive Luciani (Niels Arestrup), a crime boss of the French-Italian mafia, to take interest in young Malik. There's a new Muslim recruit who threatens to give Luciani trouble with the kind of information he has, so this guy must be taken out as quick as possible, but none of Luciani's prison gang can kill him; they need an inside guy, someone who can get close to the Muslim without exciting the attention of the Arabs. Malik is perfect for the job.Luciani tasks Malik with killing the dangerous arab, and in exchange he'll protect the sapling and, well, won't kill him. Malik undertakes the job and therein encounters his commencement into a many-layered, complexly nuanced world of crime which his avid mind is only too keen to absorb. The film follows Malik's progression into Luciani's gang and his painful, discomfiting maturity from a naive human being into a drug-trafficking, coldly-calculating and VERY intelligent crime war boss. I can't even explain more about the plot; it would a) give out too many spoilers, and b) destroy my poor brain trying to write some sense into the heavily complicated plot (complicated to explain, by the way, NOT complicated to understand). It's one of those stories where you begin out by trying to sort-out and predict the events and outcomes, but there's a point where it all overwhelms you and there's nothing to do but sit back and watch in wonder and the utter perfection of the screenplay.Jacques Audiard has outdone himself. This is the first Audiard film I see, but I've read that with it he's reached a maturity level he never could have hoped to accomplish with his previous films. I need to watch them to form my own analysis, but there's no doubt that Audiard has eased his way into my list of Most Respected Directors; this is a film which shatters your nerves and never cares to reassemble them. The DVD's been off for ten minutes and I can't stop running my hand through my head in stupefaction.The mafia has always been a disturbing topic, and one which appeals to audiences worldwide because of the unimaginable web of corruption it reveals. "The Godfather" and "Goodfellas" did an excellent job exposing us to the blood-paved, double-timing world of crime, but "A Prophet" presents it to us in the grittiest, most horrifying way possible; not only that, but it carefully and poignantly studies the transformation of the human being from a 'normal' person into a crime machine. The character of Malik is a character which not only film lovers will remember and ponder upon, but it's a perfectly analytic sociological dissection of the nature of corruption (both social and psychological) and the dog-eat-dog situation we're born in. The prison the film takes place in is an allegorical microcosm of the lives we lead; the blood, the violence, the cruelty, the painful maturity...EVERYTHING is the same to the lives we lead, everything but the prison walls.THIS is the kind of film every human being should watch. It's expertly-made, every technical aspect is perfect (especially the cinematography and Alexandre Desplat's suspenseful score), the dialogue and screenplay couldn't possibly be better and, most importantly, it'll have you thinking and thinking for many time to come. It's called "A Prophet" because of some visions Malik sometimes has concerning future events and because, like a prophet, he came into the prison silently proclaiming an eventual change of power. For me, it's also called "A Prophet" because it paints a horribly true portrait of the eventual dehumanization of men and the spread of social corruption in our youngsters' minds. Put any teen or young adult you may know into Malik's shoes and see if the resulting thoughts don't scare the living hell out of you. Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Metamorphosis of a Criminal Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A PROPHET ('Un proph?te') is a mesmerizing film, so involved in complex subplots that the viewer's attention must stay on alert lest any aspects of this gripping film escape appreciation - despite its long (155 minute) duration. The redoubtable Jacques Audiard directs this tale written by Abdel Raouf Dafri and Nicholas Peufaillit and adapted for this film by Thomas Bidegain and Audiard himself. Almost all of the film takes place within prison walls with occasional (and very important) tours outside the prison) and with the cinematography of Stéphane Fontaine the atmosphere is appropriately claustrophobic for the story to emerge as dark and mysterious as it does. A musical score by Alexandre Desplat once again proves that this composer is able to capture the mood of a piece and enhance it without drawing attention to the actual music we are hearing. Malik (Tahar Rahim) is only 19 years old, illiterate, an orphan of the streets who is bilingual in Arabic and French, when he is imprisoned for assaulting a gendarme. He resents every aspect of his entry into prison but decides to remain alone and a anonymous as possible until his sentence is completed. But prison life has a different plan for him: noticing that Malik does not congregate with his fellow Muslim inmates, the Corsicans pick him as a cohort - mob boss César Luciani may be cold but he is powerful and promises Malik 'protection' if Malik consents to kill Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi), a threat to the Corsicans. Malik is terrified of the 'project' but fears the recourse if he should not comply, and so he manages to kill Rayeb - an act that causes him great emotional turmoil and follows him in the manner of Rayeb's ghostlike presence haunting him throughout his imprisonment. Malik is thus attached to the Corsicans, learns to read and write, and makes friends with two other similar Arabs, Ryad (Adel Bencherif) and Jordi the Gypsy (Reda Kateb) and the three become involved in drug trafficking. César manages to gain a day leave situation for Malik and with each of these criminally centered turns outside prison walls Malik becomes more and more powerful in his courage to do the near impossible. As time passes the Corsicans are returned to Corsica (they had been political prisoners), except for César who is not eligible for transfer. As Malik becomes more self sufficient and more involved with drug smuggling both inside and outside the prison, César loses control until Malik is calling the shots. By the time of his release, Malik has 'grown' into a practiced criminal - but with a specific soft side that has also developed from his prison experience. The film is all the more strong because of the impeccably fine performance by Tahir Rahim - a very young actor about whom we will be hearing much more. This is a dark and often depressing film, but the may in which it is directed and acted makes it a very powerful work. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At last a movie has been made which kicks "The Godfather" straight in the balls. As some reviewer rightly said, it's the same as the Godfather but it's more confined. Tahar Rahim gives a scintillating performance as Mali, one of the finest I've seen in recent years. But the actual stealer of the show is Niels Arestrup whose portrayal of Cesar, the uber powerful Sicilian crime lord, is simply on par with Marlin Brando's Vito Corleone. The brisk cinematography, and brilliant narration sums up to the performances. And all of this takes place in a prison. It's a pity that "El Secreto de Sus Ojus" got made in the same year as this. Both of them deserve an Oscar. The best scene? There are many but the very last scene in the movie where Mali gets out of the prison and walks with his deceased friend's wife and child while three luxury SUV's follow him. A story of transformation, from nothing to everything. All of it confined within a cell. One word for it, brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Does Anyone Know About Violence? Nothing, and Everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a killing at the heart of Jacques Audiard's A Prophet that is blundering, slipshod and savage, and leaves the killer trembling. Whether he shakes with remorse, alleviation or rage we cannot tell. That's why it's the centerpiece of this film. We watch, we follow, but we cannot tell. It generally must be that way when we observe acts of savagery. What goes through the mind of an executioner when he pulls the switch on the electric chair? When murderer who kills for psychological gratification is found guilty in court, is he aware this is for the best? Does he feel punished and sorry? Does he care? More pertinent to the survivalist nature of this movie, if an ordinary person kills a mugger in an alley, or generally must kill to survive, are they glad their attacker is dead? Are they remorseful? Who are we in these situations and how do we judge someone in them? Operating on both levels as hard-boiled, diligent social realism and as an irresistible genre piece, the movie tracks Malik, a young Arab Frenchman, who sets foot in prison as a childlike stranger and is sculpted into a ruthless, grown-up gangster. He wasn't born ruthless. He was born a bashful, submissive failure. Prison made him all that he can be. Played by Tahar Rahim, he's lanky, apprehensive, attempting to nurture a mustache. He's behind bars on vague grounds. He insists he's innocent, although it doesn't make any difference. Prison effortlessly deprives him of any privacy or pride and kicks him over to the Corsican gang that dominates everything behind bars through brutality and pay-offs.This gang is run by Cesar Luciani, played by Niels Arestrup as a man with the bearing and impact of Don Corleone but with more bitterness. He walks everywhere surrounded by an entourage of muscle. He sees all that goes down. He gives an order, and it is executed. He makes it his business to strong-arm the new guy, who is valuable as he supplies clearance into the Arabic circle. There is a prisoner there who Cesar wants dead. Malik is ordered by Cesar's right-hand how to hide a razor blade in his mouth and slit the man's throat. It's pretty cut-and-dried: If Malik doesn't do this, he'll be killed himself. When Malik attempts to find aid from the warden, he swiftly learns that Cesar is correct: Kill or die.It's merciless natural selection. Malik has never killed. He makes a blunder of it. There is a terrible scramble. Everything is soaked in blood. Malik gets away solely since Cesar has emptied the wing. It is an initiation. Now that he has killed, he is not a "man," but he is a subsister who will do what is required. In the years to come, Malik endures a metamorphosis. He's an incredible autodidact. Outside society never got an opportunity to shape him. Now he masters how to watch, how to weigh intentions, how to be a tactician, how to advances. He also starts to read, although that's more significant for his positive self-image than for anything he learns. He is an outsider to the Corsicans, a "dirty Arab," yet there is no point in begrudging that. He must think for himself.Gradually he becomes Cesar's most dependable right hand, maybe since he is Arab, cannot side with the other Arabs, and has no other place to go. Prisoners occasionally are provided a few days' leave. He does a job for Cesar on the outside?and it also lets him further align himself. A Prophet becomes a young man's dark, unapologetic coming of age story. The best performance in the film is by Arestrup as Cesar. He sees but does not want to be pinpointed. He controls by obstructionism. He has maintained total control over life and death for so long that he behaves like it's inherent. Most of his pivotal points comprise wordless reaction shots: Judgments and foresight.A Prophet, with its stylistic grittiness and catchy soundtrack, is also great because of its compelling figures, characters for people who don't often see themselves in the iconographic landscape of movies, and yet the new kid Rahim is a mystery. What is he thinking? That's the characteristic Audiard desires. He's a freshly baked man, and when the form shapes, it occurs inside. He learns from Cesar to betray nothing. Lots of movies and actors are prepared to disclose to us what everyone is thinking, and why. Sometimes it's more engaging for us to absorb connotations from enigma. An actor who betrays nothing, like Alain Delon in Melville's Le Samourai, is absorbing. Although what does go on inside Malik? That's the scary part. We can just determine by what he does. Now he is ready to kill. If we must be killed, don't we all somewhat knock wood that it'll be by someone for whom the deed has significance? For whom our life has significance? Malik was such a man once, and that ended in the gory disarray of the prison cell. Now prison has trained him to return to the streets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MYeah's Review: Un Prophete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So to start out: Simply put, this was undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2009.The film is a very tense prison drama that centers on a young, illiterate Arab named Malik El Djebena (Played by Tahar Rahim), who is sent to a French prison for a six year sentence, his first in an adult prison. The main inmates of the prison are groups of Muslims and Corsicans, the latter who use guard connections to control what happens in prison. He is recruited by a Corsican kingpin in the prison, Cesar Luciani (Pkayed by Niels Arestrup), to join him in fulfilling criminal acts and schemes for him, not only in prison, but in the outside world as well. While in prison, he also tries to help set up for his post prison life, as well as occasionally being haunted by a specter in the form of one of the first people he got to know in prison (Played by Hichem Yacoubi) The movie's story is nothing short of spectacular. It's tense, brutal, and edge of your seat engrossing. It's absolutely inspired work.The movie is not only told wonderfully, but acted brilliantly. The cast are all incredible, they help lift this movie to unreachable heights, especially Tahar Rahim, who carries this film undeniably perfectly. I also want to give credit to wonderful performances like Arestrup, and Adel Bencherif, as well as a brilliant performance by Hichem Yacoubi.The movie runs at a relaxed pace, and the time just flies right by because you're just so into the movie. It keeps your interest locked onto what's happening, and doesn't lose that interest.A wonderfully told movie, with absolutely brilliant performances.I give Un Prophete ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Beast",I refer to, is the prison,and those who end up doing hard bullets for various crimes. In this case,it draws on Malik El Djebena, a 19 year old who has been sentenced to six years for murder. While in prison,he comes to the attention of the local protection mob,mostly made up of Corsicans,headed by Cesar Luciani,who is doing a life stretch, there. After a grisly initiation ritual,young Malik ends up a flunky for the Corsicans,doing various jobs for them (but is still ill treated by the various other members of the gang,who regard Malik as little more than a house boy). Amid all of this,Malik is plotting a sinister agenda of his own. Jacques Audiard ('Read My Lips','The Beat That Skipped My Heart',etc.)directs from a very well written screenplay by Thomas Bidegan,Abdel Raouf Dafri,Nicholas Peufaillit &amp; Audiard. The film's gritty cinematography is by Stephanie Fontaine,with editing by Julliet Welfling. Tahar Rahim plays the role of young Malik,that ranges from near innocence,when he enters prison life to hardened criminal within a short period of time. Abdel Bencherif is Ryad,who is as close to family that he has,with Jean Phillippe Ricci as Vettori,one of Luciani's close associates,with far too many other cast members to list here. This is a tense,unflinching tale of prison life that will not be everybody's cup of tea,but those with a penchant for it will respect it for it's bravura. Spoken in French,Corsican &amp; Arabic with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains some brutal,bloody graphic violence,pervasive strong language,sexual content &amp; flashes of nudity. Leave the kiddies home (I really mean it---this is NOT for children)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>blends truly powerful material with lengthy mundane passages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of 3 contenders nominated for the best foreign film Oscar I've seen (still yet to see Ajami and Milk Of Sorrow), the French entry A Prophet is arguably the strongest. Still I don't love this film, which only shows how little I care for the Academy's picks in this category. Jaques Audiard's A Prophet is a story of Malik El Djebena, a young prisoner who gradually gains power while working out the politics of prison system. Audiard does a great job showing the chain of influences in prison that has a lot in common with the battle of gangs. This well-acted movie not only shows the mechanisms of organized crime, but also focuses on its main character's psyche becoming a peculiar character study. Sadly, it's very hit-or-miss in this mode. I completely don't get an allusion to Malik's prophetic skills pointed out only at one point in the movie. In addition, director Audiard has plenty of problems with tone and pacing: the movie often feels painfully slow and would benefit from additional editing. In fact, I would even go as far as to get rid of 50 minutes of this overlong movie, which would certainly make for a more visceral experience. All in all, A Prophet blends truly powerful material with lengthy mundane passages. It strikes me as a lost opportunity for a gangster movie classic. 6/10 (B-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly inspired by the intelligent, incisive, and provocative genre that has given us "The Godfather" and every other Scorcese production, here comes "The Prophet", a detailed, blunt, lacerating exposure to the deals behind the walls of a French prison where a new generation of entrepreneur/criminal rises from a nondescript inmate to an intelligent, manipulative, and very resourceful leader.Brilliantly played by Tahar Rhim, Malik is an intriguing figure, an example of a character that is equal parts, resourceful, intelligent, and lucky, as he takes every possible advantage of what the surroundings can offer. His first instinct is to survive, and eventually he learns to use every possible opportunity to gain control of his surroundings and possibly outsmarts the other clique heads Rahim is perfectly cast as he is an example of the new French generation, an embodiment of two or more cultures, closely tied to his ancestors but perfectly exemplifying the conflicts that arise from not really belonging anywhere, a human being who years acceptance, identity, and control of his surroundings, and though "Un Prophete" is rather daring example of how far people can go, it never shies away from the conflicts currently tearing apart France's society. There is plenty of suspense, tension, drama, and emotional conflicts boiling under the surface of what might seem to many just another prison drama, but don't be mistaken, there is nothing ordinary about a movie that gives us full bodied characters with enough emotional baggage to draw the attention of many in the audience. Here cleaning up the blood after a horrible crime is full of pathos, not just a quick way to arise audience's sympathy. The blood is a reminder of the action, the cleansing process, the loss of life, the psychological tensions that are part of that character's own make up. At this moment, revelations are surging forward, transforming him in front of our eyes. He's baring his soul and stripping his body, but the blood remains, and he continues to evolve within the new phase of his life.The film is an intimate epic, never really giving us loud scenes, special effects that overwhelm and substitute for non existing scripts. When things explode, it is because there is no other way out, something must burst, die, or change. Change of some fashion is taking place, and it's all the result of a series of events that can't be stopped. Most interesting is the fact that every move here is calculated, even with the inclusion of the dreams that might contribute to the main character's development.This film deserves more than its share of awards and more than one viewing to do it justice. It highlights the introduction of a magnificent performer to the silver screen, one who can communicate more than a few emotions with a quick look and a small gesture. Hopefully it will overcome the recent slight at the Academy Awards and garner a bunch of nominations in next year's awards, as it is a much better example of what truly original and remarkable craftsmanship is.</fullReview>

If you appreciate cinema that is masterful, subtle and brutal then The Prophet is the film for you. The film maker is at the top of his craft in every way. The story evolved into a riveting tale of survival, discovery and triumph. That you can say that about the creation of a powerful criminal mastermind is all the more magnificent. It is a story as much about self discovery as it is about self creation. From the claustrophobic sensation created by the cinematography that shows you a world you've probably never seen to the performances that never lose their humanity this is an important film. If there were flaws I missed them. For over two hours I was immersed in a story that is masterfully told. I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

With a generous 2 hour running time it still catches you from the 1st till the last minute and never lets you look away. This French Slumdog millionaire portraits life in prison realistic and raw without making life in crime equal stardom or a walk in the park. The flashes of the psyche of the somewhat mysterious Malik are intriguing and complement the harsh reality of indifferent justice systems, dirty prisons and dog eat dog mentality. Excellent performance by everyone but Tahar Rahim as Malik is no less than magnificent. Even if the story line, not a simple action flick, is not your thing than watch it still. You'd be missing out on a classic if you don't. Brilliant!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great non-stop action plot compensates for auteur director's questionable moral stance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'A Prophet introduces us to its 19 year old protagonist, Malik, a secular Muslim, who has been just sentenced to six years confinement in what appears to be a maximum security French prison. It's unclear what he's in for but when he first arrives, Malik is practically illiterate. What's more, he doesn't fit in with the French-Corsican types who appear to 'run' the prison. The French-Arabs also hate Malik, as they regard him as a traitor, since he seemingly has been consorting with the Corsicans.The fraternizing, however, is unintentional. The Corsicans, run by Mafia boss Cesar Luciani (brilliantly played by Niels Arestrup) threaten to make mince-meat out of Malik if he doesn't murder a recent admitted prisoner, Reyeb, a fellow Arab, who is now awaiting trial. Reyeb invites Malik into his cell for some sex but appears to be quite literate and sensitive. Malik has no choice but to conceal a razor in his mouth and use it to do Reyeb in, by cutting his carotid artery. Once Malik does the dirty deed, Cesar declares that he's now under the 'protection' of the Corsicans inside the prison. Malik eventually becomes Cesar's right hand man, earning the coveted job as 'porter', getting all kinds of perks including a very expensive stereo system as well as visits by a prostitute. At a certain point, a good number of Cesar's buddies are transferred out of the prison, which reduces Cesar's overall influence. Cesar comes to depend on Malik more and more but always reminds him that he's still a 'dirty Arab'.Eventually, one of Malik's Muslim buddies, Ryad, helps him how to read. Now more educated, and with new found confidence, Malik is ready to take on more responsibility as Cesar's enforcer. By bribing various officials on the outside, Cesar arranges for Malik to receive one day parole passes. Director Jacques Audiard throws in the kitchen sink as we follow Malik on the 'outside'. Malik's first job for Cesar is to pay a ransom to a bunch of thugs who have kidnapped one of his crew. Malik successfully gets Cesar's man back and is soon ready for his second assignment.But before he does Cesar's bidding a second time, Malik joins forces with Ryad (now paroled), while he's out on his one day parole pass; they become partners in a lucrative hashish smuggling operation. The operation is soon threatened by a criminal named 'The Egyptian' who kidnaps Ryad and threatens to destroy Malik's whole operation. Malik turns the tables on The Egyptian when he discovers through contacts with the Muslim Brotherhood that The Egyptian's brother is locked up in the same prison. They beat him up and learn where The Egyptian's mother is living. Malik's friends go to the mother's house, tie her up and take a picture of her using a cellphone. That picture is sent to The Egyptian who backs off.Suffice it to say but the plot of 'A Prophet' becomes even more complicated as we head toward the climax. Cesar has two more 'assignments' for Malik. During assignment #2, Malik takes his first jet flight to Marseilles where he meets with a Muslim crime boss who Cesar wants to negotiate a truce with. The crime boss ends up brokering a truce between Malik and The Egyptian, at Malik's behest. Assignment #3 involves Cesar's decision to order the assassination of his own boss with Malik as the assassin. After following a bullet-proof limousine with the intended targets inside, Malik manages to get inside the vehicle and shoot the crime boss's bodyguards. He then drags the boss to his own van and ties him up in the back. But instead of killing him, he explains that it was Cesar who ordered the hit. One of Cesar's associates is left tied up in the back of the van, soon to be murdered by the boss. Malik cleverly returns late on his one day parole and is locked up for forty days and forty nights in 'the hole'. By the time he's let out, Cesar has no associates left in the prison to back him up. Cesar gestures for Malik to join him, but Malik ignores Cesar while standing with his new found Muslim friends in 'the yard'. Malik won't stick up for his former boss as he has endured too many humiliations from him. When Cesar tries to walk over to Malik, a Muslim inmates comes up and punches Cesar in the stomach. A shell of his former self, he doubles over and is left writhing in pain outside on the concrete floor.If you forgive the rather implausible ending where Malik miraculously ends up kidnapping a major Mafia kingpin and then lets him go, A Prophet must earn praises for its attention to detail and highly entertaining plot. It's the type of film that holds your interest to the very end.A few criticisms are still in order. First off, the Muslims come off looking much too good in this film. The Corsicans are the bad guys and the Muslims are depicted as being way too 'sensitive' (remember how Malik engineers the prison shakedown, even though the warden points out that the Muslims inside the prison are quite well-behaved?). Aren't there any bad apples? There's also lots more sympathy for the other Muslim characters--poor Ryad is dying of cancer and Reyeb, with his book smarts, is no ordinary thug. Furthermore, instead of killing Cesar at the end, the Muslim inmate merely punches him in the stomach?instead of knifing him to death (which would have been much more realistic). Despite Malik's violent conduct throughout the film, none of it is to be condemned, since he was the victim of the Corsicans from the beginning. Director Audiard terms 'Un Prophete', the "anti-Scarface"--and that is correct; in the sense that while Pacino's Scarface and Audiard's Malik are both charming, Scarface gets his just rewards while Malik's questionable conduct, remains unpunished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well deserved Oscar nomination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally a film that includes graphic shots of a man getting his throat cut in the first half hour would have a hard time getting more than a 0 rating from me. But this one is different. Tahar Rahim plays Malik El Djebena, a na?ve 19 year old French (probably French/Algerian) guy who ends up in a tough French jail for assaulting a policeman. We don't get to find out much about what brought him to this point, although there are hints that he didn't get the best start in life. We do get to see how prison changes him. With echoes of 'Papillion' and 'Midnight Express', he finds himself in a prison world divided into two camps - the Corsicans and the Arabs. The Corsicans hate the Arabs, and the Arabs hate the French. Malik is hated by the Arabs for being French and hated by the Corsicans for being Arab. That is, until the Corsicans find a use for him.Un Proph?te is one of five films nominated for Best Foreign Film in the 2010 Oscars, and there are many aspects that makes this film deserving of the nomination. First, it is many different stories-within-a-story - and each one works. It is a political commentary on the relationship between Corsica and the French mainland, and on the tension between Arab and Corsican populations in France. It is also a story of friendship, loyalty, and conscience. And at the heart of it all, it is the personal journey of Malik, who evolves from an innocent boy into a street-wise man. Second, Un Proph?te does a great job of describing moral complexity. Jail is supposed to rehabilitate offenders, but Malik commits far worse crimes in jail than out. He learns to read and write, but he also learns the drug trade. He enters prison with a single note, and leaves a relatively rich man. He begins the film as an isolated outsider, but leaves with friends and a family of sorts. There is a third, interesting thread running through it which explores how someone who doesn't fully fit into any part of society can make this work to their advantage. Finally, all of the acting is excellent. The unknown Tahar Rahim is totally convincing as Malik evolves from na?ve inmate to master criminal. Niels Arestrup (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) is completely believable as the Corsican mafia boss. It's almost unfair to single them out because the supporting cast is also excellent.Despite the violence I would give this film a 10. What brings it down to a nine is that I lost the plot part way through (Godfather style, there were too many characters being played off against each other for my brain to cope with) and perhaps the supernatural element that gives the film its name, but didn't really seem to go anywhere.I haven't seen any of director Jacques Audiard's other material (most recently De battre mon coeur s'est arr?té (2005) and Sur mes l?vres (2001)) but I'll be looking out for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know it's not the first film I have seen in 2010 but Un proph?te really does set the precedence for the year. I very much doubt there will be a better film than this released any time soon. The film straddled the genre line perfectly and included enough elements for it to be unmistakably part of the relatively niche prison film genre or the much more commonly recognised gangster film genre, yet at the same time it flaunted certain elements in order to really make a point. This is the whole point of genre being formed and the reason that genre in cinema is so important. Not so that lazy writers and directors can churn out 'sure fire' predictable hits but so that geniuses and directorial wizards like Jaques Aidiard can subvert certain mythologies in a recognisable and engaging format. It was from Steve Neale that I learned the importance of this repetition and variation. This film could well have been used to prove his point as to why the variation from certain expectations can be so impactful and carry so much weight and significance. see www.destroy-apathy.blogspot.com for a full and in depth analysis</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hard work but hugely satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not familiar with director Jacques Audiard's work. What I know though is that he is a very skilled operator indeed as this gripping French thriller demonstrates. Nominated for the Oscar for Best Movie in a Foreign Language it would appear it's in a straight shoot out with Michael Haneke's, The White Ribbon.Both movies are terrific and both deal with the evil in man in very different ways. In The White Ribbon it's all about the gestation of fascism in a typically (for Haneke) underplayed, subtle and metaphorical way.Here, Audiard goes straight for the jugular (and for those that have seen the movie they will know that this comment is pretty literal).A Prophet (to give it its English moniker) is as graphic a prison drama as you'll see. It focuses mainly on the relationship between a misfitting North African Muslim boy who is flung into an unnamed French jail for murdering a copper and an aging Corsican mafia leader (played convincingly by Neils Arestrup - whom British viewers could easily mistake for celebrity chef Anthony Worral Thompson) As the movie develops, the young Muslim, Malik (played with convincing menace by Tahar Rahim), becomes an increasingly trusted aide of the old master. But the relationship is built on hatred and bitter distrust.Malik, gradually gains the upper hand as he increasingly frequently gains passes out into the free world to carry out a variety of unsavoury tasks for gangland boss Arestrup, whilst fitting in a bit of empire building himself.The movie is visceral, at times shockingly so, but never short of engaging and we build a close bond with Malik as his story unfolds.An interesting device in the movie is to include a series of ghostlike appearances of one of Malik's early 'victims'; the ghost giving Malik premonitions that contribute to his ultimate nomenclature as "The Prophet." So. Who will prevail? The Cannes Grand Prix winning A Prophet or the more cerebral and understated White Ribbon? Well, my vote goes to Michael Haneke because, despite both movies being truly excellent, Haneke's style edges it for me.A great category in a relatively weak Oscars year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An epic, modern jail drama A Prophet cannot be called operatic as it's simply too real. Cold, bloody and filthy the design and photography (predominantly hand-held) make Steve McQueen's Maze prison look like a boudoir. Yet the power-struggle and ambition of the individuals, factions and, of course, the remarkable central opportunist Malik El Djebena are well-plotted in a rat-eat-rat arc consistent from beginning to end.This film has one of the nastiest opening 25 minutes of any I've sat through. Tahar Rahim's performance as Malik deserves its accolades on the back of this alone, a performance shivering with the fear of loneliness and pain. Both Rahim and Audiard are to be commended on a murderous sequence of unutterable horribleness that, nonetheless, demands to be watched.Alas, this is the character of the film though, a seamlessly tailored procession of chapters in which Malik claws his way through the sewer- like outlaw's system in pursuit of... well, my exhilaration at the close of the film was comprehensively tarred with conferred immorality.

		<fullReview>A Prophet has hit the world of cinema with massive critical acclaim, winning the Cannes Grand Prix and the London Festival, and the favourite to win the Oscar for best Foreign Language film (though the Acamedy have gotten that award wrong many times before).Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim), is a 19-year-old man sent to prison for six years. He tries to keep his head down. But he is forced into the murky world of prison crime when Ceser and the Unione Corse (Corsican mafia) tell him to kill an follow Arab prisoner, and if Malik doesn't they would kill him. The Corsicans control the guards, so Malik has no place to run. After the brutal murder the Corsicans protect Malik, but he stuck in the middle, because the Arabs and Muslims see Malik as a traitor whilst the Corsican treat him as a lower class citizen. Malik's only hope is his friendship with Ryad (Adel Bencherif), who gets Malik to go prison classes and improve his education. The government introduce a new policy to repatriate Corsican prisoners. This forces Ceser and Malik closer together. Ceser helps Malik to get day release, but makes the young man to perform his dirty work on the outside. But is also given the chance to form his own crime empire.A Prophet has a mix of social realism, a trait of British cinema, with reminders of the great HBO show Oz, and has arty, surreal moments more common with French cinema. The director Jacques Audiard effectively mixes these elements and makes a fine film. People have looked for politically meanings within the film, seeing it as a commentary of the treatment of Muslims with French society. There are those ideas where Muslims are seen as lower class citizens by some elements of French society. But the film reminded me of American prison films and television programme, show prison live is very brutal and the inmates group together around racial and religious lines. The film also tackles the fine line between a criminal's attempts to reform and the pull towards darker or more organised crimes. The film shows the element of guilt within Malik's mind and how he is forced to work with the Corsicans. The film also takes great care to show someone could run a crime empire whilst still in prison, an interesting element in my opinion.The film has some good acting throughout. There are a wide range of complex characters, with complex issues, which are well handled by the actors and by Audiard. Audiard also show a very violence, brutal world of what prison and the underworld is like.Audiard uses a slow burning type of storytelling, which is effective for the most part. But some elements felt like they went on too long, which is never a good thing.Still, a worthy watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...this is a great film. I am not speaking of the political message, the psycho-social-religious message - I'm talking about fictional characters and the development of a fictional story on screen. This is one of the most riveting, gritty, heart-wrenching movies I've seen in some time. I am an American black female, born in the country, raised in New England, Libertarian by design, and a business owner. This is my demographic - and I loved this film. I read a review here which rates the movie 1 star, and berates it for dishonesty and glorifying the criminal/racial element in prisons. I don't claim to know the politics involved with the film. I do know for 1 hour and 50 minutes I was thoroughly entertained. I gawked, cringed, laughed, and cried (scene where Malik sits on the beach and one with him in a plane looking out the window). The film did this, and for that and the quality of it's acting/directing, I give it 10/10 (a rating I have given twice before).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be renamed 'A Weasel'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to start this review by saying something positive. The positives are important but there are only two.Firstly, the casting director has cast the most authentic-looking actors in France. It's hard to believe that the actors in this film are not real prisoners doing hard time. Every fresh scene has an even uglier inmate than the last. If someone can be breathtaking in their ugliness, this lot manage it. That in itself is extraordinary. The casting director deserves an Oscar.Another positive is this film is beautifully crafted. The cinematography is original and stunning and could rival Polanski for skill. But like many artistic films, the story does not equal the artistry. You need both for a truly special film.For those of you who thought that the title tells a story of a man who is up against insurmountable odds but then somehow overcomes them and emerges into the light, you will be very disappointed. The film should be called 'A Weasel' because that is all the protagonist is. Fresh and youthful at the outset, the imagination goes into overdrive. What qualities does this man have? He will have to have cunning and guile to survive the prison system but there's got to be something else. I wanted to believe in this man. I wanted to like him, admire him, find anything redeemable about him. I was a naive fool.It wasn't long before I realised that this man with all the potential of youth is as duplicitous and evil as the criminal underworld mafia boss who "adopts" him. He gels far too easily with the monsters he's surrounded by and becomes one of them. At first you think he's pretending but this is no pretence. Soon he's consumed by corruption. Even his smile becomes twisted. Hope over. Game over. My interest just flew out the door. A few hours in Pentonville would have been less depressing.This is a grim slice of prison life. No more no less. The person who put the title to the film should be tried. I feel cheated. It's either that or I am hopelessly naive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary performance in an ordinary gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't like gangster and prison movies as a genre, and the only thing that sets this movie apart from other such movies is Tahar Rahim's fantastic performance. Just discovering him made this movie definitely worth watching. Otherwise, it's not a particularly great or even interesting movie.Unlike The Godfather, for example, this movie does not transcend its genre and become deeply rewarding far beyond a gangster movie. I loved Godfather despite its being a gangster movie, but A Prophet doesn't rise above its material.Also (and this may seem petty, but it's my review so I can write whatever I want to), there's a really annoying song about midway through by some singer doing a Bob Dylan imitation. An early reviewer here thought it WAS Dylan and praised the movie for using his song, but that person must never have heard the real thing. Maybe to French ears it sounds like Dylan, and the singer obviously is trying really hard to pull it off, but it just made me extremely angry.It's not even a copycat singer singing a Dylan song - it's a fake Dylan singing a song he made up to sound like a Dylan song. How dare he? and how dare they give him an international venue for his plagiarism? If they want a Dylan song, dig up the cash and use a real one, not a cheap fake. I'm still angry about that.So I recommend this movie ONLY for Rahim's fantastic performance. I'm going to watch whatever other movies with him are available and hope they have something to offer in addition to him, because great acting in mediocre movies only goes so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All's been told about the storyline, so I'll cut right to the chase: This is a well filmed movie, great actors and such, but I see nothing new here. Yeah, there's some little bonusses like this guy can talk any language, and he's a bit of a loser at first, and he's not your regular main character; but it's not really things that are integrated into the storyline as a part of something bigger that would make this an interesting persona and /or story, let alone a revolutionary film.You have these stills with text, like in Lock Stock &amp; 2 smoking barrels and many other movies, something which has been (re)done endlessly by local amateur filmmakers in every corner of the planet. You have the guy Reyed whom he killed who keeps showing up. Been done before, too.Basically (I'm not a good writer): I have seen all of the ingredients in other movies before. It's just the music and some other elements that want to give it an 'instant classic' or filmhouse look.I have nothing against french films. Not even against this movie, cause (again) it's not a bad movie at all. It's just not 'that good' that it's proclaimed to be.</fullReview>

A good prison film - A rags to riches film; it has you rooting for the main character, El Djebena (i think i've spelt his name right) from the start The film deserves the award it has won, (most notably 9 Cesar awards and Grand prize at Cannes), if you can watch it without feeling moved then prison films are not for you. People have told me that it does not compare to prison serials such as 'Oz', again, I would say that for the current time this is one of the best I have seen and i would definitely recommend this to anyone reading this review and also to have a look at 'Mesrine', another great french film. In conclusion, the film has made me come back for repeat performances and if thats not good evidence of a superb film, then i don't know what is. Simply put, you must see this!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting but Without Emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film interesting in its depiction of the improbably rise of a young prison inmate from scared and abused newbie to some sort of crime boss. But the film lacks heart. The main character, whose ability to maneuver between the prison's various ethnic factions is the key to his survival and eventual ascendancy to crime-lordship, is an enigma to his prison cohorts and remains a sphinx to the audience as well. We never really get to know anything about the main character and there's never an opportunity to feel any real sympathy for the youngster as he quickly moves from pawn to willing conspirator in a host of violent crimes. Overall, an interesting depiction of prison life but without much emotional impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding acting but shabby story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film of its reputation, the underlying story is surprisingly weak and unconvincing. It is easy to fall victim of the smoke screen of acting (which IS outstanding), suspense, violence (albeit very little in the schema of things), and a sense of expectation, but look beyond you'll find very little substance. The film spends a disproportionately long time on the boy's first job, which didn't seem to have much effect on him apart from the ghost who is more fatherly than haunting. The boy's ethnic and ethic standpoint has been close to none which largely weakens the effect of the twist at the end. The "tasks" assigned to him do not require any special quality to warrant his rising to the power. His leadership is also questionable - it's more assumed than demonstrated. The only one reference to the "prophet" is abrupt and meaningless, and it makes the film title (and the film) confusing. Moreover, supporting characters are of minimal weight - none is memorable or likable. The film does have many merits: the casting, the acting (wow!), the camera work, the mood building, etc. It also has very nice touches such as the entire airplane trip, and the conversation with the imaginary ghost. But fundamentally it's a shabby story with a pretentious ending that's more wishful than truthful. This is definitely no Scarface.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean, I guess this is a better film than I'm giving it credit for. Also, it's not American, so I can't fault it for following every other film of its ilk here. Still, the plot and characters never really rise above being sort of archetypes, and the lead character, although decently played by Tahar Rahim, just isn't very interesting. His arc isn't terribly unrealistic, but it also doesn't go places we haven't seen before, and taken as it is, not terribly effective. However, there are some good things in the film, and despite the weak script, the directing really does do its best to make this rise up. Yeah. not very recommended on my part.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably too lengthy for its own good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this, I fell asleep at least twice so the next day after seeing other reviews on another site then decided to give it another shot. And this time, I also resolved to pay close attention lest I miss out on anything from the first viewing.I will say first and foremost that the casting is excellent so that the actors chosen are very believable in the roles. In addition the acting itself is quite good and I was pleasantly surprised to see this from actors I was completely unfamiliar with. But having said that, I feel that the rather lengthy production made it sometimes hard to maintain my attention which made it boring in parts aside from being a bit hard to follow with the multilingual subtitles adding insult to injury for this.Another reviewer wrote quite appropriately that in the entire film there's only ONE reference to the lead guy being a "prophet", this following the scene where this car he's in collides with a deer. I would add that there's not any gratuitous violence in the film even with this one horrific murder scene early on.</fullReview>

There's a gratuitously graphic scene involving an attack with a razor blade. It's an attempt by the director to show gritty realism, but realism does not a good film make. The film lacks a compelling narrative flow and doesn't know when to stop. Although well acted, the characters are clichés and there isn't a single one who is likable, not even the protagonist. There's a mob boss who essentially runs the prison, but it's not clear why he can't get himself released despite all the power he wields.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible spoilers with regard to ending: More of an ordeal than a revelatory film experience at 2 and ? hours, the story's scant true emotion comes at the beginning in the sense of vicarious dread we face with the hero. While never boring, a significant accomplishment at this length and testament to the story's tension and good acting, the film lacks any real insight. What we get instead is an interesting, often exciting chronicle of the creation of an accomplished criminal. The world of the prison is fascinatingly dangerous and crude, and refreshingly different from the human warehouses exposed in US films. (Prisoners in France often use "sir" when addressing guards.) But when our sentence of two plus hours is done, all we have is the perfection of a criminal, the cold product of what is often a strong, heated story.</fullReview>

The Arab boy goes to a French prison, there this Corsican gang rules. He is forced to do things for them. Dreadful things. He's a chameleon, who takes all his colors from the surroundings and will do that for the rest of his life. Also when he tries to be independent.But you can't really say that this is told in a new way. It could have been more interesting if Muslim culture would have been put in collision with an environment outside civilisation. This film doesn't really take that chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It must be. The movie met the highest ratings at the Cesar awards. Nothing less than best actor, best cinematography, best director, best editing, best film, best production design, best supporting actor, best writing and best promising actor. So I must confess: I understand nothing of movies. What I saw here was a young immigrated crook integrating far better in a prison environment than in real life. I suppose that there is a message behind all of this? Let me try. French prisons are abounding in Arab-Muslims-Corsican-African prisoners? When you learn to speak Corsican, obey Corsican orders and kill who you are asked to, you become member of the club? French prisons wardens are corrupted by the power of some inmates? The French judicial system is so weak that it does not even check what inmates really do when on temporary leave? Nobody speaks any decent French anymore (I saw the movie in its original French version)? And finally, the measure of success for a young immigrated crook is to get out of prison, be greeted by your sister in law, by now a widow, soon to become your future wife, and be followed by a bunch of expensive cars, crammed full with other successful immigrates. This richness probably impressed all the movies Experts. I told you I understand nothing of movies, although I very much liked Le Mari de la Coiffeuse, Leon, Quai des Orfevres, Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amelie Poulain, Le Grand Bleu, Le Pacte des Loups, Le Salaire de la Peur, Le Cinquieme Element, Les Diaboliques (should I continue?).</fullReview>

And the ludicrous plot of his journey and rise quite unbelievable. and is it long, it just goes on and on with nothing to say and saying that very badly.avoid at all costs</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Prophet?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please, how can this movie have so may good reviews??? Is someone deleting the bad reviews and the insults? Because the movie is, in parts, really insulting.It's not that it is bad? sometimes it is quite good, and the acting is truly great, in particular the actor who plays Lucciano ? the incarcerated mafia Don - who is terrific.But the story is a little bit stupid, and the filming is, many times, so incredibly boring that you don't want to believe it!Fortunately I have seen this at home, and so could fast forward the most boring bits (and bytes), where the characters would just drag along, pointlessly, looking at some empty space beyond their eyes. In this particular aspect, this is a very French movie: the Frenchmen seem to appraise directors who drift pointlessly as if it that is some kind of artistic statement. Why? You can only guess.Perhaps it has something to do with the effects of the French accent on males.However, what really ruins the movie is its artistic presumption: the "Prophet" attribute of its main character. This is beyond ridiculous, and really really embarrassing!I'll try to explain: this guy, the main character, kills another guy in the beginning of the movie. Then, the dead guy starts to appear to him, not in a frightening way, quite the opposite. He becomes a kind of a boring pall, pseudo intellectual, hanging around, sometimes with flames burning his clothes or his skin (one guesses that the he must live in hell the rest of the time), expressing insipid and pointless reflections that don't add anything to the story, sleeping with the main character (I think that they even get to make love, one night, but perhaps it was just one vision? you don't really get to understand). And then, one day, this dead buddy explains to the main character what will be the actions of the prisoners who walk around in the yard ("look, that guy is going to turn around and run, look, that guy is going to stop and do push-ups, Ah! look that guy is going to put that ball through the basket!"), and he guesses correctly all the time. Really impressing, as you may guess...Then... another day, the main character is out on a mission for the mafia ? as he sometimes is - and gets his ass saved at the very last moment because he impresses another gangster - who is about to shoot him ? by predicting that a dear is about to cross in the car's way, provoking an accident. There! The accident occurs, fortunately, no one gets hurt, and the gangster gets really impressed and calls him a prophet ("What are you, some kind of prophet?"). That's it! That's why the movie is called "The Prophet". But that hasn't got anything to do with the story.Well, never mind,... it's FRENCH ART!</fullReview>

The french need to tighten up their prison system though, if this is at all realistic. The main character is let out on a regular basis to pursue his life of crime. Why on earth anyone is interested in how the dregs of society live their life is beyond me. There appear to be no redeeming features about any of the characters. The french do seem to like fantasising about prison life though. Remember Papillon? I rented this film because it had a high rating and had won an award at Cannes. What a waste of time.

		<shortDescription>A critic's hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been massively over-rated. Of course it has good performances, and mis-en-scene - it should do with the talent on hand. But at the end of the day this a nasty film about very nasty people which plays on every prison movie cliché. Disguising its true rationale - revenge, violence and the criminal world are sure fire recipes for commercial success - it is misogynist, homophobic, and yes, yes, yes, sympathetic to racism and the branding of political and religious stereotypes. We are invited to sympathise with a man who murders within minutes of his appearance. We are invited to enjoy his antagonist's subtle brutality (the end sequence is used to justify this by inviting sympathy for him too in his fresh isolation at the expense of some very unpleasant fundamentalist Muslims), and we are asked to enjoy the interplay of Roman Catholic pseudo religiosity, and Islam in equal measures. The film is offencive to both religions and its duplicitous political prejudices re-enforce the reasons to severely mistrust its manipulative dramatic tensions. The up market critics have as usual behaved like sheep and praised this film out of all proportion - sadly few of them have taken the trouble to really think about it. To complement its status at Cannes in 2009,the BFI/London Film festival jury have been conned by the pre, during and post Cannes hype by giving it a Best Film Award (in the same year as The White Ribbon, Precious and a host of other great movies shown at the LFF) - embarrassing and typical of the British film hierarchy: they have succumbed to its technical wizardry and its visceral impact. The same attitudes which have given The Bourne movies their dubious critical status. The film has some great performances but like all great propaganda, and films with dubious messages, they are serving the premise and have been used cleverly to re-enforce it. I felt dirty and disgusted with myself after seeing this horrible film. My guess is that director will scoff, the critics huff and puff, and those who like violent criminals to be the vehicle for their weak philosophising will dismiss my comments as 'agenda led' or 'misguided' or 'blind' to the films qualities. I would refer them to far greater examples of the genre (criminals and prisons) which deal with human issues with honesty and with a highly thought through political and sociological perspective (and I use only a few of the more recent examples - I leave alone the great prison movies, and movies which deal with incarcerated criminals which came from the 1930's and 1940's. This is a list in no order: The Shawshank Redemption; The Birdman of Alcatraz; Brubaker; Scum; Scrubbers; L'Argent; Daybreak (a recent Iranian film); Hunger; Dead Man Walking; and then almost all of Melville's films; Papillon; Cool Hand Luke.... Un Prophete is a dishonest film which is disguised as such because it is so obviously well made. That puts it into the category of surely one of the worst (and equally dishonest) prison movies of all time - Midnight Express and that had similar critical praise and attention.</fullReview>
