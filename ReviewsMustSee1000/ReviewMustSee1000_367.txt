		<shortDescription>My all time favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The City of Lost Children is my all time favorite movie. It is unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced before. It's a movie that I hold dear to my heart and will never forget. I have to be honest though, the first time I saw this movie, I really didn't like it at all. The story was too confusing, and the characters were extremely weird and twisted. After watching it a second and third time, however, I understood what was going on more, and could spend more time looking at the visuals rather than the subtitles. Speaking of visuals, this movie has it in spades. The environment that Jean-Pierre Jeunet created is out of this world. The city is very dark and the water looks as if there are secrets hidden within. The mood the soundtrack sets is perfect for the scenery and the superb acting by everybody (including the kids) just adds to the greatness of this flick. I highly recommend this movie, it's one of those movies that you will never forget watching, and the images will stay in your head for a very long time. A beautiful, beautiful, movie. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written for English class my freshman year in high school.Lights! Camera! Action! What makes a good movie? Better yet, what makes a great movie? In my opinion, a great movie should include almost flawless acting, a finely woven and gripping plot, music that is both beautiful and suitable, and great direction. Of course, mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films. So, for all the reasons above, I consider "The City Of Lost Children" the best film of 1996.The plot of "The City Of Lost Children" is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places. It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called "The City Of Lost Children" (hence the title). One(that is his name) is a slow-minded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops. One's little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen. The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him. Because of this curse, his wife is a midget, he cannot dream, and he has seven identical sons (all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder). In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters. These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them. One small, but tough, girl named Miette runs away from the school, finds One, and aides him in his search. When the two women find out about their little thief, they go to Marcello, a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow, to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend. Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow, it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results. To accompany this odd story, there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song ("Who Will Take Your Dreams Away") by Marianne Faithful. This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with you(as does the movie itself) long after the credits have rolled.The casting director of "The City Of Lost Children", Pierre-Jacques Benochou, sure knew what he was doing, because there is not one poor (or mediocre one, for that matter) performance in the whole film. In fact, I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless. Ron Perlman's performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted. Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film. Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable. Dominique Pinon is wonderful (perhaps the best actor in the whole movie) as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers (yes, he does play all of them, and with fantastic results, too). The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins, Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable. Last, but not least, the children, with Judith Vittet as Miette in a stand-out performance, all carry out their roles with smashing results.Another reason for me choosing "The City Of Lost Children" as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction. This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro(a.k.a. "Jeunet and Caro"). The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish. The directors of this film are, in my opinion, masters of the camera. The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996. Whatever it might have been, whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects, I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen. What I particularly liked about this film's special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and in-your-face computer special effects that some of today's blockbusters and other genre films seem to have. I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie. On the contrary, the special effects of "The City Of Lost Children," however, are very subtle. A final thing I liked about this film were its sets. From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank's laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.Was the plot great? Yes. How was the acting? Outstanding. Was the direction done well? Definitely. How did the visuals appear? They were beautifully presented. From what you have read, whether you have concluded to avoid this movie completely or go out and rent it right away (I do understand that this movie does have a select audience), I am hopeful that you understand the picture I am trying to paint. Even if the story will not appeal to you, it is still splendidly done. Overall, though, "The City Of Lost Children" is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of fantasy films. It's a mixed bag of a genre on all truth. Very rarely are there any great fantasy films. There are good ones or average ones that can merely get by on their looks. I do love the fact that fantasy films can paint such vivid and imaginative picturesque settings. As an example look at Legend. That was one of the best looking films ever made but the content of the film was not great. It was poorly scripted with hokey dialogue and a storyline aimed at 5 year olds, with creatures and effects that would scare the pants off younger children. Now you look at the best ones and the rare ones that can be called classics with greats of other genres like Lord Of The Rings and in a more Sci-fi orientation, Star Wars. City Of The Lost C children is a French fantasy aimed at a more mature audience member, from 15 up really. It looks fantastic. The sets, the costumes, the effects, the cinematography turn this 15 million dollar film into something looking far more epic and majestic in scope. Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro take joint plaudits and credit as directors, Jeunut more responsible visually and Caro for the character and story. This is endlessly imaginative and immensely enjoyable and is very quirky.The story centres around a mad scientist, Krank, who is unable to dream, because of this he is aging quickly and is old beyond his year. He grows insane and has developed a technique to view and capture children's dreams so he can thereby inject them into his own mind. He kidnaps children from the nearby village and brings them to his lair, a king of oilrig in the middle of surrounding sea. He is aided by his brothers who are four identical clones of each other, unfortunately they all suffer from narcolepsy. Krank himself is a clone. His father who created them is now merely a brain in a tank and Krank was an unfortunate mistake who doesn't dream. The only clone who was right is an enigma called the original who has long since escaped the insanity of this evil lair only to be living underwater and a kind of insane junk collector. One day strong man, One, and his little brother are ambushed by Krank's men and One's little brother is kidnapped. Thus far Krank's captives have proved unsuccessful in his quest for a cure, because they all suffer terrible nightmares, partly due to his own nastiness. All this latest young victim responds to is food, he seems to have no fear and it seems he could be the one, just as long as Krank keeps feeding him. One sets out on a quest to find his brother meeting Miete, a young a troublesome orphan girl in the process. It's all good fun this film and while the story is simplistic it's a kind of delightfully Grimm fairytale sort of story that keeps your interest.The cast are great. Ron Perlman is one of those cult actors who everyone seems to like and he has hit it big with the recent success Hellboy. He is a strong presence and unlike many musclemen of his stature he can act, something which has held him back somewhat because people have never really cast him as a leading action man, although in truth he's not blessed with good looks. The interestingly named Rufus, a Juenet stalwart is also very good as the clones, while Daniel Emilfork is excellent as Crank. Also good and a charming innocence is Judith Vittet as Miette. Anyone who loves a visually stunning movie should watch this film it looks amazing. The sets, the impressionistic and exaggerated designs are brilliant. It is typically French in it's verve. This is a fantasy fans wet dream, believe me! ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The City of Lost Children gets two platinum stars and also moves up to one of my top ten favorite films of all time. This is a confusing story, from beginning to end it expands your mind, reaches into your nightmares, and creates a story that is part Dark City and part of a novel called "The Golden Compass" by Phillip Pullman. Yes, this film was everything and more. Not only visually beautiful, but the creative and symbolic meaning of the actions and words of the characters are "jaw dropping". Also, there are so many sub-stories in this film that reminded me of the style that Run Lola Run was done. This is the style that due to a connection of unrelated events something extraordinary happens. Let me give you an example from this film: There is a scene where the girl and One (Ron Pearlman-also a very biblical name) are trying to escape from the two women who want their jewels. There are events that lead from a dog finding its female companion to a boat almost hitting/splitting the women in half. Wild coincidences...imagine this times ten, and you have this film.Keep in mind this is a French film with English subtitles, so you are not only getting the true voice of the film, but seeing the darkness of the cinematography without any American input. This really shows the purpose behind making this film, it really takes you to a new place so dark and dreamlike that you the viewer actually feel like you are in the picture itself. A movie about dreams and nightmares that takes place in a world of dreams and nightmares. Overall, a heavily religious and symbolic film, The City of Lost Children should be put at the top of your foreign film list. Put it in your DVD player, open your mind, and be ready for a wild and intense ride!!Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't help myself: I adore this film. I freely accept that it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea; if pushed, I might even accept that it's not perfect. But there's no film I love more, or more enjoy re-watching. One caveat though: I've seen both the subtitled and the dubbed print, and the English dubbing frankly comes close to ruining the movie. Ron Perlman dubs himself and is fine, and some of the other adult English actors are perfectly OK, though they tend to be blander than the French originals. But most of the children are terrible, and with her own voice it's Judith Vittet's extraordinary performance (all the more extraordinary considering she was nine at the time) that helps give "La Cité" the genuine emotional centre that some viewers don't feel it has.But I'll come back to that. In any version, at least Jeunet and Caro's astonishing visual flair and artistry come over. I can't think of a film that has such a concentration of memorable shots - time and again, especially watching on DVD with a freeze-frame facility, you realize how many beautiful compositions Jean-Pierre Jeunet gives us: though the cast of characters could easily fill a freak show, and the sets are dark and quite unglamorous in themselves, the cinematography is gorgeous and the mise-en-sc?ne often strangely elegant. It has a look all of its own, perfect for a modern, urban fairy-tale. The music too is gorgeous, one of the finest scores by David Lynch's regular musical collaborator, Angelo Badalamenti."Fairy tale" is I think the best generic starting-point for this film, so long as you think Grimm rather than Disney. (Unlike "Delicatessen", it isn't really a comedy, though it has comic elements). And the plot works according to its own logic, even if the progression from scene to scene is occasionally a bit lumpy or obscure. Krank (the astonishing Daniel Emilfork), grown prematurely old because he cannot dream, uses a cult of blind, messianic preachers to abduct children from a decaying industrial port and steal their dreams - but they have only nightmares, and Krank falls ever deeper into despair and evil. It's up to the orphan pickpocket Miette and a none-too-brainy circus strongman, One, to put a stop to him. This rich idea is elaborated with all sorts of visual conceits and eccentric characters - Jeunet mounts, for example, a couple of astonishing sequences in which chains of unlikely effects proceed from the smallest of causes - but never at the expense of the central relationship of One and Miette.In a sense Miette, like Krank, has grown old too fast: the orphaned street-children of this city are savvy and unsentimental, and never seem to have had a childhood; meanwhile there's something deeply childish, in various ways, about most of the adults. Sensitively directed and never overacting, Judith Vittet's Miette gradually thaws, and Ron Perlman brings a lot of sympathy and pathos to what could have been an oafish, cartoonish role: Jeunet gives plenty of space and subtlety to their gradually-developing friendship, and dares to do what I suspect no English director would dare to do at the moment, which is to make their relationship innocently sexualized. Neither of them is really a grown-up, but it's still an extremely risky move, exploring the first stirrings of pre-pubescent sexuality while trying not to be exploitative or prurient. I do think the film pulls it off, though I can imagine some viewers feeling distinctly uncomfortable with it. For me it's one of the most convincingly unsentimental and nuanced (if mannered) portrayals of childhood I've ever seen on the screen, and there is real compassion and tenderness along the way, as well as some darker twists and turns.It's a film that rewards analysis if you're prepared to surrender to its strange world with its strange rules. But it rewards the senses and the emotions too - and it radiates love of cinema as the perfect medium for sophisticated fantasy. One elderly actress who appears towards the end (Nane Germon) acted - as Jeunet's DVD commentary points out - in Jean Cocteau's "La Belle et la B?te" about fifty years earlier (there are, by the way, distinct references to the Beauty and the Beast story here), and "La Cité des enfants perdus" deserves to join that film as one of the classic cinematic fairy-tales. Pity about Marianne Faithfull over the closing credits, though!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's so bizarre that it's beautiful; it's so illogical that it's funny; it's so dark that it's so sweet. That's The City of the Lost Children. The plot it's that the evil -and weird- Krank (Daniel Emilfork) kidnap children to stole their dreams due to the lack of his ability of dream. Or at least he did it, until it came One (Ron Perlman), in the search of his adoptive little brother, aided by Miette (Judith Vittet), a street smart orphan child.In technical aspects it's a master piece. The decoration give a baroque sensation of always being in small places, yet it's a full city populated of bizarre characters as the story itself. The acting it's great. I'm quiet impressed for the flawless french that Ron Perlman show us, he's just simply astounding. I cannot say less of Judith Vittet, that being a child in that time she was a tremendous actress. The two have a good chemistry as a girl mature as an adult and a grow up man with the innocence of a kid.I can't say that this is a movie that everyone would like, because it's not. It have a little of nonsense that might be not of the like of all the public. And all the dark atmosphere might be a little suffocating. So, take the risk and watch it, and then decide: you love it, or you hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost City of Cinema-Gold!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The City of Lost Children" is unquestionably one of the most imaginative and exceptional films of the entire 90's decade and it pretty much represents an entire sub genre all by itself! It's a dark and often disturbing fairy-tale, but nevertheless magical and child-friendly. Since this is a film by Marc Caro &amp; Jean-Pierre Jeunet, you simply know to expect a unique and surreal story (remember "Delicatessen"?) filled with extravagant characters and bizarre dreamscapes! It's enchanting to observe and quite challenging to follow, as there's always some ingenious gimmick to distract your attention from the main plot. I got hooked on it right from the GENIUS opening sequence in which a child's dream about Santa Claus slowly turns into an eerie nightmare. The action then cuts to the "main" character; the evil Krank who's unable to dream himself and hence kidnaps orphans in order to steal their dreams. Krank has an army of semi-human androids, one brother cloned six times, an uncanny midget-mother AND a malicious brain in a fish tank! Ron Perlman is a good guy for once! He portrays a simple-minded yet friendly strongman, assisted in the search for his abducted little brother by a witty young girl. "The City of Lost Children" is an amazingly energetic and vivid adventure and no self-respecting cinema fanatic can afford him/herself to miss it! It's funny, frightening, emotional and intelligent all at once. The decors are mesmerizing, the music is dazzling and the special effects are staggering. I can keep on mentioning good aspects, but it all comes down to one thing: watch this film!!! It's still regretfully underrated and we urgently need to change that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As in Amelie and Delicatessen, Jeunet is interested in the complex connections between things, even as small as a flea. The film is not so much about a story as it is about illustrating how the characters got where they are, often with a fast- paced sequence of events like a Rube Goldberg device. Open up your eyes and mind to the world that is created here, leave behind expectations of how it should function or how the plot should advance. You will be richly rewarded. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, true enough, but the true beauty lies in the characters and their lives; the children that are too grown up, the hero who is more a child than they are, the imperfect creations of science, and the improbable leftovers of a circus freak show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M. Perlman parle francais aussi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City of Lost Children" is a beautifully-realized if derivative dark fantasy in which a mad scientist named Krank, aided by a half-dozen clones, a midget woman, and a brain in a tank, abducts children to his offshore lab so he can steal their dreams. Seems he's unable to have any of his own. A sideshow strongman, played by a radiantly fit Ron Perlman, goes in search of his little brother, who has been taken by Krank's goons. Perlman, in another of his growing gallery of bizarre roles, is a perfect example of why I like character actors better than big-name stars. And how many languages does he speak, anyway? French here, Spanish (and English, of course) in "Cronos"; polyglot in "The Name of the Rose"; what next?The strongman, named One, enlists the aid of Miette, a homeless, streetwise girl who, along with her fellow urchins, is part of a ring of thieves employed by a pair of sinister female Siamese twins named the Octopus. (Watch carefully how these evil twins smoke a cigarette. There are more weird characters per square inch in this flick than anywhere else outside a Heironymus Bosch painting.) Miette is played by Judith Villet, whose gonna-be-a-great-beauty looks, her air of intelligence and experience beyond her years, make her a sort of Gallic Natalie Portman. Anyway, that's the plot: rescue little brother from the mad doctor. The images are the thing: with its rendering of a bleak, low-tech retro-future, "City" looks more like a Terry Gilliam movie than "Twelve Monkeys" does! And it slyly slips in ideas and images from other sources, to good effect: Krank himself is as much of the mad-doctor stereotype as is the character in "The Nightmare Before Christmas"; his outlandish electro-headgear is similar to that used in Disney's "Merlin Jones"; a nightmare on the loose swoops low along the ground through streets and alleys as a trail of green mist, improving on a similar image from "Bram Stoker's Dracula"; there's a confrontation in dreamland a la the "Elm Street" series; and while the idea of a brain in a tank isn't a new one, this is the first benign one I've ever seen. Familiar or not--and I'm thinking also of "The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T"--"City of Lost Children" is still engaging, enjoyably weird, fantastic and funny, helped greatly by the fact that One and Miette are so endearing. The pace is a tad slower than it might have been. But this is, after all, a French movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surrealistic, Dark and Bizarre Fairytale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a surrealistic and bizarre society, children have been abducted by a mad and evil scientist, Krank (D. Emilfork), who wants to steal their dreams and stop and reverse his accelerated aging process. When the gang of Cyclops kidnap Denree (Joseph Lucien), the little brother of the former whale hunter One (Ron Perlman), he is helped by the young street orphan girl Miette (Judith Vittet), who steals for the Siamese Pieuvre (Genevi?ve Brunet &amp; Odille Mallet), to reach the platform where Krank leaves with his cloned dwarf wife Mademoiselle Bismuth (Mireille Moissé), his six cloned sons (Dominique Pinon) and a brain, and rescue the children."La Cité des Enfants Perdus" is a mesmerizing movie, with one of the most beautiful cinematography and music score of the cinema history. This surrealistic, dark and bizarre fairytale is almost perfect, and my only restriction is the quite confused screenplay. When I saw this movie for the first time in 1995, I was impressed with the stunning performance of the young actress Judith Vittet and I expected that she would become a star, but eleven years later I have just read in IMDb that she quitted her promising career and now she is graduated in Economics Science. The soundtrack of Angelo Badalamenti is another wonderful work of this outstanding composer. I love the sequence that begins with the tear of Miette and ends with the ship hitting the harbor. I am also impressed with some sick twisted-minded persons that can see pedophilia in the beautiful relationship of One and Miette. I have this movie on VHS, but I have just bought the recently released DVD, and I do not regret, since this film deserves the better image and sound of the DVD. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Ladr?o de Sonhos" ("Thief of Dreams")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I shook my head and wondered why I wasted three dollars renting this movie. It seemed to me that the storyline was worthless. However, I gave this movie a second chance, and this time instead of constantly reading the subtitles I paid more attention to the acting and events taking place on-screen.I was shocked. The amount of creativity and symbolism blew me away. A lot of questions I had accumulated throughout my first viewing were answered by watching the movie carefully.I recommend to everyone who thought this a poor movie to watch it again. If you don't speak French (like myself) try not to get so involved in the subtitles that you miss critical detail. It's there, and it's important, trust me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sought out this film after seeing another film from the same production team that made the wonderful DELICATESSEN. However, while I adored DELICATESSEN and gave it a very high score, I wasn't nearly as impressed by CITY OF LOST CHILDREN--mostly because this film seemed to emphasize set design and weirdness, while plot seemed almost unimportant. In DELICATESSEN, there were of course the weirdness and odd sets, but the story and acting was so much more important and this made me care much more for the characters. In CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, it felt more like I was gawking at a freak show and there was just no emotional involvement--none.In many ways, the film was reminiscent of several of Terry Gilliam's films--particularly BRAZIL. However, once again, BRAZIL had better characters and made me laugh. CITY OF LOST KIDS was just creepy and weird but with practically no charm.Now this isn't to say it's a bad film or that I didn't like it--I did. But instead of an involving or funny film, it was almost all visuals and weirdness. As for the plot, it sure took me a long time to even understand what was happening--and it seemed like I needed captions to explain the captions as I read along with the film!! But given the amazing sets and cool characters, it still kept my attention. I particularly enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinon playing a bunch of clones. I have liked this odd looking actor ever since I first saw him in DIVA and he was the best character in both this film and DELICATESSEN. His delivery and manner is just captivating.Now usually in most of my reviews I give a summary of the plot. Here it's very tough because I still am not 100% sure what I saw!! It all involves an evil genius who was created by one of the Dominique Pinons. This guy spends much of the movie kidnapping kids and trying to steal their dreams (kind of like an evil twist on MONSTERS INC.). At the same time, some evil freaks led by conjoined twins are thrown in as rival baddies. In the midst of this, Ron Perlman (who speaks no French in real life) and a little girl set off in search of Perlman's stolen little brother. There's more to it than that, but really I didn't think the story was that important--it was more a chance to give a canvas to all the weird sets and characters.Overall, I liked seeing the film but I never came close to loving it. I recommend it for those with an appreciation for the very weird and perhaps lovers of French cinema. All others, proceed at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''La Cité des enfants perdus'' is a beautiful movie with a dark and surreal visual and scenarios, as well as awesome clothes and distinctive color scheme.The movie should have won the Oscar for at least 'the Best Art Direction'or 'Cinematography, but since is not American, I guess it is not even well known.I think is sick how some people see Miette and One relationship as 'pedophilia''. Miette is much more mature than him, like a grown-up in a child's body, while One is innocent and a child in a grown-up's body. The only thing I don't get in this movie is why does Krank's final dream kill him.The plot: Krank is a mad scientist who cannot dream, and because of this lack of ability he is prematurely old for his age. That's why he starts to kidnap young children: he wants to study and extract their dreams for him. One of the kids that Krank kidnaps is One's young brother Denree, and when One decides to go after Denree with Miette's help, Krank and his partners will need to face a new danger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, but for a different reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm fine with movies that choose style over substance. I absolutely love Brazil, if that tells you anything. I was totally prepared to see a movie that had minimal plot and coherence, and was ready to simply immerse myself in the 'grotesque and disturbing imagery' as the rating touts. Another thing that intrigued me was the box art, which looked almost Aztec/Steampunkish. I thought that perhaps that type of imagery would dominate the film, or at least figure prominently in it. It did not. Instead the film mainly features imagery and sets from what appears to be the city from Alex Proyas's Dark City if it had been located on a French coastline in the 1940s.But getting to the point, what ruined this movie for me was not that it was to unfocused and lacking in action. It was the filmmakers insistence that everything be so insufferably f*cking goofy. I felt like I was watching a bad rip off of a Terry Gilliam film, made by somebody who completely missed what made his style so great. First of all, this is a tame movie. Not that that is my reason for disliking it, I'd just like to set the record straight. The film's rating is absolutely undeserved. It easily could have been rated PG-13, and contained nothing too disturbing for a young teenager to stomach. And even then, any scene that even began to create a sense of foreboding atmosphere was immediately ravaged by unnecessary and painfully protracted scenes of people acting like mentally damaged infants.Look, its not that I don't "get it". I understand what they were going for here, its just that they f*cked up (In my opinion). To put it simply, an otherwise chilling, absorbing film best described as Bioshock meets Brazil, is marred by disgustingly indulgent characters and camera-work by the filmmakers. For instance, the character of the mad man who kidnaps children to steal their dreams because he cannot have any of his own should be instantly tragic and threatening, a truly fantastic character simply by design. Any hopes of such a thing are tossed aside within the first few moments as he and the rest of his, what I suppose you could call family, scream directly into the camera for over a minute. Without any thought, they instantly reduce what should have been an incredible character with so much potential to a pathetic whimpering baby in the body of a man. They really seem to be TRYING to act stupid and over the top. Why? What's the point? There is no subtlety or really any care given to anything in the film, least of all that first pointless scene. It really seems as though that scene existed for the sole purpose of destroying the disturbing atmosphere that the film was trying to achieve right out of the starting gate.In the end the film had so much potential, and so much style to work with, but it was wasted in favor of the film's oh-so-quirky antics. If this is French dark absurdist comedy, perhaps I'm just more suited to British dark absurdist comedy where the comedy goes hand in hand with the atmosphere rather than the former beating the latter into submission and sticking its @ss into the camera lens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the most memorable movie experiences I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many disagree with the previous reviewer.Not sure what the last reviewer watched, but City of lost Children is amazing cinema from the sets, color, acting, lighting, plot, it had everything pushed to the Nth from what I experienced. It is NOT a typical American style movie. It is French and luckily, they are allowed to have an alternate path to interesting movie making.This guy Jeunet puts a LOT into all of his productions. Almost a mentally overwhelming amount of style, info and actions (not action packed, but activities that go on in or behind the scene). He also did Amelie which is just as astounding and one of the best films ever made. Watch it start to finish if you don't believe that.The City of Lost Childen extends its name sake across many peoples from the twisted characters that are adults and act like the children they never were, to the children who are lost from being children and must be adults. Not to mention the abductions and the reason for that. So it is a win on many levels. One of the best, and I am so grateful I happened across this bazaar gem of a flick.Wish more movies were as intricately entertaining as this art piece is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was given this film by a friend to watch. It first sight I was skeptical. It is now, by far, one of my favorite films of all time!Visually it is unreal. I could simply turn off the sound and stare at it. Even watching the film in its native tongue is impressive. I wish more films would follow suit. You rarely see American films with the mix of such heavy subjects tied with humor. Maybe some day someone will come along and mimic the feel and look of this film. We could only be so lucky!Ron Perlman is very good in it as well as his sidekick..Miette. I was further impressed that Ron had to learn French just for the role. How many actors would do that, I ask?I would suggest anyone who is a film buff to see this movie. It will change the way you look at cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagination sets you free</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my greatest cinematic experiences. For me, cinema has always been about imagination, and I just love movies that send you a positive message about how imagination can set you free.Seeing the world through a child's eyes, turning even the darkest, most depressive of worlds into a world of wonder through the sheer power of dreams and unbridled imagination - that's pure magic.From a certain point of view, most of Jeunet's movies are about that, and with their wonderfully bizarre characters and environments, beautifully choreographed clockwork-action sequences, dreamlike colour palettes and unique camera angles, they are true successors to Terry Gilliam's best films (Brazil, The Adventures of Baron Munchausen).Totally unique and heart-warming, maybe even more so than Jeunet's other two great movies, Amélie and A Very Long Engagement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: If your children see this movie they may never enjoy the schlock churned out by Disney, Dreamworks or another soulless showbiz conglomerate. A memorable film which puts Hollywood to shame. As a parent I had to watch god knows how many mostly Disney movies but none of them stays in a memory for long. It's like a fast food for the soul; full of harmful ingredients which cause child's mind to become "obese". I am not sure why this movie is R rated. There's no profanity or nudity. I let my 10 year old watch it. And even though movie was scary at times there is nothing gory or sadistic that can deeply affect a child. I think "Modern family" or local TV news would hurt my child's psyche immeasurably more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful And Precious Work Of Art. One Of Cinema's Greatest Fantasies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>every time i view this film, i'm always impressed at what a remarkable achievement it truly is. i believe this to be one of the greatest works of visual fantasy since the works of Cocteau.CGI effects movies would do well to study exactly how this film's visuals are applied and used so effectively. even before the popularity of today's CGI driven blockbusters, visual effects in movies could often be "showy" or distracting from the storyline and diminish empathy with a film's characters and situations. not so with 'Lost Children', the visuals only enhance the atmosphere and effectiveness of the story telling. the visuals become a protagonist, of sorts, and enhance each sequence to become more compelling and immerse the viewer emotionally.i've always loved the Disney family classic 'Mary Poppins', and feel it to have a lot of heartfelt message. but the reliance on technical visuals often makes the film a little confusing and feel episodic. there are so many visual effects and ideas that 'Poppins' can leave the viewer a little confused about what is actually supposed to be happening and what it's about. the storyline of 'Lost Children' is rather abstracted, but the viewer never really loses sight of film's actors and their motivations. instead of distracting from the storyline, the visual effects actually make the events more compelling.this film is also superb in every department. the acting, the screenplay, the music and production design, and of course, it's marvelous technology.Ron Perlman's sideshow strong man and Judith Vittet's tough minded street orphan, are two of the most memorable and compelling performances i've seen in cinema. the other performances from the flea circus master to the sinister and horrid Siamese twins, are impeccable. and where in Heaven's name did they find so many cute and irresistible kids. many of these tykes and toddlers are no more than three or four years old and some of them are effective actors as well.even though i would very much recommend this film for children, even if it is a little disturbing and at times frightening, this film is not for everyone's taste. but i would venture to wonder if those people were ever really children or ever had a deep and unexplainable dream or nightmare. dreams are the very fabric this movie is woven of.this film is for anyone who loves and is defensive of children and childhood. and for those who truly believe that their dreams speak to them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, and it is one of my personal favorites. Its imaginative and powerful premise is brought to life by a creative story, excellent acting, skilled directing, innovative special effects, dreamy visuals, and a surreal atmosphere. The City of Lost Children also has a gloomy and chilling soundtrack that suits the movie perfectly. The movie takes place in a corrupt, dismal town filled with orphans, villains, and miscreants. Most of the adults are portrayed as evil, while the kids are the heroes. However, there is one good adult, who befriends the orphans. His brother is one of the many kids to have been kidnapped by the mad scientist named Krane. The scientist is incapable of dreaming, and makes a machine that connects his head to the heads of children. He uses this contraption to haunt the kids' dreams because he cannot dream on his own. He believes his lack of dreams is causing him to age prematurely. But the kids are stuck on the "island" of his laboratory. That is a simplified, condensed summary of the movie. It is sometimes hard to follow though, because of its intricate plot. Many critics have praised its originality, though some have complained that many of its fascinating concepts are not fully developed, or explained. They seem to think that the movie needed to be longer to offer a full explanation. While this argument does have merit, I believe that the movie would have lost momentum, had it been longer. The City of Lost Children is not perfect, but it is a rich and vivid fantasy that is otherworldly, provocative, and moving. It is not for everybody though; some will be turned off by its nightmarish mood, and complex narrative; however, that does not change the fact that it is an engaging and refreshing film, in that it is totally original. The City of Lost Children showcases enormous talent and ability, in so many areas: story, direction, characterization, visuals, music, and acting are all top notch. It is certainly one of the most original movies of the decade, and one of the most imaginative and compelling films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark fantasy from the maker of Delicatessan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The critics don't know what to make of this movie but give it a good rating anyway. Me, I definitely know what to make of this movie and consider it a masterpiece of film making. The French are very much the artists. They create the Eifiel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, and the Cannes Film Festival. When it comes to making a movie, they know how to do it, and the City of Lost Children is one such movie.The critics cannot seem to understand the plot, and that is probably because they are too stupid to see it. A scientist, Krank, cannot dream, so he kidnaps children and attempts to steal their dreams. Unfortunately the children cannot have good dreams so he ends up with nightmares which inevitably kill the children. A young boy, Dedree, is kidnapped by the Cyclops, a fanatical cult that have blinded themselves and wear an electronic eye, and is sold to the scientist. Dedree's big brother, One, seeks him but becomes embroiled in an Oliver Twist gang ring led by a siamese twin known as Octopus.This is said to have been the most expensive French film ever made, and visually it shows it. The City of Lost Children is a movie which soars above the Hollywood blockbusters in visual masterpiece. The directors seem to have their own little quirks in here, like the snowball events. That is something happens which causes something else to happen, which ends up saving the heroes. The final one is a classic, where one tear ends up causing a ship to smash into a dock.There are some visuals which call back images of Alien Resurrection, such as the babies in a survival tank. What is interesting is how most of the movie is green and that there is a lot of water. This is a contrast to Delicatessen which is yellow and very dry.The City of Lost Children is a fantasy. It has the feel of a Jules Verne style of science fiction but it seems to be more of a future in the past. Rather that being critical of what should be and what should not be, we should just look at this as being in a realm somewhere between fantasy and reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is not as entertaining and uplifting as Jean-Pierre Jeunet's more recent movies, which must be one of the reasons why "La cité des enfants perdus" isn't as praised and being loved as for instance some of his other movies like "Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain" and "Un long dimanche de fiançailles". This movie is definitely more dark or tone but with still its very distinctive imaginative, fantasy-like world, spirit attached to it.If you aren't really taken by the movie its story, you should at least be blown away by its visuals. The movie has a great look and it manages to create a world of its own. As far as fantasy movies go, this one is definitely up there with the most imaginative ones. Not just all of its sets and costumes are great looking but also its limited effects and odd looking actors who play the characters.Don't really understand why most people praise Ron Perlman for playing a French speaking role and all the claims that he does it flawlessly must have been written by his agent or something. I won't pretend as if I'm an expert on the language but I've been to the country and had French class at school, so at least I know how it should sound like and Ron Perlman just didn't sound very French. I can still understand and see how he got cast for the role though. It must have been because of his unique and distinctive look. The entire movie is being filled by a whole bunch of quirky but unique looking characters, so Perlman fits in perfectly with them.The story is not that complex but it's still quite hard to keep up to, since so many oddball things and characters show up in this movie. It does really slow the movie down at some parts and I do wish the movie would had been a bit more entertaining and comedy-like to watch but this is, as it seems, due to the hand of co-director Marc Caro, who seems to be more fond of post-apocalyptic and darker stories than Jean-Pierre Jeunet. don't know if this also was the reason for their creative split-up as directors but fact remains that Jean-Pierre Jeunet has continued to make some beautiful, classic movies, while Marc Caro has had very little work since.One greatly odd and beautiful looking film.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

This is an excellent film from Jeunet and Caro with thier previous film - Delicatessen only half the film the city is (Although it is still a good film.) I would recommend people to watch it twice as you can then really absorb the visuals and the storyline (which may be seen by some to lack coherence.) Daniel emilforks character Krank is often labeled a monster but as he says it's not his fault, he was created. The set design is the best you will see, as is the lighting. The acting is also top notch with Juddith Vittet hitting the nail on the head. The music fits the film entirely with its eerie tone. This could still be a cult piece through word of mouth so watch it twice and then get someone else to watch it. PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONE JEUNET AND CARO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably one of the most bizarre films I have seen in recent years. It is very hard to describe in small words and is probably one of the most horrific, disturbing, surreal, unique, dark, vivid, and for some, enjoyable, films out there. Truly, this film is not for all. It is WAY too dark too be considered a children's film, yet it is the kind of lucid ideas that would flow from the brains of children who have night terrors at night. Kind of like what you would get if you did a direct brain-feed out of someone's mind who was both comatose and psychotic. The only comparisons I can even think that have a shred of likeness would be a mix between the films Dark City, and Time Bandits. This film is definitely warped genius, and definitely not for most people out there, as it could be and I'm sure is, too disturbing for any semblance of mainstream audiences. With the two main characters being a strongman who is a cross between Lyle Lovett and Arnold Schwarzenegger and a little girl who looks like a midget Donna Reed, as well as a veritable cast of kids and freakshows, it is sure to appease the appetite and wet dreams of every fan of musicians like Marilyn Manson, Oingo Boingo, Jack Off Jill, Twiztid, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, etc., as well as anyone who likes the dark dark arts and has a very very twisted sense of humor and taste. To put it shortly, I liked it. Will you? Hmmmmmm......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is visually rich and fairly engaging, but some key element is missing to tie everything together.The movie's narrative structure is fairly simple: Krank, the evil creation of an anonymous mad scientist, is kidnapping children to steal their dreams for himself. Krank's henchmen kidnap Denree, adopted younger brother of One, a slow-witted but good-hearted circus strongman. One bands together with pristine street urchin Miette to bring Denree back and defeat Krank in the process.However, the plot, when examined more closely, is full of implausibilities and inconsistencies. Taken together, these plot holes comprise one of the film's major flaws: the whole universe seems to exist solely for the purpose of supporting the story. Sadly, this makes it seem very contrived and one-dimensional. For example, the "cyclops" people, who are seen as a formidable force at the beginning of the film, completely vanish from the story midway through. Miette's fellow orphans seem much more like a band of ragtag adventurers out of some Disney production than real street kids. The villainous conjoined twins are plenty villainous, but they don't seem to have any real motives, making them pretty bland, predictable antagonists. And so on.Another issue I had with the movie was that a love of spectacle seemed to subsume a sense of balance and pacing. There were plenty of visually interesting moments, but they typically flashed past once and then vanished, never to be seen again. Examples include the carnival seen at the beginning of the film, the stronghold of the Cyclops-men, and the underwater home of the bearded inventor. Each of these settings suggested an interesting world in themselves, but the movie only paused in each location long enough to show us the most interesting visuals, then resumed its relentless march onward. This gave the movie a somewhat scattered feeling, as though it couldn't ever really commit to its setting.Oddly enough, this rapid stream of visuals was accompanied by a rather slow-moving plot. There are basically three phases to the movie: the call to adventure, a series of advances and setbacks, and the final confrontation with Krank. Unfortunately, both the challenges the protagonists face and the corresponding resolutions of those challenges are caused by forces entirely beyond the characters' control. Everything is external to them -- they basically bumble through the plot without ever making significant choices. Thus, the monomyth is crippled, there is no fatal flaw that the hero must confront, and the "climax" feels weak and pointless. The characters undergo no changes over the course of the film. There is no real progress, just a lot of aimless wandering.For all its shortcomings, the movie does have some good points. For the most part, the acting is good, with particularly strong performances from Judith Vittet as Miette and Ron Perelman as One. Jean-Claude Dreyfus also did a great job in his supporting role as Marcello. I didn't really care for Dominique Pinon as the unnamed creator ("The Original") and his assorted clones, but maybe that's just me -- I tend to find his exaggerated grimaces disagreeable rather than funny. As I mentioned earlier, the movie does a great job creating rich visual environments. It sort of reminds me of a concept painting for some post- apocalyptic video game - full of grimy textures, well-lit interiors with dim backgrounds, and highly saturated lighting. I actually saw this in a fairly low resolution on the internet, but the visuals still drew me in to the world of the story.In conclusion, I'd say this film is worth watching for the interesting visuals ? but don't expect much more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is grossly overrated by the IMDB group. I will grant that the visuals are outstanding, among the best I've seen. The problem is that I could watch this movie muted with a strip of cardboard over the subtitles and enjoy it as much if not *more*. I guess that would only be true if I'd read a one paragraph summary of the plot (which could probably be fully written in one paragraph), but it still stands to me to show that visuals can't make a movie.Stealing dreams, that's slightly intriguing. That's about it. The rest of the writing was complete drivel. Imaginative, yes, but on par with the Avengers in my vote for "most likely to have been written by a team of untrained brain-damaged monkeys".I suppose many people can appreciate a movie for more than plot, but when a plot stinks to high heaven, I can't stand a movie.This is the type of movie they should show in film school when teaching two different courses: "How to make a great-looking film" and "How not to write a movie".If you want to see some great visuals and the usual supply of *good* movies with great visuals have been exhausted, see this one. But play a book on tape at the same time instead of trying to follow the plot; no need to offend your ears and brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a fascinating set design philosophy. The idea is to use a sparse sense of retro machinery (rivets everywhere), and lots of water, stark lighting and not overly creative framing. It also has a competent score. Both attempt to support a creative stance that is, alas poorly structured.The problem is that there is no core vision. At root, we have an attempt to make a deeply self-referential vision: a dream stolen from your own self-conscious and presented as a story about the same, with deep symbolic hooks. The idea has great potential, but fails. The problems are two:--the images are not deep enough. The evil is thin. The characters are stereotypes, not the archetypes the drama requires. These should grab and puzzle; instead they introduce and act predictably. Also the drama has many discontinuous fragments that are never harmonized, nor presented as dreamlike discontinuities. Its just thrown up at us as the result of partially digested cartoon gluttony. Would have been better to steal from Dickens than Stan Lee.--there's an attempt to be humorous, and this undercuts the primary goal at every turn. Every single image or vignette has the filmmakers winking at us as if to say, "You know we're not serious here. Isn't this cute?" Gilliam knows to hide the humor. Greenaway knows how to disturb with depth. Here, we have the Tim Burton syndrome. It should have been well enough known to avoid by 1995.I usually give a lot of credit to films which shoot high and fail. But these people only pretend to shoot high and so fail in an uninteresting way. Yet another example of the bankrupt system of French film subsidy: you have to promote the "French" view. Whatever that is, it maps poorly to this type of creative endeavor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's Where "Happily-Ever-After" Is Just A Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Step right this way into the nightmare/fantasy world of this truly bizarre, freaky and phenomenally weird tale that comes at you straight from hell.Very quirky and curious, The City Of Lost Children (TCOLC) is definitely something of an original (it's actually hard to believe this is even possible in this "been there/seen that" age of filmdom that we live in these days).You can be sure that this is one far-out fairy tale that you'll never, ever see coming to you from the likes of Disney Studios.This undoubtedly strange, and, yes, unsettling little tale is sure to leave quite a lasting impression on the viewer long after the closing credits have rolled on by.Directed with a truly astonishing visual flair, TCOLC puts a unique, new twist (that's very dark and surreal) on the familiar "Mad Scientist" theme. (This is the sort of twisted twist that seems to work its magic about 75% of the time) Set in an awesome "otherworld" of shadows and light, TCOLC's story revolves around the doings of Dr. Krank (a total mad scientist, if you've ever seen one) who has his team of cloned henchmen abduct the young children of the city whom he wants for his experiments.Using a most unusual contraption, Krank (who is aging prematurely) then attempts to steal the dreams of these innocent babes because he, himself, cannot dream.This is one of those films where trying to go into any great detail about its story would only be an utter waste of time. You really need to see TCOLC for yourself to fully appreciate it for the richness of vision that it has to offer.On the down side - 2 of TCOLC's drawbacks were that its story has a tendency to be quite uneven at times and actor Ron Perlman (whom I do not like) has a substantial role in the scheme of things.These 2 deficits are actually quite minor, though, in comparison to the up-side of this mighty weird and entertaining gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simultaneously beautiful/grotesque magical tale. Perfect!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genre of dark fantasy in films is truly a wonderful genre to explore. It's a mix between the absolutely fantastic (duh), the surreal, the beauty and the horror; it's a mix between the sweetest dream and the most grotesque of nightmares. This wonderfully appealing and appalling premise is the drive behind Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro's classic film, "La Cité des Enfants Perdus". The plot itself is just a tad bit complicated, but here goes: It's about an ex-sailor-gone-freak, super-strong man called One (Ron Perlman), who's strength capable of snapping metal chains comes paired with a mental retardation and a serious language problem. He's the 'big brother' (or caretaker, if you will) of a small, abandoned child who's only interest in this world is eating, and is oblivious to all else. One night, the child is mysteriously kidnapped by a band of hideous men with golden, mechanical left eyes, and poor One tries to follow them.These mechanical-eyed men (whom we later learn call themselves Cyclops) send One's little brother away, but One learns that they do shady thievery with a gang of rough, orphan children. They help these children steal things, take their large share, and leave them the rest of it. In turn, the orphans take their spoils to their evil matrons, two identical twins physically joined by one foot. The hunky and dim-witted One befriends one of the orphans, an intelligent and mature-minded young girl called Miette (Judith Vittet), and she decides to help him rescue his kidnapped brother...much to the chagrin of the vindictive, evil twins.Meanwhile, in a metallic island stranded smack in the middle of a mined ocean, there lives an evil scientist (Daniel Emilfork) who doesn't dream, and who uses little children's mind to extract their dreams (he dreams of being Santa Claus), but whenever he does so, the only things he gets are excruciatingly horrid nightmares. He dreams of finding the one child who won't produce nightmares for him, and he sends his dwarf wife and his six identical (and also dim-witted, Robin Williams-look alikes) sons in search for them. There's also a living machine powered by a brain that lives in this metallic island, but I can't say anything about it (or is it him?) because that would be giving too much away.Anyway, the film joins these two stories seamlessly, and follows our main heroes One and Miette as they go through a series of quirky, slightly amusing and disturbing events involving a series of equally quirky characters, each one weirder than the last. As a matter of fact, it's one of the most interesting and original plot lines I've ever seen.The script is very funny. The costumes are, well...they're designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier, so imagine the possibilities (though don't expect outfits worthy of fashion runways here; think the opposite). The photography is simply splendid, colourful, and the lenses are used to give the characters alternately a comic and a gruesome appearance. The music reminded me of a troubling circus, and it's well it should do that, because the film seems as if we've taken a ride through a circus full of gross and amusing characters.Jeunet and Caro have outdone themselves. There is also the element of art here. It's a surreal film, and it attempts to present us with images drawn from the subconscious, portraying the nature of human dreams and expectations and human ties as well (albeit in a very magical way).And it never lags! From the very first moment, till the end of the second hour you'll be amazed and entertained. If there's a film that fully entertains while being artistic and refreshingly original, it's bound to be embedded into my mind. So regarding this film, that's fine with me! Rating: 3 stars and a half out of 4!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those strange movies which comes out of the Cannes film festival and is not easy for American audiences to digest. Tell you the truth, first time I viewed it, it was difficult to understand. Yet, there is a precision to the story which is easy to interpret once you can identify all the characters. The film is called " The City of Lost Children " or course in French it's La cite' Des enfants perdus. " I doubt anyone can guess how often Ron Perlman who plays the character 'One' is selected to be the hero of the story. Here he plays a transient ex-sailor earing a living as a circus strongman. While working, his adopted ward or little brother is stolen by an evil scientist seeking a fountain of youth by kidnapping children. When he steals their youthful dreams, he is kept perpetually young. However when he is discovered by One and his new friend Miette (Judith Vittet) he tries to prevent them from reaching him and his ally called Krank (Daniel Emilfork). The city is set in the middle of the ocean and defended by a mine-field, an assortment of grotesque, diabolical and mysterious criminals. The film is crafted to maximize the dark dreams of anyone who's ever been afraid of nightmares which never seem to have any explanation. I would recommend this movie to everyone not afraid of confronting their dreams. Excellent, film adaption of the novel. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>enchanting, bizarre, spine-tingling, jaw-dropping and immensely creative film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caro and Jeunet had a fairly long collaboration that produced a good many shorts and only two features: this and Delicatessen. For City of Lost Children, one is brought into a netherworld, a place of dark fantasy where a scientist keeps children's dreams to keep him from growing old and dying while a strongman (Ron Perlman) and little girl try to stop him and get the children back. This is the one line summary that can barely do justice to the sheer visual prowess that this film provokes. One has to think back to Terry Gilliam, and later on to Guillermo Del-Toro, as a basis of comparison for an eye for a world that is entirely there's but very much recognizable. You actually can't easily compare a lot of what is in it, since its look (mostly from Marc Caro, who focused on art direction while Jeunet did the actual direction of scenes) is derived from sources without having to be specifically homage.It's as original as 1990's dark fairy-tale/fantasy can get, and for the select viewer there's few pleasures/terrors like it. I say both pleasures and terrors since that is the ultimate goal here, and while the word may be repeated most amongst critics (alongside, perhaps, 'existential') there's no other way to describe it in a word: it's surreal. But this I mean in a sense that would've tingled Salvador Dali, or tickled distinctive science fiction authors like Frank Herbert. City of Lost Children is a world where a city is baroque and full of browns hues and dark corners, black and greys, the sick greens of the eye that the aliens look through, and the production design suggests a world that may have never happened or may happen years from now.And the choices of lenses and the direction of particular shots and the rhythm are creative too, always very interesting in the means of experimentation. Some moments, like that tear that the child Miette sheds that flies across streets and sets off a chain reaction starting with a spider web and ending with a ship crashing through a dock, is no less than stunning in its timing and weird crescendo. Other things, like with Krank (exceptional and underrated Daniel Emifork) and his scenes where he is made to cry by being reminded of his present state of predicament, or when he does that extremely creepy scene as Santa Claus singing to a record player to a bunch of wailing babies, are given that look through a warped perspective, of that oval-shaped look where things jut out or look bigger than they actually are- in this case Emifork's face. This isn't the only area Caro and Jeunet practice their unique outlook with the cinematography (Darius Khondji deserves a lot of credit as well), but it's most prominent and memorable.City of Lost Children has a remarkable take on a story that could be a possible companion piece to Pan's Labyrinth - not because it has the same reality-meets-fantasy angle, but because they're films that inspire the dark and beautiful, the most sinister in human beings manifested into things that shouldn't be seen, and aren't simply for kids. We're engrossed in both of the stories in this film, of this daring, sometimes very amusing quest of One and Miette, and the struggle to maintain sanity and a sense of what existence can be amongst the six clones and the dwarf Mademoiselle Bismuth, because it's a world we've never seen before, even if we think or even know we have.And so many things that will stay with you, scenes and the language of the cinematic technique: the opening scene with the old man's dream of Santa coming down the chimney to deliver presents only to become twenty Santas in the room; the green smoke that travels all along the city that invades peoples dream-state and gives the vision to a mysterious woman; those wicked witch-twins who play music as a flea intoxicates one to kill the person standing right beside; the death scene of the Mademoiselle, which shouldn't be so sad but is if only for her mentioning of her allergic reaction to steel; and that bearded, cackling man tied with dynamite to the legs of the castle above the water. This is such a rich experience that it will take a few more viewings to let it all seep in, but for the first time it's simply fantastic imagination of an order that suggests freedom rarely seen in the weird-and-wild cult world of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagination at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directors Jeunet and Caro have cleverly woven this futuristic/early 20th Century fantasy/adventure into an entertaining, involving tale of a big-hearted giant's efforts to rescue his little brother from the clutches of a mad scientist, with the help of a feisty, pint-sized heroine.The screenplay from Jeunet, Caro and Gilles Adrien captures the imagination and always holds the interest of the viewer as it takes us through this amazing underworld of genetically cloned characters and strange surroundings.Much credit must go to set designer Jean Rabasse and artistic director Caro who provide our eyes with a sumptuous feast of creative backdrops and bizarre sets, while Darius Kondji brings it all to life splendidly with his camera. It is also great to hear a score from Angelo Badalamenti ("Twin Peaks"). Editing is by Herve Schneid.Final note to a top cast that is headed up by the versatile Ron Perlman, immensely enjoyable as "One", the simple strongman who is heartbroken when he loses his adopted little brother. Impressive too is Judith Vittet as Miette, the determined little girl who is only looking for a home. Daniel Emilfork is deliciously off-centre as Krank, the obsessive creation who is desperate to discover what it is to dream. As the cloned brothers, and the "original" ultimately responsible for the "City of Lost Children", Dominique Pinon provides much comic relief. Genevieve Brunet and Odile Mallet are a real delight, often a scream, as the evil twin sisters with the maniacal plans and the amazing likeness, while Jean-Louis Trintignant is humorous in supplying the voice of Uncle Irwin.Imagination at its best! Give yourself a surprise!Monday, September 1, 1997 - Hoyts CroydonJeunet and Caro's startling, visual delight loses much of its wonder on second viewing, especially on the small screen. Whereas the first time is a marvellous, quirky surprise, the second loses its shine. Not to say "The City of Lost Children" is not worth a second look.Captivating sets and amazing visuals alone are worth a return. Add to this a great cast that provide much of the entertainment, and you have one of the best French fantasies to feast on. Look out for Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, the craziest, funniest wicked witches ever.Sub-titles and the strange manner of this flick may leave some viewers cold.Sunday, August 23, 1998 - Video</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeunet masters science-fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another masterpiece crafted by the genius Jean-Pierre Jeunet. The City of Lost Children weaves together two very different stories. In one we see a scientist's flawed experiments (clones, an immensely short woman, a brain with no body and most importantly, Krank the mad scientist who can't dream) and in the other we see the story of One and Miette, a circus strongman and a young girl who combine forces to get One's little brother back from Cyclops who stole him so that Krank can harvest his dreams. Both of these stories were immensely compelling in their own way. The story of the experiments was darkly humorous and original, and featured a sensational performance from Dominique Pinon as the clones. And on the other side, there's the story of One and Miette which was absolutely adorable and engaging. I loved the strong friendship between these two characters and the complexity of both of them. Ron Perlman gave a very strong performance, but the young Judit Vittet gave the best of the film and one of my favorites of all time. As always with Jeunet, the film is shot wonderfully with some phenomenal cinematography and he proved that he could master science-fiction with some of the best art direction I've ever seen. A darkly humorous, strangely adorable masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As all dreams do... An excellent movie, a favorite that I watch time and again. I have a VHS English language copy and I find no fault with the dialogue - the story flowed very well for me from the first viewing. But I haven't seen the subtitled version, so perhaps there are some subtleties I have missed. I especially like the surreal sense of humor that runs throughout the story. No need to go into the plot and repeat what others have said, but it definitely is in the same mold as Terry Gilliam's and Tim Burton's works. If you like them, you will like this. A moody, bittersweet musical score - capped by an excellent performance by Marianne Faithful over the final credits of the theme song. Great performances by Ron Perlman, Dominque Pinon, Daniel Emilfork, Judith Vittet, Jean-Claude Dreyfus and cast. Dank and mysterious sets, flowing cinematography, obtuse plot connections, phantasmagorical editing synchronicities... what else is needed? One minor quibble. Why need a map for the minefield if all the mines are floating on the surface and quite visible? Otherwise the carnival logic holds up well in a movie that should become a cult classic and more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>reviewing a re-watching of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been several years since I first saw this movie, I actually bought it on DVD years ago before even seeing it because the trailer intrigued me that much. If I remember the trailer there was no talking in it, only music and perhaps a voice over. Ron Perlman is seen walking through a expressionistic city with a child on his back. I fell in love with the darkness and strangeness of the trailer.well fast forward to the present. I just watched it about a week ago at a friends house. I lent it to them for a while but they never got around to watching it. So there I was placing it in to the DVD player. My friends watched it for only 10 minutes and they had no interest in it whatsoever. One of them even said from the start, "I don't like this movie." sadly they did not even give this movie a chance.and so I sat there alone in front of the television re-watching it for the first time in years. the thoughts of my friends comments ran through my head but I could not take my eyes away. There's originality in this movie, reminiscent of Amelie and the Triplets of Belleville. It has that kind of feel to it, only a bit darker.The world is quite fantastical yet small. It always seems dark and smoky and the building seem to dwarf everyone. It's a tiny place yet full of so many interesting characters. Blind people who believe they see the light. A villain who just wants to have a nice dream. A brain in a fish tank.And yet with all of this strangeness the plot makes it easy to relate to because it's reminiscent of fairy tales.Just give the movie a chance. It's an experience with it's world alone. It's a world that isn't cookie cut with dragons and faeries and elves or one based upon this world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Franz Kafka, meet French cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"La cite des enfants perdus" (called "The City of Lost Children" in English) is a movie that I will probably have to describe in several ways. The movie is set in an ultra-surreal French city and the plot involves elderly scientist Krank (Daniel Emilfork) kidnapping children to steal their dreams so that he won't age. That is, until orphan Miette (Judith Vettit) joins up with strongman One (Ron Perlman) to try and stop him.Obviously, if this was a Hollywood movie, we can guess how idiotic the whole thing would be. But this is a French movie, so it is very creative. For starters, there's the look that they give the city: it's surreal beyond what Franz Kafka could have ever imagined, and thus very dark. What we have here is the sort of situation where you literally are always wondering whether what you're seeing is real, much like what director Jean-Pierre Jeunet accomplished in "Delicatessen". A previous viewer noted that Miette is as mature as an adult, while One is a muscle man but with a childlike innocence.All in all, I can't really do this movie justice by trying to describe it. "TCOLC" is not the sort of movie that you can just watch; you have to feel like you're experiencing it. Also starring is Dominique Pinon, whom Jeunet always casts. Specifically, Pinon plays several roles at once. Very impressively, I might add.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surrealist delight requires patience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A soulless man named Krank who was long ago created by a brilliant but unstable scientist is struggling to remain alive. His inability to dream has made him age at an accelerated pace, and the only way he can halt this process is by stealing the dreams of children. He is aided in this endeavour by the other creations of the scientist: six identical goofy-looking clones, one midget and wide-faced wife named Mrs Bismuth, and a super-intelligent brain which lives in a fish-tank and sees using an old-school bendable camera lens. Krank appears successful at stealing children's dreams, but he is not a happy man because all the dreams he captures are nightmares by children who are obviously traumatized by the kidnapping process.Meanwhile, Krank's hunting ground, the city of lost children, is a treacherous place; Krank's "cyclops" henchmen are always trying to capture children for his purposes. We follow the story of a young girl named Miette (meaning "crumb" in French) who belongs to a small and resourceful gang of children who are exploited by Siamese witch-like twin sisters who run a school where the children steal for them. Miette befriends a simple-talking strongman named Mr. One (Ron Perlman, aka Hellboy) who is looking for his kidnapped little brother Denree. As the story progresses, Miette must escape from the clutches of the evil Siamese twin witches, while also helping One find his long-lost Denree.The movie features terrific acting by all involved. Especially noteworthy is the high quality of the child actors. Further, although the dialogue is simplified in the subtitles for the sake of easy reading, it is very imaginative. Of special note is the scene where one of the clones is describing a dream to Krank. Many dialogue quirks help to give the movie a unique and memorable feel, such as the writer's fondness for making insults out of calling others the name of an unfavourable animal. City also features great casting, with every actor having a look which suits the character ideally (note the one gluttonous and very cute boy). But perhaps the best aspect of the movie is its cinematography. Every shot is done impeccably, and the look and feel of the movie is very much in the surrealist vein in which the directors intended. Make no mistake, this is a full-fledge dark fairy-tale fantasy movie. Finally, the classical score complements the movie very well.If there is anything that detracts from the movie, it would be the lack of focus. The movie hops from one scene to another without allowing enough development of any particular story thread early on. As such, we don't get a good grasp of what the story is really about until later in the movie. For many, this will mean the movie will fail to hold their interest early on, and they may be tempted to give up. For those that don't give up, however, they will find the story to be quite satisfying. And for those willing to give the movie a second viewing, they may be able to fill all the story gaps that they missed the first time around. Much like most Cohen brothers movies, this is one of those movies that improves after the first viewing. Also, much like other movies that improve after first viewing, this is one of those movies that makes the top ten on many film-buff's top movies list.The following movies/stories have major similarities to City: Brazil, for its own lack of focus and its similar retro-futuristic feel (note the hyper-intelligent brain's look as well as the cyclops'); Dark City, for its similar cinematographic style; Frankenstein, for its "scientist creates something awful and tragic" theme; and Amelie, for its imaginative similarities stemming from the director in common. Terry Gilliam himself made the following comment on City of Lost Children: "the most astounding visuals of 1995, 1996, and possibly 1982." Genre: Fantasy. Verdict: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can you not love this movie? From the amazingly talented team of Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet comes this superbly original fantasy tale, that just oozes inventiveness and drags you into it's world, where it's all too easy to completely lose yourself. Caro and Jeunet were, of course, the good people behind the brilliant 'Delicatessen'. The City of Lost Children is kind of like Delicatessen mark 2. The style is still there in droves, except in this film it's much more abundant, and while Delicatessen had a base in reality, The City of Lost Children can easily be classified simply as 'pure' fantasy. The film is very French, and even if you didn't know where it's makers came from, you'd be able to guess. The French style is great anyway, and an excellent base to make a movie from, but when it's mixed with Jeunet's personal style, we've got a movie on our hands! That's exactly what this film is too; pure cinema. This is the sort of experience that I watch movies for, and so the film gets a huge thumbs up on that front.The plot follows a man named Krank. Krank ages prematurely because he cannot dream, thus leading him to kidnap the local children and attempt to steal their dreams. However, as Krank is many a child's worst nightmare, that's exactly what he gets; nightmares, which just isn't good enough. The fun starts when Krank's men kidnap the brother of strongman Ron Perlman, who then sets out with a young orphan girl to find him. The two leads; Ron Perlman and Judith Vittet do a magnificent job of carrying the film, and their very different appearances and persona's blend well with one another. Judith Vittet really does steal the show all on her own, however, as her performance is far more mature than you would expect from an actress so young. It's a shame she only has four film credits to her name. It's not the actors that are the real stars of this film however, as the surrealistic style just steals every scene. You spend most of the movie simply admiring the lavish settings and absolutely sublime uses of CGI.As mentioned, this is exactly the sort of production that cinema was invented for. The inventiveness on display is simply stunning and puts just about every other film in it's class to shame. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is one of today's finest filmmakers, and along with a select group of individuals is one of the few directors left that are still capable of a masterpiece. And that's exactly what this film is; a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is simply enchanting. It plays much like a dream; the sort of dream you don't want to wake up from because it's just too interesting. And, not coincidentally, the film is about dreams. That is, it is about a mad scientist who lacks the ability to dream. So he kidnaps children, with the aid of his midget wife, a groups of clones, and a brain in a tank, and attempts to extract their dreams. The problem is, he frightens the children so much that they will only produce nightmares. Most of the film is the story of a carnival strong man, whose little brother has been kidnapped by said mad scientist. The strong man sets out to find his lost petit frere, with the help of a streetwise little girl.The inventiveness of the story alone would be enough to captivate my imagination, but the acting and the directing are perfect, and the cinematography is nothing short of genius. The characters are so creative, and brought to life with such je ne sais quoi, that thinking about it makes me want to go pop it in my vcr right now.

		<shortDescription>The City of Lost Children is a wonderful, spell-binding film about the fantasy world of children.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The City of Lost Children is a film about a child's fantasy. Like a fairy tale about a beautiful princess threatened by a witch or an ogre, it's also about a child's dream that becomes a nightmare. Krank (Daniel Emilfork), an evil genius, sends his henchmen out to capture children and bring them back to his laboratory. He does this because he desires to steal their dreams. He hooks the children up to a strange contraption, a cross between a barber's chair and an electric chair, topped off with the very first electric hair curlers.With this high-tech machine, he is able to capture the children's dreams. Then Krank hooks himself up to the same instrument and downloads the children's dreams. Krank does this because he, himself, has never been able to dream. What this means metaphorically is that Krank has no soul; what it means psychologically is that he is probably mad. His primary goal in life, then, is to be able to dream, and he has no scruples as to how he achieves his ends. He will do whatever must be done to achieve his goal. Krank is evil because, like a consummately selfish person, he panders to his perverted desires. In fact, he is in many ways a narcissist.What happens to the children whose dreams have been stolen is not clear, but it is certainly unpleasant. Children are brought to his secret laboratory out on the ocean and there they just disappear. In effect, they become prisoners, guinea pigs to be used in nefarious ways by the evil Krank.The city where the action takes place, the eponymous "city of lost children," is an anonymous metropolis, a lost city, that is visually like a German expressionistic painting. The city reminds me of Robert Wiene's wonderful silent film, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919). The city's obscurity and shadowy seediness also remind me of the Depression-era German city in M (1931), Fritz Lang's chilling film about a serial child murderer, and there are echoes of Lang's film in this one. The "lost" city may also refer to the microcosmic world that Krank has created in his "city in the sea," to use the words of Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem: "Death has reared himself a throne / In a strange city lying alone / Far down within the dim West / Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best / Have gone to their eternal rest. / . . . / And when, amid no earthly moans, / Down, down, that town shall settle hence, / Hell, rising from a thousand thrones, / Shall do it reverence."To add to this odd, expressionistic aspect of the film, all of the children in the film appear to be orphans. We never see any of the children's parents, their mothers or fathers. In fact, the children appear to live in world of orphans and evil adults. Yet, at the beginning of the film, we do see a poster in a scene reminiscent of M, which expresses concern over the disappearance of many of the city's children. Yet, unlike M, we see no crowds of maddened city dwellers marching en mass to do violence to Krank and his henchmen. No, Krank is too smart to be found out by common folk, even the city dwellers of this anonymous and bleak urban sump.I thoroughly enjoyed this film by directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, even with its implied temptations, perversions, and illicit desires. It's as if Tim Burton (director of such dark comedies as Beetle Juice [1988] and Edward Scissorhands [1990] and producer of The Nightmare Before Christmas [1993]) combined elements of Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist, the Star Trek television series, and Alex Proyas's brooding science-fiction adventure, Dark City (1998) to create this visually haunting and mesmerizing film.</fullReview>

This is not, however, a movie for everyone. It is a film which, in my case, deserved a second look before I understood everything. It's in french, so getting names and things organized took a bit of work, but it did not ever take away from the film itself. If you're a lover of the surreal and confusing and don't mind subtitles (if it's got a dubbed version, I still suggest subtitles) then by all means see it.

		<fullReview>Context really is everything. European cinema has an unfairly elevated reputation in America. Whether it be the pioneering work of the early French and German masters, or the new wave, there is an annoying deference for European film, which in turn has tainted European cinema and threatened to forever consign it to the dreary shores of social realism. Whether you considered this a good thing or an annoyance will impact your perception of the Jeunet-Caro revolution.Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro represented a clean break with contemporary French - and by extension Western European - cinema. They seemed not to follow in the footsteps of Godard and Truffaut, but to revel in the rich tradition of French "bande dessinées" that gave us the likes of Moebius. After applying this heightened, busy aesthetic to their breakout hit Delicatessen, the duo upped the ante with their follow-up.City of Lost Children is one of the most unique fairy tales committed to film. It fully commits to its ideas with an unapologetic, un-sarcastic tone, and manages to build its own, completely self-sustaining inner logic: mad scientist Krank can no longer dream so he kidnaps orphans to steal their dreams, but unfortunately, his mere presence turns those dreams into nightmares. He is about to lose hope when his minions (all clones of his former master) bring him a fear-proof toddler. Hot on the child's trail, though, is his older streetwise sister, her gang of street-rats and circus freak One (Ron Perlman).What raises the odd eyebrow at best on paper works wonders on the screen, in what is the most singular world and myth-building this side of Tim Burton. Jeunet and Caro throw in everything but the kitchen sink, to such a degree that there was nothing left to subsequently do but part ways. This artistic triumph is the lasting legacy of that short-lived, brilliant union.In short: a treasure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a work of art- it mixes humor with a sort of dreamy essence, the acting is great and the set/costumes are amazing. If you liked this, you'd also like Delicatessen. Dominique Pinon is excellent, as is Ron Perlman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where fantasy and love meet perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personal Rating: 10 out of 10 Jean-Pierre Jeneaut, one of the most important French and worldwide directors, directed this wonder called La Cité des enfants perdus, with this movie he opens the door of love to all the sci-fi fans out there, making the perfect mixture between science fiction and love stories. The film introduces a new and weird world, some kind of apocalyptic future, the city of the lost children is a very dark place, similar to Dark City, but this city is trapped in the middle of a non-stop French blues, where the orphans need to steal in order to get accommodation in their asylums, and where the cloned sons of a dead group of researchers need children's dreams to fulfill their existence. As usual in Jean-Pierre Jeneaut movies, the photography work is more than awesome, just perfect, the contrast of the film can't get you better in the film, the colors are just wonderful, and help the overall fantasy appearance. The plot is one of the best points, the relation between One (Ron Perlman) and Miette (Judith Vittet) is genial, you really think of Miette as the typical defenceless young sister and One as the typical strong and not very clever big brother. Although his appearance, One has a very big hearth, and loves Miette as a Sister. The problems with movies where children have a very important part, is the children's acting, and City of the lost children has a 9 year old Miette as main character. However, the acting of this young actress is magnificent, she never seems to be a little child saying adult-made lines. And Ron Perlman is the best big guy with bigger heart ever seen in the celluloid history. In conclusion, La Cité des enfants perdus is a perfect film, just able to be cataloged as BEAUTIFUL MOVIE. For me, the best movie ever, even better than Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain or Delicatessen, they just get the lost children formula to other worlds, but the first and the best will always be La Cité des enfants Perdus. I'll always be in love with this movie, is just... PERFECT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I first looked at this movie was due to a trailer provided on one of my Terry Gilliam DVD's. Boy, I'm glad I did. This movie's visual look and feel is reminiscent of a 30's Sci-fi adventure, but with a great story and a dark story.One thing. As tempting as it is to watch this movie in English, I strongly urge you to watch it in French with English subtitles. Much of the beauty of this movie is Daniel Emilfork's performance as Krank. The tone of his voice is beautiful in it's own creepy way.Ron Perlman is great as the gentle giant One. He really got in great shape for this. Dominique Pinon is brilliant in the 7 rolls he plays. Judith Vittet and Ron Perlman have a great chemistry, in spite of the fact that in real life they had no common language to communicate in (Ron speaks only English, and Judith only spoke French at the time). The twins they got to play the octopus worked so well together, you believed they were that way. And Delicatessin's Jean-Claude Dreyfus was a pleasure as the flea trainer.The plot may be about stealing dreams, but this movie is what nightmare worlds are all about. My only criticism is they were a little blatant with the initial setup of the characters (with Uncle Irvin's "story"), though it does speed up the start.Foreign films are a hard subject for some. Many hate subtitles, and many hate watching out of sync dialog cause by poor language dubs. But this movie is great, well worth the "effort".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have not seen this in a few years (like myself) or even in the last 6 months, get thee to a video store now.I figured for quite a while that DELICATESSEN was a better movie. I was so wrong. In fact, I won't say this is one of the greatest movies ever, but I will say, this is a PERFECT movie. Nothing out of place, nothing wrong, and includes everything right. The only thing missing are the tears. If this film made me cry, it would definitely become a film I watched weekly. As it is, I must simply stand back agasp at it, in awe and wonder.Often you will read comparisons with Terry. This film makes Terry seem like a hack, like the maker of "Not another Teen Movie" (which I haven't seen, thank you). Yes, Terry definitely influenced the film making, like Hitchcock influenced everybody. But to make such a superb film, such a wonder, to go so far beyond Brazil in such a short time....Go out right now and get the movie. If everything is closed, drive to new york and rent it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A visual experience, a perfect illusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surely every child has dreamed that it should be Christmas every day, a continous flow of joy and happiness. But when Santa shows up, not in one or two, five, ten but hundreds of copies, the child doesn't laugh anymore, the child cries with fear and agony. Then the dream transforms into a nightmare.In La cité des enfants perdus (The City of Lost Children), Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caros' latest movie, an evil man and his companions, consisting of a sect of blind men and a brain in an aquarium (!), kidnap children to steal their dreams. The good is represented by "the strong man", called One, who is looking for his abducted baby brother (in fact a child he had found in a garbage can). Soon we meet a little girl. Through a nightmare landscape filled with torture-looking dream laboratories, dirty alleys and slough sewer water, the hunt for the dream thieves is conducted.The story resembles, in some parts, a well known children's story, Alice in Wonderland (AiW). In this story we also meet a little girl, in this case Miette, who is walking through a dream like landscape and, just like Alice, Miette meets the most grotesque figures like the laughing Siamese twins (a sneering cat in AiW) and the opium smoking stooge (an opium smoking toad in AiW). But this is a disillusioned and cunning Alice, an Alice in Wonderland roving in a futuristic nightmare. In contrast to Alice, Miette is not filled with expectation and curiousity of what to come in the new world, which easily could be the world of grown-ups. You get a feeling, from all the children, that they, including Miette, are more disillusioned than the grown-ups. To grow up is not a goal for these children. A dream forms into a nightmare and La cité des enfants perdus becomes a metaphor and not only for the children's lost illusions but for the entire world's lost innocence. This movie is a visual experience, a perfect illusion.The musical score was made by Angelo Badalamenti, who made the score for Blue Velvet, a movie by David Lynch. And the amazing costumes were made by Jean-Paul Gaultier.</fullReview>

Truly a visionary masterpiece, this film stays in the mind's eye long after it is gone.CGI's, so often misused, here are used in the most remarkable way: a CGI flea is a character.It is in the characters that one falls in love with the film. There is a sense of FACE, each human face is so remarkable, so intrinsically interesting to gaze upon, ugly, beatific, each singular, that one can forget the remarkable sets, costumes and make up. This is not a cookie cutter pretty boy Hollywood film.The actors are superb.

		<shortDescription>A triumph of fantasy and imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always loved original movies, especially weird ones. The kind of movies you think "how the hell did he come up with that?" after you've seen it. La Cité des Enfants Perdus is definitely such movieIt beats Being John Malkovich in being original and completely bizarre. This fairy tale for grown ups is a absurd, grotesque and so surrealistic that you'll not even believe you're eyes in some part. The special effects is breathtaking which contributes to the visual part of the filmI've heard that they build up almost a whole city inside a film studio to make this movie. They did a great job with the set because it looks really cool. Sometimes a little frightening"How the hell did he come up with that?" is the question you'll be asking yourself. If you could take your mind of the movie, that is. Because as I told you it is truly breathtaking. Caro and Jeunet are two people with extremely strange minds (you should see their previous movie "Delicatessen", then you'll know what I'm talking about) but somehow it all works out to the best. This movie is a real masterpiece of fantasy, imagination and surrealism with some grotesque and absurd parts. Great special effects, music and camerawork makes this movie one of the biggest work of arts ever madeIf you, as I do, love movies that are really weird and strange you are gonna be so thrilled that you saw this movie. And if you like movies at all you'll be happy as well</fullReview>

Every single frame looks like a work of art - you could actually sell postcards with those images. Thats a movie that really deserves oscars and people's attention, but not all those "innovative" films that are secondary to this masterpiece. Even "Dark City" - the movie that most people thought was artsy and atmospheric, looks like a rip-off of this one. Take my advise - if you really love cinema and if you like when the movie looks like nothing you ever seen - rent "THE CITY..." or buy it as i did.</fullReview>

Like Gilliam's Brazil, there is a message, albeit a rather opaque one. The storyline is bizarre (in the French meaning of that overused adjective) but immensely satisfying. Ron Perleman as the confused strongman in quest for the kidnapped youngster is both sympathetic and determined. There are lots of twists and turns, wonderful settings and moody surrealistic characters. This is one you'll want to see again and again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird &amp; Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-Pierre Jeunet &amp; Marc Caro, perhaps better known for 'Delicatessen' &amp; ('sans' Caro) 'Alien: Resurrection', have here created a mini-masterpiece, a film that is not only visually stunning but is also deeply involving, touching, macabre, &amp; probably the most wonderfully inventive &amp; imaginative film I've ever seen.If ever a dream was made real &amp; filmed, then cross-bred with cinematic conventions such as plot &amp; characterisation I think this film would come very close to the end product. This film starts in a child's dream, has a central theme of dreams, &amp; looks like a dream. It is shot in gritty 'ultrareal' locations - crime-ridden, rat-infested, poverty-stricken docks &amp; their surrounding hovels - yet every scene conveys an unreal, dreamlike quality that completely belies it's setting: much like a dream on screen. The characters are weird &amp; wonderful, a lot of them looking as if they come from a circus freak show (which many do). It could be described as surreal, but in it's context I don't think it is: it obeys the internal 'logic' of a dream come nightmare where anything &amp; everything is possible.This film is hard to classify but I think it belongs in the 'cyber-punk' sci-fi genre - characterised by a world of advanced technology but also one of decay, hardship &amp; anarchy. However, unlike most films of that ilk ('Blade Runner' is the best example), this film rather than being set in the future seems to have gone back in time to the Victorian era. The lifestyles, clothing &amp; poverty of the inhabitants of the docks is very Dickensian, &amp; the advanced technology looks more like weird &amp; wonderful contraptions that could have come straight out of a Jules Verne book. So perhaps this is the so far sole example of the 'French Victorian Cyber-Punk Sci-Fi' genre!There is a host of weird, wonderful &amp; freakish characters here: on a rig in the harbour behind a mine-field live the failed human experiments of a now absent mad inventor's efforts to create his own family outside of the more traditional methods. Head of the house is a monster of a man named Krank who has aged prematurely due to his inability to dream; there are ? a dozen midget clones who suffer from somnambulism (here translated as 'sleeping sickness'); the woman who was meant to be the wife is even smaller; &amp; 'Uncle Irvine' is a migraine-ridden disembodied brain that is still able to see, hear &amp; speak.On the shore there are religious cultists named Cyclopes, who upon joining are fitted with an artificially enhanced eye &amp; ears; evil conjoined twins (who I'm sure were influenced by Cora &amp; Clarice from Mervyn Peake's 'Gormenghast' books); a drunken flea-trainer; a simple-minded strongman named One; his very young omnivorous adopted brother Denree; &amp; a gang of child thieves led by a young girl named Miette - among others.The Cyclopes capture children under 5 who are then taken to Krank's rig where they are hooked up to machines along with Krank so he can attempt to experience their dreams. Not surprisingly - except to Krank &amp; his 'family' - the dreams are always nightmares, Krank's quest remains unfulfilled &amp; his premature ageing continues.When One's little brother Denree is taken by the Cyclopes he, along with Miette, sets out to find &amp; rescue him.If this sounds weird &amp; confusing that's probably because it is! The plot is somewhat convoluted &amp; hard to follow, &amp; the freakishness of a lot of the characters I'm sure many people will find off-putting. On the other hand this is definitely one of those movies which benefits from repeated viewings: it has such richness, depths &amp; attention to detail that you will almost certainly notice something different or view it in a different light every time you watch it.The sumptuous cinematography is one of the outstanding features of this gem of a film - visually this is stunning: every scene looks like a painting; dark &amp; moody but at the same time vividly colourful.However, what I most love about this film is it's wonderfully imaginative inventiveness. There is so much to admire &amp; enjoy here, &amp; I don't want to spoil things by recounting too many, but there are delightful ideas &amp; tricks here that I doubt I will see anywhere else. Here are a few examples:A 'bird's-eye' viewpoint is a common thing in film; here Jeunet &amp; Caro give us a 'flea's-eye' view: at several points in the film the action is viewed as if from a flea as it leaps from post to post, hitches a ride on a passing dog then settles in someone's hair. Wonderfully inventive, &amp; also great SFX.There are some great tricks with perspective to do with the fact that the Cyclopes can swap their eyes with each other, enabling them to see themselves from another's viewpoint.My favourite character(s), the 'Octopus twins' as they are known, are wonderful - 1 being with 2 heads, 3 legs &amp; 4 arms all over the place - &amp; have to be seen to be appreciated - especially the rather unique way they have of smoking a cigarette!In what has become one of my all-time favourite movie sequences, a protracted chain of events is set off by a teardrop flying from a child's eye &amp; culminates with a huge icebreaker ship smashing the dock - wonderful stuff.One final note on the dilemna you always have with foreign-language films of dubbed vs. subtitles. Having seen both I still don't know which I prefer. You lose a lot of the character's personalities when their voices are done by someone other than the actor - for instance the child who did the English voiceover for Miette was awful, whereas the French actress (Judith Vittet) I thought was superb - &amp; should have a great future. It's also disconcerting when the actors' mouths &amp; their words are out of synch. On the other hand having to read subtitles means you aren't able to see as much of the film itself, which in a film of this visual style &amp; detail is a big disadvantage. Maybe I should just learn French &amp; watch the original language version - this film is so good it's almost worth doing just for that reason!There is so much to this movie I found it hard to describe, &amp; even as I was writing it all sounded a bit like a load of French arty-farty weirdness. It IS weird, but also wonderful, &amp; if you can get past that or (like me) even enjoy it &amp; the complicated plot you will find a film that is unique, rich, rewarding, refreshing &amp; hugely entertaining. I personally rate this is one of my all-time favourites - highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning, blackly comic fantasy noir with extra darkly funny bits</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps even darker than Delicatessen, though with arguably less gore, City of the Lost Children is in a class of its own in the gorgeous, hideous visuals oozing across the screen. The fantasy style that made Deli such a delight is turned up to the max, the whole movie shot through with amazingly intricate weirdness that makes you really believe it was filmed in the sweaty imagination of a visionary lunatic. The story, simple and yet convoluted as befits a fantasy fairy tale, follows the fantastic, stone-faced Ron Perlman through the clammy greens and sticky browns of a nightmare world, inhabited by a delightful collection of freaks and evildoers, trying to save the angelic child from the crazed Emilfork and his City of Lost Children, hampered at every turn by the gang of street urchins and their wicked siamese Fagins. This is just an excuse for the visual exuberance, the fabulous sets and storming camera work that make every frame of this film a must-see. The chain-of-random-events scene is sheer genius on a par with some of the set-ups in Delicatessen, and the tame mosquito is unbelievable. The children are indeed cherubic and perform well, Pinon is superbly rubber-faced in his multiple roles, and moments of hilarity, suspense and sentiment are well balanced, making this a superb film, a worthy successor to the magnificent Delicatessen and deserving of every award in the book. If you don't know French just soak in the voices (whatever you do don't see a dubbed version), let the Pinon's manic squeaking and just about everyone else's sombre rumbling wash over you, floating you away, like the visuals do, into a wonderful, superbly realised world of madness, tragedy and joy. Joy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie! I saw a preview for it on Monty Python and the Holy Grail, of all places, and was intrigued enough to order the DVD. Great call. This movie captures the imagination with its completely original storyline and incredible visuals. I swear they had to have built an entire city just for this movie. I don't know how they accomplished it on the typical budget for a European film. The plot? I don't think I could describe it. Not doing any justice, at least. A big part of the fun is untangling the many unusual characters and figuring out how they relate to one another.My favorite subtle trick of the movie? The casting: A horde of perfectly gorgeous children contrasted against the ugliest bunch of adults one could hope to find (Notable exception - the hot French lady in the bar). This movie encourages repeat viewings, as each will lead to a better understanding of the complex, odd world that has been created.9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece without any doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I was struck by an unusual feeling; I didn't like it, while I couldn't stop seeing it! At the end of the movie, I declared to myself that it was not good. Yet, I found myself talking for this movie, to everyone I met on the next couple of days! I talked about how "different" this movie was, and how great visuals it had etc. Later on I discovered that it wasn't that I didn't like it; it was just the outstanding experience of seeing something you're not used to seeing, and something you just don't expect to see...This movie is a masterpiece. I would recommend it to everyone as "a must". It is the colors that are amazing, it is the time that cannot be defined, it is the city that it is almost deserted, it is the dark night and the glowing water, it is the out of this world visual effects, it is the beautiful music, it is ART.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A SLAP in the face of Hollywood that looks more like a beating!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>La Cité des enfants perdus (LCDEP),is a MASTERPICE ! In all possible meanings !First it´s the best special effects movie ever. For a simple reason. We get to the end of this movie and ONLY THEN we realise that we were watching special effects for almost two hours! Normally in an american Hollywood movie, we think WOW everytime we see a good special effect, and we know when to think WOW. In LCDEP the special effects are used to create a world and not to make us admire them all the time. Here they are used to create the story and it is the story wich is the true spectacle here not just the effects. The whole final product is one WOW ! Not fragmented parts like in the enormal Hollywood special effects flic, where we can divide a movie into sections, the actors, the special effects ,etc. In LCDEP there is no way we can separate a particular aspect of the movie, because all is so choerent. This is a brilliant work ! One of the best movies i ever saw. True, the story can be weird, but that´s exactly the appeal of this movie. It makes us want to see it again. I know people who claim to have hated this movie, but all went to see it again. And for some strange reason, they all like it now.Anyway, this is a brilliant piece of work. Probably the most beautiful movie ever filmed in visual terms. The story is very original and incredible, with a very haunting atmosphere all over. It´s like watching an haunted fairy-tale sometimes.This is one of the best fantasy movies ever. Sometimes it reminds me of the atmosphere in Company of Wolves. I bet everything that the makers of Dark City (another good movie), were inspired by this movie !The actors are fantastic, specially the little girl, which is already a great actress, and Ron Pearlman is excellent as usual.I hate sequels, but i wish Jeunet and Caro would make a sequel for this movie.Brilliant stuff !Hollywood, take notes, this is the way to create a fantastic fantasy movie. Learn !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, combined with the great director/actor/producing, is one of the top 100 films of all time.It combines magic, mystery, and childhood fantasy... wraps them up in a small blanket and keeps you warm throughout. Dominique Pinon brings with her to the screen something that was near lost in the thirties, A child with a brain. It's hard to imagine that such a young person could have the intelligence to make a movie. And on the subject of Ron Perlman... The human special effect.At any rate, the visuals in this movie just absolutely astound everyone and anyone who see them. The characters brought to life by Jeunet and crew are never forgotten. And the movie itself is 10/10 on my "should not be missed" list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is what all fantasy writers are dreaming of.The whole film is set around a perfectly made set. This set adds atmosphere to the whole movie and gives it more mystery about the whole film. The acting in this film is wonderful. Ron Perlman plays the part perfectly as the simple strong man. Another acting performance which stood out was Judith Vittet. Her role as Miette was played perfectly and this her first main part in a film. She could go very far if she wanted to. And with acting like that at only the age of 9!!!!!! Although the film is spoken in french you can look at the subtitles at the bottom. This may be a bit annoying the first time you watch the film but after seeing the film a few times u will understand what is going on and you wont need to look at them. Acompanying this brilliant film is also a computer game. It has been released on PC format and also the Playstation. This game is Excellent with graphics that will make your chin drop all the way to the floor. Your take on the role of Miette in this game and it is a hard but rewarding adventure game.ALL IN ALL THIS IS A WONDERFUL FILM I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE WHAT A MASTERPIECE 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stunning, disturbing, funny &amp; engrossing this movie often seem to defy description. I first saw it without subtitles &amp; was so enthralled that I went away &amp; learnt French!You may not like it though, as it ploughs it's own furrow using none of the preconceptions of Hollywood &amp; as for the story, well... I'll leave that up to you to decide. The look &amp; feel of the film is very, very dark, twisted, nighmarish, the product of a fevered mind. This is a world that you could almost believe was one step away from hell. The acting is superb, with Ron Perlman (he of Vincent in the TV series Beauty &amp; the Beast) copes well with the French script &amp; the children are impish, tinged with a little evil. Fortunately none of them ever gives us a Hollywood "cute kid" routine.All in all, for me, top marks for what must be one of the classics of French cinema, indeed of world cinema. Prepare to be stunned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just so totally beautiful, the only other movie which comes close is Luc Besson's "Léon" (The Professional), interestingly another French movie. The story is fantastic - set in a dark, Vernesque "steam-punk" era, similar to that of Gilliam's masterpiece "Brazil", and you can probably be sure some of "Dark City" came from the visions in this film. The relationship between Miette (played by Vittet), a confident young orphan girl, and One (Perlman), a huge strong-man is played out so beautifully and tenderly, it will make you cry. This film was apparently one of the most expensive and effect-rich French films ever conceived, but you probably won't even notice as the characters blend seamlessly into this fantasy, fairy-tale world which leaves your head swirling with it's tight mixture of sorrow, happiness and crazy surrealism. Watch it, then come back here and vote the "10" you know it deserves.</fullReview>

Jeunet and Caro's "La Cit? des enfants perdus" is without a doubt one of those rare motion pictures. It manages to capture our wildest dreams on film, the fantasies we only thought we could imagine in our sleep has in fact been crammed up into this brilliant, evokative, haunting masterpiece, thanks to some stunning (FASCINATING!) set decorations -which of course was ignored by the Oscar Academy- a fantastic cast: in particular giant Ron Perlman, young Judith Vittet, Daniel Emilfork, Dominique Pinon (who plays at least 5 characters), and the most incredible little group of kids.

		<fullReview>What more can be said about this movie? The words "darkly beautiful" become a little redundant. City of Lost Children combines the mood of some of Roald Dahl's more twisted stories and the visuals of a Terry Gilliam tour-de-force with a uniquely European lushness. Comparisons with with movies like "Dark City"(which it predates) are obvious, but when all is said and done, this is a much more intensely original, visual, complete, and above all, magical, piece of filmmaking. It clearly transcends any sci-fi/fantasy genre to take its place in a league more perhaps with films like Kurosawa's "Dreams" It is a film that still manages to inspire emotion in spite of being a little nasty, but never enough to dispel your sense of childlike wonder.I don't know where charges of plot incomprehensibility come from... it all makes a perfect internal sense, an odyssey in a 1920's rusting industrial cyberpunk dreamworld.Having viewed this movie both on the large screen, with wonderful english subtitles (resembling an aging typewriter font, fitting in perfectly, rather than detracting from the atmosphere), and on non-widescreen video with horrendous english dubbing, I can safely say it loses a lot in the transition. In its pure form, the sensuality of the characters' luscious gutter-french, and art direction beautiful enough to make your eyes cry blood tears, this is a visionary film you will never forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film a number of times now, yesterday I was lucky enough to see it on the big screen. I think it is one of the most creative and underrated films I have ever seen.The criticism I hear most often is that it tells an incomprehensible story and relies too heavily on its 'weird' visuals. Personally I think that the plot and characters are all consistent, and while not exactly straight forward certainly not ununderstandable. This is a film which takes place in another world. A strange world it is too, but accepting that all the characters and situations are consistent with the world they inhabit. It does require more thought than the average film, but not by an unreasonable amount.The cast are perfect, stand outs are Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon (in all his roles) and Judith Vittet as the sassy street thief Miette. The visuals are stunning and beautiful, the story and characters are more original than almost anything esle you'll ever have seen before.The whole thing combines to make a perfect fairy tale for grown ups. Do yourself a favour and see this film. It's a magical way to spend a few hours!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever made? That's what I think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, yes, with English subtitles you feel a little distant from this film on first viewing. But once you watch it a second (or third or fourth etc . ..) time, the subtitles become less important and you are able to spend up to 90% of your energy watching the visual (instead of reading the text).Once the language barrier has been broken down, this film manifests as it truly is: breathtaking cinematography, insanely detailed production design, beyond Oscar acting (from children as well as adults), captivating story, and other wise all around cool flick!I feel for these people; Ron Perlman as "One" the Forrest Gump-like strong man in search of his adopted "little brother." Judith Vittet as "Miette" the street thief who's been forced to mature way too fast for her tender years. Their chemistry and character fool you into the film's reality.Like Shakespeare, everyone in this story has their positive and negative side. You can forgive the heroes their weaknesses just as you can understand the villains' motivations.This film is in no way "American." It is uniquely European and therefore much more difficult for the average American movie viewer to follow or get into. But if you liked films like "Brazil," "Eraserhead," "Blad Runner," "12 Monkeys," "Dune," and so on (if you've seen any of these, you can guess the atmosphere of this film) then you MUST SEE THIS FILM.Just remember, unless you speak French you should watch this movie at the very least 2 times. Probably at least 3 and most likely 4 before you have enough of a command of what the dialogue means to simply watch the visual action on the screen instead of reading the subtitles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The poor masterpiece became so demented he thought a teardrop could save him."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Style over substance. 'The City of Lost Children (1995)' is one of the most visually-exciting films to emerge from the 1990s ? constructing an elaborate fantasy world of the weird and wonderful ? but, unfortunately, it often feels rather hollow and purposeless. French co-directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet were already well-known for their distinctive visual style, having previously achieved success with the post-apocalyptic black comedy 'Delicatessen (1991),' and this film, the last of their collaborations, only extends their fascination with blending surrealism and fantasy into a veritable feast for the eyes and the imagination. The story unfolds in a gloomy, greenish-tinted industrial world ? closer to an alternative universe than any futuristic dystopia ? and concerns, in a twisted, twenty-first century take on an age-old formula, a keen inventor who attempts to fashion his own family using bizarre scientific methods. Caro and Jeunet fill the screen with grotesque human figures, apparently delighting in the stark contrast created between the weathered, disfigured features of the adult characters, and the soft youthfulness of the large cast of child performers.On an ominous oil-rig in the centre of a green, polluted ocean, an eccentric inventor (Dominique Pinon) has attempted to craft a family for himself, with ghastly results at every turn: his would-be wife is stunted and dwarfish, his "brain-in-a-tank" intellectual companion suffers constant migraines, the six clones "created in his own image" are clumsy and idiotic, and his supreme creation ? "more intelligent then the most intelligent man on Earth" ? is stricken with one disastrous flaw ? the inability to dream. Depressed and tormented by his shortcomings, this masterpiece creation, Krank (Daniel Emilfork) ? who was obviously inspired by Mary Shelley's Frankenstein Monster ? rebels against his maker, tossing him into the ocean and presumably killing him. In order to stave off the aging process, Krank has taken to kidnapping children and attempting to experience their innocent dreams, those the torment of imprisonment results in little but horrible nightmares. When the "little brother" of a dim but kind-hearted strongman, One (American actor Ron Perlman), is kidnapped by a cult of sinister blind men in Krank's service, he strikes out in pursuit, willing to stop at nothing.'The City of Lost Children' is part "Frankenstein," part "Oliver Twist" and part 'Labyrinth (1986),' a bewildering amalgamation of fantasy concepts, and an exceptional master-class in cinematography and set-design. Though there are a good share of brilliant storytelling moments ? such as the elaborate sequence in which a single teardrop saves the lives of our principal characters ? it never really comes together as a whole, and often the whole tale is so preposterous that you're not sure what exactly in going on. Daniel Emilfork, with his gaunt, pale face and empty eyes, makes for an excellent villain, though I preferred his character when the film didn't steep too deeply into tongue-in-cheek absurdity. Ron Perlman, the one actor you'd never cast in an elegant Shakespearian period-piece, is very much at home in the bizarre trappings of Caro and Jeunet's elaborately-twisted universe, and does very well considering he was the only American involved in the film's production. Of course, I think it's safe to say that young Judith Vittet steals the show, delivering an extraordinarily confident and heartfelt performance as a street urchin who finds, in One, a guardian and best friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful film, a surreal fairy tale, with a quite interesting metaphorical story. It might be necessary to be a bit of a linguist to fully understand all of the subtleties in this film, but even if you're not, you should be able to understand something deeper is going on besides a "weird" or "pretty" movie. The cinematography is brilliant, as is the music and acting. What is most fascinating is the writing- It takes a simple story and with subtle clues and symbols, tells another story.Big Brother, (named One), is looking for little brother, Denree, after he has been kidnapped by the Cyclops. One and Miette (a street wise orphan) set off an an adventure to leads them to Krank (whose name means 'sick' in German). Krank and the Clones have been working closely with the Cyclops to kidnap children so Krank can steal their dreams.If you are simple minded, stick to Hollywood action flicks where they spell everything out for you. If you enjoy thinking a bit, watch this movie. You'll be amazed at the clues and hints in the language, the characters names and events... (If you think 'One' and 'Krank' are weird names, start pulling out your dictionaries and looking up the others!) and how they are metaphorical for something else...</fullReview>

While this film was at times hard to follow, the density to the story and the plot kept you engrossed, even if the slow pacing tends to veer you off the story.as a film, The City of Lost Children certainly lives up to its art cinema stamp, and it's indelible uniqueness will aid in its remembrance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film and "Amelie" are two of my most favorite films--both by Jeunat. I think they are both about Hope. Jeunat has a way of revealing character that is unsurpassed in my opinion. You sit there watching, thinking, hoping that you would do the same as his heroes. They have such courage. There is no doubt in their minds of what to do to help a child, or an old man. They step up to the task. One (in "City"), played by Ron Perlman, the American actor in the French cast, sets off to find the missing little boy who has come each day to watch him do his circus strongman act. That moment when he steps down from his 6-inch-high platform and into the "real" world to put his strength to test, it isn't his physical strength he uses, but his strength of heart. To help him in his task he gains the trust of a street kid who otherwise would never ever trust anyone after all the abuse she's suffered. A moment follows that I will not reveal, but to me it is the most devastating moment in all of cinema--something you would never see in an American movie. This is my favorite movie of all time. It exploits the medium as good art does, it has a sympathetic bad guy and an ideal, but still human, good guy--everything I could hope for in a great movie.</fullReview>

City of Lost Children is another fantasy with a mad scientist abducting children and stealing their dreams. The cast is wide ranging and the usual odd ball characters portrayed in Jeunet's other works. I was exhausted by the visual throw everything up on the screen and try to follow this marathon of strange behavior. The most interesting role is that of the circus strong man, One(Ron Perlman), who is a good guy trying to rescue the children from the bad doctor. The sets are intricate and colorful but the twists and turns of the story are overdone, without Amelie's wit and charm to save it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little boy wakes up in the middle of the night to see Santa Claus coming through the chimney. He's delighted, as any boy would be, because of the gifts he may receive. But then a strange thing happens: another Santa materializes out of the chimney. And another. And another. Soon, they're popping out from everywhere, rein-deers and all. The boy, terrified now, starts crying. And then he gets a good glimpse of who the man behind the Santa outfit is....This man is Krank, a scientist who could scare the bejesus out of anyone. He's screaming, too, but for a different reason: he can't dream, even when he's sucked the life out of this little boy who he's kidnapped. As a matter of fact, he's in the habit of kidnapping little children and stealing their dreams in order to delay his own aging. One of the boys he decides to set his eyes on is Denree, the adopted brother of a circus strongman named One. Employing some sinister men who wear magnifying cameras as super-lenses, they kidnap the kid... only One wants him back and isn't about to sit still.But it won't be easy, not in this Paris of the future, perpetually smothered in a dank fog, with rivers of a stinking green color and an overall aura of desolation and despair. There are other interests as well, like the two Siamese twins who call themselves the Octopus and train children how to steal for their own benefit. Among these children is a girl, Miette, whose path crosses that of One, and who knows who's behind these kidnappings.CITY OF LOST CHILDREN moves with an uneven pacing and takes its time to get to where it wants to go because of the many intertwining story lines, one of them involving cloned henchmen played by Dominque Pinon who continually ask a brain which lives inside a fish tank if they are the "one" (unaware that the real man is out there, underwater, in a diver's suit). One of these henchmen have the task of telling Krank stories so he can fall asleep. Another storyline involves the Octopus' employment of a man who trains a flea to do some interesting things and create havoc.The movie looks gorgeous. Futuristic dystopias would relish the textured atmosphere as the city seems to drown itself in murk and dankness. In what I disagree strongly is to the need to film children crying as they're being literally tormented with the presence of Krank: it's enough that this is a story about children's dreams being taken from them in horrible ways, but to see in a protracted scene that the six henchmen and Krank torment three children as they sing an upbeat tune -- and we see them not only crying but bawling their eyes out, reacting to whatever the director told them to -- is bad enough. It hints at a level of sadism in using children as bait to get an effect I'm not okay with.Another minor complaint is the use of comic relief when it's not needed. The Octopus go to the character played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus for his assistance. His dog, which plays an important part in his services, is shown on two occasions licking the actor's foot up close. The displacing technique has been done before for laughs -- here, it's just bad. I think that this is due to the fact that the filmmakers wanted to go for a 12 MONKEYS effect: a lunatic, eccentric feel with quirky elements here and there. It's true that this film and Gilliam's film look a lot alike, but I prefer Gilliam's over this one.So overall, a good film, uneven, disturbing for the use of children in scenes involving torture, technically dazzling, but a little too convoluted, as would be ALIEN: RESURRECTION for me to truly like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great visuals and interesting premise, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It leaves me wanting. I just rented this movie after reading all of the rave reviews on this site and others. People talked about a movie reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's "Brazil" in terms of the look and feel, and when I saw that the director did "Amelie", one of my favorite movies, I was intrigued needless to say. However, while the visuals were definitely reminiscent of a Gilliam work, the screenplay and the acting was sorely lacking. Don't get me wrong; I thought the idea was fine - I just don't think that the script was properly hashed out for a story that strove for something so grandiose. And while there are elements of humor, horror, and surreality interspersed throughout the picture, these genres are touched on in a far less subtle way than in a Gilliam production.On the plus side, I loved the way this world was created; the mix between pseudo-futuristic and ancient technology led to a feeling of timelessness, while the dark lighting gave this film, so obsessed with dreams and the ethereal qualities of the human soul, the proper "shadow" through which to explore these themes. I liked some of the techniques used to keep the viewer enthralled. For instance, the scene where Miette's tear starts a chain of events which alters the fates of her and One was unique and well-done, albeit slightly contrived. The Siamese twins were hilarious. The smoking octopus. The idea of the murderous dancing fleas, also very well done and unique.However, for me the whole of this movie is less than the some of its parts. Dialogue is sparse, and for a movie with such an esoteric plot, this is not necessarily a good thing. I also thought much of the acting left a lot to be desired; One (Ron Perlman) was pedestrian, and many of the supporting characters were guilty of overacting. I did not care for Krank (Daniel Emilfork) at all - while I thought he looked the part, he was by no means convincing as the arch-villain in mind or mannerisms. On the other hand, I thought Judith Vittet (Miette) and Dominique Pinon (the merman/the clones) were excellent.One the whole, I thought the concept and the visual aspect of the movie was great - but the banal script and mostly sub-par acting really ruined it for me. I would say that this was a grand effort for Caro and Jeunet, but an effort that ultimately failed. See it if you want to watch something completely different than what you are used to, and see it for the outstanding sets and gadgets. However, don't rent this if you are looking for a true sci-fi masterwork on par with Brazil -chances are you will be hugely disappointed.5/10</fullReview>

Sit through it again and I bet your rating of it will increase, even ifit was very high in the first place. However, if you know you are amiddle of the road kind of person you might want to move on and findsomething less complex and surreal. At least wait until you are in amood to concentrate and be entranced. If you'd like a more gentle entry into getting comfortable with thisfilm, you could start with Amelie, followed by Delicatessen a couple oftimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, this one definitely caught me off guard. I was expecting a freakish steampunk film in the vein of 'MirrorMask', only with a more visceral edge, due to the more mature rating. What I got was a tepid, bloated turkey of a French flick that occasionally threw out neat images but was largely preoccupied with meandering around. It's muddled, boring, and largely unsatisfying, which strikes me even more strange since so many people on this site are asserting that it's genius.The plot is about children who get kidnapped by the vile scientist Krank, who can't dream. He runs his child-kidnapping racket from an oil derrick out in the middle of a sea with green water, hiring Borg-like religious zealots to nap kiddies for his nefarious designs. So, yawn, Ron Perlman's little brother gets kidnapped, he tracks him down with the help of a thieving little girl, etc, etc. I was crushed by how empty this movie was, after hearing such good things about it and anticipating its arrival on Netflix. And it really could have done without the R rating. Seriously, it would have been PG-13 due to some language and some brief violence had a brief sequence of topless women been left on the cutting room floor. Breasts, huzzah. At that junction in the film, it came like a last ditch effort to secure my rapidly waning attention. And it really isn't that weird. Yes, it is more imaginative than 95% of most movies nowadays. But if you really want to know weird, watch MirrorMask or read China Mieville. Just stay away from this torpid slug.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both Appealing And Unappealing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For someone who loves wild visuals, I should have loved this film, but I found it too far out and simply very unappealing.Yes, it's visually stunning but the story is disjointed. to say the least. If a viewer - and I am not alone in this opinion - is almost totally lost as to what's going on for almost the entire film, you don't care after awhile. And when you don't care what's going on, you lose interest no matter how good the visuals are. At least, that's how I found this movie. Now I am judging this on the VHS version. Perhaps the DVD makes this so stunning that I wouldn't care about the story, just being entertained by the visuals....but I haven't seen it on disc yet so I don't have an answer to that. I do remember the characters being too grungy and no one being particularly likable. The dubbing in here also was horrible. Hopefully, the DVD offers subtitles, instead. One reviewer here said to give this movie a second chance, and perhaps that's the answer. If I do, and like the film, I'll delete this review.</fullReview>

He has an unusual look (not ugly, just different) and has used it to angle for some great roles in fantastic film. This one, of course, but also "Hellboy" and others. He is an unlikely success story, and good for him! And these guys make such good films, with a beautiful cinematography and a blend of the surreal and the fantastic. And plenty of humor. Arguably, "Amelie" is their best, but this is great, and so is "Delicatessen". It would be hard to pick just one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is both very simple and so complicated at the same time, set in a steam punk city with no name a mad scientist named Krank has set up a lab on an oil rig on the outskirts of the city. Krank has a gang of Cyclops men. A gang who are blind in one eye and use the aid of a machine to enhance their sight and hearing to kidnap children as young as possible but old enough to dream so that he can steal them and stop him aging, currently Krank is unable to dream and believes stealing the young kids dreams will make him live longer. What Krank doesn't understand though is that because the children are being stolen and scared the dreams they are having are only nightmares. A carnival strong man with a young mentality called One played by Ron Pearlman (Hellboy, Drive) goes searching for his brother Dunree and happens across conjoined twin sisters known as la Pieuvre (the Octopus in English) who send young kids of the city to steal what they can in dead of the night. One joins the thieves and in particular a young girl named Miette for a big steal, he spies his little brother amongst the Cyclops gang and attempts to steal him back. Everything soon changes though the night one of the dreams escapes and enters the city?There is a lot that goes on within this film and I haven't yet mentioned the Midget woman or the clones who constantly bicker about who is the original or even the brain in a box that tends to manipulate everyone it can or the music box that controls fleas. This film is so dark in nature and so amazingly beautiful, the directors took 14 years to bring this idea to film so they have had a lot of thought go into it. It's one of the first films to make full use of CGI as well which is very apparent in some amazing scenes. The unnamed city the story is set in is a very dark and twisted place but again so magnificent in its landscape, the way the city comes together can only been seen to be believed. The score really helps the film along as well, the right music is played in the right places and never gets in the way of anything. City of the Lost Children is filled with wonder and amazement from its opening scenes to its last it's a world within a world where escapism is only limited by your own imagination. The characters that have been developed are intense and so very well played and lastly I'll mention the beautiful cinematography without the close ups, unusual angels and filming techniques this film would most likely be very ordinary its these amazing sequences of footage that really help the film become what it is.Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro not only directed the film but also helped script it as well. The City of Lost Children is a French spoken film but those desperate enough should be able to find an English dubbed version without having to look too hard. Again I will say? Don't bother with the dubbed version you need the actual spoken word to her all the film has to offer within even though it is written words on the bottom of the screen, the language spoken and its tones is gorgeous especially during the sentimental moments.</fullReview>

One (Ron Perlman) is a strong man performer whose little brother Denree is kidnapped by Krank's underlings, the Cyclops. Miette (Judith Vittet) is a young street kid who ends up helping him.This has a lot of weird concepts on display. I can only describe this a outlandish mix of Dickensian poverty and a french grimy Jules Verne sci-fi with a good helping of weird surrealism. The visual is a good unique grim fairy tale but the story drags a little too much. It meanders and is confused. It is in love with its visual surrealism more than trying to make sense with the story. It should be a lot more simpler than what it is. It spends a lot of time luxuriating in the weirdness of the world and the villain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Delicatessen but still very worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The City of Lost Children is the follow up to French directors Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's popular and critical hit Delicatessen. It wasn't as successful as that earlier movie though. But despite not connecting with a wide audience it almost immediately became a cult movie. To date it is the last film that these two cinematic stylists have made together.To be honest, it isn't necessarily surprising that this one didn't do as well commercially as Delicatessen. Despite sharing a lot of visual ideas and having similar humour and general setting, the story by comparison is quite messy and not necessarily clear for a lot of first time viewers. The set-up is considerably more expansive than in Delicatessen though; where that one was almost exclusively based in a single tenement block, this one incorporates many locations ? in the city, under the sea, on a converted oil rig ? and this is really the chief strength of the film. The sets, props and costumes are all very well designed indeed. The look has that quite specific retro-future styling that Caro and Jeunet are so fond of. The detailed set-design, stylised gloomy colour scheme and controlled lighting really works well and creates an atmosphere and tone all of its own. It's the visual ideas that are definitely the real draw here.The story is somewhat less engaging. It's about an evil scientist called Krank who cannot dream. He kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams. He sends out his henchmen, the cyclops, to carry out this evil task. One day they steal the brother of a circus strongman called One who then, with the help of a little girl thief, sets out on a rescue mission. There's a few other things going on in the story but it's not especially brilliant and seems more like a means to an end; a framework that allows the directors to create their visual artistry. Having said that there are individual scenes that are well worked out such as the whole sequence down by the harbour. There are some interesting characters too such as the evil Siamese twins, known simply as The Octopus. Ron Perlman is good enough as One but better is the young performer Judith Vittet as the little thief Crumb, while Dominique Pinon is excellent in the role of the clones ? he is so convincing you really do forget that it isn't four different actors on screen.For me this is not as successful as Delicatessen but it's certainly an extremely worthwhile film. It's a very interesting blend of sci-fi and fantasy and at times it does look quite gorgeous.</fullReview>

The details about the various characters, their appearances, the sets are spell-bounding, turning the movie into a painting on celluloid which you can just enjoy watching even if you know where the story would be heading. Small things like the mysteriously explored relationship of the two leads will give goosebumps to you. The lead actors are perfectly cast in their roles. Judith Vittet was the one who stole the show for me though. She is charming and portrays the complex role of Miette awesomely.All in all a good movie to watch especially if you wanna give treat to your eyes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is one of the best fantasy/sci-fi movies ever made. It can't really be compared with any other movie, but if you're familiar with the work of Jeun-Pierre Jeunet you will definitely recognize his brilliance here. Unlike his previous productions, he's got the budget to realize his vision. Combine this with a strong cast, an elaborate story and French humor at its best, and you've got a timeless masterpiece.The most impressive aspect is probably the breathtaking atmosphere and the acting of the young Judith Vittet. Daniel Emilfork also does a great portrait of the evil scientist Krank. When the movie was released in 1995 the visual effects was of absolute world class. It set a new benchmark for cinematography and even fifteen years down the line, it's able to compete with the visual effects of high budget productions.Not everyone will like this movie, that's for sure. You need to be patient and have an open mind. If you have that you'll be told a fantastic story about the fears of growing old and the power of unconditional love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CITY OF LOST CHILDREN is a very dark, disturbing, dystopian, fantasy with a look and style that is quite striking. The movie begins with a scary dream sequence involving multiple Santa Clauses, and then, the viewer is catapulted directly into the world of the film. It takes quite a while to ascertain exactly what is going on, and why. I felt that the dark, nightmarish quality helped to highlight the affection between the young street urchin, Miette(played by Judith Vittet), and the carnival strongman, One(played by Ron Perlman). Although the film never implies a sexual attraction, you definitely see the world-weary felonious scamp, and big-hearted blockhead nurture a growing respect and understanding for each other. The sets and costumes are outstanding, and the very young actors are quite convincing, however, in the end, the visual extravaganza overshadows the 'human emotions' of the film. And, depending on your mood or taste, this will be a 'plus' or a 'minus'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starting out with an unforgettable opening scene involving Santa Claus, The City of Lost Children subjects us to a bizarrely beautiful surrealist nightmare (or is it a fairytale?) involving a mad scientist who steals children for their dreams, an underground society of mad cyborg Cyclops, an orphanage of child thieves run by an evil pair of Siamese twins, and the childlike strongman One.This was the first French movie filmed exclusively on studio sets in 40 years. The result is a beautiful tapestry of grimy docklands that resembles Charles Dickens on acid. The performances are wonderful, and not just from the adults. The City of Lost Children boasts some of the most imaginative and intricate set pieces of any film - for instance check out the scene where the children enter a locked building using a cat and a mouse, or the scene involving the ship and the Octopus.In short, this is a masterpiece of cinema. And while it may be difficult to follow in some places, it is certainly worth sticking with and watching over and over again. Everything you could want from a film is here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean Pierre Jeunet! A self taught filmmaker! Debut Delicatessen, best debut ever. Then what, Jeunet had to make something new. He and his buddy Caro. Could they do it, was it possible to not disappoint. Yes it was. The City Of Lost Children is and will be top 3 of 90's. In my book that is. The Time of release. Most of us remember, -man it was the 90's. New and exciting, surprises at every corner. And I as a 16 year old, as young as the 90's, if you catch my drift, in my dawning as a movie lover. Spend most of my weekly petty cash and bought a ticket. Mostly because the paper I used to read said that this was a masterpiece! 6 out of 6 stars. Who in their right mind could resist such recommendations. That was the first time, the following weeks I did the same, one could say I spent all my cash on this film. Every week for as long as the movie featured the Copenhagen cinemas, I was there! could not get enough. Why is that? Answer, because it is a good movie, not for everyone, that is for sure, reading what some people have to say, mostly Americans, sorry, is in my mind just open wide stupidity! Because if you take your own time and use your mind, the story is not that confusing. Quite simple really. A mad scientist, his victims, the hero and his girl. The fight between good and evil. What more can one ask for. OK some might point out the fact that One and Miette are lovers! True explosives, but far from ethic and morally decadent. They are not having a sexual relationship, and love knows no boundaries. If decandece and sexual pervertedness is what you seek then watch a Larry Clark Movie or a Harmony Korine Movie. This movie and its makers knows the limit, in my book they know when to quit. Tideland also touches these issues, by Gilliam that is. No no no this is much more refined, and the story goes places and you gladly follow. Here and there you notice small mistakes, not big ones, depending on your view on small mistakes, but these are easily forgiven. For the point of the story never misses, once the bullet has been fired at you. This movie hit me with a machine gun. And now 13 years later I once again own this movie. And yet again WHAT A MOVIE! So much I had to write this. Love never rusts, and seeing this movie for the first time lit up a fire in me. The fire was that I believed in life, with people like Jeunet and Caro this world was on track. All war, hate and violence put aside, the world was a good place where stories like this were told and listened to and cared for. For again it is entertainment, created to light up your mind with fantasy. And to me it is good people doing such things, genuine good people. Here I speak of, off course, Jeunet ét Caro, but also Pearlman doing a good job at portraying a dumb man. A man with a mind of a 9 year old. The other cast Daniel Emilfork! Great actor for a great character! Highly memorable performances by Dominique Pinon. And let's not forget the children, all brilliant! Jean-Paul Gaultier is the wardrobe guy, and the real nice score by Angelo Badalamenti WHO could reject this. In my book you need very strong argumentation to make me even consider changing my mind. Periode. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this at an art-house here in Chicago in 1996 and was beyond overjoyed at the characters and the story. Dingy, dirty, and yet so wonderfully shot. The rag-tag band of little orphan thieves and the big clod circus strongman are so believable as characters you cannot help but fall in love with their idiosyncrasies. Jeunet and Caro's ability to weave masterful fantasy and plot with the elements of a turn-of-the-century industrial revolution era France just oozes off the screen. Perlman shines in his role as the mentally challenged strongman and Miette, the tough little girl leader of the orphan thieves, makes you believe you best keep your wallet in your front pocket. I always like the scene where One is peering in the window of the orphanage and the one boy gives him a look and waves a knife in One's direction.Crank, the antagonist and evil scientist guy, is cast well and has great creep factor here while the secret band of child stealing "cyclops" guys lends well to the plot. And of course, there's the band of clones played by Dominique Pinon who I think of as the Robin Williams of France. He's brilliant just standing there breathing air.I must say that there are a few different version of this film floating around and you would certainly fall asleep if you were to ever watch the horrible English dubbed version. Never watch the English dubbed version. It does this wonderful movie no justice and should be banned from any home or video store.I have seen a version recently with updated subtitles that more literally translates a few scenes and character names that I didn't like personally (I have the old subtitles version). See this, then see Delicatessen, and Amalie (unless you've been living under a rock or something and have not already).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years ago when I was younger "The City of the Lost Children" was the first film I saw from French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet (and Caro, of course, as he's credited as director as well). The movie has stuck in my mind since, as it has truly unique style of blending in dreams, surrealism and bizarre, Victorian looking sci-fi elements.One (Ron Pearlman) is a strongman, who's little brother is kidnapped by a strange cult of people called the Cyclops. In his search for is brother he gets help from a streetwise little orphan and thief Miette (Judith Vittet) and while they find out it's an evil scientist Krank (Daniel Emilfork) who's behind the kidnappings, they also get the crime bosses behind Miette after them: a Siamese twins, le Piuvre, who are joined together from their hips.The reason why Krank is kidnapping the children is, that he himself is void of dreaming. So he needs to hook the kids on a dream machine in order to see dreams, but the problem is, that he himself is something nightmares are made of.The movie goes forth with dreamlike logic. It's something that rarely works well, but in this case it is very fitting, as the story is about dreams. Real and those you see at night. There still is a couple of scenes that don't actually make any sense and could have been left out from the film without hurting it, but then again even those bizarre, very illogical things are so fascinating, that they do add their own charm in the mix.In a word, The City Of The Lost Children is not a sci-fi/fantasy film for everyone. It's more like a bizarre dream like Terry Gilliams Brazil, yet bit more clear. A nice film none the less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, let me say that Jean-Pierre Jeunet is an auteur and a brilliant one at that. I suggest that anyone interested in French Cinema (or all-around good cinema in general) become familiar with his work. Furthermore, there is no doubt that "La Cité" is like "Amélie's" dark, evil sister. I recommend watching the more accessible Amélie before watching this film, use Amélie as sort of a taste test for Jeunet- if you don't like Amélie, then stay away, but if you do like it, then strap yourself in for a dark, whimsical, surreal ride with La Cité des enfants perdus.Jeunet's trademarks are all present, here, from his topical, visual wonders (complex cause- and-event scenes, playful trickery on the characters' part, extremely intricate art direction) to his deeper story telling skills (as in Amélie, many of the characters here have tragic pasts, but unlike Amélie, many of the characters here do not find redemption or solstice from their torment).The acting is inspired. All actors present convey so much in so little. Ron Perlman brings an impressive amount of French to the table, as the only American in the film. Dominique Pinon seems to have even more fun here as a mysterious treasure hunter and the five men who seem to be clones of him than the paranoid, neurotic ex-boyfriend he portrays in Amélie. Most impressive, perhaps, is Judith Vittet, who ranks with Jodelle Ferland in my mind as most impressive child actress. All of the villains (and there are many of them in the film) are dark, creepy, funny, and deliciously sinister, especially the wicked "Octopus", a pair of chillingly sinister Siamese Twins whose cruel treatment of children brings to mind Count Olaf, The Trunchabull, or Aunts Spiker &amp; Sponge.All-in-all, the imagery, acting, and story are all beautiful, dark, tragic and funny all at once. If this sounds appealing to you, watch the film.</fullReview>

But in over other aspect it is hard to beat. I must say that I am really starting to like Ron Perlman a lot. Just based on Hellboy and this I must say I think he is a pretty unique type of actor. I really loved the feel of the whole movie and the universe that was created. From the opening sequence to the introduction to each of the unique characters. Except for Miette all of the other characters had a very memorable introduction. I loved the character design as a whole and how the whole movie felt like a circus. I think the message of the movie was how a family can be a misfit of characters how truly love each other. I loved the relationship between Miette and One. Extremely strong and built with heartfelt moments, but in the end I did not feel as emotionally attached as I think I could have been. I endless joy to watch and very cleverly written and shot. The shot from the perspective of the flea added a nice touch and actually helped pace the movie a little bit. I really loved the character of the One and is really very unique. He reminded me a bit of Lenny from Of Mice and Men and his radiator moment with Miette was perfect. Great movie, but not for everyone and very obviously a Jeunet film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeunet and Caro cloning experiment preceding Alien 4</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the Delicatessen-era Jeunet and Caro, so watch out for a heavily surreal load of original imagination thrown at you. I enjoyed it less than I enjoyed 'Delicatessen', but I do see the point in why we are treated to the sight of infantile adults, most of the time looking autistic more than infantile, and the sight of children with a spleen here. The contradiction is connected to that other contradiction of hyper-modern science co-existing with medieval stupidity in some of the characters portrayed in the film. But hey, that message was rather familiar to me from 'Alien 4' (made two years after 'La cité des enfants perdus'), to where Jeunet and Caro took pretty much the same crew that is seen here. And I enjoyed 'Alien 4' a lot, to tell you honestly, even if I get the odd condemnation by a passer-by Alien 1'n'2 fan. Still this film is full of images that you'll remember even if having to fight sometimes to stay alert to plot developments or to make sense of the ones you witness. And the resolution is satisfying enough so that you'll definitely not feel like having wasted time with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>like i said its a great movie, one of the best movies to come out of France, and if you liked Delicatessen you'll love this movie too, its better tooits great visually and so is the sets and little gadgets they made up, great acting from the whole cast,especially Daniel Emilfork. it has some flaws and rough edges but overall a really great, funny, enjoyable film, that is very underrated, i strongly recommend itthe film is about a man (who is tormented by not being able to have dreams), Krank(Emilfork) who decides to kidnap very young children, to take their dreams, but since they don't like him and are scared of him he instead of good dreams gets their nightmares, and when a man from a circus,One(Perlman), gets his little brother stolen from him he tries to find the mad man, with help from a little girl (Vittet)and some other very strange and unique characters he puts and end to the madness and saves his little brother</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some way I agree with a guy who compared this film with a painting. In some ways I disagree with him.Director did't want to say much here, accept maybe that the children are sometimes more adult then the adults. He just wanted to share his picture of a past-futuristic city in which children are playing more important role then the adults. Bizarre characters like "two" "teachers", mad scientist and a brain in the aquarium are just completing our vision of this twisted world, maybe not much more cruel than our. I liked that world a lot and it is beauty of this film. Boring fairy tale is not so important.Accept this dark and weird town, the thing I like the most is Miette. Perfect choise for this movie. Very nice girl. I almost fell in love with her. She is now like 21? 22? Too bad.seven out of ten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny, beautiful nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wonderfully realized dark fantasy, in which a sour-faced mad scientist, Krank, who cannot dream, steals children and then their dreams, which he thinks will help him resist aging. Out in the ocean is his oil-rig lab, protected by mines and inhabited by a wicked small woman and a number of droll clones (six?), and a brain, l'Oncle Irvin, in a fishtank (the voice of Jean-Pierre Trintignant). On shore, the city is shadowy and dystopian, where orphan children steal for the wicked conjoined twins -? la Pieuvre -- who run the orphanage (they cook crosshanded, scratch each other's itches, one smokes and the other exhales). At large in the city is a terrifying order of Cyclopses, who volunteer for blindness and wear a grotesque brass sight machine on one side of their heads. They steal a child from a circus strongman, One (Ron Perlman), so he goes in search of his little brother, with the help of the extraordinarily lovely orphan girl Miette (Judith Vittet). Some of the sequences are funny, especially the clones and the train of consequences that leads to the end of la Pieuvre ? as if the secret patron of the film were Rube Goldberg filtred through surrealistic nightmare...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far the strangest film I've ever seen in my life, 'City of Lost Children' was something that I spotted at the videostore one day and thought, "hey, I'll give it a shot." I should have known it would be this weird when I heard it was one of Terry Gilliam's (12 Monkeys, Brazil) favorite films. 'City of Lost Children' will have you in a state of 'what-the-hell-is-going-on?' during it's entire 112 minute runtime, but personally I thought it was a very well made film not to mention original as hell. The off-the-wall story that resembles a children's book written by Jeffrey Dahmer, takes place in a dark, gloom city in France, surrounded by a port of green water. Somewhere in the ocean lays a laboratory owned by the incredibly weird and frightening scientist Krank (Daniel Emilfork), his pushy dwarf wife Mademoiselle Bismuth (Mirielle Mossee), his four cloned sons (all played hysterically by Dominique Pinon) and Krank's brother who is just a brain in a tub of water (voiced by Jean-Louis Trintignant). The evil scientist Krank can't have dreams so he sends out his army of cyclopes to capture small children and steal their dreams. One day Krank's army kidnaps the little brother of a circus strongman, One (Ron Perlman - Hellboy), the story's hero. One, with the help of a band of kiddie pick-pocket thieves led by the compassionate 10-year-old Miette (Judith Vittet) try to get One's brother back from the evil clutches of Krank. The film is beautifully shot with out of this world visual effects, cinematography and makeup (all of which should have gained the film Oscar nominations in 1995). The direction is wonderful, and the writing is solid for the most part. The acting is led with top-notch performances from American actor Ron Perlman and the delightfully deranged Daniel Emilfork. Dominique Pinon is wonderful at adding much-needed comic relief while everyone else in the cast kind of runs in together. 'City of Lost Children' is a French film with English subtitles, and I feel a little was lost due to the language transfer. If you enjoy that kind of 'bizarre' film-making, I think you'll believe 'City of Lost Children' to be a terrific find. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual Feast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a visually rich and atmospheric movie to look at that I forgave it its loosey-goosey fairy-tale plot. The story involves a mad scientist who kidnaps children to steal their dreams, and the carnival strong man (Perlman) and the little girl who set out to rescue the former's little brother from his clutches. There's a subplot involving an apocalyptic Cyclops society that wants its members to renounce the visible world, trained venomous killer fleas, and a Faganesque orphanage run by Siamese twins, none of which made much sense to me.But forget all that. The real star is the setting, a surreal, rust-colored urban nightmare city on the edge of a greasy gray-green sea that seems to draw a lot of its inspiration from computer games like Myst and Riven. I happen to like those games, so I loved the visuals in this movie.The screaming kids at the beginning are kind of hard to take (who wants to see infants crying?) and the first 20 minutes or so are hard to follow, but once the movie finds its legs, the story moves along pretty smoothly.If you're looking for plot and character, forget it, but if you like surreal and moody ambiance, this is a fine little flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The city of the lost children is an example of great underground film making, combining great characters and lush visual settings. It's dark and sometimes, sadistic and cruel, but this doesn't come without its own dose of light hearted humour. The sets and costumes are grand and twisted, a German expressionists dream, only it's french. Ron Perlmans performance has great finesse', and his characters connection to The character Miette is touching. I think more films like this one should be made, films without a purpose or comment, but a will to express a story through imagination instead of box office numbers and gross. This is what movies are meant to be all about, experiencing a plethora of emotions from a film that, from the look of it, was a weird occult movie. This is most certainly not so, Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible story and vision.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dark tale of a simple man whose young brother is kidnapped by a madman who attempts to steal the dreams of children because he himself cannot dream.This movie is like an even darker version of the "Child Catcher" character from the film "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" made a movie (I also kept expecting him to cameo). It is a totally stylized, created world filled with dark fantasy imagery, a madman (Daniel Emilfork), silly clones (Dominique Pinon), a talking brain (Jean-Louis Trintignant), orphan thieves, evil conjoined twins (Genevieve Brunet and Odile Mallet), mechanically altered religious fanatics, poison carrying fleas, and the notion that a tear can cause a shipwreck and save two lives. It also has one of the most disturbing openings I have ever seen (it involves Santa so be prepared for another childhood memory to be flushed down the toilet of life). Dark, unsettling, twisted, to the point of almost defying the ability of description, yet also touchingly beautiful in it's portrayal of the spiritual nature and devotion of unrelated people who become family. Ron Perlman has the male lead, a circus strongman named One, who's three year old adopted brother Denree (Joseph Lucien) is kidnapped. Innocence is tough to pull off. Most actors come across looking stupid and that's not the same thing. The character of One isn't bright but he's also not stupid. Simple, yes, but that's also different. It's fine lines and Ron Perlman does a great job walking those subtleties and capturing innocence.The nine year old female lead character, Miette (Judith Vittet), an orphan thief who helps One, has the look of youthful, lovely adulthood and the attitude of a child who has had no childhood. A great, character defining moment is when she is being carried on One's back and tries on an earring and checks herself out in a mirror. A telling juxtaposition of "father/daughter" and "blossoming woman" imagery. Perlman and Vittet have lovely screen chemistry. The spiritual connection that develops between their characters is the beating heart of this film.Favorite line(s): "Does it hurt?" (asked of a woman with a metal arrow through her body) "Yes. I'm allergic to steel." Favorite line spoken by Ron Perlman: "After I heard them sing (whales), I always, always missed target (harpooning them)."I personally would consider this worth a buy but due to its unique vision, renting first might be in order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My low-brow opinion: three thumbs up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever you might think of the plot and characters, this is one of the most visually spectacular movies ever made. The fascinating "retro-cybernetic" technology alone makes this worth viewing. Cyborgs have never been so amazingly (and even humorously) portrayed as they are with the cyclops religious sect, and the Priest's rant about the world of appearances is fascinating even if it's not philosophically challenging. The movie shouldn't be taken too seriously - it's clearly not meant to be a true dystopian vision, nor a deep treatise on anything in particular. It's just a beautifully enacted science-fiction / fantasy drama. I am not as sophisticated as some of the reviewers who have complained about shallow TimBurton-esque humor and disjointed plot lines, so I give this movie three thumbs up. This movie ranks very high in my top ten list.</fullReview>

An evil scientist (Emilfork), unable to dream, kidnaps children and steals their sleepy visions for his own insane amusement.

But even without the symbolic content it is a beautiful film, a mixture of fantasy and surrealism. The colors and city itself are mesmerizing, and the characters, a mixture of circus freaks, fantastic stereotypes and orphans make it all the more surreal. They're all there: The strongman, the brain in the tank, the mad scientist, the siamese twins. Even the costuming is vibrant. The plot is interesting and even after watching it hundreds of times I still can't help but be glued to the screen, hanging on every word.*spoilers ahead* For those of you who didn't get it, try watching it again. Pay close attention to the characters names, the languages they come from, and what they mean. It could give you a hint into the metaphorical meaning of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Opinions on relation to Tim Burton films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film major and music minor, I not only had a personal interest in this quite exemplary film, but also a subjective interest as well. My immediate reaction after seeing this film was that it seemed to have, with respect, a Tim Burton-esque quality to it. For those who may not be aware of the director and screen-writer Tim Burton, who not only is my personal favorite director but also has been very successful in his recent film Big Fish, he has a remarkable cache of excelent films under his belt. Including but not limited to; "Nightmare Before Christmas" "Batman" "Batman Returns" "Edward Scissorhands" "Beetlegeuse" and his most recent, as forementioned, "Big Fish".Pertaining to "The City of Lost Children", as I sat through this film over and again, it seemed to me more apparent why I enjoyed this film so much, along with it's obvious devotion to the surreal and eccentric, it had a noticeably appealing dark optimism also found in Tim Burton films. Lighting, costumes and visuals usually include much dark, almost sad characteristics. While the story itself usually tells of one unique, yet metaphorically incomplete, character at odds with the world who, through the help of another incomplete individual, endures and blossoms through great adversity.(i.e. Miete and One [City of Lost Children], Tim Burton's Jack the Pumpkin King and Sally [nightmare before christmas], Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands and Kimberly Boggs [Edward Scissorhands], and Tim Burton's Ed Bloom and Sandra Bloom [Big Fish]).Lastly Tim Burton films, along with Marc Caro and Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film, usually contain an element of forbidden love that the respective incomplete characters share. This element of love not only pushes the characters to strugle through obstacles, physical and emotional, but also forces them to grow with each other and finally when the "growth spurt" is complete, they as well are completed by each other.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeunet found a nice balance here with this dark modern day fairy tale. It's easier to swallow than his muddled post apocalyptic tale of cannibals and weirdos living in a bizarre apartment building, "Delicatessen," yet not as overly sentimental and cloyingly sweet as his over-rated and more well known romantic fluff piece, "Amelie." What's not to like about a film where you meet sinister Siamese twins running an orphanage, a talking brain living in a fish tank, an evil midget woman who kidnaps children, and the offspring of a mad scientist who tries to steal the dreams of said children because he himself is incapable of dreaming (and thus has no soul)? All of Jeunet's usual tricks are here: fun camera movement that follows certain scenes from the eyes of animals and insects, elaborate set pieces that demonstrate the inner connectedness of all things and how one tiny detail in one small insignificant event can set off a huge domino effect that ends in something of immense significance, and of course a cast of characters who are all misfits, weirdos, or orphans of some sort. The set designs are fantastic, yet feel a little too similar to stuff we've seen from Terry Gilliam and Lars Von Trier in earlier works (Gilliam's "Brazil" or "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" and Von Trier's "Element of Crime" or "Zentropa" come to mind often). The music score from Angelo Badalamenti (of Lynch fame) is as great as always. The cast is wonderful (especially the children and the young girl playing Miette). Unfortunately its all drown out by such washed out colors and darkness. I get the point Jeunet was trying to make, but with all the light-hearted touches he added in other ways (the little boy belching, the idiocy of the clones) that the film could've used a few visual contrasts. Some brighter lights and brighter colors should have been used in some scenes so as to give the audience's eyes a rest and to coincide with the hopeful fairy tale aspect of it all. Strangely, his next film, "Amelie" would be nothing but brightness and color. Still, for all its flaws, "City of Lost Children" is a wonderful movie for anyone who loves weird films with lots of interesting visuals, strange characters, and ultimately a good heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now I want to see "Delicatessen"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first Jean-Pierre Jeunet film not in English (I've seen "Alien: Resurrection," which I thought was just as much fun as any of the "Alien" movies). I'm interested now in seeing "Delicatessen" and "Amelie."The basic story is this: a man, The One (Ron Perlman), has his "little brother," Denree, stolen from him and taken to a strange place that looks like an oil rig, where he will be used by an evil old man, Krank, for the purpose of stealing his dreams. That's basically all I got from the plot, which is, well, a bit difficult to understand. (There was something about Krank not being able to cry, how it represented his soul or lack thereof...whatever.) There are other things: two old women, twins, who are after the children, some people who I assume work for Krank, that look somewhat like Borgs from "Star Trek." The One meets a young girl, Miette ("crumb," in English), who eventually helps him on his quest to rescue Denree. There's also some guy, Marcellus, who has a flea that injects an evil green liquid into people, turning them into angry killing machines once music from a jack-in-the-box instrument with the crank on the side starts to play.The One, as played by Perlman, is like a great big little kid -- a foreigner, probably Russian as Perlman notes on the commentary -- and there are some touching moments in the movie, like when he offers to be Miette's big brother. Up in the oil rig (or whatever), Krank is surrounded by a handful of clones (Dominique Pinon, who also plays a submarine professor) and a short little lady. Oh yeah, there's a floating brain, in what looks like pickle brine, called Uncle Irvin. Now, I never quite figured out who made whom but it's not really that important. After about 45 minutes it gets less confusing, more interesting and more involving. This movie is all about visceral, visual impact and at least on the visual level, there's no complaints. Shot by Darius Khondji, who did "Se7en," the movie looks great; there's a focus on the contrast between faces -- either craggy and impish or young, wide-eyed and innocent. The set/art design is sumptuous to look at and it, as well as the special effects, blend seamlessly into the picture.With the focus on visuals, and not the hard-to-understand plot, the film would work almost as a silent movie. I had the first few minutes of the film playing without subtitles. (Here's something: I don't know exactly how subtitles work, but wouldn't it be nice, if possible, to place them over the black bars in widescreen, rather than on the picture? If they need to be on the picture for some reason -- if they're interconnected or something -- then color me stupid.)The style of the film is somewhat expressionistic and surreal. In dreams, the camera bends and becomes fluid. In one of the more wacky moments (more wacky, because the whole movie is sort of wacky), there's a strange dance within a dream between Miette and Krank, where he seems to be robbing her of her youthful essence. I can see various influences from Burton, Gilliam, Coen(s) and Lynch. I've heard that there is some Fellini influence, and that may be true (I haven't seen any of his movies but I've got "8 1/2" on tape, so don't scream at me!). I would lump Jeunet together with Guillermo Del Toro: they've both done strange variations on genre movies, giving them a unique twist and they look fabulous (they both like Ron Perlman, too).The film has a lovely, dreamy, evocative score that reminded me of Lynch and I gave myself a pat on the back when, in the commentary, Jeunet said it was indeed by Angelo Badalamenti, Lynch's longtime collaborator.With a budget of 18 million, this movie puts other big-budget fantasy movies to shame; it looks as if it could have cost five times that much. Also, why would people go see a Hollywood fantasy/child movie like the cruddy ones Hollywood serves up monthly, when artistically credible, highly original (organ stairs?) movies like this are available? (I admit, the subtitles may pose a problem to young viewers. Maybe this would be one time where the equivalent of cinematic rape -- watching a foreign-language movie with English dubbing, rather than English subtitles -- would be an option.)To the people (or person, I only saw one note of it) who compare this movie to Spielberg, I say feh. This movie isn't sentimental, it's not one of those movies where the young kids look adorable and then get shamelessly put in situations of peril. In fact, Denree looks more than happy after he's kidnapped, eating people's dinner. There are cute little kids here, but they're not sympathy devices.There were some nice lines in the movie, my favorite being when the little lady is shot with a harpoon and has one of the clones ask her, "Does it hurt?" To which she replies, "Yes. I'm allergic to steel."***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best fantasy films (and this movie certainly makes the short, short list) challenge us. Here we have an almost aggressively bizarre film from the creators of the considerably more accessible "Amelie" (not that I didn't like that film, but it's much more easily lovable). It's rated R, apparently for some very brief nudity and the few salty words that pop up in the subtitles. There are a couple of scenes that are really more upsetting than outright violent; for example, one main character is enslaved and made to fight another. But I think the real reason is that this is a great fairy tale for adults. By turns disturbing and surprisingly moving, if the rumored film adaptations of Philip Pullman's lyrical and haunting _His Dark Materials_ trilogy REALLY have to exist, they should look like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Absolutely Brilliant Masterpiece : An Imaginative Cinematic Feat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Wonderfully acted, masterfully photographed, with a moving and absorbing score, and an over-the-top choreography and cinematography make this film stand out as a splendid and unique gem. A masterpiece.Combining fairy-tale fantasy, Brazil-esque sci fi, and some of the most tactful, tasteful, and powerful use of CGI I have seen in quite some time. This movie is able to maintain a sometimes-convoluted but by no means disjointed story about dreams and nightmares, friendship and hatred, empathy and apathy, generousity and greed, and the uneasy struggle between these often-fused forces.Some of the techniques used in this film were so breathtaking they made me gasp out loud. It even resulted in me violating one of my most sacred taboos of first-viewing of a movie: rewinding several scenes and re-watching these on the spot.This movie was so masterfully photographed, it left me speechless. Atmospherically absorbing, it effectively uses colour, light, shadows, as well as an excelent execution of various lense techniques one seldom sees in this somewhat 'lazy' day-and-age of computerized grandness. The chorographical, cinematographic, and architectural manner in which charachters and the surroundings were displayed (in particular the aqua-gothic harbor town and the island lab) were so rich, so full of depth, colour, and dimension (with an emphasis on height, skewed proportionality and centeredness). For these qualities alone this movie shines.But there are many more positive qualities. The acting was absolutely superb; convincing, involving, and moving. From the first child to the last adult actor, there is not a single performance that is lacking and virtually all the performances are quite excellent, even brilliant.At no point does the dramatic momentum seem to slow down throughout. Love and kinship must battle the hatered, greed, indifference and terror that confronts them through various unexpected fantasy-laden, black-and-gray comedic, horrific, and dramatic overtures. The satirical and tragico-comical flavoures keep this surrealist odyssey always-interesting, always-engaging. Danger, albeit at times ill-defined (which is not necessarily a bad thing), lurks continuously and a suspenseful tension keeps one on their toes. One gets the sense as if anything can happen at any given time.The music is an inexorable component of the movie. It does not disappoints and it compliments perfectly the film's momentum. Likewise the special effects come across being as humble as they are fantastic. The atmospheric flow of skewed proportion, near-caricature-like surroundings and characters resonates fits perfectly with these and resonates with the depth. Eluding the senses, augmenting the mind, and stirring the emotions. Excuse the bombast.All these virtues combined make up a movie that entrenches itself deeply in one's mind. An utterly strange and highly moving journey, whose impact is anything but short-lived.********Spoilers:********Three particular scenes which made me break the aforementioned taboo were:1. Juan &amp; Little-Brother are hiding in the closet. Little-Brother evokes pain from Bald-Fat Cyclopes, what is he chewing on ? (!)2. The exponential causal repercussions following the shedding of a single tear-drop, putting into a halt an entire town .3. The interposition of age in the final climactic dream scene.*******Spoilers End:*******=====Summary:======&gt; I highly recommend this extraordinary and brilliant surrealist fantasy tale as an all-out masterpiece with much, much replayability value. Anyone who still possesses any links with their childhood, who can, for a few hours at least forgo the cynicism of modern popular culture (or else, this, like anything else, would simply equate as cliché) is sure to find this film worthwhile. I would even go so far as to say that one should not rent it first to give it a glance, no! Buy it, own it today (though as always, look for the subtitled version over the dubbed one) ! Yes, it is that good.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually, I either strongly like or dislike a movie when I write a review. This movie, however, confuses me. I'm not sure what to make of it. Interesting is the only word that can describe The City of the Lost Children. I saw the version of the movie containing dubbed English voices. I feel as though I missed out. The French voices with subtext would have added a lot more flavor to the movie's dementedness. My favorite part of the movies had to have been the cyclops (you'll understand if you see the movie). Even though the characters were unique and the setting was very dream like, my brain couldn't make heads or tails of the movie. I still am not sure if I liked it, but I will say I am glad I saw it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes their movies bizarre and very original.</fullReview>

Ron Perlmans performance as the dumb circus performer searching for his adopted brother is so watchable amongst a whole host of crazy characters.However what the script may lack in dialog it certainly makes up for in its environment and in a way could be seen as a flawed masterpeice, so decodent and at times scary, especially as the evil clone proffessor dresses as santa, uuuurrrrrhhh.

		<shortDescription>This movie is visually surreal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree with the person who commented that this movie is notsurreal. The movie is visually surreal in many places, but I offerjust one example. Whenever the surface of water appears in thefilm, it has a quality that I've never seen in water. Somehow, it'sbeen excited so there are thousands of tiny wavelets all ofapproximately the same size. (It reminds me of an odd paintingthat I saw in the Getty museum in LA.) If you look at the surface ofthe ocean or a lake, it's usually a continuum of wave sizes. Alsothere doesn't appear to be any direction of motion in the waves asthere would be if they are being driving by the wind. Finally, thesurface of the water is highly reflective and yet the source of thelight reflected from the surface cannot be discerned--the scenesare so dark. It is obvious that the director intended the water tohave this surreal appearance. The director is genius. It is theattention to such small details that makes this film awesome.Excellence is in the details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing but magical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts with a magnificent score by Angelo Badalamenti roaring into our ears. Darius Khondji provides the beautiful cinematography, as we witness a strange sequence in which people dressed like Santa Claus enter a boys home. This sequence sets the tone for the whole movie, a studio-shot magical ride that does that such rare thing in some movies: it takes us to another place. But there are drawbacks. And although it's easy to get involved by this authentic movie magic, the plot is confusing, and many things are left unexplained at first viewing. Maybe this one requires another look, but it's many times difficult to follow. But this ain't no bad movie. There is a great young actress here (in the role of Miette) that steals the scenes she's in, the music is beautiful, some Jeunet-esque touches are delicious (the way they steal the key to enter the room). Loved this world, will see it again of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsure of why this is a great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie on the advice of my brother (who has, I admit, a much wider range of taste in movies than I). I am confused as to what makes this movie unique, or more to the point, original. I have been reading hard science fiction (no, not "Star Trek"!) for years. Zenna Henderson, James P. Hogan, Robert A. Heinlein, Ray Bradbury, and Kurt Vonnegut have all written stories concerning the ideas from this film, and they wrote them long before 1995.The film's visual effects were interesting, and some were even new to my experience, but it wasn't enough to keep my attention from flagging about 1 hour into the movie. I lost the ability to be astounded by the costumes and sets when the plot of the movie settled into a predictable pattern. A pattern including some great acting on the part of most of the actors, but still, a pattern I'd seen over and over. An old, cliched science fiction story not fully masked by the costumes or sets. It wasn't a waste of time, as some people have commented, but it also wasn't an experience I'd care to repeat. Perhaps it would appeal more to viewers who have not read as much science fiction. The story might seem original to them, then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievably enjoyable fantasy, but slightly empty in its subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although highly entertaining, and with an impeccable visual style, the follow-up from Jeunet &amp; Caro, the creators of Delicatessen, never really gives the viewer anything to think about. It unfolds before us like a fairytale, and before it's said anything lasting it's ended. It's hard to go into any aesthetic connotation the film might have, because in my opinion it doesn't have any. The visuals are there purely to create a bizarre atmosphere, there is never any great thought into mise-en-scene, the composition might trick viewers into thinking that the ideology behind the framing has some deep message, but it doesn't. But that doesn't mean the film isn't enjoyable, it has an interesting and imaginative story, concerning a scientist who is unable to dream, kidnapping children so he can steal theirs, and also has some delightfully abstract performances from the likes of Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, and the young Judith Vittet. Not to mention Darius Khondji's cinematography (everything the man has lit has been beautiful) and unique production design and Angelo Badalamenti's evocative score. Don't get me wrong the film is very good, just in an empty kind of way, and you can't help but feel cheated when you think of how wonderful a film like Delicatessen is. Perhaps the bigger budget sent directors Jeunet &amp; Caro crazy, as the film could have certainly done with a little restraint. Anyway, it may not be in the same league of Delicatessen, but City of Lost Children still has more beauty and imagination than any American/British film I can think of at this moment, and is worth seeing just for the opening Santa Clause dream, which is truly haunting. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully surreal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen the latest Jean-Pierre Jeunet (minus Marc Caro), "Amelie", but having registered much of the hype, I was interested to see "City Of Lost Children". I didn't know what to expect, but I was overjoyed to find this film to be perhaps one of the best I have ever seen.Its magnificently surrealist cinematography and breathtaking performances gave it all the makings of perfect art-house cinema. Moments of completely bizarre and alienating surrealism set it well and truly apart from the completely average Hollywood fantasies that get much more recognition and viewing from mainstream audiences. For modern audiences, use of special effects is often credited with enormous respect, yet Jeunet and Caro exhibit a magnificent and disarming ability to create a completely otherwordly atmosphere simply through emotion and imagery without needing the latest in digital effects. The result was something so much more fulfilling than "Lord Of The Rings" or "The Matrix", both of which were visually spectacular yet offered so much less as food for thought. An astonishingly mature performance from child actor Judith Vittet as Miette made this film all the more enjoyable - some actors of twice her age can only hope to have a third of her talent."The City Of Lost Children" was truly a brilliant film in which Jeunet and Caro have presented their viewers with a powerful and breathtaking analysis of perception and imagination. I only wish more people could see it and appreciate all it has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Surreal Jeunet and Caro rule supreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time an inventor having no wife or child decided to create them in his test tubes. His wife was to be a beautiful princess but alas an evil genetic fairy took hand and she was born a minikin. Next he cloned six fine sons in his own image but fate cheated him again and a sleeping sickness took them. Needing a confidante he grew a brain in an aquarium, plagued by migraines. Finally came his masterpiece a man of supreme intelligence, alas this creation also had a fault, an inability to dream. This made the man so unhappy that he grew old unimaginatively quickly, so crazed did he become that he believed that one tear would save him, after a life of cruelty he died in agony never having known a dream.Thus unfolds the story of the City of Lost Children as relayed by, the brain, uncle Irvin. The evil genius Krank (Daniel Emilfork) is stealing children's dreams in an attempt to lengthen his own dwindling life, but success is elusive as Krank turns dream to nightmare. One (Ron Perlman) loses his 'little brother' to Krank and, aided by Miette (Judith Vittet) a female artful dodger, he sets out to recover him.Jeunet and Caro have created a visual masterpiece in the City of Lost Children, with beautiful sets, a warped fusion of docklands and fairground, and outstanding costumes by Jean Paul Gaultier. The film is as surreal as their previous collaboration, Delicatessen, the City of Lost Children is less adult in theme but it is no less unsettling. The films share many actors, notably Dominique Pinon, the handyman, who plays the six sons of the inventor, and Jean-Claude Dreyfus, who played the cannibal butcher in Delicatessen, as Marcello the opium addicted circus master. After the supremely disappointing Alien Resurrection, also directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, this is a masterpiece, visually reminiscent of Peter Greenaways The Cook the Thief his Wife and her Lover.Like a twisted dream of a nineteenth century industrial fairground, viewed through the distorted mirror of Jeunet and Caro's imagination, The City of lost Children is a fantastic film and essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually intriguing, but dramatically lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"City of Lost Children" has one of the most striking production designs you will ever see. The world that the characters inhabit is a cross between the sewers of Paris, the canals of Venice, and Victorian London. The set design, lighting, and camerawork are first rate. Add to this costumes by famous designer Jean-Paul Gaultier. This adds up to a visually stunning film, which might satisfy some viewers.Unfortunately, this does not make up for the major shortcoming of the film. While the story is imaginative and the dialog is mostly appropriate, the direction of the actors appears to have taken the form of "do not show genuine emotion under any circumstances." Perlman's "One" is the only character capable of putting forth any aura other than those exuding evil, and his performance is mostly unconvincing. Miette is supposed to be standoffish because of "wisdom beyond her years." It merely comes off flat. The "little brother", a watery-eyed blond waif, is constantly eating and burping into the camera. The first time is "cute", if a bit contrived, but the joke gets old quickly.One of the more inspired characterizations are the vicious twins who run the child thievery ring. Of all the people we meet during the course of the story, they are some of the more devious and entertaining. They are actually interesting to watch, while many of the other characters appear to wander aimlessly through the story.However, even with its shortcomings, the film is an interesting and slightly surreal experience. If the acting had been more credible and the pacing provided a little more suspense, this movie could have been a 9 or 10. As it is, I give it a low 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is just incredible to look at. The exquisite production design creates another world, a Terry Gilliam-esque combination of the futuristic and the antique. Darius Khondji's cinematography is unsurpassed. Green water has never looked this beautiful. The first time I watched this film, I immediately rewound it and watched it again. All of the actors fit their roles perfectly, especially Dominique Pinion, Jeunet and Caro's favorite actor, in his multiple roles. I don't think you could find a better Krank than Daniel Emilfork. The excellent musical score by David Lynch's regular composer (from Blue Velvet on) Angelo Badalamenti is also worth mentioning.The genre of this film is kind of hard to pin down. Sci-fi? Not quite. Comedy? There are some pretty funny parts, but no. Art film? Possibly, I don't really like that term though. If it applys to any film, it's this one, though. Jeunet and Caro really show a lot of influence from Terry Gilliam, the film also has a certain cartoon style to it, and the influence of Tex Avery and Rube Goldberg is also evident.If you liked this film, definately also see Jeunet and Caro's earlier film Delicatessen and Alien: Resurrection (If only the latter had a better script).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked City of Lost Children. It wasn't because of the spectacular special effects. It was because of the story. There just aren't enough movies out there that make you smile and think about something as obscure as a man who's so desperate to dream that he tries to steals them from small children. It's weird. It's twisted. It confused Roger Ebert! It's gotta be good! You have to watch this movie twice to really appreciate it (which is a bit of a chore when it's nearly two hours long). If you like Terry Gilliam, you'll love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautifully shot and crafted film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has resurrected my faith in the European sci-fi film, which had been in crisis since I saw the quite terrible 'Fifth Element'. From it's opening, disturbing images to the final astounding, surprising finale, this film consantly takes the viewer to new heights of film appreciation. I can't praise this film enough for simply being different, for daring to charge it's wonderful effects with emotion and poignancy. By satisfying all facets of my filmgoing personality (effects, emotion, wonderful acting and a subversive edge) this ends up a perfectly balanced film as I'm sure many others find it.I think that the retro-futuristic look this film has been endowed with helps its watchability enormously. You strain to think at what time the film is set before realising it is actually a rather clever, if somewhat brash fusion of both past and future. The heartfelt yearning of the brain to be something more is the most human desire and indeed, it is the skill with which Jeunet and Caro force us to sympathise with and be repelled by all the characters which adds to the experience of the film. A slight improvement on the excellent 'Delicatessen'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't like this film very much. I was lucky enough to see it on a big screen, in a movie theater, but I really couldn't stand it. I found it very annoying for some reason. The story was pretty lacking (I've noticed many of you have declined to comment on that aspect), also, I couldn't stand the acting, the dialogue, the characters, etc. Sure, it may have had nice visuals, it was lovely in some parts, but I just thought it was so shoveled full of syrup that it made me want to puke. I thought it all seemed very artificial, especially the acting; so much of this movie seemed so cartoon-ish. None of the actors seemed to deliver a really good performance that they had some contribution in, it was almost as if they were drawn by the directors, like animated figures in a Disney film; all acting was the cookie-cutter same style, hamming it up and moving with forced actions. I almost felt that it was as if this movie was addressing itself to little kid type intelligence; it reminds me of a cross between Sesame Street and an Ed Wood movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeunet and Caro direct a visually stunning piece which, to me, had projected the entire atmosphere out of the screen. The film had a presence all of its own and had some quite brilliant performance especially from the young Judith Vittet. What people might not appreciate is its detraction from the Hollywood world of characteristic effects. What this has is European style... specifically French ( although produced in collaboration with a German TV production company with other French companies).A pity about Ron Perlman's French though!</fullReview>

The brilliant camera views help this and from the first scene you know this is a good film where lots of identical santa's enter the room then the camera seems to take some LSD and has a bad trip.The main characters in the film are all strange but yet in the context of the film they seem normal. By the end of the film you are emotionally attached to certain characters and are willing them not to die and the films bad characters to die as soon as possible.The atmosphere and look of the film accompanied with great characters played by great actors who have a skillfully written script to show off their talents, filmed by talented directors shows you don't need that much to make a great film.</fullReview>

What is better, though, is that is doesn't, to my mind, override the acting, which is superb. Judith Vittet, in particular, was amazing as Miette. I did not see any particular flaws with the plot or execution: the movie held together very well.I have seen this movie twice with English subtitles, and once the dubbed version. I suggest that the French is better; I don't think that the emotions of the characters came through as well (especially since I saw it in the original French first), and I don't speak/understand French. It is fun to see Ron Perlman try and mutter a few words in the language, too.If you like this movie, I would recommend Brazil as well as Dark City.

		<fullReview>The City of Lost Children does not hold together as tightly or completely as Jeunet and Caro's Delicatessen, but the visual acrobatics equal or surpass those found in the earlier movie. Creating an even more abstract and fantastic universe than in Delicatessen, the world of The City of Lost Children teems with figures who might have materialized out of Lewis Carroll's imagination had the author been living in the latter half of the twentieth century. The disembodied brain, the lumbering giant One and his sensuous companion Miette, the conjoined twins (I love the image of one twin inhaling the smoke from a cigarette and the other twin exhaling), the clones, and the sour-faced scientist (Daniel Emilfork) are the ideal inhabitants in a grown-up fairy tale that I would have loved to have seen as a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The summary says it all. This movie is not only visually stunning, it also has a very beautiful storyline. I am so sick of the people who say this movie is too dark to be enjoyable. The darkness is probably its best attribute, not to mention the wonderful performances, especially Judith Vittet's. I cannot wait to see more of her in upcoming films, as I believe she is going to be a very promising child actress. The performances were very real and I actually could relate to these people! The storyline was reminiscent of a fairy tale (think Alice in Hell) and it's fantasy feel was just unreal. Also, I don't think that the spectacular visual effects clouded the storyline, another comment lots of critics seem to make. Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro did a great job with this movie, and I think a non-sucky follow-up or a sequel would be great. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Alien: Resurrection, so I decided to give this movie a try. The first thing that worried me when I rented it, was the fact it was French (with English subtitles). Watching the movie though, it didn't bother me at all. As you probably have heard this movie is really stunning visually. I watched the wide-screen version with surround sound, and the movie is breathtaking. The story is really weird. Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet stated he wanted to "catapult the audience into a world they don't know, but which has its own logic". I guess it worked. I watched it, and everything seemed so unreal, kinda like a...dream I guess. Yet the more times you watch it the better it gets. All in all this movie is certainly not for every ones liking, but it's great nonetheless. FX buffs have to check out this movie, as the special fx are great (especially the fleas), and the movie is VERY atmospheric.</fullReview>

For some reason, I did not notice at first the fairy tale-ish plot. It must be because everything with the movie went right.

		<fullReview>Certainly one of the best films I have seen. Sit back and be thoroughly enjoyed by this work of art. Do not be tired while watching because you want to be alert as the puzzle fits together. The characters, story, effects, cinematography are all superb. Special mention to Ron Perman as One and Judith Vittet as Miette. Their relationship brings substance to the science fiction plot. Action/reactions, cause and effect, something for the budhists here with interconnectedness. The movie is great on so many levels. You will not be disappointed with bizarre, twists and turns that the story makes. However it all ties off, and you feel thoroughly entertained at the end, and not brain dead. The movie really enables your mind to escape, but also your mind is kept active throughout. Not a dull moment anywhere. The setting matches perfectly with the plot, and the set really works for this piece. This is an 'original' and I hope that others in the movie making business will take notice of this great work of art. The cast is brilliantly chosen, and much credit should also go to makeup and wardrobe. It seems that the whole movie is put together so well with everything complementing, which must go to the directors credit. Really well done to all those involved. Good work Marc &amp; Jean-Pierre, excellent piece of work. If you have not seen it, definitely do. Beware it is in French and subtitled, so if you are not used to subtitles, watch a few other foreign movies first so that your are not distracted in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard that this film improves when you watch it in French, and though i have not seen it in French, i can understand why. Some of the effect and punch of dialogue is clearly lost in translation and the dubbed voices range from good to worryingly bad. All the same, this is one of the most visually fantastic films i have ever seen. Jeunet and Caro have created a mesmerising setting by a harbour and put in an eclectic mix of twisted characters and creative story lines. Originally creative and with dark comic-book like undertones. The relationship between our hero, ex sailor One, and streetwise pickpocketing little girl, Miette, is touching and makes the film seem like a warped and re-drawn French imagining of 'Leon'. An awesome film to watch, thats set in a beautifully imaginative world and a story that runs like a fairy tale and delivers everything you want it to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A French Gem: Perhaps the Best Movie I Have Ever Seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the principals involved in the production of the film "Dark City" gave credit to the earlier "City of Lost Children" for its original visualization of fantasy. That remark is what led me to "La Cité des Enfants Perdus" in the first place. I think "Dark City" is a great film; but "City of Lost Children" is a true, spotless, priceless gem. It is valuable, perhaps, beyond normal human comprehension. Yes, that is over-the-top, but it's my opinion and I'm sticking by it!If my French were better, I'd be tempted to write this review in that language. As it is, I very much prefer watching and listening to the film in its original language! It's not that the English dubs are so very bad, but the movie is so much better viewed and heard in French, I believe... I need the English sub-titles, but that's fine.This is a very difficult movie to review for me; even my native English vocabulary feels inadequate to the task! The top adjective to fit this film must be, pour moi, incredible! (Say it, shout it in a really bad fake French accent: ON-kray-DEE-bluh!) Yes, we must laugh long and hard about it! This film is so genuinely cute, so horribly evil, so deliciously sweet, so side-splittingly hilarious, so full of heart-wrenching pathos... I just cannot find the correct words. It is self-contradictory in every scene, in the best meaning that phrase conveys. Yet the final entirety is one of the sweetest, most lovely film experiences...Whoever wrote the screenplay (writing credits: Gilles Adrien &amp; Jean-Pierre Jeunet &amp; Marc Caro) are geniuses. I can't imagine how their fertile minds ever came up with such a wondrous plot line. The story is quite complicated, and yet weaves together perfectly into a tight, glorious tapestry of imagination! Whoever designed the sets and props (Art Direction: Jean Rabasse, Production Design: Marc Caro &amp; Jean Rabasse) are geniuses. This is a small rural village, but covering many square kilometres, whose every view is decidedly urban, a miniature-yet-sprawling Paris of over a century ago.The village-city is populated with futuristic (yet stylistically far-outdated) alien folk in rubberized black trench coats, all wearing eyesight and hearing enhancers whose gains are set, always, too high. Like all in this movie: a tad scary, and yet oh so very funny! Populated, too, by circus performers of a bygone era, by little self-reliant street urchins who'd be right at home in a Dickens novel... There are "modern" telephones, creaky old diving suits, huge rusty ships, Edison phonographs playing those big thick records, and enough Rube Goldberg devices to amaze and make you laugh all night long.Whoever wrote the sweetly evocative music (Original Music by Angelo Badalamenti), and whoever matched it to the film's images (Film Editing by Herve Schneid, Music Mixing by Thierry Lebon), are geniuses par excellence.The directors (Marc Caro &amp; Jean-Pierre Jeunet) are geniuses off the top of the IQ scale. How on earth did they get these beautiful young children to cry, to act in such sweet-childish yet professionally adult ways, to look straight at the camera with such amazing aplomb, to exhibit perfectly the emotions needed to make their characters so believable? Jeunet attempts to describe, in his Special Feature commentary (with Ron Pearlman), how he accomplished some of this stuff, but it comes off in such a way that he himself appears genuinely amazed at how well things went, especially with the many scenes including the precious child actors...One of the principal children, Petite Frere Denree (Joseph Lucien), perhaps all of six years old, does absolutely nothing throughout the film but eat a lot of good food and, occasionally, burp. And yet he will steal your heart away, right from his first appearance, guaranteed.Alexis Pivot, as "Tadpole," gets special mention from director Jeunet in the DVD's Special Features commentary. Apparently, even at the tender age of eight or so, he gave Jeunet some very effective ideas about filming some scenes. One shows Tadpole walking slowly away from the camera, in a beautiful scene evoking "The Little Tramp," but much better, I think... Jeunet's remarks about Alexis Pivot should encourage us to look, in a few years, for that young man as a director of note.The "adult" actors are truly superb, as well. Judith Vittet (Miette) was nine years old at the time the film was produced, but she must certainly be counted as one the professional adult actors...A good scene for Dominique Pinon involves his playing only four clones at one time on the screen! He is absolutely, wonderfully hilarious.Daniel Emilfork (the monstrously evil Krank) is certainly a remarkably strange vision of a character. He is the archetypical villain in this bizarre melodrama; we all boo him at his every appearance. Yet, at the end, we do feel small pangs of sadness for him. He was a child once, too, before he became so evil. His over-the-top pantomime of "Papa Noel," which aims at getting some toddlers not to fear him, fails so spectacularly... The harder he tries, the worse he gets! I think this is the funniest scene in the film, wildly hilarious, even though it ends in half-a-dozen little kids crying, screaming in absolute terror of the horrible Krank apparition. How can such a contradictory scene be so endearing? Well, it surely is!I have seen little of Ron Pearlman, but I want to see more, now!There are so many more actors, too numerous to detail, and yet they all fit so well into this tapestry.I could go on and on, and I have gone on too long. Thank you, dear reader, if you have gotten far enough to receive these thanks.I think I will never lose my love for the perfect "City of Lost Children". C'est Magnifique! Ten out of ten.

		<fullReview>"Production design" is by Jean Rabasse, "art direction" by Marc Caro. To be honest, I don't understand the distinction (aren't the two terms more or less synonymous?), but no matter: between them, Rabasse and Caro are responsible for fantastic sets that may be just as good as those of any film ever made. One gets the feeling that they LITERALLY designed a City - a city more miserable than any I've been to but with more integrity, with colours that aren't exactly inviting, but which could not be improved upon. Few films look better; perhaps none look more true to themselves.Yet it's a film to abstractly admire rather than love. The characters are like chess pieces, with the difference that we're unable to tell which ones are important, and we aren't told. We never get to know any of them; I suspect there's nothing to find out, anyway. Neither the story as a whole nor any particular part of it is moving.If the film has a single vice, it's flippancy - and perhaps flippancy IS its only vice, which is just as well, since it's the worst vice of all. No story is improved by being told in a flippant manner. Imagine the smug, mirthless chuckle of the storyteller who thinks everything is a big joke, but won't explain why; translate this chuckle into dialogue and editing and camera angles and narrative pace and emphasis, and you have a fair idea of what the film's like. But not a complete idea. The flippancy lies, as it were, between the frames; within each individual frame is the wondrous visual sensibility of people who are very much in earnest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You could watch this film backwards and it would still make just as much sense. I watched the first ten minutes with avid interest - the lurid colours, the characters and the sets and props all seemed fantastically wonderful. However, there is no sense of progression or development, and theres no discernable plot or character analysis. Admittedly, there's a lot of imagination gone into the sets and the props, but unfortunately the reliance on these becomes too great and they gradually overwhealm the film until, finally, it disappears up it's own magical and fantasy-world backside.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea of the movie is not well executed, in my humble opinion. While it is quite unique, the movie is unpleasant and makes an abominable impression. The characters are ugly and disgusting. The shots are too dark. Certain scenes are utterly stupid (like the one when children are running along a copper who is stuck between the two waterfronts). The author's voice behind the screen is no good. The overblown performance and grimaces are goofy. If this flick could have been cleaned up, it would be an impressive and beautiful cinematic experience.For a "kindermovie" it's too disgusting and complicated and for an adult one it is too goofy and over the edge. I sent this DVD to a trashcan whereto it belongs (it was a cheap DVD).A solid and awful 3 out of 10 (it's not a complete waste and the complicated design of the set is of note). Thank you for attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of Amelie and A Very Long Engagement, I thought I would give this Jeunet film a try. I should have known better, since I didn't like Delicatessen either. This movie, too, was overwrought and tiresome. Despite the occasionally engaging visuals, the story was near impossible to follow and visual excess can never substitute for a good story. I think the emphasis upon excess also made the actors, at least those who weren't required to play some hysterical prop, seem like quaint scenery. A Very Long Engagement may have worked for me because Jeunet was working from an original novel and there he could use his visual talents to create the stunning horror of W.W.I trench warfare and didn't allow the love story to be swallowed up by the visuals. I recommend that film and, of course, Amelie, to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark comedy disguised as science fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Jean-Pierre Jeunet films, I went back into the catalog and found The City Of Lost Children. This shows the Marc Caro side of the JPJ productions. It is ambitious, anything but dull. It is also void of the charm found in every other of JPJs' movies. We get the fixated characters by the actors we'd seen over time, which is remarkable on its own. Its like a Christopher Guest production from that standpoint. We get to see our old "friends". In COLC our friends are a bit too creepy, with the exception of the eternally elastic Dominique Pinon in many roles. While the plot is a mess of design over substance, there are many familiar developments that are better laid out in Delicatessin, Amelie and The Very Long Engagement (the best JPJ film - if you're into that sort of designation). Here, being unique, or the "One", are something that is touched upon but this world of freaks is taken over by this old man who steals children for their dreams. The best summary could be made by stating this is a dark comedy that is Rated R for disturbing and grotesque images of violence and menace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but interesting nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We're really starting to get attached."Some parts of The City of Lost Children worked better for me than others, but it's undeniable that it's a wildly creative and inventive movie from beginning to end. The overall look of the film is unique, you never quite can guess what weird quirk the story or characters are going to show you next, and you can just tell that a lot of imagination and passion went into this. That fact helped make up for the times when I lost interest in the story a bit. Visually, it's excellent. Artistically, there are a lot of great ideas, they just don't all come together well. &nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to spoil the plot, but it involves missing children, a scientist who can't dream, a army of blind (well, not quite) men, a kind-hearted strongman, orphans, and a hateful set of Siamese twins. Mostly though, it's about the desire for family. The relationship between the two main characters, Miette and One, is quite touching, but there's also humor and action to be found. &nbsp;As I said, this movie is kind of all over the place, and some aspects work better than others. Still, I'd recommend it be seen just because of how genuinely different it is. Take a dark adult fairy tale/fantasy movie like Pan's Labyrinth (though, not as good) and add in a bleak dsytopian setting and some sci-fi, and you've got a good idea of what The City of Lost Children is like. If that sounds interesting to you, you owe it to yourself to give it a try, despite its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie-making from an incomplete script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"La Cité des enfants perdus" is excellent, imaginative and very accomplished movie-making with an excellent, extremely fitting cast. Still the film leaves a few things to be desired and this is mainly due to a script that almost seems to embrace plot holes.One's willing compliance with the thieves and Miette's sudden affection for One are never fully explained, at more than one point characters use tiny pieces of evidence to jump to the wildest conclusions and some layers of the story seem oddly disconnected from one another. When you think of the bare-bones story you even realize how the subplot involving the evil Siamese twin sisters was unnecessarily stretched out to cover a wide range of movie without very much consequence other than providing a back story for Miette and setting her up with One. Also there is a brilliantly weird, wonderful climax that just flat out ends the movie, leaving the viewer hanging without a sense that the story, despite completed, has been fully resolved.I certainly won't brag about all the riddling, fantastic moments (like the dream sequences) that are not very easy to understand. That is actually the movie at its best and most imaginative and should be left to everybody's own interpretation. As I said, the pictures were wonderful and Jeunet triumphs in constructing a dark, menacing world rooted in our own but at the same time completely disconnected, a joyride through the subconscious.See it for the fun and the wonderful experience. Just be aware that emotionally some of it will pretty much leave you hanging in the air due to an underdeveloped script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This entire film is a French Catholic nightmare inspired more by Dali than by any other( Spanish or not). All the characters represent biblical figures to a certain degree then warped to reflect the nightmare version of their socially accepted selves. One is of course the Jesus figure. His aim is to save his little brother and ultimately all the children (us). he is superhuman in his abilities but of course limited by his humanity. Miette represents Mary Magdalene or any potential temptation of the flesh, made all the more taboo by the man/child paradox. Old testament visions haunt us in the form of the the Siamese/Demons/Angels, the Jonah/ mariner under the sea and of course by the Evil/Satan one himself. His three flawed created selves, the clones comically represent the holy trinity while simultaneously are represented by the father himself (the creator/Brain), the son,(the One &amp; the Satan) and the Holy Ghost (the Mariner/the original. The metaphors never cease and become readily apparent for the crucification finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A noir fantasy with considerable retro elements and a few comic situations. Somewhat cerebral (not just the "brain" voiced by Jean-Louis Trintignant) but a quite poignant comment on the interface between fantasy and reality, memory and the everyday and childhood dreams vs. adult nightmares. To all us accustomed to faster-pacing American action, this movie can seem somewhat slow. It does try to communicate a message but sometimes the intertwining plots seem to collide and confuse the viewer somewhat. I may have to see it again to discern more plot arguments and twists! Some subplots, like that of the diver that rescues discarded artifacts from the city, are left somewhat high and dry... but the settings of the lugubrious harbor town are excellent and very suggestive, possibly the film's strongest point. The One and Miette duo are quite effective as characters, so are the evil twin witches and the Brain.</fullReview>

The visuals, and the Burtonesque quality of them (including the various gizmos and gadgets which have become a staple in Tim Burton films) exactly fits the story, as well as total atmosphere of the movie. You can even see much of David Lynch in the movie, at times when it is most disturbing. Ron Perlman (one of my favorite actors) brings a very good performance, despite not actually speaking French. I highly recommend this to Tim Burton fans, or maybe David Lynch fans, or maybe Terry Gilliam fans as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modus Operandi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been trying to chart the progress of this visual style. Jean-Pierre Jeunet exhibits it here and in 'Alien: Resurrection'. Since him it has been reused in the 'Matrix' trilogy, in 'Dark City', the last two 'Star Wars' films, and even in 'Lord of the Rings'. Half the technique is a fascination with colors, the other half is examining the environment.I would go out on a limb and label it a "New French" method, but that seems a misnomer. Besson predates Jeunet and he didn't display the same attitude, even in 'Fifth Element'. Thus, I have traced the influence of this technique in America to 'Alien3' (Ridley Scott really pioneered it with 'Blade Runner' but color was not affected), so we can all thank David Fincher. This is your only spoiler warning.Jeunet exhibits the technique here with all the giddiness of a 6-year-old. Like many other American viewers, I viewed Jeunet's work in a sort of "pop culture categorization" starting with 'Resurrection', then 'Amelie', then this, and finally 'Delicatessen'. I will give credit to Jeunet's orchestration of chain reactions. The finale with the seabird and the detonator is stolen right out of 'True Lies'. 'The City of Lost Children' has interesting ideas for its cliches like Mad Scientists, dim-witted Strongmen, and bandit children, but its all superficial. It's a children's fantasy much like 'Manchurian Candidate'. This is a simple movie, easy to watch and too silly for its own good. The real evil is the MPAA for rating it 'R'. Other than that, I can't say this is bad. It has its moments.Overall, French film is visually heavy but it's a facade. Russian film is more ground-breaking. British film is all-but-dead. This leaves me wondering where the German industry is in this world. 2.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>City of Lost Children boasts some very odd, original visuals and camerawork, and an overall bleary, twisted, and haunting production design, but their is not much else to recommend this otherwise slightly-above average story about a scientist who kidnaps children in order to steal their dreams.As far as performances go, Ron Perlman gives a muted, touching, and sometimes uninvolving performance as One. Daniel Emilfork lends a creepy, demented air to Krank, but is ultimately overshadowed by Jean-Louis Trintignant's voice as, quite literally, the brain behind Krank's torture. Dominique Pinon also gives a very good performance, and surprisingly each character he plays (although they all look the same) is varied.While as visually striking as a Tim Burton or Terry Gilliam and equally as dark, City of Lost Children is not as involving, provocative, or deeply-rooted as either Burton or Gilliam's films are. The story leaves much to be desired, but the entertaining children and Badalemnti's atmospheric score elevate what would otherwise be an overall average film.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The city of lost children is a film oozing with brilliant visuals, Caro and Jeunet bring forth some of the most fantastic and awe inspiring ideas I have ever witnessed like the killer flea circus, the cyclops' and the twin sisters. However amid the deliciously dark world we are forced to be pulled through a jerky and mostly incoherent storyline. The directing duo of Caro and Jeunet would make a better producer/cinematographer team than directors, this is due to the simple fact that directors must be able to tell a coherent story, otherwise the viewer is too distracted to enjoy the movie, this was the case in City of Lost Children. I felt that the story was thrown upon the characters, which led to a fake feel, rather than the intended surrealistic feel. This movie seemed nothing more than a chance to present some "neat" ideas and characters but not let you into their lives of stories. The casting was wonderful, all of the actors seemed to fit their characters molds from the beginning. However once again I didn't feel any connection with these fantastic people and creatures, this was possibly because it is a foreign film which was dubbed, but I have a feeling that even if french was my native tongue, I would still feel confused and lost. The City of Lost Children was a valiant effort at trying to combine the rich, dark visuals of a film like Dark City, and the enticing, fantastic story of Labrynth. however all that came out was a mutt, a film that was too dark to be fun and too incohereat to be enjoyed. I would probably recommend it just for the visuals, but do not come expecting to be immersed in the city of lost children.</fullReview>

They asked him, what are your favorite movies? and one of the movies he told was City of Lost Children. The name aroused my curiosity, there was a mystery in the name. At that time, years years ago, I was knowing nothing about the film and I was not aware of even IMDb did not see Amelie yet. The story I imagined was completely different. There is a man who kidnaps children and uses them in his experiments in a mysterious, surrealistic France while the police tries to catch him or not police, while a man or woman whose child is kidnapped tries to find him. Something like that. Some mystery, some horror, some surrealism and some fantasy. Later, I watched Amelie, I loved it and remembered City of Lost Children. Therefore, watched the film at last. However, it was completely different from the film I had expected. The film is neither a thriller, nor a mystery, nor a horror and not artistic. It is surrealistic, but not like Bunuel's films. Bunuel's surrealism is mesmerizing, this is a bizarre, vapid surrealism. Many people say that it was a bizarre film in a good way, so a masterpiece. No. The characters are unlikeable and not interesting at all like Amelie, the way of story telling is not serious which is one of the main problems of the film, after a while, the story is scattered and becomes 'watery' The story 'collects' itself in the final part a little bit, but it does not save it. Visually, City of Lost Children is the same as Jeunet's other films almost, but the film is not stylish like Jeunet's other works, so not appealing. Such an interesting story would have been told differently. Now, I think to myself. I should have seen Vidocq at that time, because I dreamed of it obviously without knowing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean Pierre Jeunet ranks among a handful of French film-makers known and appreciated abroad. With his first feature-length film, "Délicatessen" (1991), he had established himself as a real author with an original talent. Although I agree that his cinema appears as innovatory, I am not really fond of it. I hated "Amélie Poulain" (2001) and here, I approached " the city of lost children" with a little mistrust. Finally, I had a quite good surprise while watching it and I thought it was a more enjoyable movie than "Amélie Poulain". However and apart obvious qualities, this original fairy tale isn't as strong as it is supposed to be because of the way the story is told. But I will come back to it later.It is easy to detect Jeunet's major influences. The way he centers his actors proves that he must be a fan of Terry Gilliam, notably "Brazil" (1985). Moreover, his movie finds the humor of the Tex Avery cartoons again with quite easiness. As for the children who constitute the most important characters of the story, they seem to come from the French cinema before the Second World War due to to their costumes and their resourceful mind. With these characteristics, Jeunet and his codirector Marc Caro have conceived a plastically very attractive film that is visually a splendor. Scenery is the main star of it. I would grant a mention to professor Krank's domain, a real artificial city located between the sea and the sky and whose architecture is reminiscent of German expressionism. The careful reconstruction of the harbor, the costumes, the music and the photography contribute in recreating a threatening and nocturnal universe tightened by a gallery of odd or disturbing characters. It is also necessary to add that the film is steeped in strange poetry. As I wrote at the beginning of this review, the movie could have been powerful thanks to the story it presented but unfortunately, it isn't so. Throughout the film, the plot tends to fray and in the end, isn't equal to the whole. We could have dealt with a simple story but it seems that Jeunet and Caro have met with difficulties writing it and have somehow complicated it. The result is a little muddled story. On another hand, Ron Perlman who plays the giant with a golden heart is nice but as he constantly mumbles, it is often hard to understand him. Furthermore, using too many colorful and eccentric characters end up tiring the attention. It is a shame because the sequences when the professor Krank is the star are irresistible. The best one is when he comes in dressing up in father Christmas and singing on a Tino Rossi record so as to make children laugh and steal their dreams but his ugly face is sufficient enough to make them cry.Even if this fairy tale isn't completely accomplished, Jeunet's fans will have a wonderful time.</fullReview>

I really admire John Wyndham's works and would include "Day Of The Triffids", "The Chrysalids" and "The Midwich Cuckoos" among SciFi classics, so I once read "Stowaway To Mars" (one of his earliest stories).

From the first frame of film we are catapulted into a superbly presented vision of an incredible mind. Very few movies contain such power. Comparative examples would be movies such as "Metropolis", Dark City, and perhaps the "Cirque Du Soleil" genre. The role casting was incredible with some of the most amazing shots of children possibly ever shot on film. The futuristic 'devices' used in the movie are fresh both in concept and simplicity. This film looks stunning and perfect on the new HD Televisions especially when viewed progressively! I place this movie on my top shelf as one of the best visonary experiencing I have ever seen. Kudos to all involved in the production of the movie from it's screenplay to the last clip of film to be edited. And the score is equally great.

None of the actors seemed to deliver a really good performance that they had some contribution in, it was almost as if they were drawn by the directors, like animated figures in a Disney film; all acting was the cookie-cutter same style, hamming it up and moving with forced actions. I almost felt that it was as if this movie was addressing itself to little kid type intelligence; it reminds me of a cross between Sesame Street and an Ed Wood movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fantastical, stylish, but muddled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst sorts of failures is a failed fantasy, because the fantastic is reduced to absurdity. Whereas, in a film -- drama, comedy, or the like, if it's bad, it's simply bad. This film teeters so close to the absurd, that at any moment it is in fear of losing its footing. People adore it. Yes, there must be people who like this, just as there are people who like Absinthe. It's a strong dose of absurdist fantasy. But it doesn't have any real heart, just formulated heart; you are a watcher, never a participant; you never feel for any of the characters, and when you do, you notice. If you appreciate this film, you'll probably like Toys, with Robin Williams; in the latter film, as in this one, there is no reality within the fantasy. Ergo, it's hard to relate to anything in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put Your Dreams Away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This makes Delicatassen - from the same writing-directing team - seem like Rebecca Of Sunnybrook Farm. It's been heavily reviewed on IMDb, well over one hundred posts and all those I read were favorable in the extreme. Alas, it didn't do anything for me but then grotesque fantasy isn't my thing and Jeunet and Caro clearly 'speak' to a lot of people. If you're prepared to put the hours in there's probably a plot of sorts to be unravelled but you need to suspend disbelief on Industrial strength. There is no suggestion from beginning to end of anything remotely resembling life as we know it and/or a recognizable landscape. The main setting appears to be something akin to a North Sea oil rig peopled by fugitives from the Weimar Republic crossed with the Stasi from post-war East Germany crossed with Cyborgs from Star Trek. Apparently the Head honcho is unable to dream for himself so his solution is to kidnap children and snatch their dreams. One muscle-bound circus strong man takes objection when his brother is a victim and goes in pursuit, picking up along the way a street-wise girl lately in the employ of a couple of Siamese Twin Fagins. Dominic Pinon, who is a regular in Jeunet movies, is on hand again. Weird? Check. Wacky? Check. Wonderful? Ah, there you have me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was the point in making this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected something at least vaguely enjoyable, but I was quite disappointed in what I got.This film is beautifully made and a total bore. Imagination in film-making does not automatically produce an interesting film. I rarely stop watching a movie halfway through, but I barely even made it to that point.If you think that you will like this movie, go ahead and rent it or see it at an art movie house, but don't say I didn't warn you.* out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this could have been an excellent film, I was rather disappointed. The main characters were wonderful, but the script leaves you with a "what?" most of the time. However, I enjoy this director, and highly recommend Amelie and Delicatessen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another bad French movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like most French movies, in that it is not worth watching. The plot, what there is, is never really carried out very well. Granted, the film is bizarre, but that alone does not make it worth watching.There is a reason why more American movies a viewed in France than French movies. French movies are typically bad. This one is no exception.This movie deserves a rating 1.5 at best, so don't waste your valuable time watching it. Instead, go out and mow your yard. It will be much more intellectually stimulating. and infinitely more entertaining</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bistro Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that you can include in your collection of favorites as a testament to your broad spectrum of taste. It's best to place it prominently in your list, lest it go unnoticed that you have a discerning appreciation for the Disturbing and the Dark, and that you have a sensibility for Foreign Film.It's dark in the literal sense of the word: the digitized Rembrandt/Caravaggesque color scheme is reminiscent of a quaint, candle-lit French bistro: the kind of place where you whisper charming nothings, perhaps remarking on the Beautiful Soufflé, and where your most disturbing experience might be a dirty look from Le Garcon when you mispronounce an item in the menu, or a short moment of sheer horror upon discovering that they serve Frog's Legs.Ultimately, though, the atmosphere's antique charm and delightful meal (exquisitely presented) makes for an Edifying, worthwhile experience, another notch on the belt of a well-rounded person.And as you stroll away, tipsy from the wine, all satiated and warm, you turn to your date: "How about those frog's legs? Pretty weird, huh?" "Oh my God, so weird. I do love that place, though."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the related comic book movie, Dark City, which has NOTHING going for it, this one at least has an interesting production design. But that is all.Imagine pantomime performed by wooden fence posts. Not animated fence posts, just ordinary wooden fence posts standing in some field. That is the level of character development in this film.Maybe there was a plot. More likely there were several. The story seemed to change focus and direction randomly from scene to scene.I tried to get interested. Failed.I tried to keep my eyes open. Failed.I really wanted to get my money's worth. Failed.But at least I cut my losses. I gave up after the first half hour. Maybe it got better later. I don't care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a clear warning to anyone, please stay away from this picture. Don't get blinded by some of the positive reviews for this waste of film. I found this movie to be quite boring from the start. I had to fast forward through much of it. I also have to say that there was something weird about the relationship between the strong man and that girl. I read some comments on how some people are pointing to this movie as surreal and disturbing. Personally I found it weird, boring, and corny. I recommend to anyone out there who is reading this, if you really want to see something surreal and disturbing, rent Blue Velvet or Muholland Drive. I'll give some credit where credit is do though, as a final point. This director's best film is probably Amelie, that was a better french film then this disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible absurd movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to have a sick mind to love this movie. At least that is what I believe. I was totally amazed that this movie was awarded this high rating. Yes the visuals are OK. Perlman in Fernch is nice. But what is it about? I did not get a clue. I have seen a lot Dutch movies like this. But French, no. What is the purpose I do not understand? I have have seen some vague movies along the years but this is just plain absurd. Watch it to judge for yourself. But if you like movies with a purpose or if you like movies with some good feelings do not!!! It is just too depressing. Bonne Chance. ;-) Do not watch it if you want to have a enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Child abuse, sadistic freaks and trained parasitic insects equipped with psychotropic drugs that transform their victim into a mass murderer: this movie is tasteless. The fact that children are frequently the victims of the violence depicted makes it no more entertaining. Pretentious french artsiness does nothing to make this film more than big-budget trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Play Tombraider instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever been disappointed by a book by a favourite author. I really admire John Wyndham's works and would include "Day Of The Triffids", "The Chrysalids" and "The Midwich Cuckoos" among SciFi classics, so I once read "Stowaway To Mars" (one of his earliest stories). After a few pages, I thought "This is rubbish, but it's by John Wyndham, so it's bound to improve" and kept on reading - it didn't get any better (if anything it got worse) and I eventually finished the book with an acute sense of disappointment."City Of Lost Children" is like that. Having watched and appreciated "A Very Long Engagement" and "Amelie", this was a huge let-down. The visuals are vaguely interesting, but they're not much better than in the later Tombraider games and the Tombraider plots are superior.There aren't many movies that I wouldn't watch more than once, but this is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why so many people think this movie is "artsy" or "beautiful", or even "interesting."I sat, for some-odd agonizing hours, watching this movie, and I've never been more bored. Complete lack of...well...anything, is displayed in this movie. The screenplay could have been rewritten to take up only 2 minutes of my time, and still would have contained the same story (which, by the way, sucks already).This movie rocks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>deus ex machina</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie is one of the worst movies i've seen this year. A friend of mine kept telling me how great this was, and that it was vital for me to watch it, so after some months i finally did. What a huge, gigantic, enormous, incredibly big disappointment: this movie brings the term deus ex machina to new and never before seen horizons of the divine intervention of the creators as gods. When things go wrong, pathetic deus ex machinas are inserted(for example when Miette is drowning, suddenly appears a new character, that lives underwater and saves her), but in such an irresponsible way, that the film turns out to be just a mockery and a horrible and boring experience.I gave it 2/10 only because it made me laugh how badly this was written.(sorry for my English)</fullReview>
