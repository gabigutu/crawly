		<shortDescription>Extraordinary movie-making at its best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar's masterpiece is a breathtaking excursion into religious fascism and misogynistic tyranny made special by Rachel Weisz, who probably give one of the best female acting performances in years as a scientist who was light years beyond her generation. Weisz is amazing and her performance is the show and then some. She's back up by Max Minghella, who is a great actor in his own right and Oscar Isaac, who is just as good. The triangle between them in believable and touch by their struggles to find their destinies. Its a moving cinematic piece of art and Alejandro does the story proud in his way of capturing the time of struggles of that time. Far and away, the best film I have seen all year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good movie but overambitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was familiar with the Hypatia story because a certain category of people in my native country choose to present here as a martyr from a bygone golden age of reason, rapidly receding before the encompassing waves of Cristian barbarity and obscurantism. I think in general this is also the view this movie takes.The character of Hypatia is presented as logical, brilliant, prudent with thirst for learning for it's own sake. The only problem that a modern sensibility could find with her is her attitude towards slaves, which seem to reflect the ideas of the educated elite of the times(of antiquity in general because even people of the calibre of Aristotle shared such conceptions). Otherwise she is perfect.In a very imperfect world one must note, because the society she lives in is convulsed by civil strife and feuds between Christians, Pagans and Jews.As the movie progresses they eventually become Christian and Jews because Pagans convert to Christianity because of the attitudes of imperial authority and political expediency. Although this is not fully explained, how a very powerful pagan element becomes impotent in the second half of the movie. I think the scenario is problematic there.Also the beliefs of the group in which Hypatia belongs are not really clarified. There were pagan, believers of the aegypian Gods(there is a statue of Serapis), of Greek Gods of Roman Gods or just agnostic rationalists(as Hypatia seems to be) belonging to a pagan upper class environment? On the other side, the Christian, the "Parabalanoi" whose existence I have not verified as a social group or lay monastic order or something in between, are presented as a bunch of idiotic thugs, the equivalent of modern hooligans with a religious veneer, keen to kill, pillage and rape(although this is hinted rather discreetly)supposedly in the name of Jesus.The leader of the Christians Cyril-a historical personage who became a saint, as the final titles of the movie correctly state, is portrayed as a power-hungry(there is scene in which he avidly takes the bishop's ring from the hand of his dead predecessor), manipulative bigot. His aim is to become master of Alexandria and Christianity is his tool, while the Prefect-the political authority- stands in his way.The Prefect, being a former student of Hypatia is advised by her, thus she earns the enmity of Cyril- with fatal results. His portrayal matches with a sketch of him by Bertrand Russell in "History of Western Philosophy":"St Cyril, the advocate of unity, was a man of fanatical zeal. He used his position as patriarch to incite pogroms against the very large Jewish colony in Alexandria. His chief claim to fame is the lynching of Hypatia, a distinguished lady who, in an age of bigotry, adhered to the Neoplatonic philosophy and devoted her talents to mathematics." The way he is in the movie seems inspired by this passage, as if the makers of the movie were based on that. Nevertheless it was effective since they made the viewers find despicable a man dead by 1.600 years.There is only one scene where the Christian religion is presented with some sympathy and that is where the slave(who is secretly in love with his mistress Hypatia) is convinced to exercise the virtue of charity, by an otherwise negatively portrayed zealot(Ammonius), through giving food(bread)to the poor, who are many and needy. It is a moving scene and the sole in movie akin to present Christianity in a positive light.Religious struggle is presented as a power struggle, which may be correct when one leaves the realm of individual conscience and enters the public arena. Pagans, Christians and Jews(both people and leaders) are equally bad, the worse being the Christian zealots "Parabolani", to which a freed slave of Hypatia now belongs. Orestes, the Prefect, a former student of Hypatia, is better as a character than Cyril or Synesius, another student of Hypatia, now a high-class Church dignitary.(One though is left with the impression that Hypatia operated the Harvard of her times!) The end of the movie, presents a view of events censored compared to the one we have from historical sources, as to what exactly happened to Hypatia.I think that the actress playing Hypatia is fine and convincing as a free spirit in an age of bigotry and also good is the performance of her two unconsummated would-be-lovers the aristocrat and latter Prefect Orestes and the slave and latter Christian zealot, Davus. The actor playing Cyril conveys the aura of sliminess and bigotry of a religious power-player.Scenery and costumes are superb to watch but I do not know enough about Alexandrian geography and clothing habits to vouch for their historical accuracy.It is a movie worth seen although it leaves a bitter taste in the end and tries to say and mix too many and too weighty matters in the brief span of a cinematic exhibition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sublime Insignificant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It surprises me how many reviewers are giving this astonishing film only mediocre ratings, and I do hope this is not because the film chooses not to dwell on the viciousness of Hypatia's murder: a decision which would have made a cinematic 'spectacle' entirely inappropriate for this most subtle and beautiful of films. For the record, the real Hypatia - a pagan philosopher in fourth century Alexandria who deduced that the earth orbited the sun in an ellipse, and preserved her right to operate as a lecturer by repelling her suitors with a gift of a handkerchief stained with her own menstrual blood ? was killed as a witch by fundamentalist Christians who scraped the living flesh from her bones with seashells. It is her life and thought, however, and not the manner of her death, which is the chief subject of this film, and that is as it should be.The astonishingly realistic recreation of Alexandria is in itself a remarkable cinematic feat, the costumes look entirely authentic, the performances are flawless, and the cinematography - always beautiful - is often thoroughly awe inspiring. Ultimately, however, what makes this film so great is the way in which it puts human beings into perspective (swarming fundamentalists ransacking the agora are likened to ants, and in one of the most inspired shots in cinematic history, Alexandria is viewed from outer space, and is sublime and utterly insignificant all at once) whilst suggesting that human beings are nevertheless capable of reaching the heights of reason, and plumbing the depths of unreason. It is one of the ironies of history that the monstrous 'Saint' Cyril of Alexandria is recognised as a Doctor of the Church, whilst not a single word written by Hypatia has survived.Much ink will be wasted in coming months in discussion of whether this film deliberately paints Christianity in a bad light. The truth is that no form of religious extremism looks good in this film, and for that reason alone, it ought to be statutory viewing for all people who are convinced that theirs is the only god. Rachel Weisz plays the lead role with such grace and conviction that her refusal of Christian baptism, accompanied by the words "I believe in philosophy" ? clunky as they may look on the printed page ? becomes one of the most powerful moments in modern cinema.Forget the lukewarm reviews, and see this film for yourself. Thrown off the scent, perhaps, by publicity over-emphasising the romantic element in the film, reviewers have begun to argue that the plot begins to flag in the second half. This is to miss the point entirely: the film is not a romance; it is an exploration of one woman's discoveries about our place in the universe, and it is at once humbling, tragic and victorious. I found myself on the edge of tears throughout most of it, entranced by the splendour, wisdom and realism of its vision. The ending was the hardest and the truest thing I have ever seen in a film.But don't trust me. Make up your own mind. That is what Hypatia would have told you to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>metaphors, distances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great thing about this film is the choosing of the story, and its context. The shifting of mentalities depicted here and the riotous events, whether historically accurate or not serve as an example of what was going on. Basically the end of an age, that meant the placement of religion at the core of political, social, and cultural powering of society. So, it's pretty apt that they developed a story around the idea of christians overcoming jews and pagans, yes, but more important, forcing Orestes (the "old school" guy) to play their political game, and wiping out Hypatia, the "last" free thinker (and a woman!).Those viewers that care about historical "truth", whatever that is, should mind a few things here: there aren't enough true facts for us to be able to tell a factual story of the events, and in this film specifically, we shouldn't take things at their facial value, but to consider them as metaphors for something. Characters stand for what they represent in their context. It's all a metaphor, including the physical act of destruction of the library. Library, the term, referred to the books back than, to knowledge, no the physical place, and this certainly is understood by the writers here, who nevertheless use the idea of the building being destroyed, but as a metaphor. That building, which is fairly interesting [1] (even if virtual) becomes the central piece of the metaphor, and the richest thing about the construction of this film, for how they play with the idea of distances. It's as simple as this: first, you have the "Greek school" controlling the library, and everybody else outside. Than christians take over, throw the greeks out, and make the "library" into something close to a church. The remaining Greek thinkers are thrown to the outskirts. And the Agora, center of social discussion, becomes center of riots. Who gets the library gets control, but those events leading to control take place in the Agora. And Hypatia comes to go on with her research outside the city, marginal to the new order.There is a certain visual interest in the recreation of events, but it seems to me that there was more to the intentions of Amenabar in what concerns the use of the camera than what technology allowed him to do. The movements seem to be more mechanical than he'd probably want, because he wasn't able to predict the spacial world as much as he wanted.Than we have Hypatia, and the interesting thing about her is how in her we see something common back than, which was the use of science, logic, and mathematics as a path to God, to the understanding of the universe. Actually this attitude went on through the middle ages in western cultures, disguised with various names (gnosticism, alchemy, esoterism). Physical or metaphorically, this shift towards religious politics certainly has been one of the greatest set backs in western culture.[1] - The building has a circular hole in the ceiling, and the effect is, i think, a watered version of one of our best buildings, Rome's Pantheon.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i haven't read all the reviews...just the first few...and there was a very good one...the one about the movie being 'overambitious' and why.but as i was watching the movie i was impressed at how it was not going to be routine in a number of ways. the heroine was not going to cave to lust. OR fear of death if she must renounce her beliefs/perspectives. albeit, and this is the ironic problem, they are more deeply held. but not religious. not 'THEIR' religion. the irony continues with the heroine being 'crucified' for her beliefs... and i just didn't see that mentioned in the reviews i read... to me it's what made it a really good film...all the ellipses within the ellipses... yes. it was flawed in its telling...certain aspects were not as developed as they might've been...and they ground against each other at times. but nothing about any of the dynamics felt false... as has been pointed out, religion was once again used to front political agendas/ambitions. charismatic characters channeled the unrest present in any populous district...the yang to the settled/incumbent yin. atrocities were committed by all sides. but the center held despite the gravitational pull of all the different dynamics in the film. lots of which i haven't mentioned b/c i've read them spoken about already in other reviews/comments. no need to go over the same ground twice.anyways... i was surprised at the high rating the film got here b/c i really didn't experience it as a crowd pleaser. i don't want to REALLY throw out spoilers here, so i can't explain some of the reasons i'm writing this. but when you get to the end of the story you'll understand. still...i really admire the courage the studios had to put money behind a movie that told an interesting story on its own terms. not following some Hollywood ellipse and maybe throwing in a feelgood thread or two so that people don't leave feeling bummed out and wanting their money back... i can take a story like this. and thanks for respecting that possibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rachel Weisz Gives a Brilliant Performance. Everything Else... meh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The chief reason to see this film is for Rachel Weisz's performance as Hypatia the philosopher. She is the main character and she gives an excellent performance. Whenever she is on screen you are riveted to the screen. Her excitement at discovery, her endless desire to learn, her ability to figure out the mysteries of the universe are fascinating and she makes them feel exciting even though we know it all already. Unfortunately, when ever she is off-screen there is nothing to hold our interest until she returns. The rest of the plot is a really blunt, unsubtle message about the dangers of religious zealotry blatantly inserted onto Hypatia's story to give it some sort of relevance. The sheer lack of subtlety and intelligence behind this message is annoying. The Christians are all bigoted, mindless, intolerant fools, and the pagans are not much better. Hypatia by contrast is presented as an atheist, which she certainly wasn't, and the only reasonable person left. I have never liked having ideas forced down my throat and this movie does that extremely roughly.Hypatia has often been seen as a martyr to science which is really a shame since the history doesn't support that. In this movie she is basically presented as an atheist who doesn't believe in any of the gods which is just flat-out wrong. She was a Neoplatonist and what the Neoplatonists were known for was their incorporation of religion in their philosophy. The supposed atheism of philosophers is a myth that should really be discredited by now, and the Neoplatonists actually had miracles and spiritual elements in their teachings. That isn't to say that they had no scientific interests, but they incorporated them into a wider religious context. To have Hypatia speak out against religion in general was just wrong.The Christian zealotry in this movie is extreme to the point of being utterly unbelievable and insulting. They burn all of the books in the Library of Alexandria because they are pagan filth. The actual event that took place at this time was the burning down of a pagan temple and it's library of religious texts. The Christians never touched the library. For that matter they never intentionally destroyed scientific or philosophical works, its just that the Dark Ages wasn't really the sort of time when they had much use for those tracts which led to many of them being lost. Turning her death into a primitive reaction to education is also bull. She was killed by a Christian mob it is true, but it was over a political conflict, not a religious one. The Christian elite was as highly educated as the pagan elite before them and this wasn't seen as contradictory.Still, what's good about this movie is Hypatia. She is presented with intelligence and grace and comes across as an extremely likable person. Unfortunately the film is intent on removing her personality and making her merely a symbol. It is to the film's greater credit that in this, it fails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film stretched too far in its complexity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this today at the Toronto International Film Festival, and overall it was quite an interesting experience for me. I will first comment on the pros, and then the cons.The GoodFrom the beginning, the film's exquisite detail is evident -- costumes, sets, props, hundreds/thousands of extras, etc --, reminding me especially of HBO's Rome series. CGIs were amazing, and the sound effects used in certain scenes with large numbers of people were thunderous and powerful -- surely the best I have seen from a film. It is by far the most ambitious project in the bringing to life of an ancient city that I have seen on screen. I only wished that they would have had the actors speak in Greek, but that would be asking too much I suppose :pAlso, I liked how the film did not focus so much on portraying any one religious group as "the bad guy". Naturally, one would have assumed that it was going to be the Christians (after seeing the trailers), but in fact the goods and the bads were exposed in all religions, which added to the realism and historical accuracy of the film.Above all, this director ought to be commended in his attempt to capture the society in the city of Alexandria of late antiquity. This has never yet been done in cinema, and Amenabar clearly attempts to do this out of extraordinary passion for his work. Agora presents to the audience a glimpse into a world that is little known outside of the circles of ancient historians and classicists, and the film's portrayal of religious strife between the different groups in Alexandria successfully shows a very complex ancient society.The main character, Davus, also serves as an important figure, by representing the common man living in Alexandria at the time who must face the challenges of an ancient society in transition. However, I feel that the subtleties of Davus' character, who is indeed a source of much important historical information, would be misunderstood and ignored by the audience, which would be in search of something more direct and "in- your-face" from the film.Overall, the film was at its best when it subtly hinted certain elements/themes to the audience -- this is when it showed the most sophistication in the portrayal of history, and skill in terms of artistic merit.The BadI think the biggest mistake that the director made was to focus too much on the religious conflict. Without a doubt, during the first 45 minutes the audience was engulfed and captivated with awe by the strife between the pagans and the Christians (probably because such a time in history is little known today, and rarely portrayed in art or discussed), but the film does not give a break to its constant references to religion. Throughout the two hours, the script continuously shows the characters' endless preoccupation with religious matters, which takes away from development of their individualities. Amenabar tries to differ attention toward other things, through the love triangle between Orestes, Davus, and Hypatia -- which works well at times, but could have been developed far more (especially between her and Davus). He also gives some attention to science; a big mistake IMO, because in such scenes, one feels like the film turns into a lecture. If Amenabar had tried to use CGIs to demonstrate some of the scientific concepts discussed among characters, he could have added something artistic to the bland dialogue of those scenes.I was also somewhat disappointed by Dario Marianelli's score. HAving heard his compositions for "Pride and Prejudice", "Atonement" and "V for Vendetta", I was expecting a musical score that was more intense and thought-provoking, rather than a more or less typical and primitive symphony that one often hears in "epic" historical films.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Savagery of Religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember hearing of Hypatia's tragic tale from Carl Sagan in his "Cosmos" TV series way back in 1980. I was appalled by the tale, and shook my head as any good reasoned young man would. It was a story that stuck with me for much of my life. And I often wondered if such an important biography would ever be published about this mysterious and remarkable historic figure. I truly did not think so, and believed that Hypatia's memory would have to live on with what little history there was written about her, and the blurb mentioned once or twice by Carl Sagan as he recounted the once magnificent library of Alexandria.People are stupid. I agree with Ridley Scott on this. They really and truly are. Whether it's the zealots portrayed in this film, or the Christian who sat behind me commenting on the film (he ACTUALLY APPLAUDED the Christians in the film), or just people in general, they really are stupid. It's how we get things like religion, and place not just some whimsical desire in them, but a devout belief, a serious conviction of some entity that is displeased by earthly decadence. Hence the crux of the story in "Agora".We have the absolute mind numbed moronic thinking of the masses verse the practicality of those who know they do not know everything, but have a thirst for knowledge, and to share that knowing with others so that they can live a life free of fear.But, we see that it is fear that wins out. Not reason. Not logic applied to a simple problem with a simple solution. But pure, unmitigated fear. Everyone from the heads of state, the heads of religions, the heads of mobs, the heads of any social entity in Roman Imperial Egypt is gripped by fear. Knowledge. Reason. Logic. Understanding. Education. Those are the true weapons that can assail the most ardent of foes.But fear is primal, and infects everyone and everything like a plague spread by rats. The notion of imaginary beings who, in spite of being all powerful and all knowing, are vested in a patch of desert and how its human female population dresses should be a warning sign. Does this not sound familiar? We have the same concerns today, and although codified and addressed by legislation for local morays, and investigated and codified by alleged behavioral experts, people are still pretty touchy about anything remotely informative that doesn't gybe with their ideals: as a for instance; sex in this case.Hypatia thinks like a man, despite her sexual makeup. She is the one who calls reason, as any good leader or scientist would. The rest merely cower to the polity dominating the social terrain. But she is optimistic. Even so, the times tragically overwhelm her.The story of Hypatia has been somewhat elongated, no doubt for dramatic effect. Regardless, it's a good watch. Buy yourself a ticket, or grab the DVD when it comes out. You won't be disappointed.Enjoy! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2009</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is arguably the best film of 2009, depending on whether or not you understand the filmmaker's perspective. I believe, in some ways, full appreciation of this film can only be achieved if you have watched a completely unrelated work: "Cosmos", by Carl Sagan.Both the Library of Alexandria and Hypatia were terms that constantly came up in Cosmos; and although it is unclear if Sagan had any influence in the making of this film, it really embodied Sagan's philosophy. For example, there are a lot of aerial shots, looking at the Earth from afar - often during dramatic scenes of either love or violence that shows both how insignificant and how precious the human existence is. In spite of all our wars and hate and differences, we are all being carried on this lone blue vessel, journeying through the vast emptiness of space. Are we really that different? Or do more things unite us than divide us, like Hypatia says? In a moment of sheer ignorance, men can destroy their own proudest and most beautiful achievements and erase all of their accumulated knowledge. It's happened before, and it could happen again. This film delivered this message with beautiful precision - are we naive, like Orestes of Alexandria, to think we have finally changed? Or should we look at ourselves in the mirror and know that we still have a long road ahead to better ourselves? The choice is up to us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rachel Weisz is Oscar Worthy but the film is not worthy of her effort.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Muddled film that has its sights set high in the right course but lacks focus and a direct script that can handle the subject matter. Alejandro Amenábar tries his best but comes up short in many ways with his narrative. The movie is a little too long and the script wavers from time to time but Rachel Weisz's performance is Oscar worthy and deserving of a better film that respects the effort she puts in it. She makes you stay with the movie, even when It sputters out of control during the last half of the film. She gets good support from her leading men (Max Minghella and Oscar Isaac) but its hard for the three of them to connect with how unfocused the script is and that's the film's biggest problem.For Weisz's Oscar effort and the solid performances of her leading men, the movie gets a 7 but with out their performances, the movie would be much lower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great re-enactment of 4th century Alexandria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AGORA brings 4th century Alexandria back to life with some expensive, elaborate sets combined with a bit of CGI where necessary. Other than a couple of alterations to historical facts, such as the manner and location of Hypatia's death and the creation of a fictional slave character, the production team obviously did a tremendous amount of research and they stuck closer to the real facts of history closer than your typical Hollywood film does (for whatever that's worth). I'm a bit of a history buff, and I'm always excited when an ancient city is re-created with such attention to detail. But it couldn't have worked without a great cast, and Rachel Weisz was perfect for her role. She had just the right combination of charm, strength and enthusiasm for math &amp; philosophy to convince the audience that she was a legendary intellectual that could elicit loyalty from her male students and slaves too.This film recreates the religious struggles of the late Roman Empire, the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, the ensuing ignorance and the relegation of women to 2nd class status in society. I greatly enjoyed watching this and I hope that many more such films are created in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very courageous view of the battle between rational science and "free thinkers" versus religious doctrine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I highly recommend the film AGORA by Alejandro Amenábar (who also directed the Others) now out on DVD.It's not a perfect film (the acting and dialogue is a bit clunky at times) but it is a very courageous view of the battle between rational science and "free thinkers" versus religious doctrine. And even if it takes place 1600 years ago, the frightening conflicts are still here today and the questions the film raises are, unfortunately, still very relevant.The sets, photography, costumes etc are great, the use of shots of the earth from space give the film a slight "Kubrick" feel (not because of a parallel with 2001) but because down below, humans in their folly, are murdering each other over "my God is better than your God" fairy tales, meanwhile the universe, that we are slowly starting to understand through SCIENCE, remains there with many secrets waiting to be discovered. The film is unbelievably sad in it's depiction of mobs of religious extremists destroying accumulated knowledge, a fact that has happen many times throughout history, delaying our progress in so many ways.This is a truly a horror film for those whose value science, rationality, free thinking and feminism.Unfortunately, this film got only a very limited theatrical release in North America.I give it plenty of kudos and 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A necessary movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am so glad this movie was made and released is Spain, where the Catholic church still retains its grip on society. Other reviews have complained about this movie's lack of plot -- they miss the whole point. What this movie shows is what people were like in that time -- how ignorance and dogma ruled people's lives and how it caused misery and conflict. But in that fog of dull wits are always people, like Hypatia, who want to see further and understand more.As to the historical nature of what Hypatia herself did, I think the film goes too far. It seems highly unlikely to me that she bridged the gap between Ptolemy and Kepler essentially by herself just thinking about the problem. Prof. George Saliba and others have written extensively on the subject, and the thousand years of analysis primarily by the Arabs was actually necessary for Kepler to finally solve it. But the idea provides very well to the story to show the contrast of one people who spent their lives thinking and those the spent their lives praying, judging and persecuting.The movie does very well in putting religion in its proper place, and exalting science with the kind of devotion of one who is obsessed with it. It provides a comparison of the ultimate sacrifice of oneself to spreading understanding as supposedly Jesus sacrificed himself for the purposes of spreading ignorance and piety (this is not in the movie, but the parallel was so obvious). Hypatia actually achieves something that we all benefit from to this day, while Jesus achieved nothing.This film is exceedingly important in this era when the next generation is not as impressed by dogma, but still falls victim to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More historical reconstruction than drama as such</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The parts that were historical reconstruction were good, where they invented characters and drama it was weaker. It's good that this story has been told in a surprisingly historically-accurate way.On questions of historical accuracy, and correcting inaccuracies that other reviewers have said about the film:- "Anti-Christian bias". In fact Amenábar has gone out of his way to be negative to the other religions, to create balance. For example, pagan persecution of Christians, as shown in the early scenes, had ceased a hundred years before Hypatia's time. Even then, being Christian never appears to have been actually illegal in the pagan empire, although Christians were universally despised. The stories of Christian martyrs are too frequently overblown propaganda stories invented during Hypatia's time when the empire was starting serious persecution of pagans. The martyrdom of St. Katherine of Alexandria is often considered a Christian re-working of the Hypatia story with the religious affiliations reversed.-Some people have falsely said there were no positive Christian characters in the film. There are very many. Of the main characters, there are more positive Christians than negative. Certain people seem to think that any negative statement about any Christian must be historically false and biased. Some reviewers actually said that Orestes in this film was a pagan: he was a Christian, just one who did not persecute others: does that disqualify him from Jesus's grace? The historical Orestes was a tolerant Christian, just as in the film.-Yes, the story is remarkably true to the historical record: read Socrates Scholasticus (a liberal Orestes-type Christian). Yes, Cyril and the Parabolani did exist, just as described: yes, the fanatics were opposed to philosophy and "pagan" science. If anything, they were considerably more extreme than shown in this film. Sozomen, a cheerful "Cyril"-type Christian historian, talks about the killing of philosophers with great relish. Read Augustine on astronomy and science, and on toleration of dissent. Or Lactantius or Tertullian: "What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?", "This is our primary faith: there is nothing we ought to believe besides." Not all Christian leaders and writers were wise and humane. For conservative Christian cosmology, look up Cosmas Indicopleustes (admittedly a hundred years later). The views of Ammonius in the film follow Cosmas. For general background, try Synesius, Ammianus Marcellinus, or Zosimus. -The Library of Alexandria. Wise people judge others on their actions themselves, and not on the affiliations they profess. The library was mentioned up to Hypatia's time, and not mentioned after. Some people try to blame it on Julius Caesar (although Antony later rebuilt it), and then desperately on anyone other than on someone who carries a label they identify with. After the Arabs conquered Egypt, a story was then circulated in Medieval Europe that the Muslims had destroyed it. That one still gets airplay. As far as anyone can tell, Christian mobs destroyed it along with the rest of pagan institutes. Theodosius gave orders in 391-2 to destroy not just the Serapeum, but all pagan temples and worship.-The scene of the Christians distributing bread was good, convincing and historically accurate. Some reviewers have used it to imply that pagans would not do this. It was true at the time. But remember that during the pagan empire there was dole of bread in cities: normally nobody was short of bread. Constantine nullified the urban bread ration with a stiff poll tax. There are many places where the film is bravely historically accurate: even at the cost of risking mass appeal. -Hypatia's chastity. It was brave to have purely intellectual romance without any sex or even kissing. -The religious aspect of her astronomy. -The lack of any modern political correctness for the main characters.Also good was the direct historical reconstruction of key scenes: Cyril's biblical challenge to Orestes over advice from a pagan and a woman, the subsequent physical attack on Orestes, the persecution of the Jews, etc.As for things which actually were historical inaccuracies:- Kepler. This was a kind of sweet artistic liberty. I took this as a sort of inside joke. Hypatia was an astronomer, among other things, and her most original work was on the mathematics of conic sections. So to have her tentatively propose the possibility that the the earth might move in a different conic section - an ellipse rather than a circle - is entertaining but not entirely implausible.- It would have been much better to have explained in more detail Hypatia's views on spirituality and the flesh, so that her "cure" for her admirer's physical passion was a bit more clear. Perhaps this is in the scenes that had to be cut. In reality, this is explained in detail in Synesius's letters.- Synesius of Cyrene. He was in fact a much more sympathetic character than made out in the film: both more humane and braver and more admiring of Hypatia. He is the only character whose writings we still have: personal letters that are well worth reading even today. Perhaps Amenábar needed a more critical character to balance Orestes's total admiration. But that kind of utter devotion was common between teacher and pupil in philosophical schools, even across religious boundaries. Again it is interesting that certain reviewers seem to think that admiration for a pagan equals paganism: even today. Just like Cyril. The message of the whole film was that this is not true. It was too subtle for some, obviously.- The initial attacks of pagans on Christians are anachronistic. Also pagans could not own Christian slaves at this time. But I suppose they had to explain the fanatics hatred for the pagans somehow, other than an inflated memory of events that had occurred a century before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grandiose endorsement of science against religion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you feel like settling down before a serious dramatisation of knowledge versus bigotry, try this $70m production that lost tens of millions and vanished everywhere but in Spain, where they lapped it up.Rachel Weisz plays Hypatia, a philosopher and space scientist who clung on to the old knowledge of the ancient Greeks amidst the turmoil of passionately stupid early Christians.The acting is good, and the costumes and sets are breath-taking. The film is framed in zoom shots of planet Earth.This production is far too intelligent, even for European audiences, let alone the tweeter popcorn mall crowds in the USA, who would completely fail to understand it from start to finish. They would want much more bloodshed and combat, abundant cruelty to slaves and women, and plenty of mouth-watering shots of Weisz's breasts and bum.This is one of the more remarkable follies of film history. I loved every minute of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The acting is fantastic but the script does not have any respect for the material.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfocused look at the beginning of the dark ages has a dedicated cast of actors working with basically nothing in terms of a coherent plot. Rachel Weisz does extraordinary work with what she has but she's doing more than she should have in terms of the script she is working with and it shows because while the movie struggles with its incoherent plot, Weisz gamely gives it the strong characterization it needs. Fortunately for Weisz and the audience, she is surrounded by equally dedicated actors who bring more to their characters and the script as well with Max Minghella, Ashraf Barhom and Oscar Isaac each giving more to the material they are working with. Which is a shame because if the film had a tighter script that focus more on the age and time the film was set in, the film would have been much better off than it is right now. As it is, its more a lesson on how good acting can be blindsided by weak material than a lesson on what the age was about.5/10 (For the acting only)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am Greek so my opinion is biased by definition. I understand that not everybody is familiar with Greek history, especially in the roman and medieval times. I did not expect one 100% historically accurate depiction of Hypatia's story. It would be simply unnecessary. The point that the film is making though is very true and I must admit it is rather contemporary regarding the identity of the Greek nation. It isn't about being pagan or Christian. For us Greeks it' s about the inheritance of the world of Classical Antiquity in contrast with the inheritance of the Byzantine Empire. These two worlds collide even today within the Greek culture and as ancient Greece, as well as the Byzantine Empire, both had significant influence on the course of European history, the impact that of this controversy is of general interest. All the film can be summarized in one phrase of Hypatia. "You don't doubt your God. I have to doubt what I believe." This is the struggle that this film depicts. This is the core of the Greek identity. This is what is important. The film is about the death of a world and the rise of another. The reasons why are shown very well in the film. Do not hesitate, should anyone of you visit Greece, to study what specific parts of the Greek statues where destroyed by Christians. The film shows exactly what my nation experienced under the influence of poverty, absence of education, social turmoil and huge economic dissimilarities. This is the cultural context of the film. And a fair judgement should take that in mind.</fullReview>

Some of the themes raised by the script does not gel in certain scenes and a few of the characters are thinly drawn out and are more caricatures than human beings. Rachel Weisz however does lift this move above its short comings with a brilliant and moving performance that captures the struggles of a woman trying to bring sense to a world on the brink of the Dark Ages and her performance as well as the performances of her costars ( Oscar Isaac, Max Minghella and Ashraf Barhom) makes you stay until the tragic end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably most people in classics know something about Hypatia of Alexandria. I myself discovered her while looking over a book my parents had, which was an illustrated history of the triumph of Christianity in ancient Rome, accompanied by a graphic depiction of the destruction of the Serapeum and the attack on the beautiful female philosopher (likely 60 at the time, but no matter). Alejandro Amenabar, however, has devoted an entire film to this story, and one can see that the subject fascinates him. How did we become who we are today? What was it that transformed the Roman Empire (the Western World, in other words) into the world of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson? Sure, the events happened more than 1500 years ago, but the link is clear as glass.In a world which set design has rendered so believably that it might as well be taken directly from a wall painting from Pompeii, and populated by characters so well cast (at least physically) that they might, as one reviewer has already said, come from Greco-Roman mummy portraits from Roman Egypt, particularly Davus, the slave boy (Max Minghella) and Ammonius, the fanatic (Ashraf Barhom), the civilization of the Hellenistic world is coming under attack by the forces of an intolerant form of Christianity, which seeks to "purify" the city of Alexandria. Hypatia, however, dispenses with religious distinctions in her classroom, teaching pagans, Christians, and Jews alike the secrets of the universe. Her earnest pursuit of scientific truth trumps all other preoccupations, until, at the end of the film, she finds, to her horror and incomprehension, that her very existence on this earth has become impossible.I have to say that I found the film very engrossing, but then, I love the period and am fascinated by the religious upheavals of late antiquity. I can say that all of the actors perform wonderfully, though I do wish the role of Davus had been fleshed out. Minghella is heartbreaking, and his role perfectly illustrates what it was that likely made many turn to Christianity. If only we could have seen more of him. At times, the film seems like his story, not Hypatia's, and he vanishes for most of the second half. I myself buy why Hypatia has so many suitors (Weisz makes her extremely intelligent without sacrificing physical beauty, and imbues her with a wide eyed, childlike quality that exudes vulnerability and innocence), but I think I needed to see her struggle with her demons more. Why does she reject Orestes? A single shot hints at a conflict here, but it is left at that. The film had an additional twenty minutes that were cut for the sake of marketability. . .perahps the director's cut will illuminate this more? To sum up, the film is flawed, too much character development is sacrificed for the sake of pacing, but in the end, it is an affecting film about a time period that needs to be better known.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie. Truly inspirational. So many sides to this movie. It depicts the biography of whom I understood as the mother of Science, Hepatia. And also the effect of religion ( Or dare I say of Christianity) to the progress of human intellect and also the conflict between Human intellect and stupid faith. And love of a young slave with his mistress. And I cannot say I love one aspect more than the other. As a student who have studied science his whole academic life and who is still fascinated about the cosmos, this movie is so inspirational because it shows how great people fatigues their minds to come up with the knowledge that is common knowledge to us all now. Some say that thinking of the stars, what really happens in this world and what happens in the cosmos is no really concern of ours because in our day to day life we never get to use that knowledge. But what if we all think like that then such philosophies that gave birth to our modern sciences would have been for nothing. To know that we also share the passion, the passion of those great philosophers like hepatia in finding out the mysteries of the universe, is truly something. To ignore that passion and say that we don't want it is to disgrace the progress of science.I think one of the greatest crimes in human history is depicted in this movie the great burning of the library of Alexandria. This is only one of the incidents that has shapes our history or, more accurately, mutilated our history. Such incidents has caused the demise of the progress and set back the steady succession of the development of science. And for what . In the name of religion. All in the name of effing religion. I stand down here.I'm so grateful that Rachel Weisz starred in this masterpiece. I still would have watched it. But her appearance certainly increased the chances. And overall this was well made. One of the best historical documentary movies I should say. One other such movie comes to my mind while vomit comes up to my throat. Alexander. Gosh I hated that movie. This movie is Golden compared to that piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb movie about religious intolerance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, a movie has been made that shows the loss of freedom of inquiry and of religious belief that took place in the late 4th Century early 5th Century C.E. (Common Era) as Christian fundamentalists took political power. We see how these fanatics ruthlessly attacked pagans, Jews, and secular philosophers who didn't follow the "true religion." It places well on the historic events that occurred in Alexandria, Egypt, at that time with brief mentions of what's going on in the rest of the Roman world, such as the edicts from the emperor. Rachel Weisz is brilliant as Hypatia.The movie is also a great reminder of what happens when religious fundamentalists have their way. No freedom of religious belief or inquiry existed for hundreds of years in Europe while Christian clerics were in control. But we need only look at events today in Saudi Arabia and anywhere else in the Islamic world where Sharia law has been imposed to see the barbarism that unfolds. In areas of Afghanistan where the Taliban are in control today (2010), women are beaten or even executed for being outside alone or for getting an education. When the Taliban ruled the country in the 1990s, they also suppressed the teaching of math and science, and tried to wipe out the country's history through the destruction of records, films, and monuments. In Saudi Arabia, rape victims are whipped.I'm sure there are some Christians who are uncomfortable with this movie's reminder about Christianity's early history. Fundamentalist leaders like Pat Robertson and Franklin Graham denounce the spread of Islam through conquest in the 7th and 8th Centuries. Yet they turn a blind eye to the tyranny and loss of freedom that occurred when Christians gained political power in the late Roman era.Agora is quite a change from the old movies from the 1950s that had a religious overtone. Several of them, such as The Robe, Quo Vadis, and Samson and Delilah, depicted all pagans or anybody who isn't a Jew or Christian as morally depraved and decadent. Christians were always portrayed as good and pure. The focus was only on biblical-related stories that ignored the world outside the Bible. As far as they were concerned, nothing good came from pagan Egypt, Greece or Rome. Fortunately, movies of that nature aren't being made much anymore or are bombs at the box office.It's a shame that Agora did not get much advertisement in the United States. In the Washington, DC area, it was shown at only two theaters. I only found out about it from an email list I'm on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't include any spoilers in this review... I entered this movie thinking i'll see some epic war, or some romance story, or maybe scientific breakthroughs... or hell a documentary maybe...? It is true that there was a myriad number of things to expect, but i didn't expect it to be all of these at once. The movies problem is not in lack of content, on the contrary, there is just so much going on, there is no focus or general direction to be seen anywhere. There is no general direction for the story itself; in the middle of the movie you're going to be wondering okay what are we concentrating on here...? Here is the way i see it; twists are nice, but total clue-lessness is not. The director is trying to do too much in one movie. He tries to talk about handful of characters at once with way too much detail about each. I would've rather had a movie that talks about one of these characters with much more focus. The acting, however, was pretty good. Rachel Weisz and a handful of actors provided us with an admirable performance that was nice to watch. The environments and depictions of 4th century Egypt were stunning. Not a waste of money, but nothing memorable either.. I've seen better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agora: a wonderful historic film about the fall of the pagan world and the rise of Christianity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Agora explores, without sentiment or melodrama, a time period and a subject that I have often overlooked; the violent and tragic end of the Pagan Classical World and the beginning of the Christian Dominated West, which also launched the Dark Ages. Watching this film I cannot help but ask myself, would we have been better off if the worshipers of Serapes and Isis had won the day.The movie was divided into two historic parts: the sheltered pagan world of wealth and status-quo where Christianity was no more than an annoying cult; and the Christian world under Emperor Theodosius with all of its early Patriarchs and Saints. The film's main character, Hypatia, was a sheltered, brilliant, upper class Pagan: a mathematician and philosopher living in a liberal world of free thought. Before her, all the ancient knowledge of Rome, Greece, and the Near East lay in scrolls in the Great Library of Alexandria: a treasure that only the pagans seemed to comprehend. This pagan world felt a little bit like our own, with its freedom of thought and its blind belief in the universal search for knowledge and understanding. One of my favorite things about the pagan world was that the elite Patricians and the wealthy Jews all enjoyed the theater.The pagan world presented in the film had a dark side as well. The slaves although treated somewhat warmly still had to wear a collar and they were also whipped. Another problem was in the established pagan cult religion of Serapes and its high priest who was an ass. But aren't so many "high priests" and people in authority asses, even today. It was a world in decline but Hypatia and the other privileged Pagans didn't know it. She dwelt in the realm of the mind, protected by the serapium and walls of the Great Library. Yet down below in the Agora the growing number of discontented Christians were about to rise up and smash the pagan world to bits. And that's exactly what they did, by tearing down the statues, taking over the city, and burning all of the scrolls in the library to ash, thus casting a darkness over the mind of the world which wouldn't lift until the Renaissance.In the second half of the film we see Christianized Alexandria some years later. Here the freedom of the mind that was so prevalent in the beginning has been crushed. Most members of the pagan Patrician class have by now converted to Christianity whether they believed in Christ or not. Hypatia is the last holdout, huddled in her mansion working on her brilliant theory of a heliocentric universe while the world around her slips into intolerant religious darkness based on faith and scripture alone. As the Bishop held the Bible over his head proclaiming that the scriptures say that women should be seen but not heard a chill went down my spine. The Christians had traded in all books and all knowledge for that one book: the Holy Bible. And we today are still suffering under the yoke of that mindset whenever evolution is disputed or someone thumps their Bible proclaiming it to be the indefatigable word of God.</fullReview>

It shows the barbarity of christians, jews, pagans, and other religious groups. It shows their hate of knowledge, because their fairy tales are incompatible with reality. Just like now. And it also shows how quickly they stop fighting each other and work together when someone questions the entire idea of having imaginary friends in the sky. Because someone that isn't completely delusional is worse than someone with a different imaginary friend in the sky.

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant movie and I can barely fault it (my only complaint is that it implies that Hypatia was an Atheist, when as a Neoplatonist she was almost certainly a polytheist). I think the reason it has not been more successful is because it is about a time and place most people know very little about. I recommend this movie to all intelligent adults but, unless you have a reasonable background in classics and/or ancient history, I suggest you look up a bit about the period, and about Hypatia, first. The movie is not anti-Christian - a careful assessment of the story shows this (via a number of sympathetically portrayed Christians). Unfortunately so few Christians are actually aware of their early history that many of them will freak out when they realise how violent their history has been (at times) and declare the movie anti-Christian propaganda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning and a strong message about fundamentalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I will say that the cinematography of this movie was beautiful. It's a shame that more viewers did not get to see it on the big screen in a cinema because here I'm sure it would have been even better. I first stumbled across this hidden gem on Netflix. I had never heard of the movie or heard of Hypatia but enjoy period movies so I decided to give this one watch. Its an unusual movie for the genre in that the lead is a woman and the casting of the primary male characters were all from virtual unknowns. Having said that, I thought all the acting was top notch across the board. The story is set in forth century Alexandria in a period of great religious change in the city. While at first glance the story seems to be about Hypatia, a philosopher and scientific pioneer, the story is rather seen through the eyes of her young slave Davus, who is played by Max Minghella. I had seen him play in the Social Network prior to watching this and here he was a revelation. His near mute performance is delivered primarily through looks, expressions and body language. Some of the scenes he shares with Rachel are stunning and very touching. The first act delivers strongly, but as the second act unfolds, the main characters seem to get lost in the the up swelling of religious upheaval. Part of the problem is the script here seems to relegate the interesting characters of Davus and Ammonius to spectators while Hypatia studies and the very one dimensional Cyril plots. Oscar Isaac as Orestes was very good in the second half. A powerful scene with his childhood friend Synesius is a strong one. The final section of the movie is completed by a beautifully passionate, violent but heart wrenching scene featuring the leads which is excellently performed. Aside from the scripting problems and some painful lines at times this movie could have been even better. I would class it as a very strong movie with excellent acting, beautiful visuals portraying a very interesting time in history. While many Christians will think of this as anti Christian, I think the overall impression I was left with was the moral of anti fundamentalism. Neither Christians, or Jews or Pagans were sold as good in this movie. All groups committed atrocities which parallel the tensions in our world. Overall worth a view on Netflix at least. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic and historical drama about a famous female philosophy and astronomy professor called Hypatia of Alexandria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spectacular and lavish film well directed by successful filmmaker Alejandro Amenabar . Historical drama concerning a slave (Max Minghella) who turns to the rising tide of Christianity in the hopes of pursuing freedom while also falling in love with his master, the known female philosophy and mathematics professor Hypatia of Alexandria (Rachel Weisz) .The mathematician and philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria was the daughter of the mathematician Theon Alexandricus (Michael Lonsdale). She was educated at Athens. Around AD 400, she became head of the Platonist school at Alexandria where she imparted the knowledge of Plato and Aristotle to any student. The picture is set in Alexandria, 391 AD . There Hypatia teaches astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy. Her pupils included pagans, Christians , slaves (Max Minghella) and foreigners . As the city's Christians, led by Ammonius (Ashraf Barhom) and Cyril (Samir) , gain political and economic power . At the end Orestes (Oscar Isaac), the governor of Alexandria, and Cyril (Sami Samir) , the Bishop of Alexandria, found themselves in a bitter feud in which Hypatia would come to be one of the main points of contention . The feud, which took place in 415 AD, began over the matter of Jewish dancing exhibitions in Alexandria . Since these exhibitions attracted large crowds and were commonly prone to civil disorder of varying degrees . Then was published an edict which outlined new regulations for such Jewish gatherings . Soon after, crowds gathered against Jews and these angry over the new regulations that had been imposed upon them , which many people felt was an attempt to incite the crowd into sedition .This intense drama is based on some hokey events , on a hand there are real deeds , but on other hand based on false facts ; as Christians are the bad guys when actually by that time Catholics were relentlessly pursued and massacred . A historical, epic film set in Roman Egyp with excellent acting , overwhelming set design , colorful cinematography by Xavi Gimenez , evocative musical score by Dario Marianelli and lavishly produced by Fernando Bovaira . Interesting and thought-provoking screenplay by Alejandro Amenábar and Mateo Gil , they wrote the script with Rachel Weisz in mind to play Hypatia, the lead character. Splendid performances all around and special mention to Rachel Weisz giving one of the best acting of his prestigious career . Originally, Alejandro Amenábar wanted Rachel Weisz, Sacha Baron Cohen and Jonathan Rhys Meyers to appear in the film. After reading the screenplay, Weisz did accept the part of Hypatia, however, Baron Cohen turned it down . Along with a notorious remaining cast such as Max Minghella as Davus , Oscar Isaac as Orestes , Ashraf Barhom as Ammonius , Michael Lonsdale as Theon and Rupert Evans as Synesius . Impressive production design , as the sets were built on the exact same spot , Fort Ricasoli, Malta, where the Coliseum was built for Gladiator . The fort was also used for Julius Caesar, Helena of Troy and Troy . Breathtaking visual effects , as the FX team designed the night skies accurately for the time period of the movie using a star chart software.The picture is partially based on facts , as the texts written are varied : The contemporary 5th-century sources do identify Hypatia of Alexandria as a practitioner and teacher of the philosophy of Plato and Plotinus, but, two hundred years later, the 7th-century Egyptian Coptic bishop John of Niki? identified her as a Hellenistic pagan and that "she was devoted at all times to magic, astrolabes and instruments of music, and she beguiled many people through her Satanic wiles". Not all Christians were as hostile towards her as John of Nikiu or the monks who killed her: some Christians even used Hypatia as symbolic of Virtue . Two widely cited, but divergent texts describe the feud between Orestes, the prefect of Alexandria and Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria . The feud and the city-wide anger it provoked ultimately brought about the death of Hypatia .One source, the Historia Ecclesiastica was written by Socrates Scholasticus some time shortly after Hypatia's death in AD 415 . Scholasticus gives a more complete, less biased account of the feud between Orestes and Cyril, and the role Hypatia played in the feud that resulted in her death. The other source, The Chronicle, written by John of Nikiu in Egypt, around 650 AD, demonizes Hypatia and Orestes directly, while validating all Christians involved in the events Nikiu describes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If She Only Had a Beard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Agora and The Last Temptation of Christ over one weekend, and ended up vastly preferring the movie I disagreed with. The Last Temptation is an earnest, though unorthodox, treatment of the Christian messiah. It's a brilliant and powerful film. Agora makes a similar attempt for a secular saint ? Hypatia of Alexandria, a remarkable woman scientist and philosopher who was killed by a misogynistic Christian mob in the early 5th century. It's a competently-mounted story of an important personage, at an interesting time in history, with a rare and compelling glimpse of the early Christian church. It works well enough as a "biopic," but in the end, this Peristera doesn't quite have the muscle to take off.Why not? Many things are done well ? Rachel Weisz was born to play intelligent and tragic women. Max Minghella is intense as one of Hypatia's domestic slaves, and her admiring quasi-Judas (his conversion to Christianity is one of the standout scenes). Michael Gambon is a confused patriarch who's losing his political instincts just as his city needs them. The canvas is crawling with bearded and snarling holy warriors, both on the side of the pagan establishment and the scruffy Christian upstarts. The production values are excellent, and the action is set in believable temples and loud marketplaces.The bits of politics may be too dry for most, but I relished the close look at the days when the Christian church first showed itself as a force, and polytheism began to disappear from Mediterranean culture. The plot gets moving when Alexandria's idol-worshipers unleash a pogrom against the Christian church, and are promptly handed their asses by the vast underclass of converts. The Romans send troops to restore some semblance of order, but only succeed in delaying the inevitable blood-letting.Hypatia wants none of this, and rejects both politics and marriage proposals to content herself with fictionalized discoveries. Unfortunately, "the nearer blood, the nearer bloody" ? as power-hungry priests hurl chunks of dogma at each other like rocks from catapults, her gender and intellect mark her as a particularly soft target. The emotional arc of Agora is a progressive tightening one gets most often from Holocaust movies.Now, the bad: the debates and science here are rather skeletal, and the dialogue is bread-and-potatoes prose. The plot is somewhat unfocused, attempting to follow local politics, Hypatia's personal life and her research at the same time, and not doing too profound a job of either. A great failing of the movie is that it literally lets you see the framing device ? occasional Google Earth shots of the Mediterranean, set to generic Middle Eastern wails. While it fits with Hypatia's astronomical interests, yanking the viewer into near orbit ranks with clown noses as a concentration-killer. The characters are also too self-aware and modern ? one can almost see a cultural studies professor grimly shaking her head.Agora is a good, straightforward movie that deals with topics American films don't usually touch. It could have been better than it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True face of cristianity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very good movie. It is a must to show this in schools so children can understand how cristianity became the number one religion.A movie about the expansion of Christianity, the true religion of murder, the true religion of hate, the true religion of stupidity, mediocrity and mental slavery, the true religion of death and destruction.2000 years later and still people are still so stupid and so easy to controll by a hand of people.Gods are as real as Santa Claus and tooth Fairy. But still mankind believes in such stupid idioms instead of free thinking.Mankind will never be free until it gets rid off every religion.Religion brings out the worst in people, because those who believe in gods they usually are stupid as sheep.That is why cristianity is the religion of sheep (stupid people).Only science and smart people made our life be so good. Religion only kept us on the dark ages.The lack of thinking whatsoever gives birth to gods and religions.I guess mankind will need another 2000 years to get rid of religions.R.I.P.

		<shortDescription>This is better than my version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I told a director friend of mine a few years ago I wanted to make two movies and one was about Hypatia (I'll save the other title). She didn't know who Hypatia was, but later reported to me that someone was already making the movie. It was not originally released in the US, only in Europe, and tried to see it there recently but missed it. I learned by accident it was playing in LA for a short time and went to the opening show this morning. I was not disappointed. I first learned about Hypatia from Carl Sagan in PBS TV Series Cosmos. I then read up on her, and went to the original sources (very few exist). The movie was pretty close to what is known about her. I visited Alexandria to see the Library location myself and really enjoyed seeing the recreation of ancient Alexandria in this movie. I loved so many things about this movie, I don't know where to start, so I won't. I'd just say go see it, for an enlightening view into the ancient world and forgotten, but important history. I am glad Alejandro Amenábar made this film--I couldn't have done it any better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Partial credit for Hypatia's astronomy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As listed in the errors section, Hypatia couldn't have known from the observational equipment available to her that the earth's orbit was an ellipse rather than a circle, (which is a special case ellipse). It was the work of Kepler using the very precise measurements of Tycho Brahe that proved that the earth's orbit is in fact an ellipse, however the deviation from a perfect circle is very minute.The seasons are caused by the tilt of the earth's axis 23.5 degrees with respect to the ecliptic, the plane that contains the earth's orbit. In the northern hemisphere, in the summer, the northern hemisphere is tilted at a better angle, thus the warmer weather. The opposite for wintertime. The earth is actually closer to the sun in the winter than summer due to the earth's orbit being a (nearly circle) ellipse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting point in history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(www.plasticpals.com) Modern moviegoers have the attention spans of small children, so it doesn't surprise me that Agora was overlooked when it was quietly released into a handful of theaters in 2009. Its subject matter is less than appealing for the Christian leaning United States, a majority of whom will not want to be reminded of this particular slice of history. The story takes place at the end of the Roman empire in Alexandria, 391 A.D., when Christianity was beginning to flex its new found political power to squash anything in their way, which would eventually plunge the Western world into the dark ages. Rachel Weisz stars as Hypatia, the first notable female mathematician, and a teacher at the city's most prestigious library. Though she lives in a male-dominated society, she dismisses her suitors in her search for the truth about the cosmos.Agora is not specifically an anti-Christian film, as some have labeled it, but it reminds us that Christians do at times kill for their beliefs (which, incidentally, still occurs - note: this review was written prior to the recent massacre in Norway). In fact, none of the groups in the film are shown in a very flattering light, as stupid decisions lead to an endless cycle of revenge, with each side believing they are the righteous. Other negative aspects of society at the time are also shown ? Hypatia, for her part, has slaves that she treats with disregard. It is a Christian who is shown feeding the hungry in an act of selflessness. It's a fascinating time in history, and it doesn't require the bloody games of the Colosseum to hold one's interest.One of Hypatia's students would go on to become the governor of Alexandria for Imperial Rome. Though she doesn't return his affections, his love for her puts them both in the middle of a power struggle with the Christian coalition. All of the sets and costumes are done quite well, and the city is shown with the same degree of realism as the Roman-era revival film, Gladiator. Though Hypatia seems a bit frigid, Rachel Weisz does a good job with the role, and the other actors fill out their parts admirably. I caught it on Netflix (one of the few relatively new movie releases that interested me) and I recommend it. It's not a perfect movie but it does a good job of capturing an interesting period in our history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title tells us little about this well-intentioned but sadly unsatisfactory film. An agora was a place of congregation and the word comes from Ancient Greek. In this case, the setting is Alexandria during the Roman occupation in the late fourth and early fifth centuries and the agora is the location of some of the conversations of the central character, the real life philosopher Hypatia. She was certainly a remarkable character, a woman in a man's world who was free of religious superstition and brilliantly original in her thinking about the movement of the planets, and she is presented as a rationalist icon for our troubled times.Rachel Weisz is fine as Hypatia and could and should have been given a more dominant role. The sets and the CGI - it was shot in Malta - convey well Alexandria at a time when it hosted the most famous library in history. But almost everything else is a disappointment. The dialogue is wooden and the narrative confusing with Christians, Jews and pagans competing for men's minds (Hypatia is the only female character) and various former associates competing for Hypatia's affections.The fault has to be down to the Spanish Alejandro Amenábar who both co-wrote and directed the effort. One interpretation of this film is that it shows that early Christianity preceded modern Islam in having a fundamentalist strand which was intolerant of other faiths, hostile to women, and in conflict with rational and scientific enquiry. But the tale could have been so much better told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always read about Hypatia with great passion to know more about her, this movie added a lot to this passion! Well done!Davus (Max Minghella), Hypatia's slave and then, after released, the Christian revolutionary, is the most controversial character in the whole plot .. Davus symbolizes the weak part in human beings and their thirst for power even if through following a certain religious belief .. we saw how he converted to Christianity .. without discussing or listening .. just through feeling he was giving from the bread of his own master .. this gave him the feeling of superiority like his master .. Hypatia (Rachel Weisz)gave the symbol of Super self esteem, stubbornness, Persistance, resoluteness, Science addiction, etc I would never find enough words for that! the reason she refused Christianity was because it would limit her span of thoughts and would prevent her from questioning facts or trying to redefine them! A one last note about Ammonius (Ashraf Barhom), the parabolani monk, he symbolized how following a certain belief not only can bring you joy and inner peace, but can also bring you to the level where you become a tool of destruction and spreading horror among human beings! HOWEVER, the movie has a lot of fictional drama added to the historical content so as not to take it as a historical reference :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am late in viewing this movie as it is now shown on Showtime2. While it is a beautiful movie scenic-wise and very well acted, I feel that the VERY important point is that mankind is still fighting science through religion. We are indeed an unwise species and our ignorance obviously has come down through the ages as the common man tries to understand the marvels of science all the while fearful of losing control politically. The scenes that illustrate the destruction of the library is repeated today as we close libraries, tolerate children who do not read so that minds can be controlled. The speech interpreting the role of women was the breaking point for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent historical film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a fantastic movie, covering such an important moment in western history for the first time. The rise of the power of the Christian cult in the Roman cities, and how this effected classical Greco-Roman culture.The film presents a compelling vision of life in classical Alexandria. The historical detail was superb. The Greco-Egyptian deity Serapis was indeed worshipped in this period. The mixture of Hellenic and Egyptian culture was spot on. The recreation of the Library and Serapium was a wonder to behold, perfectly in line with what we know about the period.We cannot know whether the Early Christian Church (or it's followers) were really responsible for as much strife as the film suggests. But it is plausible, given accounts of the era (such as the real-life stripping and murder of Hypatia and widespread destruction of pagan temples). Given our present experience with religious fanaticism, it is easy to see how a new religion claiming to have a universal answers was likely received by both hungry new converts searching for meaning and existing communities.The film is not suggesting that all Christian Martyrs were fanatics elevated into propaganda figures. I am guessing this perceived suggestion is what some Christians found objectionable. No doubt some people will read the film in this way, one cannot help that. Some however, may well have been provocateurs, harassing their neighbours and then reaping the fear and outrage it provoked. Isn't it interesting that those pagans who died for their beliefs, aren't also considered Martyrs by the Christian Churches? They were persecuted too, but but their beliefs were 'wrong' of course.At the end of the day, neutral people in the middle of the two paranoid and bigoted communities, are often the ones who suffer the most unjustly. Hypatia is depicted as a true humanist; she does not care what cult people follow, and is only concerned for the welfare of human beings. Between the two reactionary factions, remaining humane and independent becomes impossible, as it has for so many millions in conflicts across the world in our own time. She, like so many other humans, ultimately faces the choice of joining or dying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a true and rare gem that we unfortunately encounter so rarely these days. The significance of Hypatia and what she stood for works on so many levels. The dialog made me cry because of how good it was. When she said that she had to question everything and we knew that she made a discovery, it gives this line such a heavy meaning. And the movie itself contains such a strong emotion that it becomes almost unbearable in the end. Her story signifies the point in history that marked the fall of women and the beginning of their treatment as second class citizens. It has been happening ever since. When you think how many discoveries could have been made, it makes one sad, so sad. Women like her have been systematically wiped out during the human history until there are none of them left. That is why this movie is more than a movie, it is a requiem for all free thinking, strong and independent women ever born on this planet. Amenabar has a talent that is as rare as his movies. He is a true humanist, his movies although tragic are so humanistic, they make your soul weep.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ancient Art of Ethnic Cleansing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one movie about Roman Egypt around 400 AD in which the Christians don't all come out on the side of the angels, at least not the prevailing Parabolian Sect in Alexandria. It's a refreshing change to see human beings instead of stereotypes on the screen. I've had enough of Charlton Heston.The film bears a message peculiar for our times. Sometimes it's better to be curious and open minded instead of believing blindly in an ideology. And so we see hints of the contrast between the perfection of movements in celestial bodies and the unrelenting influence of the reptilian brain on human behavior.Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) is head of the library in Alexandria. Not the old one, but its replacement. And she teaches classes in logic, astronomy, and mathematics. She has no interest in theology. As a young woman and a figure of some authority, she attracts her male students and some of them develop crushes on her. But she has no use for that carnal stuff either. She's more given to filia than eros, and when one pupil gives her a present of his musical instrument, she reciprocates with her own gift, a menstrual cloth. After that, the plot gets too complicated to describe in any detail -- and at 127 minutes it's a long flick.Basically, the Romans rule Alexandria but permit the worship of pagan gods like Serapis. But the cult of Christianity is growing and they overthrow the pagan establishment with considerable enthusiasm and bloodshed. Not that Serapis was any great loss. He was deliberately invented by an Egyptian king to unify the Greeks and Egyptians in his realm. But then the Christians, once in power, turn their swords on the Jews and drive them out of town.Now, with the Parabolian sect in complete control, what happens is what usually happens with ruling parties. They begin to split their allegiances. Ideologies, just different enough to cause friction, take root. And Hypatia, now older and with her former students in positions of power (Prefect and Bishop) is seen as causing a rift between the hard-nosed fundamentalists, who see women as essentially a lower form of life and perhaps evil, and the Christians of a more humanistic bent. Urged by those who care for her as well as those who hate her to be baptized and become Christian, Hypatia is unyielding and suffers the fate of those who would rather twist in the wind than bend with it.It's an impressive film. It was shot on Malta and the imagery is convincingly Circum-Mediterranean. CGI adds to the visual impact, for a change, instead of becoming the whole point of the movie. Rachel Weisz handles the principal role well and the supporting players are all up to their tasks. Oscar Isaac, as Orestes the musician, is especially effective in a complex part. As one of Hypatia's young students, he has an argument with his teacher, but a thought of her own suddenly strikes her and she's delighted. Orestes, puzzled, looks around and asks the others, "What -- was I right? Did I win?" It IS a long movie and it does inevitably drag a bit from time to time. And it's a tragedy too. But I admire it for several reasons. One reason is that it's the only movie about the Classical world I can think of, off hand, that values rationality over mysticism. Hypatia isn't interested in power, wealth, celebrity, gods, or appearing on television talk shows. She just wants to know what's going on in the world around her. What a role model she could be for the rest of us.</fullReview>

"Agora" means an opening space for people gathering, I also felt the writer refer it to our modern world. You will also see many events in the movie are happening now in our life. This movies has many layers behind the story. It tells what appear to be common senses is not always the truth, as truth needs hard work to discover it. It is so much easier to accept other people's word as truth rather than to seek it out for yourself. It is so much easier to point finger to those things that they don't understand as devil's work. The sad truth is that, in this world, there are more or equal amount of people are "dumb" as those who are intelligent and the dumb one are tend to use violent to cover their weakness,one of main cause of war. It is sad that this movie did not do well in North America as it should be. It really has a lot of truth in it even the story is merely a written one. There are movies that are just purely entertaining and does nothing to our mind, this one is different, it is beautifully made and lots food for our soul. Go see it, then watch it again.</fullReview>

The they went after the Jews. Having driven out all the other religions, the went after women and children. Does all this sound familiar? These bigots justified their murder and hatred by saying it is what God wants. It was obvious that it was what they wanted, and only used God to justify their hate.

If you can't catch this film on the big screen, at least do yourself the favor of streaming it to a BIG screen entertainment center with surround-sound turned up...Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a few points. 1)Caesar damaged the Library but it was obviously functioning well until Hypatia's death in 415. Scientists like Hero continued to do research, correspondence confirms it was in use throughout the Imperial period. After her death, we hear little of it, though to their credit several Christians tried to save the precious knowledge there. 2)Hypatia's friend the Bishop of Cyrene did not betray her as the movie suggests. It was due to his praise of her brilliance in his letters to others that we have documentation that she was a great scientist. 3) Cyril did use the mob in his struggles with the Roman governor and his own Christian opponents. It's not anti-Christian to be honest about that. The brutal, often murderous in-fighting between Christian sects, often centered around a single figure such as Cyril or Arios was an important crippling factor in the defense of the Empire during the calamities of the fifth century and later in the seventh helped to weaken the surviving Eastern Empire against attack by the new Islamic power. Gibbon's claim that Christianity "softened" the Empire is belied by the violence but there's no doubt Christianity did not provide the fully unifying force Constantine had hoped for.A very fine, well acted movie. At points it does become a bit unfocused and I agree a tighter script would have helped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drama on ancient war between THINKING &amp; RELIGION.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story of fight between Thinking (Philosophy and Mathematics) vs Religion (Christianity) where holy men interprets the Word of GOD for his own gains. It revolves around a young beautiful Greek Philosopher and Mathematician (Hypatia played by Rachel Weisz) and his three students, who also are in deep love with her, in an era of high tensions between Jews, Christians and Pagans.Its 391 ? 400 AD. Hypatia is the head of the Platonist school at Alexandria where she is teaching philosophy and Mathematics. Three of her students, Davus (Max Minghella), Orestes (Oscar Isaac) , Synesius (Rupert Evans) have special feelings towards teacher. Orestes has admitted his feelings publicly which was brutally rejected by her. She don't have any such feelings towards anyone of the three. Her only passion and love is Philosophy.With rise of Christianity in Alexandria, everything changes. Pagans being in power tries to power the Christians down, but was outnumbered. In result of this, the raged Christian mob burns down the great library of Alexandria and years of work with it. Hypatia has to run to save her life along with other pagans. Rage of Christians is not limited only to pagans but also towards Jews.Orestes is Prefect of Alexandria, Synesius is Bishop of Cyrene and Davus is a confused Christian. All three have accepted the Christianity in their own way and are still in love. Orestes still loves her and trusts her with all his matters. Cyril is the new head priest and under him Christians are taking liberties day after day for his own interpretations of word of GOD. With Cyril the new head priest, he has his eyes set on power as Prefect of Alexandria.One day, Cyril, while reading from the holy book accused Hypatia of ungodliness and calls her a witch and asks all present to kneel before God to reconcile themselves with Christ make all nonbelievers embrace it too. This puts all three in awkward position. All men present there kneels but one, Orestes. This outraged the Mob and they throw stones over him. Group of Davus plans to abduct her and teach her a lesson.Orestes and Synesius discusses this with Hypatia and tries to make her compromise who dismisses this and leaves the government protections. Davus tries to find her but his group finds her first. Group ridicules her, strips her naked and decides to skin her alive. Davus intervenes and convinces them not to color their hand in her impure blood and suggests to stone her. While the group finds the stones, he suffocates her with his bare hands.The movie shows us in a brutal way that blood was shed in the NAME OF GOD then as it is now. Nothing has been changed. Few radical people interprets the Holy word of God as they want and lure common innocent people into the web of cunning and lies and uses them to their own gains. The plot has uncanny resemblance to the current state of radical Islam and other sectarian conflicts going on these days in middle east. But it avoids to dwell into other romantic subplots and keeps its focus on the fight between science and religion, men over women.It also shows a true love of a genius women for truth. This in itself is hard to digest by the big egoistic holy people. Wrongly interpreted lies, by these SO CALLED HOLY People, feel threatened and in return they do all in their power to save them. They even stop people from questioning and imposes their OWN thoughts by presenting them as word of God. It was clearly evident in the conversation between Hypatia and Synesius where she tell him that "You don't' question what you believe, You cannot. I must". In reply Synesious tells her that its a Pity. This sums up the whole movie.Rachel Weiz was great in role of Hypatia so as Max Minghella and Oscar Isaac. Sets are amazing and take you back to the ancient Greek world. All in all a great movie. A real treat to watch for all those who like to think with open mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agora</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love ancient history and I love philosophy. So i m suggested to watch this movie by my brother. Agora is the fascinating true story of Hypatia. She lives in the 4th Century AD in the city of Alexandria, Egypt. Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) teaches her students in philosophy, mathematics and astronomy. She is famous in her era. Also Hypatia is a symbol for courage.I hope the film is liked and understood, and that we learn a little bit from its depiction of history. It's established early on that she rejects the love interests of both Davus, her soon to be freed slave and convert to Christianity and Orestes, the pagan nobleman who later becomes the prefect of Alexandria. In a scene based on a true story, she hands Orestes, a handkerchief soaked with blood from her menstrual cycle and makes it clear that she has no interest in future sexual relationships. The focus thus is on Hypatia's internal arc, as she struggles to replace Ptolemy's erroneous geocentric conception of the universe with a heliocentric model. We know basically that she'll come up with the right answer in regards to her astronomical quandaries. Many of the scenes is quite emotional. In the end, I highly recommend it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Historical Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movie plot consisted of Pagans, Jewsat , Christians, and Romans who had converted to Christians. All living in Alexandria, Egypt at 379 AD. The main crux was the beliefs of the Pagans which the Christians felt were centered with the Lady Hypatia whom the believed was a witch because of her teachings. They further felt these beliefs were housed in the library at Alexandria, a seat of great learning but not according to the learning of the Christians. The complaint against the Jews was that they had murdered their Christ and hung Him on the Cross. The Jews countered saying the Christians wouldn't even exist if hadn't been for Jesus because he had been a Jew too. After the Bishop of Alexandria died and a new Bishop appointed the seeds were set for the storming of the library. As they did so I couldn't help think I was witnessing the precursor of Krstal Nacht and Nazi Germany. At least the early stages of the dark ages. As the movie progresses Lady Hypatia continues to teach her theories about the stars and how the Sun is the center of our solar system. She questioned what caused the change in seasons and contually espoused that the earth moved and did not stand still. She was eventually commanded to convert and be baptized a Christian or suffer the consequences. In this case she was stoned and the two men who loved her the Prefect of Alexandria and Davis, both Christians and who had sat in on her seminars in earlier and happier times could not save her. With Lady Hypatia's death her works and teachings were lost. It wasn't until the 18th century that the movement of the stars and the earth around the sun was again discovered and plotted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The DVD of this movie has an interesting extra, where the writers and director explain how the story and movie came about. Intrigued by modern knowledge of astronomy and the universe, they kept working backwards, mentally, until they came to the 4th century AD when a Roman Egyptian mathematician and philosopher named Hypatia lived. The date given is 391, but probably spans 20 to 25 years. The understandings of the time were of Ptolemy who had worked out elaborate models, charts and tables to predict movement of heavenly bodies, with the Earth as the center. Christianity was in full force and accepted Ptolemy's model of the universe, and anyone who questioned it could be accused of heresy.The story is set in Alexandria, Egypt, which by then was a Roman territory. A large and important city, it was home to large populations of Jews, Christians, and Pagans. Most of the time there was an uneasy peace between the various factions, but at other times fighting which led to killings was the norm.Rachel Weisz is a superb choice for the role of Hypatia. Widely believed to be a Pagan, we see her teaching, and in trying to make sense of everything begins to wonder if perhaps the Sun is the center of our solar system, with the Earth and other bodies in orbits around it. This pattern of thought, combined with other factors later, begin to turn the Jews and Christians against her.Crunch time came when Hypatia was required to declare herself Christian, and kneel before the cross. Failing to do so, she eventually was considered a witch and killed. Historical writings indicate she was dragged, stripped, and her body parts burned.Difficult time, good movie. The "Agora" was the Greek name for the common area in a city where people would meet, hear proclamations, and other sorts of things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a movie on Hypatia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This average good movie holds something important. Now, why average good? Compare it to the 400 Blows, Apu Trilogy, Tokyo story and such others, there is a margin for best upto AgoraBut wondering what makes it special, I was displayed with two important aspects. The life of a Scientific Brain and the religious turmoil. If one thinks over it, the director made an absolute blend of Hypatia and people. Whereas one feels astound on her realization of the case of a perfect figure, the balanced figure circle itself being a special case of ellipse which can be realised through a cone as a conic section, at the same time we are visualised over how all kind of religious folks corrupt and misuse the simple and guiding principles. It doesn't take a moment or the beautiful idea to be moulded in the cruel and hampering thought just for personal ego satisfaction. One can justify anything everything and there will always be statements that will shut our mouth of logic for the logicality of those statements.Intentionally or unintentionally, the blend got great and significant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie depicts 4th century Alexendria at a time when its streets were crowded with Greek philosophers, Ptolemaic Egyptians, Roman soldiers, Jews and early Christians. We focus on the library, although there was so much more to this important city at this time.The film succeeds spectacularly in bringing this to life. This alone makes the movie worth watching.But even more than that, the movie tells a story based on a series of events involving group of historical figures: Theon, Hypatia, Orestes, St Cyril of Alexandria and others. Hypatia is the interesting one here, passionately and credibly played by Rachel Weisz. The movie is not quite historically accurate, but it is a hell of a good story based loosely on historical events.But wait, even more than that, the film has religious fundamentalism and intolerance as its main theme. I guess you could say it takes the side of science over religion, freedom over faith, reason over madness. It shows the exact moment we entered the Dark Ages.In my second viewing, I came to appreciate Oscar Isaac's performance even more. He is a wonderful actor. The really powerful character here is Davus. I'm not sure this fascinating, complex character was properly fleshed out in the script, but it was a tremendous performance by Max Minghella.I absolutely loved this intelligent, moving and important movie. I wish all movies were like this. I didn't want the movie to end. They should use it as the basis for a mini-series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very ambitious work undone by a few key missteps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recounting the events that led to the destruction of the Great Library of Alexandria, this epic Spanish drama tells of the Christian-Pagan tensions in 4th century Roman Egypt, specifically focusing in on the slave of female philosopher &amp; scholar Hypatia (Rachel Weisz), and how he witnesses her struggles to preserve the ancient knowledge against the rising Christian extremism.Ambitious but ultimately out of steam before the end, 'Agora' is rather lavishly mounted, but its hefty script doesn't quite pack the punch it ought to. It makes the classic mistake of a lot of historical/biographical films; it tries to cover so much ground and squeeze in as many historical events and personages as possible, and so whose story this is, and what even the main themes are, becomes really muddled. You have Hypatia's own experiments concerning astronomy, her own battles for preservation, the social tensions in Egypt, the religious tensions, Hypatia's slave and his quest for knowledge, the battle over the Library, the declining power of Rome, the rise of Christianity, it's just too much to cover in a little over two hours. Cutting out a lot of the side characters, most of whom are one note 'PRAISE DAH LOWD' archetypes, and centre the story more around Hypatia and her slave's quest, and the film would've been the better for it.A pity it's so scattershot and rambly, as there are quite a few good things, and it is a very superb production for European cinema. The sets and locations that recreate Roman Egypt look amazing and you really see and feel their size and just how populated they are, as well as the historical crossroads Alexandria is at. The cast is well rounded, with Weisz in top form as both a charismatic yet passionate and fiery Hypatia, joined by the likes of Oscar Issac, Max Minghella, Sami Samir, Michael Lonsdale and Rupert Evans, who all do fine jobs, even if their material is again, more limited. We even have a score from Italy's new cinematic go-to Dario Marrinelli, which takes a strongly religious/choral cue and is often sombre, reflecting the state of affairs in the story. Think of the more downbeat, intimate tracks of say 'Gladiator', as an entire film score.But it's a bloated script that lets all of this down. I cannot deny I respect director/co-writer Alejandro Amenabar for really pushing larger scale Euro film making, but he just forget to really have a powerful tale to bring it all together. Well mounted, but never truly enthralling. Shame really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dramatization of History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>May contain spoilersThe film Agora is a dramatization of a historical event, the destruction of the Serepaeum, the "library of Alexandria." Read that again: a dramatization of a historical event.It is no understatement to say that the loss of the knowledge in this greatest library and center of learning in the ancient world had catastrophic consequences. That this film has generated a lot of controversy is not surprising. Much of the negative press is based on some factual errors in the film. It seems to be conveniently forgotten that this is a drama, not a historical documentary. Agora actually deserves credit for how much it gets right. It convincingly recreates the era and the city of Alexandria during a turbulent time when several factions vied for power in the city, pagans, Jews and Christians. Although it may appear that the Christians come off looking the worst of the bunch, there are no angels here. One of the pagan leaders incites a massacre of Christians which backfires when they discover there are far more Christians in the city than them. The Jews lure some Christians into an ambush under the pretense of a fire which the well meaning Christians respond to with water buckets. And the Christians defile holy places of both rival groups. The film makes it quite clear however, that the Christian zealot Cyril (Samir) is driven more by desire for power than by faith and is merely using his followers for political ends. The movie is less an "attack" on Christianity than a warning about the dangers of fundamentalism of any stripe (even, dare I say, atheism), and of blindly following charismatic leaders.The central character is the famous pagan mathematician and astronomer Hypatia (Weisz). A story of a love triangle between her and the noble born Orestes (Isaac), a student of hers, and her personal slave Davus (Minghella) has been added more as a device to tell the larger story than as the main plot of the film. Hypatia has dedicated herself to philosophy, and has no care for the earthly pleasures of this world. The film suggests that she was virginal; that she was widely regarded as a symbol of virtue is chronicled in several contemporary written accounts. Although a love triangle, it is unrequited love on both sides. This is the vehicle used to bring us into this time and place, but the real story is the conflict between superstition and fear versus knowledge and open inquiry. In Hypatia's time, mathematics was essentially geometry, and we see this regularly as she uses geometrical methods to solve problems. The film expects at least some familiarity with the science and mathematics that is discussed in it, as we see Hypatia struggle to find a way to reconcile observations of the heavenly bodies (the "wanderers") with competing theories, the Ptolemaic system and a heliocentric system. Touches like these added to my enjoyment of the film. The CGI is excellent and rarely intrudes, and brings this ancient city to life. Weisz does a fine job portraying Hypatia, dedicated to her philosophy and pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. She certainly looks the part with her features, her dark curly hair, and proud bearing. The film's convincing recreation of the time and place is a large part of the appeal this film had for me, but the drama and action are also good and the visuals are often well above average. It is an enjoyable and thought provoking movie if one goes into it with an open mind. It almost begs you to ask yourself: how might history have been different if this knowledge had not been lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A most excellent film, giving it 5 stars plus. Rachel Weisz is luminous as the heroine of the movie as Hypatia. All of the other actors were equally outstanding. For me, a glimpse of the Alexandria of old was exquisitely brought to life. The history which this movie encompassed is bittersweet led by persons fueled by blind adherence to religious and fundamental beliefs which curtailed independent thought and inquiry, thrusting mankind into the Dark Ages until the Rennaisance. I've seen this movie more than 3-4 times now, and it still continues to inspire deep respect for those "thinkers" of classical antiquity. My hat's off to Alejandro Aménabar for bringing us this truthful chapter so that, as Carl Sagan so aptly put it, "we may NOT let it happen again."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an outstanding historical epic which captures all the pain, drama, and spectacle of the last years of the Roman Empire.In the early 5th century AD, a relatively new religion, Christianity, was sweeping the Empire. This film reveals many of those Christians to be essentially Islamic jihadis. The secular government of one of the great cities of the ancient world, Alexandia, must cope with this new wave of radicalism.This film is visually spectacular. Excellent -and quite imaginative- work was done on the design. The actors carry their roles with great confidence, especially Orestes. I'm so glad this great man from history is receiving the credit he deserves.By the way, it's entirely possible that ancient astronomers were as advanced as Hypatia. The ancient world was more advanced than we are today, in some respects.Watch this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow but Interesting Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rachel Weisz is Hypatia, a fourth century mathematician, philosopher and scientist, who was years ahead of her time when Christians and pagans were battling for control. When the Christians destroy a temple and the contents of the vast library scrolls, Hypatia tries in vain to save anything she can. Years later, Hypatia continues to study the moon and the stars, and is ridiculed for her beliefs, much like Galileo many years later. It reaches the point of mob rule, as she is branded a witch after being caught in the political crossfire of the day and when offered salvation by accepting Christianity, she refuses, and I 'll just say that we don't get a happy ending. Religious intolerance hasn't changed, and Agora delivers an important message about freedom and intellectual curiosity without interference from ignorant, narrow minded hypocrites. The scenery is awesome, although at over two hours, it could have been edited down a bit, but overall it's a good epic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If art seeks excite and provoke feelings, "Agora" succeeds in that regard. As many have already seen, it is true that the film is pretty close to many current conflicts, intolerance and religion in conflict with freedom of thought and preventing the evolution of science. But reflecting the historical truths and film are used to reflect on not using religion as a way to belittle others for thinking differently. The film provokes a sense of irrevocable disaster because it is the end of a brilliant era and the beginning of a sad period in freedom and human progress. But I think it gets you to think and that's what counts. It is a splendid detail reconstruct much of the city with real sets, it is true that it is more credible because when ever digital note and can not help the image of the actor on the blue screen. In short: great success in recovering the important figure of Hypatia, unjustly forgotten, strong characters and good script, a superb actor and post a good time to reflect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful historic drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled across this on TV one night, I had never even heard of this film before and at the beginning i thought it would be dull but I was soon hooked.This film is about two things the rise of Christianity in the roman empire and early developments in astronomy. ( well early compared to the where we are now, most believe the earth is the centre of the universe)Rachel Weiss is beautiful as the very ahead of her time Hepatia an astronomer, mathematician and philosopher. She is dogged in her attempts to better understand the universe in particular the earths trajectory around the sun. At the same time attempting to remain neutral to cultural turmoil around her.At the beginning of the film Christianity is very much in the minority and they are persecuted by the Romans. Which is the common portrayal of Christians at this time in film. By the end of the film however they are the persecutors and are represented as very violent defenders of the faith who will not abide anything but full submission to the new God.As you probably know early Christians ( and modern?) were not to keen on women with influence, so combined with Hepatias attempt at neutrality, being a leader of education and a few other issues, well I would give exact details but it's not good by the end.I didn't know anything about the history of Hipatia but I was engrossed in this film and devastated at the end. There is also a senator ( I think a senator) and a hot former slave who are in love with her. she is committed to neither for separate reasons but the ultimate conclusion of both sagas is very moving and sad.Perhaps one of the only downfalls is the sets and cg, it looks quite amateurish sometimes like a down market version of Spartacus but really I hardly noticed this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Epic Drama that Gets Lost Along the Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AGORA is a strange film one that attempts to explore the history of changing philosophies in Egypt during Roman occupation while attempting to present a biography of the great Egyptian astronomer Hypatia, probably one of the first great women of science. It succeeds on spectacle but stumbles a bit on chronology and script. Written by Mateo Gil and Writer/Director Chilean born Alejandro Amenábar (honored for 'the Sea Inside' with Javier Bardem, 'The Others', 'Open Your Eyes', etc), and populated with a handsome and smart cast, the film succeed on many levels and frustrates on others. Set in Alexandria, Egypt in the year 391AD, Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) teaches her students in philosophy, mathematics and astronomy: her rapt students include Orestes (Oscar David), Theon (Rupert Evans) and Hypatia's loyal and adoring slave Davus (Max Minghella). Alexandria is in the throes of upheaval as the ancient culture becomes challenged by Christians who gradually gain influence and power in the city, eventually leading to hostilities with the Jews and with women who are not Christians. By the end of the film Hypatia has remained a scientist and philosopher, concerned about the movement of the planets and the need for unifying all men in a universal brotherhood and is uninfluenced by the current religions and is condemned to being stoned to death, but an act of real love prevents the agony of the end of Hypatia: her benevolent freeing of her slave, the loving Davus, provides an ending that is bearable. The sets and costumes are dramatically beautiful and the moments when the film concentrates on individual character development instead of focusing on fights and brawls it is quite successful. The long film simply sinks under its own weight despite the radiant Rachel Weisz' performance as the brilliant and enlightened philosopher and astronomer. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this film - very well crafted, beautifully shot, and the story acted out as best as could be possible for this type of genre'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to even start? The story of Hypatia is fascinating in of itself, a realm of history not commonly known to the general public until this film brought her unique story, and the life and times of the cultural conflicts of the time, artifacts of which are witnessed to this very day.The sacking and destruction of the Library of Alexandria, the largest repository of all forms of literature to have existed in the ancient world, is only a piece of this intricately detailed examination into the cultures and theological conflicts of the time.Hypatia was a fantastically gifted and intelligent woman, determined to explore concepts of astronomy, mathematics, and the great philosophical questions of her time (many of which are pondered and probed to this very day).The concept of such an intellectually powerful and independent woman did not bode well with certain religious "leaders" of who were determined to not let such examples encourage and inspire other such women of the time, and for centuries onward.I'm not an atheist by typical definition, but more of the agnostic view of the human condition and the spiritual complexities woven into such. This film centers around the life and eventual fate of Hypatia (not revealing any spoilers here), but this basic storyline really serves as a platform for presenting the controversies, intrigues, and self serving endeavors of the various competing religious "authorities" seeking political power, under the somewhat tenuous control of the then declining vestiges of the Roman Empire.The film takes you through the dividing of the eastern and remaining remnants of the western Roman empires, and the ambitious enterprises of the new religious order established around Christianity in its formative years as created by the emperor Constantine and the subsequent aftermath of this emergent theocratic governance.The cinema photography is absolutely splendid, including the scenes of Earth from space during critical moments in this political / cultural upheaval and transition in the making.Rachel Weisz delivers an absolutely perfect rendering of her Hypatia character in this work, but the casting director hit the mark with all of the supporting actors . . . I don't think a better treatment of this film could be imagined.It may not be for everyone, but for anyone with even a casual interest in this type of genre' in the artform of filmcraft, I don't think anyone will be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected and unique epic, for a change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out of the many movies I saw from 2009, this one seriously escaped my attention - I only found it through a fluke on Netflix. That being said, this film is also considerably better than many films I've seen recently, including the big-tickets ones. The acting overall is pretty on-point for an epic drama with above-average character development, and the way the film deals with the transition and conflict of religion is quite interesting. Watching Hypatia's (Weisz) fate unfold is affecting, but so are the lives of the men around her, though you can't help but feel sadness as you watch the world around her become ever more hostile towards learning, research, and female intelligence, or female anything, for that matter. I kept expecting Weisz to fall into the inevitable lure of sex that most female roles give in to, but she portrays a different kind of woman that we don't see very often; the sort of academic philosopher-nun (without religion) whose prime occupation in life is to try to figure out the world just a tiny bit more.An appealing glimpse of how different characters make sense the of changing world around them. Watch this movie for the history, perhaps not in the most accurate sense, but for the overall sensation and feel of the 4th-century events portrayed in the film. Also to get a pretty cool imagination of what the library of Alexandria might have looked like. Overall an interesting exploration of the clash between academics, philosophy, personal relations, and dictates of religion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agora is the story of Hypatia of Alexandria and the dichotomy between science and politics; philosophy and religion; inquiry and obedience; reason and passion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hypatia of Alexandria was the last librarian of the Library of Alexandria, a scientist (Astronomy) and philosopher. As an astronomer she was the first to determine that Earth is part of a solar system of planets revolving around the sun in elliptical orbits (1200 years before Johannes Kepler was credited with this discovery). As a philosopher she used logic to illustrate the similarities within diversity that unite all humans. Her methods of intellectual progress were based on Inquiry, Reason and Fearlessness.The story is set within the Roman empire as social order collapses after a period of relatively peaceful co-existence between Jews and Pagans with the growing masses of early Christians. Fanatical Christian religious leaders plot to topple the government and grab political control using the methods of assassination, unquestioning obedience, and the incitement of hatred and fear between the citizens of Alexandria. The creative artistry of this film is revealed in its portrayal of the dichotomy of the human condition as an elliptical orbit around two poles - not unlike the Earth's that at times is close to the sun and at others distant. Hypatia struggles toward illumination of the mysteries of planetary orbits, gravity and a natural universal order; while fanatical Christians struggle to corrupt government and destroy civilization in order to impose a man-made repressive order. Caught up in this milieu are the passions of a slave and a royal, each who would have Hypatia, who is a rock of intellectual reason against which baser passions are smashed. Agora is one of the rare depictions in Western Cinema of the Christian religion in its most ignorant and terrifying ability to replace light and reason with shadow and servility.</fullReview>

Its a fantastic telling of Hypatia known nowadays for her intelligence far greater than all the men of her times, with incredible accomplishments in mathematics, science, philosophy. All she wanted was to unravel the mysteries of where we earth the centre of the universe? was the sun? what holds us to earth? is the earth moving? The Christians unwilling to accept anyone believing any faith but their own begin to slaughter people in the streets, when they are done with the Pagans they move onto the Jews, then they turn to those who have no faith.i was so surprised to find out this isn't a film about agoraphobia as i had assumed from the title but about 4AD and the beginnings of the killings by the Christians of the other faiths. to discover Rachel Weiss was also a shock and a pleasure, she is an incredible actress, i have never actually seen her in a bad part, she first caught my attention in the mummy and by the mummy 2 i was mesmerised by this vivacious creature (it was the amazing fighting scenes for me, as a woman i love nothing more than a woman who kicks ass, who has a brain and looks good doing it) I would recommend this film to anyone with a brain!! if you just love action you can enjoy the fighting scenes but a brain would help for the philosophy. I love shows such as Spartacus, The Tudors, and films like Elizabeth, Troy, Gladiator. I'm not saying they are all historically accurate but they are great storytelling, great action, and actually make me want to go online and research the people in them just as this film has.please watch this film!!! and enjoy it.</fullReview>

He expect to say everything. And that it is one of errors. The mixture of science and political combat, the love story and the gray figures of Chistianity, the page of encyclopedia and the game with historical facts, the drama and testimony are parts of a very strange veil. And, in fact, only beginning. "Agora" is , for many, blasphemy. For others, first contact with Hipatia's name. Or a story about our time in which intolerance against old values is present at every step. For me, it is only invitation to define yourself. Not a show but a necessary question. About the cycles of history and the price to be cool, about sacrifices and expectations, about refuges in the empire of globalization. A strange film about a lost age of humanity. About one December 21, 2012. And the force to be more than a shadow.</fullReview>

Her performance is incredible; she carries the movie, completely dominates the story and brings to life a woman whose bravery is unmatched. The supporting cast is excellent too, and together succeed in telling a story that is relevant to today's audience. As this movie shows, when religion gets mixed with politics the results are invariably catastrophic. But the movie offers more than just a glimpse into the past. It's about people caught up in a time of rapid social change and how outside forces can shape personal relationships. Hypatia is a symbol of courage and the price that one may have to pay in defense of personal integrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agora</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Agora by chance on Netflix the other night, and I expected something very different than what I saw. I thought it would be a movie that was like other recent sandal and sword shows and movies, meaning it would offer a shallow story with one-dimensional characters that blathered lame one-liners and wreaked of testosterone. Very quickly I realized that I was completely wrong. The beginning of Agora sets you up in the beautiful city of Alexandria, a city still occupied by the dwindling Roman Empire, and actually thriving and boasting wonderful architectural achievements. The Library of Alexandria is where the heart of the story lies, and where the philosopher Lady Hypatia teaches her very devoted group of "future leaders". Although it's well known that women were thought of as second class during this time period, the movie does a brilliant job of not portraying Hypatia that way, and I think they're very right for doing so. She was so well respected by the people around her that her gender was never a problem, for a time at least. The story is about Hypatia's philosophies, her students, and the Christian/Pagan/Jewish struggle. But, it's also a very touching and heart wrenching film, filled with much unrequited love, difficult choices, moments of discovery (in science and relationships), and leaves viewers feeling that so many things went unfair and how things "should have been". The ending is true to the records, but only more devastating as you watch the characters you love fall into devious conspirators.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Did This Movie Get Buried?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agora had a seventy-three million dollar budget, had a respected director, and starred an Academy Award winning actress. How did it end up with a desultory release in the United States?Even if one allows for its high brow subject matter, the answer seems to be its critical attitude toward Christianity. Thanks to the influence of evangelical Christians, the entertainment industry shies away from any critique of religion more serious than the Da Vinci Code or comedies such as Borat. This is unfortunate, as it denied audiences access to an excellent film.The film deserves applause for a willingness to not talk down to its audience, as it engages with philosophical issues and the scientific work Hypatia did. Furthermore, it is not a polemic so much as a call for tolerance. Although some critics have seen this film as a condemnation of Christianity, it is actually an attack on fundamentalism in general. For example, in several scenes the pagans are shown to be just as fanatical as the Christians, particularly in respect to attacks on religious images. Indeed, the scene where Christians attack pagan statues can be seen as a commentary on attacks on religious images by Muslim groups.The film itself also benefits from some good action scenes and an ability to create suspense even though the ending is not in doubt. Rachel Weisz gives a good performance as Hypatia, while Sami Samir does well as the film's main antagonist, St. Cyril of Alexandria.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amenábar delivers on his most ambitious movie so far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Synesius, you don't question what you believe. You cannot. I must."Agora is a very interesting movie set at end of the fourth century A.D. in Alexandria, when the Roman Empire was facing decline and the religious conflict between the pagan worshipers of various gods, Jews, and the early Christian church was reaching a violent high point. One of the most interesting periods in history, and a great topic for a movie.&nbsp;Kudos first and foremost for the fact that this movie does its best to avoid having an agenda and casting one side or the other as "evil". Complex situations like these are rarely as simple as black and white, and Agora does a great job of showing that.The crux of the story revolves around a slave named Davus and his relationship with his mistress, a brilliant philosopher (appealing to me, as I was a philosophy major) and teacher named Hypatia (Rachel Weisz), who actually lived during these events. As the city devolves into conflict-fueled chaos around them, Davus must come to terms with both the knowledge Hypatia has taught him, his desire for her, and his interest in the growing Christian faith. At the same time, the great Alexandrian library is being threatened with destruction by those who wish to eradicate the writings held within. It's all quite fascinating to watch. Think Gladiator meets your freshman-level philosophy and astronomy classes.If your looking for a historical drama that's entertaining as well as gives you a glimpse at the tumultuous happenings of the world at that time, Agora is a good fit. Weisz is great, the story never lulls or loses the audiences interest, the recreated city of Alexandria is marvelous, and there's a refreshing attempt at objectivity to it all. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not subtle and not perfect, but very interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few works of fiction that deal with the brief and very interesting period in which the Greco Roman classical world was rapidly and sometimes violently replaced by Christianity: if you ask me quickly I can recall only some of the poems of Constantin Cavafy. Agora, directed by the Spanish Chilean director Alejandro Amenabar (who also co-wrote it) tells the real life story of the Alexandrian philosopher Hypatia, one of the last platonic philosophers, who was brutally murdered in 415 at the hand of Christian monks followers of bishop (later Saint) Cyril. Her story has always been almost too neat a metaphor of freedom and scientific inquiry being crushed by obscurantist theology, and as such it has been espoused by writers critical of religion (the first time I heard about Hypatia was when I watch Carl Sagan's Cosmos when I was 12 years old and reportedly director Alejandro Amenabar also first heard about her there). Agora is certainly not subtle, but at least it does not underestimate its audience and is not afraid of being about ideas, refusing to water them down. I read negative comments by some classicists about the movie, and most of their criticisms are really nit picking (like, Roman soldiers are using uniforms of the 1st century instead of the fifth). Other common criticism is in the movie's imagining Hypatia as a precursor of the Keplerian system of planetary movement, but given that a lot of the science and philosophy of this period was lost with the burning of the library of Alexandria, and that geometry and astronomy of that era was quite advanced for the time, this scene doesn't seem such a terrible slip. If you read any biography of Hypatia, it is clear that the movie got the big details about her life (and the ideas she was espousing) right. The acting is generally good: Rachel Weisz is good as the philosopher, but some of the supporting players like Oscar Isaac as Orestes (the prefect of Egypt and a former student and admirer of her that try to protect her) and Sami Samir as Cyril particularly excel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agora is a fascinating and very ambitious movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though it is generally enough with a good screenplay, good direction and good performances to leave me satisfied with a movie, it is indubitable that the richest cinematographic experiences are those ones which are based on ideas...their discussion, their expression and even their denounce.A good story can keep us entertained for a couple of hours; but an idea can change our lives, even if it is transmitted by a medium which is rarely famous for its intelligence (I am talking about modern cinema, of course).The film Agora may not go as far away as that, but it definitely has enough ambition to present a simple truth by a complex way, because of the historical context where it sets it as well as for the multitude of perspectives it uses in order to examine it.The previous filmography from director Alejandro Amenábar includes two excellent movies (The Others and Tesis), but I think that Agora is his best film so far, mainly because of the passion he brought to this film.I also have to mention the extraordinary manufacture from this movie, from Xavi Giménez's beautiful cinematography to the perfect combination of vast real settings with digital extensions which bring the city of Alexandria to life.However, that does not mean that Agora is precisely faithful to the historical reality...it simply proposes a theory about the destiny of the Alexandria Library, as well as an interesting conjecture about the methods and scientific discoveries from the fascinating main character.I think that the "dramatic license" from co-screenwriters Amenábar and Mateo Gil is perfectly acceptable, because I do not go to the cinema to receive a History lesson.I would also like to make a mention to the message this movie leaves, which is also absolutely interesting.Some people may take those ideas as a historical analogy about the current religious conflicts around the world.However, I think that the message goes beyond of bringing us another lesson about the danger of religion when it is connected to the government.I think that the main message from Agora is that religion is only the favorite excuse of some people to impose their will on other people, and justify any different point of view as "malignant".Besides, Agora's epic narrative is based on an intimate story full of intense emotions.And that leads me to the brilliant performances from Rachel Weisz, Max Minghella, Oscar Isaac and Sami Samir; they all express even the most complex emotions with the most subtle expressions and looks.The only fail I found in Agora is that some details from the screenplay feel a little bit forced and simplistic.However, that does not avoid me from very enthusiastically recommending this excellent movie, which besides of keeping me very entertained, also left me thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plurality of centers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have a film about center, meaning, different pathways to truth. So let's find our own.The film caused an uproar about its historical accuracy. The obvious thing to say is that Christians did not burn the Library and I suspect more scholarly knowledge than mine will turn up inaccuracies at every step. It should be also noted that the film is careful to point that the Library being destroyed is not the world famous monument, but a smaller one at the Serapeum that survived the first, though the outcome is the same: the loss of classical knowledge.It seems clear however that the dramatization is used to sketch a broader shift of world from antiquity to the middle ages, and this shift was no less violent and arbitrary across the Eastern Empire than what is essentially shown in the film. If we can accept that the specific events are of course fictional, all films are, yet the broader sketch captures a model that is not far from recorded truth we are a step closer to what this is.In its dramatic fabric the film is for the most part ordinary Gladiator- fare. Sorrow and sacrifice, bonds snapped by violent pulls. But if we pull further back?What attracts me here is the filmmaker's attempt to find a more cosmic view. The film opens with a majestic shot of Earth rolling in space and we swoop below to find the petty human world where people despair about love and debate god. We have several aerial shots of the destruction where tiny particle-like figures of rioters flush through the stark geometric order. The film is all about finding pattern in human madness. Primitive religion against primitive science, different paths to pinpoint a universal center. Here we need to say something clearly. The film promulgates a distinction between a science of pure reason and a more or less blind religious impulse. It aims to show a fanatical, irrational religion at work, this of course has been a reality, still is. It does give a wonderful impression of the appeal of early Christianity as a communist revolution of the poor and downtrodden against the smugly powerful, both vital and senseless, and the process of its turning into another hierarchy.This common distinction between science and religion however obscures an interconnected truth. That both, before petering out in institutionalism and scholastic debate, are driven by a profound cosmic feeling to describe the human experience. And although the observations differ, both have to construct their center.This was the great concern behind attempts to model the solar system up until and including Newton, just where to place the center and the metaphysical implication this carried about life. Both Kepler and Newton were deeply religious, the heavenly mechanics they uncovered didn't banish god, merely pushed him at a greater distance. There was great joy that precise and knowable mathematics resided in the mind of god, but the laws were still god's. Newton spent inordinate time trying to calculate absurd things like the exact area covered by the Biblical heaven.What this all means is that science turns up facts, reason finds symmetries and coherence, but it always falls on us to construct a framework of understanding that, hopefully, jives with the way things are in a fundamental way. In terms of the film (and every film), it means you have to find your center, if any, and decide on the value. Here for me it's not the specific history, forged or not. It's not the dramatic arch. It's that cosmic view of a broader human journey through the ages caught between the profound awe of looking up at the sky and the horror of how controvertible our concepts can be at the hands of people. It's not a matter of science against religion, science can be as fanatic about its findings and as obstinate to change. It's a matter of clarity against ignorance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rather enjoyed watching this film. Agora is filled with beautiful visuals, superb acting, and just enough drama to guide the characters in a transition a new world. In fact I view Agora not as a movie to portray historical facts, but instead to showcase the loss of a way of life that occurred in the tumultuous final years of the roman empire. While some of the acting is only so-so, Rachel Weisz does an amazing job as the philosopher Hypatia, which in the end makes up for the faults of the other actors. My biggest criticism is the lack of development of the relationship between Davis and Hypatia. Davis is supposed to be desperately in love with her, yet only appears mildly interested at best. If you are looking for a true, cold-hard-facts, historical movie, then this is not the movie for you, but I would still highly recommend Agora to any lover of historical dramas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave, if not entirely successful attempt to make a period epic about ideas and intelligence.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the 4th century A.D. in Alexandria, "Agora" follows the fall of the Pagans as the newly empowered and growing Christians took over. On a political and historical level the film works well, with interesting swipes at the destructive power of religious fanaticism (Pagans, Jews and Christians all have some very bad moments here), and obvious parallels to today, when extremists of various faiths can still be seen to be taking making some of the same kind of violent attacks on those they see as wrong or other, as well as dis-empowering women, denying science and distorting scriptures to justify violence or oppression. On a human level the film is a bit more rocky. The story centers on Hypatia, a female teacher, philosopher and scientist who, at least at the start of the film, is given the same level of respect as a great male thinker - something that seems very rare in the world of the film. She is outspoken in preaching brotherhood, and always unbowed in her pursuit of knowledge. Rachel Weisz does good work in the role, but I wish the film hadn't made her so glamorous in look and feel, which feels like a movie conceit, a bit at odds with the character. More important, the movie feels slowed and weighed down by the stories of the various men trying to romance Hypatia, in spite of her seeming indifference to romantic entanglements and her almost monk like devotion to knowledge. It's not that these sub- plots are bad, they're just much less interesting and more pro forma than the far less familiar historical, scientific and social material and story lines that surround them. Amenebar is without question one of our most talented directors, so when he makes a film that doesn't reach the heights of "The Sea Inside" or "The Others" or "Open Your Eyes" in can't help but feel a little disappointing. But that doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not normally write film reviews. I am a lover of film and a teacher of the relations of art and science. I find this film to be remarkable.As a film I find that it has flaws in aspects of its production that are relatively minor. For example, the written titles that introduce sections of the film should be read by a narrator as they are too important, hard to read (by contrast) and fleeting as they stand. Directorially, the characters of Hypatia, her father, her suiter, and her slave (who truly loves her) are too indistinguishable on first viewing. The ultimate tragedy of Hypatia's torture and death are also fleeting moments of history that cannot compare with the tragedy of the destruction of the library of Alexandria. The film depicts this, but does not make its meaning clear.Hypatia's experiments and conjecture of the elliptical paths of the earth around the sun receives full emphasis, as it should. That is what makes this film important in the Western world. It is but a part of what we think was lost in the destruction of that library of Alexandria. The lack of the destruction could have advanced humanity by a millennium or so. I wish the film had made this clear, given its opportunity.This is a beautiful film, and Rachel Weisz portrays the beauty and wisdom of Hypatia with all the grace that a modern woman could. As it stands, the film should be retitled Hypatia. As such it would draw more people in to what it is about. Not everyone could love such a woman, but drawing them to love her, would draw them to love what was lost in Alexandria those millennia ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think she (Rachel Weisz) was the only female in the entire movie but I may be wrong, her acting was exceptional in this film, maybe even more so than for the one she won her Oscar for. The film was presented from a very biased perspective which I'm pretty sure might have single-handedly been the reason for it's lack of showing at the box-office (as far as I know this went straight to DVD) and award functions. Even though Christians were made to look the worst, no religion was portrayed in an exemplary light. Even the pagans had their faults though it seemed like the director's single intention was to trigger sympathy for them from the audience. For a less confusing concept, there is a similar film that stars Natalie Portman in a similar role as Weisz's, Javier Bardiem was also in (he played a priest) I can't remember the title right now but you can wiki Portman's resume to find out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is part intellectual tale (the astronomy) and part historical saga about religious conflict in Egypt around 400AD - quite relevant in 2011! Those looking for an ancient Egypt Mummy Returns type of adventure won't find it here. Instead it is a fascinating look into the turbulent times of the decline of the Roman Empire in Egypt. The tragedy isn't depressing but illuminating. It's sad to see how religious strife and fanaticism that existed then still exist today.The sets recreating Alexandria are good - could hardly tell it wasn't filmed in Egypt.A couple of faults - it's a bit hard to tell who is fighting who because their costumes are confusing. Another thing the story is a bit serious overall - it's not depressing just needed a bit of balance - a few lighter moments.Rachel Weisz looks quite good in the part she does have an Eastern Mediterranean look like she came from one of those Orientalist paintings of Egypt. Max Minghella is smallish but he is supposed to be a slave. His face has the right look for the area despite the fact he's not Middle Eastern. Supporting cast are quite well cast and quite convincing.Some critics found the movie anti early Christian but they miss the point - it's more a general message against fanaticism and the use of religion as a weapon of persecution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Distant Echo of Hypatia's Screams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT! I find it particularly disturbing that the unjust demise of Hypatia at the hands of an angry mob of Christians took place during Lent of 415 A.D.! As to the ungodly scoundrels who perpetrated this horrific crime against a defenseless woman in true cowardly fashion and who by their very actions rejected the timeless teachings of Jesus (especially that part about loving others), couldn't they at least have given up torture and murder during Lent the way later generations of their Lent-observing progeny give up candy and cake? And to anyone who wants a crash course on the differences between the teachings OF Jesus and the teachings ABOUT Jesus, there is always the distant echo of Hypatia's screams to cut through the clouds of chaos as just one of many examples that emerges through the thread of time and the needle of space to remind us how differently Jesus would have reacted to Hypatia and the angry mob compared to the worst of what can happen when the name of Jesus becomes merely an outside thing worn like a fancy logo on a uniform for a local sports team.Whether based on the 77 Urantia Papers devoted exclusively to the unabridged version of Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Jesus or the Bible's Gospel accounts, the Jesus I know would have undoubtedly rescued Hypatia from this dire situation had He been incarnated on the temporal stage of tragedy depicted in this film where all tangible traces of her slaughtered innocence slowly slipped away from her mutilated femininity with the final few breaths that passed across her fading lips into the winter darkness of a silent abyss. How quickly Hypatia would have embraced Jesus and become a true believer had His facial expression of unconditional love been the last image she saw at the very end of her mortal journey.If the eyes are the windows to the Soul, then just imagine how Light from Paradise reflected through the eyes of Jesus could have reduced that crime scene to a tiny speck of cosmic dust.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bigotry against open-mindedness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And intolerance against freedom of thought, ignorance against learning, love against hatred. In the end of 4th century AD Alexandria was a great center of learning under the direction of the Library led by Hypatia a brilliant woman astronomer and philosopher who taught there a number of disciples of whom two fell in love with her. But a threat was coming nearer, embodied by the Christian community whose power was increasing everyday causing violent religious conflicts with the polytheist heathen first and with Jews later on. We come here to know how a faith of love, mercy and peace, transformed itself in a violent and intolerant movement of bigots and ignorants intending to destroy and kill everything and everyone which or who could smell of culture, science or philosophy. In Alexandria they were led by Cyril a violent intolerant man (can you imagine that later on he was canonized as a Saint by the Church!). Their main object of destruction was of course the Library and its leader who courageously refused to be baptized and to resign herself to the circumstances and the new increasingly dominant political power. She ends up by being arrested, beaten and killed as a so-called witch and prostitute though maybe the way she died in the end may not have been historically quite true and more of a concession to a sentimental attitude of one of those her former disciples who loved her (a love not corresponded as such however). All this is shown in the movie in images and scenes full of emotion in a realistic reconstitution of that epoch in terms of scenery, characters and attire. There are particularly beautiful and meaningful angles of vision and filming. I recall for instance those scenes filmed from very high above where the mob of Christians is moving around wildly down and look like small cockroaches on a surface. The plot doesn't despise entirely the sentimental element of the behaviour of the two Hypatia suitors (though not corresponded as such) and whose conversion to the Christian faith complicates things a lot and generate terrible inner psychological conflicts for them. One of them, Orestes, becomes the Roman prefect in a time where the Empire is declining. He tries to save her but her intransigent attitude on the one hand, and his loss of power on the other turn his efforts to be powerless. One more important detail to remember: at the time Hypatia is trying to solve the problem of structure of the solar system: which one is the center of it, the sun or the earth. She is inclined to the former answer following Aristarchus (the first ancient astronomer that sustained that hypothesis). This was another nail on her coffin since the Christians sustained that the Earth was the center of the Universe and denying it was an unpardonable heresy punishable even by death as Galileo Galilei had to meet with several centuries later. An extremely beautiful movie about the secular conflict between intolerance and dogmatism on the one hand and culture, wisdom and freedom of thought on the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really lovely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the interest of full disclosure, I should state from the outset that I am a Christian, and I found nothing in this movie to upset me.This movie tells at least a partially fictionalized account of Hypatia of Alexandria, renowned philosopher and mathematician. The viewer should remember that, in ancient time, philosophy and science were often thought of as one subject. Philosophy could account for science, in other words. What makes this particular story unique is that Hypatia was a woman, and one who influenced important men. This is what probably caused the alleged manner of her death.Rachel Weisz makes a beautiful Hypatia (according to tradition, Hypatia was beautiful), and gives her just the right amount of social awkwardness, especially when she is pursuing philosophical questions. Standouts in the cast are Max Minghella, Oscar Isaacs, and Rupert Evans (gosh, he's pretty in this!), as respectively, the slave, politician, and churchman that Hypatia teaches and befriends. I like the way this movie did not demonize either side, but rather demonized fanaticism on any side. There are moderate Christians and fanatical ones, like those led by Cyril of Alexandria in this movie, and that's probably how things really were. Cyril, not all Christians, is the bad guy in this story. But there's so much more than even that - the story is sprinkled with lovely little vignettes of Hypatia's philosophy and discoveries, like the ellipse. The camera often pulls back for a global view, which turns out to be quite appropriate, given the subject matter. And at the end, when a human life must be taken, one begins to realize the import, how much is lost, every time a life is taken. The film is gorgeous to look at, with some neat little tonal tricks - look how Hypatia stands out near the end, for instance. The music is stunning - I plan to purchase the soundtrack.If you know anything at all about the subject, just watch. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

Amenábar has done an impeccable work assembling a great cast and taking us to those hard times. Rachel Weisz was perfect for the role being not only a beautiful and talented actress, but smart enough to dig into Hypatia's scientific knowledge to reach a perfect combination that resulted in a brilliant performance. So were co-stars Max Minghella and Oscar Isaac and the rest of the cast which combined with a well written story and impressive scenarios made of "AGORA" one of the best historic events based movies of all time.

		<fullReview>This is billed as historical - which it may very well be although considering that the lion's share of the documentation was lost through various Christian pillages and the ever available present writer's prerogative, it would be somewhat distorted. Actually, more writer's prerogative would have helped here. This movie ends up being longer than it really is. Though well-acted and obviously financed with fully fleshed out sets and situations, it can put you to sleep waiting for something to really happen. Is it a love story? Yes. Is it a story about a Christian uprising and the contradictions therein? Yes. Is it a story about a strong female figure in a time when the odds were against her? Yes. Is it a story about a changing view of philosophy and science governing the Universe? Yes. It is all of these things and maybe even more. The biggest problem is that the movie never really seems to lend weight to any of the themes. They are all happening at the same time and the viewer will ultimately wonder whether one should care about any of them. This film will be mostly for those who may want to dwell on opposing philosophies trying to co-exist in under the intolerance of the time. Don't expect much excitement here, though. The revelations that are ferreted out along the way are somewhat still-born and anti-climatic. One has to put oneself into the mind of the time to appreciate the significance. Many will find that not worthwhile. It isn't a bad film - it is well made, just not very compelling. Personally, I appreciated what was attempted but did not end up liking any of the characters and ended up falling asleep halfway through it. I watched the other half the next day and it still didn't surge my blood. Bottomline: Not bad. Worth a viewing, but they should have focused more on one or two themes and not try to circumference the entire Universe.</fullReview>

In taking on these themes, the film relies on a highly metaphorical presentation. The reliance on metaphor acts as both a boon and a detriment to the storytelling. From the standpoints of technique and talent, "Agora," is an above average film. The greatest problems arise from symbolic depth causing shallow character development.The apparent assumption in "Agora," is that a general but highly metaphorical presentation makes up for not exploring the details of characters. A theme that pervades the film is that tolerance is a key ingredient to successful civilization. To demonstrate this, the story utilizes the historical conflict between pagan society and the burgeoning Christian society. The various clashes between the pagans and Christians illustrate how diverse and complex groups are capable of descending into bigoted violence over poorly thought out matters of faith. The metaphor is prescient to a modern audience in that it indirectly hints at the religious turmoil surrounding current issues between conservative Muslim factions and Western society. The strength of this metaphor is both subtle and strong. "Agora," takes great care to develop the conflict clearly. In addition, no sides are taken. The general goal of espousing tolerance is never adversely complicated by suggesting one side as being more correct than another side. While this metaphorical style of conveying messages is deftly woven throughout the film, an unfortunate side effect is a lack of characterization. The martyr of intolerance is Hypatia of Alexandria. Rachel Weisz turns in a well-rounded yet hollow performance of Hypatia. Unfortunately, Weisz's performance is typical for the whole cast. There are no characters that are really developed to the point of being complex humans. Rather, characters defined by gross and general traits function to grease the wheels of metaphorical development. For example, Hypatia is a rarity in that she is a highly regarded scientist and philosopher in a clearly misogynistic society. Furthermore, she maintains some interesting behavior and thoughts regarding sex, relationships, societal contract, and governance. At no point in the film are any of these interesting and character defining traits directly addressed. The problem with such lack of definition is that the audience is asked to use imagination to fill in important and not readily deduced detail. Had Hypatia's details been provided and a general character inferred, the film would have come off as a great deal more realistic. As the film stands, characters are interesting stereotypes and little more. The presence of stereotypes is not necessarily bad. By creating easily accessible characters, a story is sometimes able to delve deeper into complicated issues. The problem with "Agorra," is that advocating of tolerance hinges on an audience understanding what is being tolerated. By creating a shallow Hypatia, the film subverts its own goals of creating sympathy and a foundation for tolerance. Essentially, the ultimate lack of character depth made the film feel bland and ultimately hollow.On a personal note, I really wanted to enjoy this film. The mixing of philosophy, history, and societal upheaval has the potential for wonderful storytelling. "Agora," is a solid attempt at mixing these themes but neglects character details of the utmost importance. The effect, pure and simple, was disappointment. A part of me knew I would like this film. Another part of knew that the important subject matter of the film should make me like it. After viewing, I was struck more by the detrimental effects of flaccid characters than by the films message. In essence, this was a sad let down. I will probably ask a few friends to see this film so as to hear other perspectives. Unfortunately, I expect to hear a great many: "Well, the message is an important one; however, the film as a whole was a bit underwhelming."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a work of fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So it's comedy to accuse it of "inaccuracies".No one ever has claimed this is the true story of Hypatia. It's not perfect, and it's not for everyone, but like Agora said, question everything. Including this movie.It's not like early Christians didn't slaughter women and children of the unbelievers. It's not like they didn't chase out the Jews. It's not like they didn't murder one of the brightest female (and human) minds ever.If you're so focused on defending your faith, maybe you've missed the whole point of the movie.So get over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Made Film - Historical Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesternight I had the opportunity to view the much-anticipated historical epic from late-antique Alexandria, "Agora"(2009) by Spanish director Alejandro Amenábar. I very much enjoy historical films and was eager to see this film because, to my knowledge this, is the first serious historical film to have been produced set in the Roman Empire during late antiquity(280 - 620 AD); or after the Crisis of the Third Century and prior to the Muslim Invasions. Apart from the rich setting of Alexandria (which I had not ever seen portrayed in film), I was also enthusiastic to watch the film's portrayal of the religious conflicts between Pagans, Jews and Christians during this tumultuous and trans formative time in Western History. I had read beforehand about the villainous portrayal of Christians in the film, but I was unpersuaded and thought I would nevertheless delight in the historical setting and religio-political intrigue which the film promised. As I am squeamish with cruel and brutal death scenes, I was also nervous about watching a recreation of Hypatia's gruesome death. Fortunately the director chose to abridge this and present it is a dramatized manner without any violence.The film "Agora" has undoubtedly many good qualities, including excellent cinematography, compelling acting, high production values, and captivating set and costume designs. Although some reviewers have complained about the slow pacing and the historical science lecture, I found these genuinely intriguing and immersing. Some of the scenes in Hypatia's classroom seemed implausible and contrived, yet these often would include important points which would be revisited later in the drama. Amenábar describes in the commentary how he had originally intended to create a film about astronomy, and only afterwards became interested in the story of Hypatia. He describes the film as a "tribute to science", and the supposed scientific rationalism of Hypatia is undoubtedly the hero of this otherwise sordid tail of violence and internecine strife. In spite of these many laudable aspects of the film, the chief and unmistakable deficiency lies in its anachronistic imputation of a conflict between faith and reason in 5th Century Alexandria, and its egregious misrepresentation of the historical record concerning the characters Hypatia and St. Cyril of Alexandria. Firstly, it should be noted that the historical record concerning the events portrayed in the film are very sparse, and where they do come down to us they are more often deliberately misrepresented to highlight the thematic conflict between faith and reason. None of Hypatia's writings have survived, although it is believed that she wrote and taught about geometry and astronomy. Letters from the Bishop Synesius (Rubert Evans) to Hypatia have survived. Synesius is a fascinating example of an Alexandrian Neo- Platonist who studied with Hypatia and later converted to Christianity and became an Orthodox Bishop. Yet the greater falsification in the film concerns St. Cyril's character who, when examining the historical figure, appears nearly unrecognizable as the zealous villain of the film. Of all of the characters portrayed in this film, by far the most is known about St. Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria who played an instrumental role in the early 5th century Christological controversies. He was a classically educated philosopher and theologian of the Alexandrian theological school, who wrote prolific commentaries on the books of the Bible and on contemporary Christological disputes. Dozens of his lengthy works survive and can likely be read for their theological and philosophical erudition in most major public libraries.Hypatia(Rachel Weisz) herself is admirably portrayed in the film as an apolitical scientific rationalist and religious skeptic. However her character does not go undistorted on behalf of the central themes of the film. Hypatia is believed to have been a 5th century Pagan and Neo- Platonist philosopher and astronomer whose association with the Roman prefect Orestes precipitated her tragic murder by an anti-Orestes mob. However, Amenábar never mentions Platonism in the entire film (with the exception of statue of Plato which is destroyed in one scene). Rather, the audience is led to believe that Hypatia and her students were 20th century religious skeptics and scientific rationalists who were merely studying astronomy in the Temple of Serapis (a pagan hybrid of Zues and Osiris from the Ptolemaic dynasty). The fact that St. Cyril, Synesius and Hypatia would have been mutually familiar with the philosophical tradition Platonism in the Late Antique Mediterranean world is never mentioned, and her belief in 'philosophy' is everywhere reduced from Platonic mysticism to theoretical cosmology and astronomy.Although I was initially unpersuaded by the criticisms of the film as deliberately anti-Christian, I became increasingly persuaded of these criticisms as the film concluded. Although there are many sympathetic Christian scenes and characters throughout the film, the direction of the final scenes of the film highlight the implicit condemnation of Christianity in Late Antiquity as dangerously violent, murderously fanatical and ideologically hegemonic. Apart from the misrepresentation of a major Christian theologian in the characterization of St. Cyril, Amenábar seems intent in portraying the brutal murder of Hypatia on 5th Century Christianity and the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The dialog, scene direction, and dramatic development of the final scenes of the film made this particularly apparent for me, as Hypatia was tormented for her religious skepticism and portrayed as a prescient martyr for religious toleration and scientific rationalism.While I very much enjoyed this film, and rate it more highly than other historical films of the period (such as the abysmal "Last Legion", "King Arthur" and "the Decline of the Roman Empire"), I would not recommend this film due to its often deliberate and inexcusable misrepresentation of the period in specific dramatic, thematic, and directorial decisions. It is a well-made film of interest to students of the period and history enthusiasts, but would not likely be of interest to the general public due to its overlong scientific exposition, slow pacing and explicit violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hypatia Was No Atheist and Christians Were Not Taliban</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I have to applaud the producers of this movie for daring to go into unfamiliar territory. It is exceedingly rare to see historical movies from the ancient era, especially the 4th and 5th centuries. The movie's production values were superb and the tone of the movie was serious. The story does seem a little choppy at times (it actually is two stories in one) but the movie never fails to engross us. Unfortunately, the message of the movie was far from subtle and I must proclaim gratuitously anti-religious. Already I can see atheists puffing out their chests and declaring religion as poison. They should also look at themselves in the mirror because such talk is dangerous, and can lead to more of the intolerance this movie is ostensibly decrying. Intolerance is cyclical: those on top eventually find themselves the victim and vice versa. The Pagans start the bloodshed in this movie and for over 200 years mercilessly killed Christians with impunity, often as a form of entertainment. Now the Christians have the power and it is payback. Yet intolerance and violence is not religion - one need have no beliefs at all to be a murderer - and the real purpose of religion is to transcend one's ego, not increase it.Now, let's set the record straight. Hypatia was NO atheist but a Neoplatonist. She was not a materialist or iconoclast like atheists today. She had deep-felt beliefs but they were decidedly more philosophical and metaphysical. Nor was she a hedonist and actually remained a virgin, as this movie implies. I am certain that Hypatia, were she alive today, would be disgusted by atheism which believes in absolutely nothing.Second, I am highly skeptical that Christians were dressed like Taliban and that they were salivating, blood-thirsty barbarians. To be fair, the movie depicts pagans, Jews, and Christians as all intolerant and murderous but in the end the Christians with their black clothes and philistine attacks on culture and learning was a bit too much and felt unbalanced. Now, intolerance to other faiths was certainly a reality. Neoplatonism itself would be outlawed within a century of this time period when Emperor Justinian closed all the pagan schools and the pagans had ruthlessly murdered thousands of Christians with impunity for a good two centuries. I'm not sure about the Jews but I'm sure they were not innocent either (nor were they in this movie).Little is known about Hypatia's teachings. She is a very minor character in the history of philosophy, even Neoplatonism, but she will always be remembered for two reasons: she was a woman and she was martyred.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>19th/20th Century Arguments, With Togas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy a historical drama if it stays true to what we know of the period, this movie fails completely.The movie is aimed squarely at the religious/atheism debate, but the arguments presented are pure 19th/20th century. Except the proponents are wearing togas. Example: The Christians are arguing "No salvation w/o Jesus". That's 19th century. In Alexandria in 391 the Christians were already established and were more likely to have been arguing for and against Arianism (which does not make for much of a plot for a movie). Prior to that they would have been promoting The Resurrection, because their main focus was that they worshiped a living god, in comparison to the Romans, whom they believed worshiped dead statues. The Romans, by comparison, would have argued the pacifism and "love everybody even if they don't deserve it" ethics of the Christians were completely impractical and would destroy the empire.Also, a woman teaching men philosophy and science In Alexandria in 391? No chance. Sorry, the Romans didn't swing that way.If you are really curious about how Christianity interacted with the Roman religions from about 100 AD - 500 AD, this movie will not only tell you nothing, you'll get loaded up with disinformation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>TIFF 09: I was forgiven, but now I can't forgive ? Agora</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not deny the fact that Alejandro Amenábar is one of my favorite directors at the moment. With the eerily creepy The Others and the emotionally wrought Mar adentro, how could he not be? And why have I not seen Abre los ojos yet? Disgraceful I know. Well, you can imagine my immense excitement when finding out his new 4th century Egyptian epic Agora would be playing as a gala presentation in Toronto for TIFF. The trailer made it seem very unlike his past movies, looking to be on a much larger scale in comparison. But it was Amenábar, so I had complete faith that he could pull it off, probably infusing it with the detail and heart the previous movies had in abundance. He spoke before the film that he wanted to make a work that tackled the subject of intolerance, to fight "against anyone who uses violence to prove his ideas". Using three weeks of preparation before filming began, with minimal computer effects?he wanted a "going back in time" realism, so extras were hired and sets were built?he definitely did the job while also shedding light on a period of history that hasn't really been done in Hollywood.Debuting at Cannes, this screening was the North American premiere. The theatre was full of festival attendees and rows of Blackberry, Bell, and AMC sponsorship employees. But once the lights dimmed and the movie began, all that went away and Amenábar encompassed us in the city of Alexandria. A woman, the daughter of the head of the glorious library holding mankind's history, Hypatia, played nicely by Rachel Weisz, is the voice and teacher for a new generation of Egyptians. It is a mixed group of those still believing in the Gods, (pagans), and the new Christian contingent, being persecuted while also persecuting as well. Hypatia looks past all that, refusing to align herself with a religion, instead utilizing science itself as her philosophy's backbone. Teaching and comprehending the world as heliocentric, attempting to grasp at the idea of gravity many, many years before its discovery to allow for a geocentric model, it all derails once bigotry prevails. The agora becomes a scene of Christians throwing fruit at the statues of the Gods, an offense that the pagans must meet with retribution. It all turns into a fight that exposes the infinite number of Christians living in the city. All those who hid their beliefs expose themselves for the battle, eventually driving the pagans back into the library to await word from the prefect on what's to be done for a truce.The fight is epic in scope and execution?a mass of humanity fighting friends in the streets. Amenábar has no fear in showing the brutality and intimacy of the war. We see overhead shots of people running around like ants, but also close-up views of the men engaging with each other, taking it as personally as possible. When a man's slave must reconcile his duty to his master and that to his God, the pain and conflict is etched on his face. Screaming, "I'm a Christian!" and then going over to beat the man he served, epitomizes the event completely. You could argue that the fighting scenes overshadow the rest in effectiveness and you would be right. The scenes of government, school, and scientific research do become second fiddle to the hostility brewing underneath the surface, as they are somewhat generic and not too original as far as historical biographies go. They are a necessity, though, to give the audience a jumping off point as to why both factions feel the need to disagree and prove their superiority. Just wait for the second half?after a clumsy transitional time jump?where most pagans have become Christians themselves in order to survive in the new rebuilt Alexandria. It now becomes a war between them and the Jews, fighting for equality in a government ruled by one of Hypatia's former students, Oscar Isaac's Orestes, a newly made Christian, yet educated by a woman ? blasphemy indeed.All the fighting does, however, is cause death and destruction, setting mankind back centuries in progress and education. We can't know for sure if Hypatia was on the verge of such scientific theories that far back, but the point definitely comes across. Amenábar made a statement before the screening that if the Alexandria library had not been destroyed, we might have landed on Mars already. The interesting thought of those words is that they might not be as bold as you'd initially think. So much knowledge was lost in this bickering feud without reason besides needing some form of victory in a pissing contest. It is something to consider especially when you look at history after that point and the countless deaths of visionaries and potentially brilliant minds due to zealotry, genocide, and just plain blind aggression or inferiority complexes. I'm sure the fact that the film shows three religions at war, none of which are Muslim, isn't lost on the filmmakers and serves as some sort of comment towards political tensions today, but you have to read into the tale to get to that point; I think it works as a historical epic alone without the need of social commentary of the present. As a piece of history and as entertaining wartime cinema, I think Agora earns the right to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even historians can claim accuracy about this particular story and yet here we are.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie started, I decided that I would put my knowledge about Hypatia aside and give a chance to this attempt at telling her story. Even though that choice allowed me to enjoy the film, I was still disappointed by yet another blatant use of this woman's name in order to promote a certain idea.Historical inaccuracy aside, this is an expertly directed film, with excellent shots, literal and symbolic narrative, on point music and beautiful cinematography. The script's message hits you a bit over the head with the black- robed parabolani, the over-the-top dramatization of the destruction of the Serapeum, the very European "good guys" and the very Middle East Christians. Yeah, we got it already.On the downside, first of all, this movie about Hypatia doesn't tell Hypatia's story. This Hypatia is a modernized and very tuned down version of the real woman. And even though Rachel Weisz does an excellent job with the material that was given to her, giving us an utterly charming, absent minded, driven and powerful in a very dignified and quiet way scholar, that character is not Hypatia.Hypatia was first and foremost a philosopher, a neoplatonist. Hypatia had such deep faith in Plato's teachings, her whole life revolved around it. Her moral code was so high and similar to the teachings of Christianity, her integrity was such that gave her "immunity" to the religious battles that were raging in the city. Many of her students were influential Christians, who later joined what they learned from her with Christian faith. She was so knowledgeable, ethical, just and wise, her influence in the political and social circles was equal to that of the archbishop. Powerful stuff for that time. Which brings us to the reason behind her murder. Political jealousy it was, plain and simple. There was no battle between science and religion taking place, no feministic tendencies or unrealistic scientific revelations.In conclusion, even though, as I said, this is a solid film with a positive message, the way it is delivered is lacking. By using a historical figure and manipulating her story in order to serve the movie's purpose, these people became no better than the people they try to condemn. And please humanity, if you have nothing truthful or of any actual historic value to add, leave Hypatia alone. She's been your poster girl for 100 different purposes these last 500 years. A woman of value ended up being remembered for her brutal murder and not for her extraordinary life. There's a point where enough is enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stupendous Spanish biopic based on the story of the great Late-Roman Philosopher, Astronomer and Mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria.This is a movie about the decadence of Rome not about the Roman Empire. This is a movie about Christians, but not the heroes that we are usually presented with. This is not a movie about Roman women who are slaves, servants and ready to please their men, but a movie about a woman who was served, respected and revered by men, who preached by example, who was true to herself, and whose talent led her to being brutally assassinated. This is not a movie about epic battles, but about a epic quest for knowledge and understanding.Agora is a movie against fundamentalism, intolerance, ignorance and irrationality, about the necessity of Philosophy and Science to advance and build a better world. The movie shows that mobs are never right or understanding, just a bunch of stupid animals, even if the principles that bring them together are respectable and valid in essence.The movie shows with great easiness and without lecturing, the decadence of the Roman Empire, and the processes of conversion of pagan societies to Christianity, both as a result of the social needs of the population as as result of the pressure of the incipient church hierarchies on a decadent political system and its holders.We don't have many movies about Romans with depth; look back at the movies recently shot on the Roman and Greek Empires and you'll see. We don't have many movies that offer an intimate study of a brilliant female intellectual. We don't have many movies in which women are even treated with respect or not presented subordinated to men. There are hundred reasons to watch this movie, especially if you just want something to feed your mind and soul.Rachel Weiz really shines in this movie, embracing the character of Hypatia wholeheartedly, depicting Hypatia's self-respect, strength and intelligence with talent, class and conviction; moreover, she looks gorgeous in this movie. Oscar Isaac also offers a heartfelt convincing performance as Prefect Orestes, as well as Michael Lonsdale as Hypatia's father Theon. I had a mix of feelings regarding Max Minghella's performance as freed slave Davus, whose dramatic intensity I considered overbearing sometimes. The same can be said of some of the fanatic Christian characters in the movie.The digital reconstruction of Alexandria is beautiful and realistic and the perfect setting together with Malta landscapes, for the story. The internal decorations and sets are exquisite, as well as the lighting, the colors, the dresses, and the actors' characterization. The mood and cinematography are wonderful, too.Among the flaws of the movie, I would mention, firstly, that it is a little too long and slow-paced sometimes. Secondly, I found all the explanatory texts that link different periods of the movie too long and distracting, and very TV-series-ish; I agree that the story, not being well-known to the lay viewer, needs of some explanation and historical context, but I'm not sure that this was the best way of doing so. Finally, the space-to-earth shots, showing the roundness of Earth before falling onto Alexandria are not only beautiful but also relevant to Hypatia quest to know the shape and movement of Earth and the Universe; however they are repeated too many times; a final scene with this shot would have been enough, a sort of modern thoughtful epilogue about Astronomy and about the link between Universe and our universe.A great biopic with good acting, magnificent atmosphere, a powerful message, and, most importantly, heart and soul. If you just like crappy movies, war battles and women slaves, this is not for you. If your brain and your mind are somewhat limited, neither.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting history lesson but emotionally cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 4th century AD Alexandria. It is still a Roman city but Christians are a new force to deal with. The empire is crumbling. Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) is a modern woman scientist and teacher with modern views of astronomy. Her student Orestes (Oscar Isaac) and her slave Davus (Max Minghella) are both in awe of her. Christians are hated and put down by most Romans. Hypatia tries to be treat everyone equally. The Christian agitator Ammonius converts Davus. Orestes tries to win Hypatia over but she rejects him. The Romans rally to kill the Christians for an insult to the gods, but it turns into an all out fight. The Romans retreat to the library. First there is an uneasy truce. The library is sacked. Peace generally returns but Christians continue to agitate. Learning is lost. Fanatism and zealotry descend on the community. Religious intolerance reign. Hypatia tries to advance learning but her place in the world becomes more and more precarious.Spanish director Alejandro Amenábar is taking on a lesser known historical drama. For the most religious viewers, this will seem like a diatribe against Christianity. There is certainly a distaste for religious rigidity. This is more of a history lesson. The science is interesting but probably not compelling for the general public. What this movie needs more than anything is humanity. The movie basically displaces human love with love of science. Rachel Weisz is playing this character so coldly. And I don't like the pulling back of the camera to a global view. It distances the audience from the characters. It does get heavy handed. The story works just enough and unique enough to be worthwhile viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Others director Alejandro Amenábar directs this dramatic historical epic set in Roman Egypt during the rise of Christianity. Rachel Weisz stars as Hypatia of Alexandria , the famous mathematician and philosopher who is credited as being the first to discover the elliptical orbit of the Earth around the sun. Max Minghella stars as Davus, a slave who turns towards Christianity looking for freedom, while also falling for Hypatia. The Christian uprising and subsequent quelling is a tumultuous and violent ordeal that leaves Alexandria in ruins and puts strain on Hypatia as she tries to discover the ultimate truths about our universe.If you like historical dramas then Agora is certainly a good movie for you. It is plenty dramatic and its historical context is very relevant and at times it almost plays out as a history lesson. There is a ton of ancient history within this film between the discoveries of Hypatia and the conflict between the Christians and Jews that dictates most of the events that happen in the film. It's a pretty interesting film to watch and there is certainly a lot to be learned from the film.However, Agora isn't all that exciting overall. It's not bad but I felt indifferent about the film overall. It's somewhat melodramatic and can border on cheesy at times. Amenábar directs with a good eye for detail, mixing in some beautiful aerial shots throughout the film, along with the film's overall high quality cinematography. Of course, the film still feels very Hollywood. Agora holds back in many places where it could have excelled in deep and unsettling subject matter. The war between the Christians and Jews gets pretty brutal during the film, but I still felt like it was sugarcoated, seeing as this was a truly horrendous and bloody conflict. Agora could have done more, but it is, overall, a pretty decent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potential, potential ? but unfortunately all that is grand doesn't make it great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Expectations where high when "Agora", after long delays, finally found its way into the cinemas and it turned out to be a pretty good movie ? but nowhere as good as it could have been. Perhaps "Agora" would have worked had it been a mini-series, but for cinema it's just too long, over-edited, awkwardly paced and still feels like blown-up TV-show. Considering the movie "The Sea Inside" one of the great films of our times and having enjoyed both "The Others" and "Tesis", it almost pains to say that all major flaws seem to boil down to one factor: director Alejandro Amenabar.Starting with the philosophical issue ? sure, with the exception of small historical inaccuracies, everything Amenabar tells us is true. Yet, after two hours, it feels like the director has been barraging us with all the social ills that he can think of: slavery, Christian bigotry, allegories to Islam (the heavily bearded, raving and ranting mob reminding us of pictures we see on the news far too often), chauvinism, inequality in education, etc. Yes, we all know these things are wrong yet ever-present in human history, but the director is preaching to the quire; and if there really was the distinct need for Rachel Weisz' menstrual blood to make a point, remains in the eyes of the beholder.As eager as "Agora" is to talk about issues like idealism and moral, as restraint is it in showing us the violence and brutality of this period and event. Sure, this is not supposed to be "Gladiator" or "300" but the occasionally severed arm or head and the clashes between Heathen and Christians leave the viewer relatively unimpressed.The actors, with the exception of an excellent Rachel Weisz, are good but never beyond good TV-standard, again making us feel that we've just watched an overlong "The Tudors"-episode. This is not so much the actors fault as, again, the directors: Amenabar would like to make us believe that the people of Alexandria, 391 AD, when it comes to philosophical and social questions, talked, thought and behave any different from modern people. Compare this to Mel Gibsons "The Passion" or even "Apocalypto": Gibson convinced us that we're watching people from those eras and places. "Agora" doesn't. Indeed, to think what Gibson could have done with this film, had he directed it and hadn't he been religiously insane ? twice the shame really.A good film that could have been a powerful, indeed, an important film but because of mentioned flaws is not ? a solid 6 out of 10 would have to suffice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The History of a most beautiful, most vertuous, most learned, and every way accomplish'd Lady</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agora" is a recent film set in classical times which is neither a large-scale "sword and sandal" epic like "Gladiator" or "Troy", nor an action movie like "The Eagle" or "Centurion". Rather, it is a biopic of Hypatia of Alexandria, a female philosopher, mathematician and astronomer who lived in Egypt in the late 4th and early 5th centuries AD. She was a real person, although the facts of her life are disputed, particular controversy surrounding the exact circumstances of and motivation for her murder at the hands of a mob in 415 AD.The film is set against the background of the struggle for pre-eminence between the old religion of Greco-Roman polytheism and the rising new faith of Christianity. Alexandria also had a large Jewish community, who play a part in the story. In the heyday of the Roman epic, the 1950s, films on this theme ("The Robe", "Quo Vadis?", "Ben Hur") almost always had a pro-Christian slant, but this is quite absent from "Agora", in which the Christians of Alexandria are generally portrayed as being ignorant, fanatical and cruel bigots, determined to stamp out any rival systems of thought. Not that the religiously observant polytheists are really any better. Near the beginning of the film one elderly pagan is heard to regret the fact that it is no longer permitted to feed Christians to the lions, as would have been done in his grandfather's time, and the pagans are as keen to instigate pogroms against the Christians as vice-versa.In reality Hypatia was a philosopher of the Neo-Platonist school, a group who had many things in common with Christianity; they believed, for example, in a single God and in the immortality of the soul, and their teachings were a strong influence on early Christian theology. The film, however, is not particularly interested in Hypatia's religious or philosophical beliefs; she is portrayed by Rachel Weisz as a rationalistic sceptic, unconvinced by either Christianity or polytheism. It is much more interested in her supposed mathematical and astronomical thinking. None of her writings on these subjects have survived, but in the film she is portrayed as not an advocate of a heliocentric model of the solar system, to which the Christians object on religious grounds. Moreover, she is also shown as anticipating (by more than a thousand years) Kepler's discovery that the planets move around the sun in elliptical rather than circular orbits.In the early eighteenth century the deist philosopher John Toland wrote a tract with the rather long-winded title "Hypatia: Or the History of a most beautiful, most vertuous, most learned, and every way accomplish'd Lady; who was torn to pieces by the Clergy of Alexandria, to gratify the pride, emulation, and cruelty of their Archbishop, commonly, but undeservedly, stil'd St. Cyril". I am not sure if the film-maker Alejandro Amenábar used Toland's work as one of his sources, but that title could also serve as a summary of the film's ideological position. Hypatia is the heroine; beautiful, intelligent, rational and an ardent defender of science and reason. The main villain is Cyril, the fanatical, rabble-rousing Patriarch of Alexandria, a man who hates Hypatia partly because of her refusal to embrace Christianity, partly because of her advocacy of theories regarded by the Church as heretical and partly because she makes a convenient target in his continuing feud with Orestes, the Roman Governor of Alexandria. (Cyril suspects Orestes, with some justification, of having made an insincere conversion to Christianity for purely political reasons).The film attempts to be a "film of ideas", tackling a big subject, the relationship between religion and science. Unfortunately, it does so in a historically inappropriate way. The idea of a fundamental "conflict between religion and science" is a nineteenth-century one, largely superseded by modern histories of science. Those who propounded the idea of such a conflict tended to concentrate on a few selected episodes, such as the persecution of Galileo by the Inquisition and the controversy over Darwinism, and there is no evidence of such a conflict in fifth-century Egypt and no historical support for the idea of Hypatia as a proto-Galileo eleven centuries avant la lettre, which is how Amenábar invites us to see her. As I said, the exact reason for her murder is disputed, but it appears to have had more to do with anti-pagan bigotry and with local Alexandrian politics than with any opposition to her scientific work.The film's other main flaw is that with a multitude of major characters- there are many others besides the few referred to above- and a constant stream of plot developments which make the storyline difficult to follow. One scene that I found particularly strange was the one where Hypatia rejects the advances of a male admirer by presenting him with her menstrual rags in order to demonstrate the baseness of sexual desire. Now it is quite true that such a story is told about Hypatia in one early (although not contemporary) source, but Amenábar ignores the fact that to a modern audience such a gesture would be likely to indicate not philosophical detachment from carnal lusts but serious mental health issues. There are some better features about the film; Weisz's performance is not a bad one, and the attempt to recreate ancient Alexandrian life is quite impressive, but overall I was left with the impression that a much better film could have been made on this subject. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amenabar's Wrong Turn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from Amenabar's usual distortion of religious issues I normally like his films a great deal. An example of this would be The Others. Nicole Kidman's character twists Catholic thinking and teaching and I've never been certain whether that was intentional or if it came from Amenabar's own ignorance. Nonetheless, The Others was a brilliant and moody film with several great performances and a few good chills.Agora is a wrong turn for the director. The storyline is simply plodding. The characters offer no emotional resonance. Perhaps in the hands of a better director whose intent was to flesh out these characters and their viewpoints on life and thought at the end of the Roman Era, rather than simply espouse a simplistic viewpoint of what are indeed complex matters (historical, philosophical, political, and theological) a better movie would have been produced. Propaganda most always lacks nuance and the result is usually a movie such as this.Several good things of note for this film. It does well at recreating an ancient time and place, bringing an obscure historical figure (Hypatia) to focus, and observes the sad case of how the Christian faith became politicized during this time period. It certainly has inspired me to read more about this time and the characters the film portrays, to see what various historians say about the matters portrayed. Here's hoping that Amenabar's next film is much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of mistakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are several things about this movie that I did not like. There are several mistakes in the movie that are listed on this site. I want to point out one more that bothered me very much: her final scientific discovery made no sense.By the end of the movie she deduces that the orbit of the earth around the sun is elliptical because "the sun looks larger in the summer" and therefore is must be closer. The writer of this movie is clearly unaware that the seasons are caused by the inclination of the axis of the earth respect to the orbit around the sun. Actually during the summer in the northern hemisphere the earth is FARTHEST away from the sun. So, if anything, the sun should look smaller. It actually looks pretty much the same because the eccentricity of the orbit is so small that they would never observe it with naked eye.It is quite common that movies make scientific mistakes. But this one is too basic. They should have informed themselves a little bit. It only takes to ask any average 12 year old boy.It bothered me particularly because up to that point, her thoughts were fairly good and interesting. It was very reasonable that the fall of objects would argue in favor of the earth being the center of the universe, and her experiment throwing the bag in the boat was very well done. Unfortunately, at the end, the scientific part of the story ended up being as erroneous as the rest of the historical references.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for christians!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Christian, I have liked this movie so much! It does not only reveal you some history about early christians, but it also teaches you so many things about faith.It does not matter that christians these days are not as combative as they are depicted in this movie, but there are so many other features, we should learn from them! Christians in this movie are depicted as brave, faithful, virtue, god-fearing people, who are steadfast in their faith and are ready to do anything to defend it.Parabalani always stand up for their brothers, they are one big family who are always ready to help the people around.The main character Davus has always liked and respected Hypatia, and at the end of the movie I really liked the scene where Davus knows that Hypatia is about to get killed by his brothers, but he does not renounce nor Hypatia nor his brothers in faith. He acts reasonably. He took care of Hypathia, so she wouldn't suffer much, and at the same time he does not rebel against his brothers to defend her because at some extent he agrees with his brothers that she IS guilty (that's what he believes, and faith is everything for him). He did a good act by supporting both sides at the same time, he got my respect for this decision.And the cast is amazing. The actors are not super famous, and that makes that movie even more interesting. I'm no expert in acting, but in this movie you can clearly see, that the acting is on the highest level. ALL actors were just amazing! I really liked Max Minghella (Davus) and Ashraf Barhom (Ammonius ), their characters were incredibly fascinating! I recommend this movie to all christians! Not sure if non christians will like it as well, but if you're interested in astronomy, history, or middle east, give it a shot ;) It's a great movie :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By Amenabar's standards, Agora is a let-down. There is nothing great here, but at least there is still something to see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenabar, the Oscar-winning filmmaker of The Sea Inside (2004) and the modern horror classic The Others (2001), brings us way back into the past to the time of the Roman Empire. Premiered at Cannes but screened out of competition, Agora was not good enough to warrant a Golden Palm nomination. I feel this is Amenabar's weakest picture to date and it is fairly obvious to any viewer that the film leaves much to be desired.Agora can be loosely classified into a swords-and-sandals epic, an action-adventure sub-genre which has produced acclaimed films such as Ridley Scott's Gladiator (2000) to flops like Oliver Stone's Alexander (2004). However, the director tones down on action spectacle and brings in ideological themes instead. Rachel Weisz plays Hypatia, an atheist astronomer whose beliefs are grounded in scientific theories and the wisdom and knowledge of her predecessors. In the film, she becomes obsessed with trying to explain the movements of the Earth and the Sun ? issues which are not important considering the fact that Christians are at war with the Pagans.Weisz's character then becomes a symbol of anti-Christianity. She is a strong, resilient force who will not bow down to "foreign ideology" and vows to seek the truth about the universe (and consequently who we are) through factual observation and logical understanding instead of relying on the "Word of God". Once again, the tussle between rationality versus faith set forth in the recent religious film by the Coens, A Serious Man (2009), comes into play.Amenabar treads on sensitive waters here. But because Agora is a film "based on historical fact" (how much of it is true only a history scholar can tell), he has the "justification" to include blasphemous material which can be very offensive to Christians. Ideological conflict takes center stage in this film and bloody skirmishes between the Pagans and Christians become its natural consequence.Amenabar films these skirmishes with quite a bit of skill even though he is not known as an action director. His camera movements remain fluid but the film lacks unforgettable images and thrilling set-pieces. Conventional storytelling also does not help its cause. The result is a two-hour plus "epic without the epic-ness". Some will read Agora as a love story between Hypatia and Davus (Max Minghella), a slave who joined the Christians for freedom. But this comes out as trivial in the film.**SPOILER ALERT Even the final fifteen minutes when Hypatia is arrested by the Christians to be brutally tortured to death, the presence of Davus, who tries to ease her suffering, fails to ignite that inadequately captured sense of "forbidden love". By Amenabar's standards, Agora is a let-down. There is nothing great here, but at least there is still something to see.SCORE: 7/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Anti-Christian Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where does one begin to take to task this fictional diatribe against Christians and the early Imperial Church. Alexandria was known to be a city that often was embroiled in heated riots that cost lives even before the Common Era and the advent of the Church. The film portrays the Christian church of the period to be violently intolerant and zealously misogynistic in their religious zeal and ensconced in superstition. The events in the film never happened. In 48 BCE, it was Julius Caesar (a pagan) who invaded Egypt and destroyed part of the Alexandrian library in his war against Pompey. Strabo, a pagan historian, who died around 23 CE, spoke of the main library as a thing of the past. What was left of this main library was probably destroyed in Aurelius' wars of Imperial unification when the Great Museum to which the main library was adjunct in 272 CE. By 391 CE, the library was not in existence. Yet, many post 18th century scholars and historians state that Christians destroyed the temple under the direction of Bishop Theophilus' in 391 CE confusing clashes between pagans and Christians as part and parcel of the main library's destruction. This is a clear untruth and what is sad it is a deliberate one at that.However, in 391 CE, the Serapeum was destroyed. Christians were captured and murdered in the temple of this secondary library by pagans. Since the murdered Christians were to be considered martyrs there was a call for restraint so as not to taint their sacrifice so there was no riot or clash. The Emperor Theodosius ordered the complex to be demolished while letting the murderers go free. The Christians were allowed under Roman governmental oversight to participate in the dismantling of the temple but no other structures were harmed. Additional damage to the building itself probably took place in 7th century by Muslim invaders. However, there was no burning of the library's collection by Christians. Both a goodly number of Christian and pagan accounts of that day exist and there is not one mention of such a burning of the library's collection. Even Eunapius of Sardi who had no great love for Christianity makes no such claim and there are even hints that by this time the secondary library had no collection. Pagan historian, Ammianus Marcellinus, describes the Serapeum as being no longer a library just a few years before its destruction. There is not one written source before the 18th century that has claimed that Christians were responsible for either the collection's destruction for either the main or secondary library nor is there any other evidence proving such. The idea that Christians and the Church were responsible for destroying the Library(ies) of Alexandria in 391 CE is a fiction made up by English historian Edward Gibbon in the 18th century.As to the murder of the brilliant Platonic philosopher, trained scientist, and author of mathematical commentaries, Hypatia. While a woman of note, there is no record of her making any important contributions to her fields of expertise. Just as the recent Cosmos series totally mislead its viewership concerning Giardano Bruno, this movie (and so many others) have created a fictional heroine to dovetail with the fictional history of banal, anti-intellectual Christians on a murderous rampage against pagans especially one pagan woman. Hypatia, who was sixty at the time, was indeed murdered and dismembered, by a Christian fraternity founded to help the poor. She was killed not because she was a woman (female intellectuals were not uncommon in Eastern Empire in either pagan or Christian circles) or a philosopher/scientist (this class of people in Alexandria included both pagans, Jews, and Christians and there was no Christian prejudice against science or philosophy). Hypatia was not perceived as an enemy of the Christian faith and counted many of the educated Christians of Alexandria as her friends, many of whom were students. The Christian historian Socrates, who admired her, states that she was killed because she embroiled herself in a political war between the Imperial prefect and the city's patriarch and it was the denizens of the city's slums that took matters into their own hands without any Church approval (even though the movie lays the blame at the feet of St. Cyril of Alexandria) and was more about her social class and standing and belonging to the wrong side of a political war where this murderous mob was concerned. While the higher, educated classes participated in each other's lives no matter their religious and philosophical differences, the lower classes before and after Christianity's advent were tribal and violent. These Christian lower-class denizens could be rightly compared to Europe's soccer hooligans and the cross was simply one more banner to wave. Such is the truth while the movie and its attempt to paint the Christian Church as a violent, banal, intolerant, and misogynistic community is anti-Christian propaganda and a deliberate lie.</fullReview>

No idea why so many see Rachel's role as good. It was contrived, and we never believe she could have been a 'brilliant astronomer'. Music was a COMPLETE disappointment from a genius composer. Photography outstanding. Story gets lost in too many sub-stories. Too vague. Love the ambiance of the 4th century, though far too clean. We see 'hundreds of thousands' of people, yet...not a single child at all. We all know kids in film double its budget (the poor little protégés have to be sooo carefully looked after, they are soooo delicate), but still. it's a glaring falsity. Been to Cairo, seen the trillions of kids everywhere? Well, it was worse then. Mmmmm what else? How yeah, a personal note to Alejandro: OK dude, you got your big lump of cash, now come back.

		<fullReview>Hypatia: "Synesius, you don't question what you believe, or cannot. I must."Although I like sword and sandals epics as much as the next moviegoer with its admixture of history and melodrama (Spartacus and Ben Hur, the twin gold standard), Agora misses greatness by a wide margin as heroine Hypatia (Rachel Weitz) discovers in the elliptical path of the earth around the son, acclaimed astronomer as she was in 5th century, AD, Alexandria. She is a teacher and philosopher preaching equality at a time when Christians are rebelling against pagans and Jews, as if the inner Mel Gibson had been unleashed.This melodramatic historical piece, both in characterization and manipulative music, has moments of clarity as when Hypatia lectures on the spheres, finally discovering what Kepler centuries later would about the orbit of our solar system. Conveniently her dogged addiction to solving the circle/ellipse conundrum parallels the fanaticism of the Christians, who brook no opposition to their beliefs.In that honesty about Christians (who would have thought of them as murderous anarchists?) rests the film's singular merit, for the rest is bloody and sometimes overwrought, especially as students Orestes (Oscar Isaac) and Davus (Max Minghella) foolishly pursue Hypatia's affection.The other honesty is the consistent way Hypatia avoids the attentions of the attractive young men. Rare it is today when a heroine avoids romantic entanglements.My disappointment is the film's lack of depth on the principles of equality and tolerance, so much a part of this contemporary world centuries later. Alejandro Amenabar has done much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat interesting, but kind of dull</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting film set in the late Roman period, in the 400s A.D., in Alexandria, Egypt. Rachel Weisz plays Hypatia, a rare female philosopher and astronomer. A religious tsunami in the name of Christianity is starting to sweep through this area of the world, and they don't take kindly to those who question God's creation. The film has been heavily criticized for its apparent anti-Christian sentiments. I'd like to think bigotry was not what Amenabar was aiming at, but that's difficult. Yeah, I'm sure stuff like this happened at the time, and the Dark Ages (not entirely the fault of Christianity, but it certainly didn't help) were just around the corner. And, yes, I'm sure they had to kill a whole bunch of people to end up taking over the world. Still, this particular story is mostly fictional, so that kind of harms Amenabar's hypothesis. Then again, one can posit this fictional account of Hypatia as symbolic more than literal. But it really doesn't help that Amenabar dresses all the Christians in black clothes, and has most of the Christian leaders with dark skin and big fuzzy beards, as swarthy as possible.I honestly don't care all that much about the political aspects of the film (maybe Amenabar meant to disparage modern day Christians, maybe he didn't). My only concern is that the film isn't especially involving. With such an obscure, interesting piece of history, it should have been a bit less dull than it is. Weisz is pretty good, but none of the other actors (or their characters) register whatsoever. I certainly didn't hate it - it's very pretty and fairly well directed - but I don't like it all that much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't tell if I was disappointed by the film because of higher expectations of it or if the movie itself lacked the essential spark. A visual feast of a film, with excellent costumes. Despite this however, the movie was lacking in conviction and the characters all seemed to be floating on the surface. The lengthy scenes of chaos (since I want to avoid any spoilers) became tedious. The chaos could have been substantially edited because the point had already been made at the gate, and elaborated upon inside the gate. The lack of editing at various points distracted from the the narrative and compromised my interest in it as a viewer. I thought the film overall was lacklustre with Hypatia's character (Rachel Weisz) doing it's best to bravely hold up the film as well as the poorly depicted characters surrounding her.Another aspect I thought that made for a disappointing film was the fact that given the high minded pursuit of knowledge on Hypatia's part the film's narrative deserved a different kind of treatment. In my opinion the central idea behind the film i.e. Hypatia's ponderings in the pursuit of knowledge called for for a tighter script which would have lent strength to Hypatia's character. Because her character lacked a basic vitality which made Hypatia's pursuit of knowledge seem like aimless inconsequential wanderings.I do not think that such a mild portrayal of Hypatia's character, regardless of the reasons for it, is an Oscar-nomination worthy performance as some of the other reviewers have suggested.Agora is an excellent film demonstrating that the visual appeal of a film cannot make up for it's poor portrayal of it's characters or for moving the story on in a manner that holds viewer attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar's masterpiece is a breathtaking excursion into religious fascism and misogynistic tyranny made special by Rachel Weisz, who probably give one of the best female acting performances in years as a scientist who was light years beyond her generation. Weisz is amazing and her performance is the show and then some. Well acted sword and sandals period films that has a remarkable breathtaking performance by Rachel Weisz that is deserving of the high praise she has gotten for her role but there is no denying the fact that the script has some very glaring problems that serves more to derail the great acting strides made by every actor in the movie other than help with their performances. Rachel Weisz is with out a doubt, an actor's actor, one of the best we have working today and she manages to work against the grain to put together a complex heroine whose internal conflict with herself and others is a breath of fresh air in this time and age of cinema and she helps keeps this movie alive, too bad that the script is so motivated in its self serving righteousness that instead of having Weisz's complexity, it flouters in such an incoherent way that you have no idea on what is going on during the later parts of the film thanks to too many story lines happening at once, which take up too much time of what this film should have been about and that should have been more a look at a complex women who stood her ground during a very dark period in human history. She's back up by Max Minghella, who is a great actor in his own right and Oscar Isaac, who is just as good. The triangle between them in believable and touch by their struggles to find their destinies. Its a moving cinematic piece of art and Alejandro does the story proud in his way of capturing the time of struggles of that time. Its a very good film, don't get me wrong but it could have been much more, especially with Rachel Weisz giving such a remarkable performance.</fullReview>

We switch between experiencing the three lead male characters' reactions to her and feelings about her. Rarely are the scenes and interactions about understanding Hypatia's mind or views or feelings; just understanding how her personality and actions effect the mind and feelings of the men around her. Her character is actually sort of just a Manic Pixie Dream Girl.It's a shame that the best movie about the first well-known female scientist can still fail the Bechdel Test. I'm not sure if there was even a single other female character in this film (other than extras). And while this movie is a remarkably accurate depiction of the historic events of Byzantine Alexandria, of the Christian population gaining influence and forcing women out of the aristocracy, this film's protagonists and target audience are men, and female viewers have little to relate to in the interactions of the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the film unfurls...the viewer (this viewer) wonders..."Who put SO MUCH MONEY into a biblical film, these days?". The answer starts to appear. The film is a 'set the records straight' operation, funded by Jewish Hollywood, and is flying under a Spanish flag to avoid perception. Interesting. "But Christ WAS a jew!" is a highlight moment...and is screamed by the rabbis. True. What is actually amusing is just how virulent an attack on Cristianity the movie is. The Christian hordes are portrayed as ancient 'bikers', Hell's Angels (forgive the pun). The admirable costume designer, a very talented Italian lady, has opted for 'bandoleros' for the heavies... so that they sub-consciously remind us of the Spaghetti- western villains of 'For a fistful of Dynamite' and its likes... and I'm sure that if the Christians had received access to a fistful of such explosives, the film would have been a riot! The sets are breathtaking. Great taste and research. The Heraclium/Pompeii inspired palace frescoes, the Egyptian columns etc. etc. Stunning and VERY expensive. But the film's lack of subtlety is an insult to our intelligence, and makes us truly doubt that its script-writers have told us the REAL story. They have tried to cram a two hour box with hundreds of years of socio-political evolution. They have tried to write off the Jewish phenomenon as something that hinged on a specific day in the distant past. Quite childish. And then there is the casting. Abominable! Especially the males. Maybe the intent was to grab a young audience by using plastic faces more akin to the latter years of Disney than to facial characteristics akin to the era. Rachel Weisz does her very best to imbue her role with value. But, maybe, she is too pretty. Too 'Pretty Woman'. Her class would be drooling, not learning. A more believable , if less obviously 'becoming' actress would have given her character credibility. As I say, surrounded by such males, her plight as an actress must have been very arduous. I would have laughed, the secretly cried.... In short: a dubious, manipulative, ethically ambiguous subject, offered up in a sumptuous chocolate-box.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First the good points of which there were many.1. The casting and subsequent acting was superb.2. The recreation of the ancient city of Alexandria was excellent and brought home to the viewer the splendour that was the third city of the Roman empire (after Rome and Constantinople)4. The historical details were well researched in that the events actually took place and most of the characters actually existed.5. The historical prejudice against the Jewish community in Alexandria by the Roman/Byzantine authorities and religious leaders is well attested to in the film.6. The importance of the Greek philosopher's to the development of modern scientific research and thinking is another thing that people will be able to take from this film.7. The extra material on the DVD which I rented (discussion of Alexandria both modern and ancient) was a nice bonus.The serious flaws1. Wooden character development in the script which the excellent acting could not overcome. Most of the characters are one dimensional simpletons and it is difficult to identify with their motivations. The love triangle had much potential but was poorly developed. 2. Technical inconsistencies - why was the symbol of city of Roma shown in Alexandria - besides being a middle age anachronism, Alexandria was part of the Eastern empire (Rome was sacked in 410 already). Incense burning was common, not the use of expensive candles. These mistakes could have been easily found and corrected and are a reflection of general historical sloppiness.3. While many of the facts may have been true or at least plausible, they are not put in historical context and this puts a misleading modern slant/interpretation on a period many centuries ago. a. Yes the Christians were a fractious bunch in Alexandria, but as Gibbon so rightly emphasized it was the dogmatic infighting between the sects - arguments about the nature of the trinity that was the real story in this period. - paganism had already had its last gasp in Julian the apostates time. Interestingly enough it was the Greek philosophers tendency to argue about metaphysical things that led to both the heresies and eventually to a solid Christian theology. It is no accident that the old testament was translated to Greek in Alexandria.b. It is implied that the remainder of the great library scrolls were destroyed by the Christians. There is no historical basis for this - the Christians were determined to destroy the remnants of what they considered idol worship (hence the attack on statues) and on cult like rituals (public sacrifice of animals and augury). The educated church hierarchy and monks (Christian Egypt was the start of the monastic movement) were responsible for the preservation of art/culture/learning of the Roman/Greco period. Atila the Hun and the his Gothic predecessors where more interesting in rape/plunder than in the advancement of knowledge. They were the true barbarians not the Christians. Note that the bishop in the movie can read Greek not just speak it. c. The Christians even in turbulent Alexandria often were defenders of the poor and oppressed. They were the ones who provided the only social services available (just like the role of many mosques today). The imperial officials in this period were notorious corrupt and harsh and this prefect was no exception. If you were an Alexandrian female slave being exploited you would go for help from the Christians not the authorities. At least you could flee to a nunnery. Roman law protected widows in theory but in practise the weak were preyed upon by the more powerful. The movie only hints at this. d. The Jews were definitely expelled by the bishop with the tacit support of the secular authorities. A organized pogrom is certainly credible in the time period, and the so called Jewish provocation (stoning) a later self-justifying fiction. However the film does not relate this to the vary serious and successful attempt at mass murder conducted by the pagan authorities with the Greek population's help during the early time of Trajan. A reference to this crucial event could have been easily inserted in one of the dialogues. Of course that would have detracted from the films simplistic and erroneous equation of early Christianity with anti-semitism. In reality it was the Roman and subsequent Byzantine need for rigid religious conformity (whether pagan or orthodox) that led to the violent religious upheavals. That all said the movie is interesting, thought provoking and interesting to watch. Just remember that it tends to put a simplistic modern interpretation on early byzantine history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hagiography of 4th Century Philosopher Scientist held up as corrective to religious fundamentalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Agora, Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar has taken on a subject that has not been done before in the movies: the story of Hypatia, 4th century Alexandrian astronomer-philosopher, a woman way ahead of her time. Little is known about the historical Hypatia so Amenabar also depicts the political situation in Alexandria: the internecine struggle between a besieged Roman pagan culture and ascendant Christians. A fantastic set was constructed on the island of Malta along with digital effects added later on that recreates ancient Alexandria. Coupled with some excellent work on the part of the film's costume designer, the result is an impressive verisimilitude. Quibblers might object to the use of candles and glass windows but as the director points out in a special features DVD interview, there is considerable disagreement amongst historians as to whether those and other materials were in use at that particular period in history.Amenabar's main problem is that his protagonist is for the most part not an active agent in the external arc of the story. It's established early on that she rejects the love interests of both Davus, her soon to be freed slave and convert to Christianity and Orestes, the pagan nobleman who later becomes the prefect of Alexandria. In a scene based on a true story, she hands Orestes (at the beginning of the film, a student of Hypatia), a handkerchief soaked with blood from her menstrual cycle and makes it clear that she has no interest in future sexual relationships. Her interest is furthering her career in philosophy and astronomy. The focus thus is on Hypatia's internal arc, as she struggles to replace Ptolemy's erroneous geocentric conception of the universe with a heliocentric model. Amenabar informs us that he wanted 'Agora' to be, in part, a tribute to astronomy and physics. This is unfortunate because the many scenes that focus on Hypatia totally lack suspense. We KNOW basically that she'll come up with the right answer in regards to her astronomical quandaries, so no matter how many circles are drawn in the sand, the viewer is reminded more of a History Channel documentary than scenes from a flesh and blood drama.In contrast to most Biblical epics, Amendabar turns his Christians into the bad guys and now the Pagans, represented by the rational and humanistic Hypatia, are the enlightened. The Christians become stand-ins for today's fundamentalists. We learn from the DVD documentary that the costume designer based the costumes of the Parabalani (the Christian Brotherhood who are depicted here as bad guy enforcers for the local Patriarch) on the Taliban. Amendabar intentionally has the Christians all dressed in a dark gray and the pagans in white.Amendabar claims that the film is not meant to be anti-Christian and he emphasizes that the violence in the opening scenes is clearly instigated by the pagans. On the other hand, the Christians' rising militancy is ably depicted in the character of Ammonius who challenges a pagan to walk over some burning coals (this supposedly was based on a true story). When the pagan hesitates, the crowd throws him into the fire and he's almost burned to death. Amendabar then awkwardly inserts a scene that's designed to depict the 'good' side of the Christian mission?the soldiers are directed to give bread to the poor. But it's not enough?before you know it, the 'fundamentalist' Christians are throwing Jews out the windows of their apartments (a la Schindler's List) and stoning poor Hypatia to death much in the manner of today's Tablian. Despite his claims to the contrary, Amendabar appears to take some satisfaction in having his Christians get their comeuppance. He even has "Saint" Cyril, the bad guy Alexandrian Patriarch, read an misogynistic passage from the Book of Timothy as a prelude to his order that Hypatia renounce her 'faith'.Given all the sappy pro-Christian Biblical epics we've had to endure over the years, a corrective in the other direction might not be such a bad thing after all. Amendabar has provided a service in depicting true historical events where once oppressed Christians now attain power and become as bad as their former pagan oppressors. But that's really all Amendabar has provided: a history lesson! I think what's missing is some basic character development. Somehow I have the feeling that Cyril was a little more complicated than the sinister Fundamentalist stand-in depicted here.Amendabar fails to rise above hagiography in his telling of the Hypatia story. The short scene where she reminds Davus that he's still a slave during the pagan evacuation of the city is not enough to humanize his protagonist. Amendabar ends up being just as guilty as the Christians he derides when he turns Hypatia into a martyr of western rationalism. Even the 'good' Christians are ineffectual or downright hypocritical. Spineless Orestes falls to his knees in front of Synesius, symbolizing the complete capitulation of the pagan world to Christianity and Synesius can only mumble platitudes about God as he basically condones Hypatia's death sentence.In the end, science and 'reason' are Amendabar's good guys and promoters of 'faith' are the bad guys. The virtually all virtuous Hypatia stands in stark relief to the world's religions which are blamed for the spread of fundamentalism. 4th Century Christians are not only stand-ins for modern day Islamic fundamentalists but the basic tenets of Christianity, based on an anti-Semitic creed, is linked to the horrors of the Holocaust. Even the Jews (albeit seen less culpable here than the Christians and the Muslims) commit atrocities in the name of religion.Amendabar still manages to show restraint in some scenes. Particularly admirable is that he protects his audience from experiencing the full horror of Hypatia's execution (in history she's skinned alive; here, Davus, her former slave, suffocates her in order to prevent her further suffering).Agora is good as a basic history lesson. But its simplistic depiction of the supremacy of reason over religious fundamentalism doesn't ring quite true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but little appeal for non-Christians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caught a preview event last night.First, let me say the production values of this movie are top notch. The casting, cinematography, sound, and editing were all very professional. The acting was top notch. This is not a fly-by-night operation.Now, on to the story. As Christianity gains steam in Roman Egypt toward the end of the fourth century A.D., a young slave (Max Minghella) weighs his desire for freedom against his growing love for his mistress (Rachel Weisz), an atheist as well as a professor of philosophy. Alejandro Amenábar (The Others) directs this epic drama based on the life of Hypatia of Alexandria, a noted Greek scholar and mathematician. Rupert Evans co-stars. Even as a Christian in a theater full of Christians, I was uncomfortable.This is how many people feel around Christians. The writers had a gem here that they could have explored with a skeptical audience. However, it was too little, too late in the movie. People uncomfortable with Jesus and prayer as themes will have already left the movie.I think the movie is not supposed to be so much "seeker friendly" as it is supposed to be a resource for people who are in some way affected by neo-plotinism, etc. That's okay, but it seems the great amount of talent, effort, and money used will ultimately result in a movie that sits on the library shelves of churches across the country.Bottom line: "Agora" is a good movie that I can't recommend to my non-Christian friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Activist/fundamentalist atheist distortion of history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie completely distorts Hypathia and her history, making her into an Atheist (which she was not) and then a martyr for Science and Atheism (which she certainly was not).This is an activist atheist movie dead set on making religion look awful (by making every religious person in it - be it pagan or Christian - to be an intolerant bigoted mindless idiot) and atheism look glorious in comparison (by making Hypathia into a glorious Atheist beacon of scientific light), and promoting clear false history - yes: lies - to do so.Realitycheck: 1. Hypathia was a Neo-Plationist, and those were certainly not atheists. 2. Hypathia's fate was sealed over a political conflict, not a religious one. She was killed for fiercely supporting a *political* opponent of someone who just happened to be a 'Christian', and certainly not for being an 'atheist' or a scientist or for anything remotely religious. 3. The Great Library of Alexandria didn't exist anymore at the time, so it couldn't have been burned down by an angry mob of mindless bigoted Christians.The conclusion of the movie is totally laughable: Hypathia discovers the truth about how the earth moves around the sun, but is then brutally murdered by intolerant Christians for being an atheist questioning 'Christian beliefs' before she can get this glorious discovery out to the world... and so the world had to wait 1000 years longer for this important scientific discovery, only because of these intolerant murderous Christians blablabla. This is utterly ridiculous nonsense, coming from nowhere else then the thick imagination of the - of course atheist - director, just like 90% of the rest of this movie. In reality by far most of the important scientists that did important discoveries in the past were *religious*, not atheists. E.g. Galileo, Newton, Pasteur and even Charles Darwin. And that is exactly why - to not make a total laughing stock of himself - the director had to go back to a history largely unknown to most to find some scientist that was killed by some Christian... to then totally make up she was atheist, and totally make up a story about her life and totally make up a story around her death to glorify atheism and crucify religion, completely rewriting history in the process. Absolutely pathetic.The irony of all this is that by distorting history in this way, and polarizing (religion/atheism) in this way, the movie does exactly that for which it tries to warn: 1. It displays rabbit black/white fundamentalism - atheist fundamentalism this time - without any form of nuance. 2. It clearly draws hard good vs evil lines for the public: atheist = good (intelligent, reasonable etc) vs religious = evil (mindless, bigoted, cruel etc). 3. It does the exact same thing as the Catholic Church (and many other fundamentalists btw) by totally distorting history to create saints and martyrs out of people who didn't even support their views let alone die for the cause they have been bombarded to martyrs of... and by of course dehumanizing the 'enemy' in the process of doing so.This kind of atheism is no better then fundamentalist religion. Or better said: this kind of atheism simply is fundamentalist religion. Too bad an excellent actress like Rachel Weisz lent herself for this kind of ridiculous propaganda. Concluding: Beautiful scenery filming, but worthless piece of trash otherwise. Director: If you want to shove your intolerant fundamentalist atheist believes and world-view down peoples throats, in the future please do so without abusing historic people who had nothing to do with all this for your cause, and without rewriting history into this kind of abomination and then presenting it as 'romatisized reality'. Its just pathetic lies, nothing else. Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-intentioned but excessive historical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A genuinely honest attempt to make the fourth century rise of Christianity entertaining and relevant. This is a handsome film, beautifully designed and shot with Rachel Weisz at its heliocentre (I'm not sure that Amenábar intended that analogy, but it strikes me as a rather elegant one). It's also a bit serious, drenched in melodrama and thick orchestral music like an excess of cinematic MSG.The idea is to give a dramatic context to the rise of Christianity, the fall of Roman multitheism, the marginalisation of Judaism and all the contingent political murkiness that goes with such events. At the centre is Weisz's rationalist teacher. Amenábar manages a good line in discretion - not too much love-interest, not too much hectoring, keeping her back from the rise of the populist cults. Unfortunately he blows it with a single line, Hypatia approaching the senate with the line 'I believe in philosophy!'. I found the support cast a little wooden, particularly as they operated in this rather brow-beaten mien (with the exception of the perpetually sagacious Michael Lonsdale). However, the punchy turn of Ashraf Barhom as the proselytising Ammonnius is worth watching the film for. 4/10</fullReview>

My suspicions were confirmed when watching the actual film - and I had to turn it off about 1/4 of the way through. The acting is atrocious; the characters are lifeless parodies of real individuals; the sets and CGI look patently sterile and fake - in short, there is no evocation of another time, place and people: just present-day people dressed up in costumes and placed amidst structures with columns and pediments. If you enjoy films which transport you to another time period, even if only conjectural, I suspect that, like me, this film will disappoint you.</fullReview>

Anyone who has read anything about the 4th Century will find nothing new here. Ceasar was cheesed off cos the war wasn't going too well - Verdammt! - Christians everywhere! Time for all true pagans to commit suicide, and swear eternal allegiance to the God of Science, etc, etc. Most of the dialog is copied from R. Ilbert's Alexandrie entre deux mondes, second volume.The only interesting thing about this movie is the thought that had the Christians won the war in the last 3 seconds, (and I were now living in a National Socialist state,) someone might have, by now, been granted permission to make an "honest" portrayal of Jesus's last moments on earth - and voil?! This would be that film! More time was spent talking about the humans than actually showing them and I found Maurice Chevalier singing in French with a bunch of kids most distressing.

		<fullReview>Yup, you can watch the fall of Roman knowledge, in the boring, slow as watching paint dry way that it might have happened in.This film takes a historical events, the destruction of the library of Alexandria and the death of the philosopher Hypatia, and turns them into a heavy-handed anti-religious message that even this agnostic found to be a bit over the top. The Christians, lead by St. Cyril of Alexandria, are painted in a shade of black (literally) that makes them look like the Taliban, while Hypatia is portrayed in a way that makes her look truly angelic. Even Avatar didn't engage in this level of one dimensional character development.Now, I have to say, visually this movie is gorgeous. The set direction, the costumes (some of them anachronistic), all look great. But it seems like this is just designed to get you to hate one side and side with the other. The scenes where Hypatia tries to figure out the model of the solar system are tiresome, because we already know what the right answer is... and she looks kind of like a monkey with a gun doing it.Overall, the problem with the movie is that it is slow, slow, slow. Unlike other Toga movies, such as Gladiator, Rome and Spartacus, which kept the action moving at a good pace, this movie bogs down in many places.</fullReview>

Couple that with Rachel Weisz's Hispatia 'discovering' the Earth's elliptical orbit around the Sun (something the Chinese apparently knew about a very long time before her) in a awfully constructed set piece and you lose the point of a film that may have been, had it not been quite so interested in pursuing the religion versus science dichotomy, much better.The acting is fair, the spectacle okay, but I would question any connection between the reality of fourth century Egypt and this movie.

It is about religious zealots who stone women and murder their opponents. I understand how the life of Hypatia was interesting to intellectuals, over the centuries, but in the year 2009 (when Agora was released), if you want to make a movie about murderous religious zealotry, there is only one religion worth the trouble: Islam.

But although the film claims that follow and respect the historical reality of the 400s AD, the film focuses on the denigration of groups of Christians who lived at that time in Alexandria, Egypt. Dramatic vision of the director is clearly designed, Christians are presented as bloodthirsty psychopaths. The film also focuses on a so-called Christians fight for power in Alexandria, presenting it as the most feared enemies of the Romans who remained unconverted to Christianity in Alexandria. Christians are portrayed as inhuman, barbaric, without feelings of compassion, understanding and love. Qualities that are actually the main component of Christianity: to love your neighbor and to forgive those who mistaken.There is no character in the film that has these qualities, by contrast it shows the total opposite.From this point of view I think the film has a bounded vision, obscure,circumscribed and stereotyped on Christianity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie AGORA is full of historical lies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>AGORA, an historical drama set in Alexandria at the turn of the Fifth Century, is an international production in English that distorts history and slanders Christianity by making the church leaders in the city at the time much worse than they really were.The story centers on the female Neo-Platonic pagan philosopher Hypatia who was murdered by a small, angry Christian mob in 415 A.D. because they believed that she was preventing a reconciliation between the Roman mayor, or prefect, and the Bishop, the famous theologian Cyril of Alexandria, also known as the Pope of Alexandria (back then, the Pope of Rome was only considered first among equals). The movie conflates historical details with purely made-up historical fiction that paints the Christians in Alexandria and Cyrus in particular in the worst possible light.The movie opens in 391 A.D. where Hypatia is teaching astronomy to a mixed class of Christians and pagans. One of her slaves is Davus, a young man (a fictional character) who worships Hypatia from afar. Davus is also impressed by the Christian preachers in the marketplace, called the Agora, though the movie paints the ringleader, Ammonius, as a charlatan.The preaching of the Christians upsets the pagans. So, sanctioned by Hypatia's mathematician father, Theon, the young pagans turn into a mob that starts killing Christians in the streets. The Christians start to fight back. By this time in history, their number is larger than the pagans, so, in the movie, they eventually storm the gates of the famous library of ancient writings and the pagan temple nearby. Led by the bishop at the time, Theophilus (Cyril's uncle), the Christians overrun the library and the temple, destroying the pagan statues and the ancient scrolls in the library. By this time, Davus is now one of the Christians. He physically declares his love for Hypatia by taking her in his arms and groping her breasts, but she frees herself from him and leaves.Some years pass, and one of the young pagans, Orestes, is now the Roman mayor of Alexandria. Like Davus, Orestes too loves Hypatia, but Hypatia is obsessed by her astronomical studies.By this time, Davus is part of a group of Christians who defend Christianity and Cyril by persecuting Jews and pagans. The group is led by Ammonius. Orestes, who also has become a Christian, tries to control the passions in the city, but the fighting between the Christian zealots and the Jews causes trouble. Things get worse when the zealots, led by the patriarch Cyril, turn their attention to Hypatia.If Mel Gibson had made a movie like AGORA depicting the Jews like AGORA depicts Cyril and the Christian leaders in Alexandria, the filmmakers of AGORA would call him a hateful Anti-Semite. While it is true that Cyril's uncle did destroy pagan statues in the pagan temple area of Alexandria in 391 A.D., in reality it was Julius Caesar, way back in 47 or 48 B.C., who accidentally burned down the library when he attacked Alexandria in pursuit of Pompey. Thus, by the time this movie takes place, there was no library of ancient Greek texts in Alexandria!!! Furthermore, there is no evidence whatsoever connecting Hypatia to any library in Alexandria at all! In fact, the movie's contention that Hypatia was connected to the famous library is a lie spread by Carl Sagan in his infamous COSMOS program on TV ("The Mysterious Fate of the Great Library of Alexandria," http://www.bede.org.uk/library.htm)! Also, although Cyril did indeed have a harsh rule in comparison to other Christian leaders before and after him, and did indeed expel the Jews out of Alexandria against the wishes of Orestes, there is no solid evidence that he led a murder campaign against the Jews or that he had any role in the murder of Hypatia. In fact, Hypatia's murder apparently was instigated by a minor layman in Cyril's church named Peter. Apparently, Peter and his cohorts thought, wrongly, that Hypatia was preventing Orestes and Cyril from reconciling with one another.The question arises, what was Cyril of Alexandria really like? Some Catholic scholars like Alban Butler tend to view Cyril in a more favorable light than Protestant scholars like Philip Scaff (THE HISTORY OF THE Christian CHURCH) or secular scholars like Edward Gibbon (THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, a book full of slander and lies like this movie, AGORA). In reality, Cyril probably was too harsh in his rule and did not always live according to his faith, but some of his theological works and efforts helped to support some important theological doctrines established by the Bible, the Word of God. That said, it becomes clear in researching the real history that the filmmakers have invented many lies about the history in AGORA so they can depict Cyril and the vast majority of Christians in Alexandria at the time in the worst possible light. The biggest false claim is that the fictional burning down of the library in Alexandria is what led to the so-called Dark Ages, another exaggeration or lie against Christianity that atheists and other Non-Christians like to tell.When it comes down to it, therefore, this well-made movie succumbs to the worst form of propaganda and Anti-Christian bigotry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, this movie has everything or, at least, tells everything about human nature: intellectual curiosity, love feelings, forgiveness, violence, political and religious oppression. All of them (and their complex interrelations) convincingly portrayed in the context of a historical turning point, make a truly classic film with a lot to tell about the conflicts of contemporary time, of every time.Rachel Weisz is more than perfect as Hypatia of Alexandria.Beautiful views of the ancient city. Don't miss the incredible zooms.One of the very few films to effectively express the intimate emotion and awe of scientific discovery.In the theater where I saw this film, the audience was clearly impressed by the movie as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film, it had the perfect balance of drama and intellectualism that stimulates the brain and made you look into your surroundings to see how relevant the things that were in the movie are today concerning religious zealots and the dangers of the mob mentality. Rachel Weisz was stunning as Hypatia, a woman a head of her time and her dilemma was felt heavily though out the movie with her sharp mind and great heart. The sets were amazing and the crisp cinematography was something to behold. Alejandro Amenábar really creates an setting of tension and despair once everything hits the fan and Weisz and her costars really come up to the plate and deliver. See this film in a theater if you can catch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story that must be told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>watched that film in the Toronto Film Festival; I have to say that it is an important story that was never told before. Overall, the movie was good, acting is excellent, and they successfully recreated the city of Alexandria and it was beautiful. It was thought provoking to see how misinterpretation of religion is a mistake that happened throughout the history of mankind. The parallel between the story that took place 1600 years ago and what is happening today is very clear. The story of Hypatia was never told before though her struggle facing the religious fanatics is one that we can identify with. The movie is based on historical facts except for the character of the slave "Davus". I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alejandro Amenábar's worst movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From my point of view this is Alejandro Amenábar's worst movie. The editing is awkward leaving the movie cut in two parts. The first one describes Hypatia's life until the destruction of the Alexandria's Library, while the second one is about the raise of Christian fanaticism that concludes with her murder by a Christian mob. The actors' interpretation is poor in general, Rachel Weisz is a very cold Hypatia, and I was sometimes having the impression I was seeing a remake of Monty Python's Life of Brian. The only thing worth to be mentioned is the beautiful re-creation of Alexandria's Library. As a conclusion, Avoid the film, it's too long, the editing is awkward and the actors do not save it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would that it were better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After four tightly focused, intimately scaled films, Alejandro Amenábar has taken on a wildly ambitious project in "Agora", a historical epic encompassing the destruction of the library at Alexandria; confrontation between pagans, Christians, Jews and one vocal non-believer; themes of intolerance, fanaticism, mob rule, intellectual inquiry and freedom; and a cosmic perspective that expresses itself in the farthest shots possible, i.e., from space. It's a worthy project with fine intentions, but Amenábar has unfortunately jumped in way over his head.There's been lots of criticism of the historical gaffes in the film, but the real problem is that there should be more of them. A film like "Gladiator" works by playing fast and loose with history and creating a strong story and a strong central protagonist to carry us along. Amenábar undoubtedly meant well by centering his story on the historical figure of the philosopher and mathematician Hypatia, a free-thinking woman with no interest in romantic attachments. But in Rachel Weisz's performance she comes off aloof and distant, without a trace of the charm that would allow us to believe three men could be hopelessly smitten with her. Those three men are the real protagonists here, and most of the film's most powerful scenes don't involve Hypatia at all. She's peripheral to most of the action, commenting on it rather than driving it. So the film, for all its admirable advocacy of reason over fanaticism, feels dramatically hollow.This is a shame, because the film has been unfairly pegged as an attack on Christianity. It's true that it shows that religion -- and, importantly, others -- at their worst and most destructive, but it's far more nuanced than a simplistic attack. The three male protagonists all are, or become, Christians over the course of the story, each for a different reason, and the final scene demonstrates, with devastating intensity, one character's realization of the most truly Christian action he can take. The film's plea for tolerance and coexistence, laid out early in Hypatia's classroom, is honorable and coherent, and takes on considerable force as Amenábar shows, in excruciating detail, the spiraling violence resulting from adherents of all three of Alexandria's religious groups taking revenge upon each other.Most pertinent, politically speaking, is the film's portrayal of how the more moderate Christians, those in political and ecclesiastical power, yield to the fanatical, black-robed sect that comes to dominate Alexandria. They're meant to suggest the Taliban, but you could read in any populist, extremist group that's ever been appeased by those who should know better.Hypatia's voyage of scientific discovery, though, is slow going and inevitably obvious. We're almost two millenia ahead of her, so watching her catch up to the heliocentric view of the solar system and the eccentricity of orbits is like watching a replay of a game you've already seen. These discoveries, though theoretically blasphemous, never become the lynch-pin of the plot. Her confrontation scenes with the authorities are too brief to carry the dramatic weight needed to turn her into a Galileo or a Saint Joan of the sciences. Passion is implied in Weisz's performance, but the film doesn't catch us up in her wonder or in any desperate need to protect and disseminate her discoveries. She keeps toiling away in her primitive lab while all hell breaks loose in the streets outside. Guess which place is more interesting.Historical epics create problems for themselves when they try to cleave too closely to what they consider history. But the farther back you go, the less likely you are to find sources that correspond to the painstaking, ostensibly objective discipline of historical inquiry as we know it. The ancient writers (and Gospel-writers) were writing down hearsay and often consciously creating myths. Filmmakers should take a hint. Amenábar's departures from history aren't too many but too few. If he'd gone more shamelessly Hollywood and created a compelling, spirited, witty heroine, and given her suitors a little bit of hope, he might have successfully mythologized Alexandria for our age, and pulled off a sword-and-sandal epic with a refreshingly critical eye toward religion.As it is, he bit off more than he knows how to chew. It doesn't help that the editing is choppy and abrupt, that the music apes the "Gladiator" soundtrack, and that the dialogue, translated from a Spanish script, can't decide whether to sound anachronistically modern or stiltedly "classic." "Agora" has laudable ambitions (and beautiful visuals). Would that it were better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a century of being a daffy playground for Christian propaganda, what better way to start a new millennium than with an atheist epic where it's the Christians doing the persecuting? Answer: plenty of ways. This drama-free zone mangles the story of murdered philosopher Hypatia to get some payback on twenty centuries of Christian outrages but forgets the important details. Story. Character. Facts. Dramatic confrontations. It just plods along as if making Christianity the bad guy is enough. It isn't. You've got to have someone you can root for. Characters you believe. Situations that are dramatic. One big battle at the library but after that it just sleepwalks for an hour before they can kill Hypatia and go home. Nothing memorable happens while we're waiting. She doesn't do much of anything but draw circles and give Ladybird First Science Book lectures about the stars. This film should be full of drama and ideas. It isn't. Two stars for all the spectacle, no stars for the rest. The previous reviewer has the right idea, wait for it to come on the telly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was agonizingly slow and tortuous to behold. On paper it would seem that the retelling of pivotal historical moments such as astronomic developments and early religious clashes would be a safe bet, especially with a promising cast. In actuality it was dull and plodding, the theories being well explained but once this has happened and you watch them all asking each other why no one theory fits for the "n"th time you feel like screaming! Religious conflict is clearly a worthy issue worth exploring in film, however instead of being thought-provoking it becomes mind-numbing. Clearly religious conflict is a relevant issue and patently emotive, however it never moves past "they're all as bad each other" and bastardisation (let's pretend it's a word at this point) of each religion's holy scripts - although, interestingly the more blatantly pugilistic, elitist paganism was cast in the same light as Christianity &amp; Judaism. Just so incredibly hard to watch.</fullReview>

The stonings had me shouting "Jehovah" from my armchair LOL. Agora tries its hardest to take itself seriously, but the whole thing is a shambles. Hammy acting, awful lines, and daft scenarios. As an Atheist I really wanted to see something that pushed the absurdity of religion across, along with the struggle science has had to make down the ages to get by religious fundamentalism. I never really saw that point being made. Yes, we get a repeated mention of proving a heliocentric solar system, and we get to chuckle at the Jews fighting the crazy Christians, (along with people running around the streets stabbing each other - lol again) but apart from that, this junk deserves a straight to DVD filing. Best way to watch it? Have a beer and take it as a comedy (of epic proportions). Next!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another inept Hollywood take on mankind history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start with the good parts.Rachel shines as usual. Not because her character is that interesting in the movie (though it looks like it might be in the beginning) but because her inner usual charisma.She seems bent to seek originality at all costs, though, in the last years. Alas, this one is too "original" for her own good, I think.There is some interesting picture of the city and of the atmosphere of the time. Realistic costumes and scenery. And it pretty much stops there.If you're into fictional stories, historical inaccuracies and misinterpretations which only retain some names but twist the events to the point of even making you laugh, then go for it. I for one, totally regret the time I lost watching it.You'd be better off reading a story about the big bad wolf. There also, everything is black and white but at least nobody's pretending to lecture you about history.Pretty soon after the start it shows the arson which supposedly consumed the famous Library of Alexandria.Except that the great majority of the historians, corroborating all the existent written sources, agree that the fire happened during one of Cesar's comings to Alexandria long before the time of this movie, in a totally different historical context. In fact, centuries before any character in this movie would have been born (sic!).Or at least some extent of time before the period when the action of this movie unfolds.Besides, the Serapeum is considered to have been a smaller, outer, public library, not the main Royal library which hosted apparently between 400.000-700.000 scrolls.Even being a smaller building, the Serapeum is supposed to have held somewhere around 40.000 manuscripts. What they show being burned there is a little more than all my books from the all the 4 high-school years.Furthermore, historians agree (based on historical evidence) that when the temple of Serapis was demolished at the order of emperor Theodosius, in year 391, it didn't contain anymore, since quite long, any books at all.I won't spoil further the pain of watching this bore, as what comes after that, looks way to politically seasoned, flavored and biased to be considered even remotely close to the historical facts.It's a pity, because it could have been good. It ended up just being another twisted and misinterpreted piece of history, the likes of which Hollywood seems to be feeding us ever increasingly in the latest years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A powerful story about love, especially a love triangle. A story about redemption and sin. A portrayal of the dominant inner conflicts caused by personal beliefs and religion. A movie which shows the cruelty, savageness and corruption that was used by the people who covered their bloody acts with the teachings from the bible. A portrayal of the magnitude of mistakes caused by religion and it's wrong usage. People still, act the same way as people did hundreds and thousands of years ago blinded by some invented scriptures, books of gods and ignorant rules. A good and powerful movie about all of these things.The acting in the movie was handled well and on top of that the cinematography was splendid. The movie was cut and edited very well and the score was very well inserted. Another good thing is that this was not slow-paced and it raised many questions. The story itself is accurate so don't worry for "fake-history" in here. (if I think about it... which is accurate and which is not?) I must admin I'm into this kind of movies, historical and religious so this one made a clear statement in my eyes that good and powerful movies still can be done. The problem with this movie is that it is very disturbing and opens discussions about faith and Christianity and since many of us are christians and not just christians but more like "ignorant and blind christians", many will reject the idea of this movie.Anyway I strongly advise people to take this film in consideration because it is a strong movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quality epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a while sine an epic of this quality has been seen, and the new angle is thought-provoking, maybe even offensive to some. Classics such as "Quo Vadis" (1951) lament the fate of early, persecuted Christians. Most recently, "Robin Hood" (2010), through the titular hero's confrontation with King Richard in an early scene, accentuates the cruelty of later Christians under the holy banners of the Crusade. "Agora" gives the audience a glimpse into the transition period where Christians turned from the oppressed to the oppressor.Shot in many (maybe too many) breathtaking satellite views, this movie seems to want to drive home the message of how insignificant human beings are, with all their wisdom and follies, both. The time is the late declining period of the Roman Empire (4th century) and the stage is Alexandra, arguably then the pinnacle of human knowledge - a distinction that can be sustained alone by its awe-inspiring library, if nothing else.Enter the characters. Hypatia (Rachel Weisz) is a revered philosopher who is devoting her entire existence to pursuit of the truth, scientific truth, that is, for she is an atheist, firm in her belief in one and only one true god: reason. As an uncanny reflection of her most favourite subject of study ? the heavenly bodies ? orbiting around her are male students not much younger than herself, of which three have an important role to play in this story. Oreates (Oscar Isaac) the traditional pagan god worshipper and Synesius (Rupert Evans) the newly-concerted Christian are continually engaged in a civilized debate, while taciturn Davus (Max Minghella) is a humble slave. On the emotional front, Oreates declares his love for her openly (literally, in an amphitheatre during the intermission between two acts) and Davus pines in his secret desire. On the political front, scheming bishop Cyril (Sami Samir) and militant fanatic Ammonius (Ashraf Barhom) stir up violence against pagans and then Jews. The presence of the Roman government in her declining days maintains order, barely.Structured very much like a two-act opera, a busy Act I establishes all the themes, elements and ingredients of this movie. Act II unfolds some years later, when Oreates has become the Imperial Prefect of Alexandria as well as a Christian (some suspect a political agenda behind the conversion) while Synesius is now Bishop of Ptolemais. Davus, now a free man, has become Ammonius' follower. Even if this movie is not based on real historical events, the direction it heads towards is predictable. On the macro front, final disintegration of the Roman Empire see even more relentless pursuit of Christians to stamp out non-believers. On the micro front our heroine is hurled towards a culminating confrontation. Her three former students all have a part to play here, but with Hypatia true to her reasoning soul, a tragic end becomes unavoidable.This film helmed by Alejandro Amenabar (The Sea Inside) has received surprisingly little exposure in North America, likely because of its unflattering depiction of Christians in the 4th century. Purely on a technical plane, some critic fault this movie for trying to do too much and be too many things at the same time, thereby ended up losing its focus. While there is some truth in this verdict, Agora should be on any cinema-lover's recommended list for many reasons. The acting is solid all around, particularly Weisz, proving herself to those who questioned if her "Best Supporting" Oscar from "The constant gardener" is deserved. The set of Alexandria is marvellous, helped to some extent by CGI but certainly a lot more solid and real than what it alone can achieve. Being controversial does not take anything away from Agora as an entertaining and informative cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw Agora at Cannes and it didn't do it for me. The movie is at least 45 minutes too long, and i'm afraid that what should be edited out are most of the scenes with Rachel Weisz trying to solve the mysteries of astronomy and it was very contrived. It's all the more unfortunate that Weisz is a good actress, she just isn't believable as Hypatia. The movie revolves around her (no pun intended) but we couldn't care less. It's typically a one-dimensional female role written by 2 men, who otherwise wrote some very interesting male roles (especially Davus &amp; Orestes). Her character doesn't evolve at all. This is unfortunate as the religious battles in Alexandria is a fascinating topic, but it seems to me that Amenabar'a talent got drowned in a sea of sand and a big budget, and that he left the keys in his DP's hands. I'm not sure if this could be salvaged in the editing room, but as it is, i just don't see this movie find a public.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film yesterday and have hardly been able to stop thinking about it since. Hypatia's patient and reasoned approach to questioning Copernicus' belief that the circle was supremely perfect, is thrown throughout the film into stark contrast with the Christians' ever growing stranglehold on silencing anyone whose ideas conflict with their own by whatever convenient argument suits them. Several times throughout the drama Hypatia mentions the sacrifices her devotion to science has led her to make. How her two male suitors are constrained by this introduces elements of a compelling (and possibly unique) variation on the theme of a triangular love relationship. Rachel Weisz's performance gives Hypatia's character a distinctly endearing charm, from her excitement while seeking answers to the philosophical questions of the day to her dignified reaction to the rising tide of ignorance and religious intolerance. All other supporting character parts are equally well performed and the direction struck me as being sincere in its motives and honest in its portrayal of the issues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Historical Drama but Be a good tourist and Read your Guidebook first!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thoroughly entertaining historical drama by a Spanish director set in Alexandria around the end of the fourth century and features a woman named HYPATIA Played by Rachel Weiss who is considered in history to be a scientist, mathematician and philosopher, although in reality, very little fact is really known about her.It is easy to make a comparison of her with Socrates and what happened to him ancient Greece. Although Hypatia is the main featured character in the movie, the movie itself is not really just about her or what she could or would have achieved if she had lived at a different time.this is not a war film nor is it in any way a love story but it graphically shows religious conflict between Christians Jews and pagans and it shows how Hypatia, although probably respected, struggled to make her mark as a woman in society at that time. if she had been a man, would things have been any different.Never mind historical inaccuracies (and there many), enjoy the film for what it is. It is a movie after all and not a documentary and Alexandria and Egpyt are beautifully represented. I do agree with an earlier comment that it seems wrong not to see a single child in any of the scenes, that could do to do with cost and budget, how many extras did they use after all? If you are a tourist to a foreign country, normally you take a guide book or read up first. Essential for this film which throws up lots of historical information at us - hands up who honestly knew anything of the story in the first place and who the hell Hypatia was? I for one did not, so thank you wiki and google for expanding my knowledge on the meaning of AGORA and the identity of HYPATIA.In reality, Hypatia clearly suffered a far more horrific death than is shown in the movie but full credit to the director for his sensitivity and moderation.Hypatia is seen as an ordinary woman with a cause. She does not indulge in a love affair in the film and her virginity is intact is it not? She follows her fathers lead and wants to lead from the front.Not sure if we can make a judgement from the movie whether Hypatia was a martyr to science but it is thought provoking all the same.Introduction of the fictional slave 'Davus' is a curious one but it works well in the movie.the movie will have two distinct audiences - one which wont care about the history itself and will watch it only for the drama - the second who will watch it in a more intellectual way and perhaps be critical at the end because the film does not give the end result they expected. Cant please everybody.discovering the mystery of the universe, religious fanaticism, masterful scenes and cinematography, its all here. Not a great script for dialogue but a memorable movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Agora</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was skeptical at first whether this film would actually make our shores here, given that it sets itself at the junction of early civilization, the waning of the Roman Empire, and the rise of Christianity in Alexandria, Egypt. During the screening, it dawned upon me that this film is most apt and timely in reminding everyone of the need for religious tolerance and harmony, because unless we learn from history, we are going to make the same kind of mistakes and never learn from it, putting ourselves as a people many steps back in terms of progress, given what has already happened here when a religious leader decides to mock another faith.Agora goes back to a time where the Christians were growing in numbers, and a society which are made up of them, the pagan worshippers, and those who follow philosophy, or science for that matter. Starring Rachel Weisz in the lead role of Hypatia, a leading female philosopher who teaches at The Library, a repository of a wealth of knowledge of mankind at the time, hers is the imparting of knowledge to her group of elite students, who one day would take up important leadership roles in future society, while keeping herself busy through the research of astronomy and geography, at a time where the Earth was considered flat and at the centre of the universe. There were many interesting schools of thought which we are likely to chuckle at now, but these make for glimpses of good insights as to how theories and hypotheses get developed, tested and proved.Outside of the school however, is where the action is and toward which the film gravitates as trouble begins to brew, where everyone wears their religion on their sleeves, making callous remarks such as comparing gods, and that "my god is better than your god", the kind of mockery and insults thrown around that is bound to warrant irrational responses, even if they are thrown about today by careless groups seeking to provoke. So when one group decides to take up arms, no thanks to the goading by a religious leader, blind followers of the faith will not resort to peaceful resolution, but one that bays for blood.How mob mentality can take over rational thought easily, and it is well known of the responsibilities that religious leaders should hold, and the clout they have over their followers. This is especially dangerous when false prophets are abound, and their deliberate and measured twisting of scripture interpretation for their own political ends has to be something to be nipped in the bud. But therein lies another challenge to the political masters, the Romans in this case, since they too irk to be seen taking heavy handed measures lest they themselves fall out from their political seats of power when people choose to riot, and that chaos caused by followers would overwhelm their own soldiers, who in turn of course, belong to their respective faiths.And the peril of religious riots cannot be more than emphasized when friends have to turn against friends, slaves against masters, and everything reduced to rubble just because one group decides to wage battle with another, regardless of the cost, which in this case was to put civilization back many years when scientific records and journals were destroyed in the name of being blasphemous. Sometimes I just wonder, whatever happen to good common sense of moral decency, when one preaches to be of a certain faith, but the deeds done run contrary to the message the faith preaches, devoid of love and forgiveness, but replaced with human failings such as hatred and violence.Filmed in Malta with gorgeous sets recreating the space of a time long buried in the annals of history, the film provokes thought on multiple levels, dealing with the likes of religious tolerance, friendship, desire, science through the main characters of Hypatia and those who are orbiting around her centre, such as slave turned moral police-monk Davus (Max Minghella), prefect Orestes (Oscar Isaac) whose love Hypatia once spurned and is put under growing pressure to be bow to the political power wielded by Bishop Cyril (Sami Samir), and Synesius (Rupert Evan), once a student and now Bishop of a neighbouring land brought in to try and neutralize Cyril's powerful clout.Being a period piece you'll soon find yourself absorbed by the tale of bigotry and the dangers of what ambition of a religious leader can do given their personal agendas, if left unchecked to incite hatred and ridicule against non-believers, and worse, violence, which will be a tad too late to try and remedy. The message contained within the film cannot be more applicable in the world of today. Highly recommended must watch film this crowded week, and it goes into my list as essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie with my mom, I didn't want to but she was hoping to see that movie because she heard of all the good reviews. I don't understand why people think this movie is good. But basically here on the IMDb almost every movie is overly overrated.-The screenplay... well there is basically no screenplay because I don't know what the director wants to tell me with this movie. -The dialoques are some of the worst I've experienced on a big screen. -The rhythm: there is no rythim at all. It all goes from one thing to another sometimes you don't even understand where the actors actually are located in space. they go, then they suddenly reapear. -That brings me to the editor who didn't do his job properly in telling the director that he actually screwed it up.My mom and I wanted to leave the theater after twenty minutes. I work in this industry and cinema is going from bad to worse. PLEASE SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY SUCH A GOOD GRADE ON SUCH A STORYTELLING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>proper historical drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies I have seen for a very long time! From the opening shots of an ancient Greek academy right through to the tragic, yet totally fitting conclusion, this movie just builds and builds to create historical cinema gold. I don't want to say too much about the acting, mainly because Rachel Weisz is the only actor in it whose work I am familiar with. But when a plot is as gripping and full of historical information as this is, the acting just seems to happen. It has everything. History, science, romance, fight scenes and even a brief bit of nudity, if that's what floats your boat. But no subject is overdone or incongruous to the plot. The balance between the plot's contending themes is always maintained as is the screen time for the movie's predominant characters. It's the kind of movie where you don't want to talk too much about the plot for fear of spoiling sheer joy of uncovering the story's events with it's characters. GO AND SEE IT!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to Hypatia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some historical characters are forgotten, their stories discarded while that of those responsible for their downfall praised and sanctified by those who have written history. In this exceptional production, Amenabar brings Alexandria back to life: its bustling life, the unique topography, its meltin' pot society and, especially, its religious conflicts. The end of the 4th century, as highlighted in Haas' very interesting "Alexandria in Late Antiquity: Topography and Social Conflict" is a crucial period in the history of Alexandria, Egypt and the Mediterranean. To a certain extent victims of persecution (a false myth of Christian propaganda, there were NOT millions of martyrs but a couple thousand over three centuries), the Christians now represent a major force in the social life of the Mediterranean towns. While Quintus Aurelius Symmachus pleas for the survival of the Altar of Victory in the Roman Senate, on the other side of the Roman world, in Alexandria, the fanaticism of the early Christian religion (exemplified by the charitable, though intolerant, group of the parabalanoi) leads to the destruction of the remnants of the great Library and one of the greatest temples of antiquity, the Serapeion. Among the religious and social parties waging urban warfare upon each other stand the pagan, though neutral, group of philosophers, among whom shines Hypatia, daughter of Theon. Through her friendship and patronage of the Alexandrian authorities she will attempt to build a bridge between the different parties and end the madness and folly of street-fighting in the great city of the Ptolemies. Rachel Weisz shines in this splendid European production, she stands out as the detached and often melancholic philosopher whose involvement in earthly affairs distracts her from her ultimate goals: the quest for reason and truth, the union with the One (in Neo-Platonist terms). She seeks to solve the enigmas of astronomy while outside the battle rages on and the hands are wet with blood of fellow citizens. Around her, her followers and students feel both love and admiration for her, regardless of their religious identity, and a circle of "brothers" is brought together, a token of what the ideal city of Alexandria could represent in Hypatia's eyes. However, she finds in Cyril (later canonised as a Saint) a terrible rival. Erudite, charismatic and belligerent, the young Bishop attempts to exterminate his Pagan and Jewish rival by claiming the right to interpret the Scriptures in his own way and paving the way to controlling the city, defying moral and civil authorities alike. The supporting actors were above average in this exceptional production. Specifically chosen from neighbouring countries (Palestine, Malta etc.), Amenabar succeeds in providing a valid cast, despite the lack of well-known faces and names. For those who know the tragic story, the movie is an unfolding coil of tension leading terribly (despite several excellent and revealing windows on astronomical thought) to the climax of the plot. Without revealing too much, the climax has been modified. The gruesome method that was employed to silence her wisdom forever would have been too much for the common spectator to watch. A final note must be presented concerning the reconstruction of Late Antique Alexandria. As an archaeologist I had a hard time identifying any anachronisms or blatant historical mistakes in this production (some changes have been made, particularly regarding Sinesius) and I must admit that the level of historical detail in the way of architectures, costumes, topography etc. is truly impressive. I know, having been in touch with the producers and the Italian distributors (this is a long story, but we had to campaign for this movie in Italy in order to be entitled to watch it, it will be coming out on the 23rd of April!) that musical instruments were based upon ancient models and craftily manufactured here in Italy (in Walter Maioli's Centro del Suono) and that archaeo-astronomers remapped the sky above Alexandria as it was at the end of the 4th century! Overall, this production was stunning and we must acknowledge the courage of Amenabar and the producers of the movie (who spent over 70 million dollars!) in choosing such a unique story and presenting it to the public. Unfortunately, the story of Hypatia had long been forgotten outside scholarly circles and Agora will allow us all to make up our own minds and further explore the troubled times of the change from Paganism to Christianity (a historical period too often wrapped up in the fairy tales of martyrdom and voluntary conversion!).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story is of the Greek philosopher Hypatia who lived in Alexandria in the 4th century and the crucial political and historical incidents of that era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is superb. Although I had read the story of that woman philosopher and the era in which she lived I was afraid that the topic might be exploited and the facts might be distorted, something rather usual in various other historical films, for commercial reasons. However this does not happen here. The story takes place in Alexandria, Egypt, one of the most famous birthplaces of civilization. The director unfolds the skein of a very crucial era concerning science, civilization and the development of human mind which are persecuted by the brutality of the first Christians. The destruction of the oldest, the richest and the most important library known in that era happens at that time. Amenabar manages to tell the story with great clarity,frugality and a poetic attitude which is enhanced by the acting of Rachel Weisz.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent re-creation of an obscure historical period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For films that have been produced about the ancient world, this is by far one of the best. There are some inaccuracies, of course. Synesius was a student of Hypatia's, and did later become bishop of Cyrene. However, he was pagan-leaning his entire life and only reluctantly accepted the post of bishop after the people of Cyrene begged him to do so. He never fully believed in Christianity, but the film portrays him that way. To answer Mr. Karpoulas- yes, the parabolani are in fact documented. They were originally organized to care for the sick and needy in Alexandria, but they were later used as shock troops against pagans, Jews, and even Christians who followed heretical viewpoints. It is purely speculative to say that Hypatia anticipated not only Copernicus, but Kepler as well! However, Aristarchus DID propose a heliocentric theory in the 3rd century BC. All in all, a great piece of work and well worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Could this film be filled with any more one-dimensional characters? Besides being blindingly dull, or maybe because of it, this is the worst written film in regards to character since Gigli. The clumsy and overt way they were trying to make a statement about intolerance results in nothing but a boring and an actual brain damaged film. The storyline was slight and forgettable, and its sweating hard attempt to act the part of the aggressive yet virgin librarian attempts to make you buy a product that apparently is factually untrue but desperate to make a point. The "holier than thou" sentimental pitch, never worked (pun intended). It would be too inane to believe that the filmmaker actually wants us to go for the bald-faced lies over anything real because it is so intensely told, which is another way of adopting Hollywood's moneymaking code of giving the paying customers whatever they want as long as they do it in a convincing fashion. Well, the performers try hard but there really is nothing to deliver and nothing to this dull film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the darkness begin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is truly interesting, intelligent, well-conceived, and designed to irk a few people, who like the film protagonist states, "can't question the words of some people." Weisz truly inhabits the role as the loving, caring, and intelligent woman who believes in observing, learning, and saving important documents for the future generations, and much later, believes this might just be a more difficult task to carry out.Directed with the same intelligence and complexity he demonstrated in "The Others" and "Sea Inside", "Agora" is loaded with much material that might be too controversial for some. It exposes how dogma is created and manipulated. It tries to balance politics with personal drama, and how sometimes compromises are reached, with the respective parties' personal agendas being more important than faith itself. It also shows how the mobs are desperate to embrace the promise of something better, and how the ruling parties sometimes are ignorant of what's brewing right in front of their faces."Agora" doesn't canonize anyone. It exposes various points of views, and it shows how easy it is for empires to crumble, when the right personality is willing to step in and take chances to manipulate the populace. It is truly scary as we see some intelligent individuals give in, seeing in their eyes, that survival might more important than fighting injustice and pure greed for power, especially when the numbers are skewed. There are a couple of moments in this film when you can't help but shake with anger as injustices are happening in front of us and we can't make a move to correct the situation.Unlike what I have seen in a couple of reviews, I think the performances here are truly interesting and very charismatic, in particular Weisz, as the very intelligent philosopher who can't believe what she is witnessing and never surrenders her integrity, even when she is posed with a very good offer who would have allowed her at least the opportunity to buy some time. The rest of the cast is almost as good, as each man in her life shows a different side of human nature and through their own interpretation and appreciation of her powerful presence, show that she is indeed a remarkable force.In addition to the important themes we see throughout the film, we are dealing with an epic, a film unlike the big spectacles of the 50's and 60's, except this one has very strong foundations, but it's impossible not to be awed by the recreation of a long, lost era, as we see some of the marvels of the ancient world, some truly accurate costumes, and some impressive art direction. Here is a world that has been rendered for us, and it appears alive, real, detached for the classic interpretations done in the past, where we saw too much of contemporary influences in lighting, make up, and costuming. The look of "Agora" is more faithful to the ancient statues, drawings, and mosaics that we find in museums. The research seems to be based at least in various reliable sources, and the marvels of CGI are not getting in the way of the acting and the essence of the film.I hope the film is appreciated and understood, and that we learn a little bit from its depiction of history so that we can't allow the destruction of art, history, knowledge, and the respect that allows civilizations to flourish. "Agora" is really an outstanding piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amenábar's movie is a misshapen anti-Christian delirium which represents an insult to historical facts as well as to believers. If IMDb reviewers where not personally involved (either to support the movie or because they are atheists), this film would have a lower rating and far less reviews. Actually not only the portrayal of Christians is crappy (no historical basis), but it lacks even logic, especially depicting the relations between Christian Romans Jews and Heathens. Some factual mistakes are pointed out in the Goofs' section. The movie is quite boring, the characters are not at all developed, with a partial exception for the maniac woman. Very poor. Some photograph shots has to be saved from the general mess though, but the set's magnificence sometimes collides with pathetic CGI effects, which you could easily find in GoogleEarth too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about the great philosopher Hypatia in the Roman empire, and the rise of Christianity which ultimately affects her society and her fate."Agora" is a beautifully made film. The story naturally draws you to the beauty and intelligence of Hypatia, and this emotional connection is crucial to how engaging "Agora" is. Hypatia is such an expertly crafted character, she is so human, full of intelligence and compassion. It makes me want to know what happens next. Max Minghella shows great promise, as he plays very well a character torn in an unsaid battle between love and faith. It also reminds viewers that there were many unneeded bloodshed and prosecutions. If these repeating history never happened, we would have been in a significantly more advanced and civilised world. I hope "Agora" will reach a wider audience, and gets the attention it deserves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An 'Agora' is a marketplace, an area where people meet and interact: an apt title for a film that covers that little known period when Christianity was emerging as the dominant religious power in Western world. The film is the story of Hypatia, beautifully acted by Rachel Weisz,a philosopher/scientist who in her battle to understand the mechanism of the heavens comes into conflict with a religious orthodoxy that brands her endeavours as witchcraft. Filmed in Malta the lush sets and subtle CGI portray a 4th Century Alexandria of the imagination rather than reality. I always find it amusing that set makers of 'Roman Epics' refuse to paint their buildings and statues in the same gaudy colours as the historical originals. Romans did not live in a world of beige stonework. Nevertheless such historical inaccuracies do not detract from film's compulsive viewing. In many ways the events it portrays have strong resonance today and religious intolerance it seems will never diminish. One also imagines this film as not being on a shortlist of favourites in centres of Christian orthodoxy for this film seriously equates the beginning of Christian political power with civilisation's descent into the Dark Ages. Hypatia's demise is the personification of the extinguishing of the torch of human advancement. A persecution that would continue for more than a millennium.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Movie for Modern Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar's Agora fictionalizes the history of philosopher Hypatia, a woman who lived in 4th century Alexandria, under Roman rule. A free woman, she devotes her life to science and teaching. She's especially interested in understanding the rotation of Earth and the relationship between the Earth and the Sun.But Hypatia lives in troubled times. Christianity is on the rise across the empire now that the Emperor has converted to the Christian faith. No longer outcasts, the Christians now go after the other religions. This puts Hypatia in several complicated situations: as a philosopher, she's constantly questioning the world and seeking new truths and so cannot accept a dogma. As a woman she's also a victim of the holy texts that say that women should be submissive and humble. And finally, as a teacher, she's a counselor for many important people in the government, which means her influence is dangerous. Hypatia gets caught in a game of power between those who have a moderate view of Christianity and those who want to enforce it on everyone, violently if necessary.Like I said at the beginning, this is a fictionalized account. People shouldn't watch this movie expecting a history lesson. Many of the events depicted here are datable as to their authenticity. For instance, the movie portrays the Library of Alexandria being destroyed by an angry mob of Christians. But many other versions exist for the destruction of the library, from Julius Caesar accidentally burning it down to the Muslim invasions centuries after Hypatia's time.This is a version of the history made to resonate with modern times, and it works. The events depicted in the movie can well happen at any moment, from the influence powerful groups can have over society to how easy it is to destroy knowledge, to the fact that in times of crisis people are forced to lead double lives lest what they truly believe in gets them in trouble.The movie itself is a wonder. Technically speaking, I loved every aspect of it: the costumes, the setting, the make-up, the art direction, it brought to life a fascinating Alexandria. Dario Marianelli's score is also very good, with its use of orchestra to highlight the magnificence of the movie.Rachel Weisz' performance as Hypatia shows her as a woman in awe of knowledge; I don't think I've never watched a movie that so beautifully captures the joy of discovering new things, but this is how Weisz plays Hypatia, as a woman who loved discovering and inquiring into the nature of things.The rest of the cast is also good: it's always a pleasure to watch Michael Lonsdale in a movie, that wonderful French actor who starred in so many great movies in the '70s. Max Minghella, Rupert Evans and Oscar Isaac played their roles well too, and Sami Samir and Ashraf Barhom played two great villains, one the manipulative Bishop Cyril, and the other Ammonius, a fanatic who fights, kills and stones people in the name of Christ.As far as 2009 movies go, Agora was one of my favorites, alongside A Prophet and Inglourious Basterds. Watch it as an interesting epic and don't let the bias turn you off, and you'll probably have a great cinematic experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fully agree with luisgmnz. The only thing that puzzled me is why Amenabar did not write the music score himself, since he is a great symphonic composer as well. (Notwithstanding the fact that the music is also wonderful). I am a professional composer/arranger/pianist/jazzist/music educator from Paraguay (you can read my profile at Wikipedia, in Spanish (en espa?ol), Carlos Schvartzman). I am also an avid reader of (besides all music subjects, of course) science, math, medicine and psychiatry and psychology, and had learned about Hipathia some years ago. The story is fascinating not only in terms of this very special and outstanding woman, but also in terms of the introspection she arouses with her ideas, opinions and acts, as well as the introspection and reflexion Amenabar proposes us through his film in terms of tolerance, humanity, human rights, morals, et al. Rachel Weisz is so great she is capable of, her performance-wise, have us love the character and remember her in spite of the outcome (at least for those like me who had already read about her character in history or math and science history books). Alejandro is unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alejandro Amenábar takes on another genre and delivers a masterpiece that's unlike any other film of the genre. It's a courageous and timely piece that reflects on the two millennial of religious fanaticism that has hijacked the attention of the modern world.The story set in 391 A.D., Alexandria, Egypt where the philosopher Hypatia is more concerned about the mysteries of the universe than what's going on the streets where Christians first fight for legitimacy as a religion before clashing with the other major religion, the Judaism to rule the world.Hypatia is a beautiful woman as well with many admirers amongst them her student and her slave. What's refreshing about this film is that its focus is not the love story as most films do but about the bigger picture on where we went wrong as a civilization where we abandoned science and knowledge with the burning of the legendary library of Alexandria for the sake of religion. Now sixteen hundred years later or so, it's the three major religions that keeps the attention of the world while our planet faces its biggest challenge. Also how women were kept away from high level positions in the society for far too long.Rachel Weisz gives an outstanding performance as Hypatia whose intelligence far exceeds her beauty. Max Minghella comes of age as a leading man with a great future ahead of him. An outstanding film in every way that will stand the test of time. YRCinema's coverage of the 62nd Festival de Cannes. It's outrageous that the film has not found a distributer in the US despite the pedigree of its cast and crew and shows how little the studios know of quality films like WB who passed on "Slumdog Millionaire" last year and only look for cash and nothing else. What a shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of Amenabar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I am not a fan of Amenabar. For me it's an overrated director with one interesting movie (Tesis) and a lot of nonsenses. So, it was an incredible surprise when I saw Agora (on a previous screening in Madrid) and it happened to be a good movie. It's true that the use of English in Alexandria is a bit strange and that there are too many zenithal shots (really too many), but the story is incredible. When I heard Amenabar talking about the movie I was a bit afraid because he simply said that it is an homage to astronomy. OK, it is. But it is much more. I guess the director knows it but he is afraid to tell the real story behind the movie: the beginning of Middle Age. Meaning with that the beginning of a dark and long period, controlled by ignorant people, proud to be ignorant. That's something that normally we can't read on History books: religion destroyed art, science, justice and intelligence and everything and substitute them for god, who is much poorer than art, science, justice and intelligence. So, that's Agora about, and I love it. Thanks, Amenabar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a wonderful B movie. But it could easily have been an A movie. There's nothing out there like it devoted to such an interesting age. Christians &amp; Jews set against the pagans in Alexandria, the home of a wonder of the world lighthouse and the greatest library of the ancient world. Of course, no ancient follower of Serapis would have called himself a pagan. The term pagan did actually come into use among Latin speaking people in the 4th century when the movie takes place, but mainly to describe provincials (and later came to mean those so out of it that they still worshipped the ancient pantheon). So the subject matter is scintillating and unique. But there's no Marguerite Yourcenar adding complexity to the screenplay here or even Mary Renault. What at first seems to be a huge leap away from the sword and sandal tradition, actually becomes very formulaic within a few minutes. The heroine is treated as a precocious feminist and that's pretty tired territory. You know early on that the Christians and the Jews, narrow-minded zealots, are pure evil and that the pagans, who hang out at the library like so many overprivileged underachievers are the open minded ones, especially Hypatia nicely embodied by Rachel Weisz. Hypatia is a backseat cosmologist/astronomer and very self satisfied, but desperate for knowledge enough to bounce ideas off her various students and slaves. She's a rationalist determined to understand how the universe works, but, in the end, she's left thrashing in the dark as much as her religious counterparts. Had the writers portrayed the Christians, Jews and pagans with greater balance, it might have been an excellent film. What attracted them to their very different lifestyles and beliefs is never demonstrated. As it is, they are shown as hateful stereotypes, with the pagans paradoxically given the least focus. If the production team went to so much trouble to reproduce this world of 391 AD, they easily could have rendered all 3 ethnicities with greater dimension, thereby making the drama richer and the outcome less predictable. But that's not what happens. You know immediately who the bad guys are and who the saint is. You are asked to love the humanist philosopher. But, unfortunately, Hypatia has too many un-PC moments with the help to endear herself to us and too many opportunities to channel Kate Blanchett as Elizabeth I for us to care too deeply about her fate. The most amazing thing about the film, apart from a few dazzling camera angles, is the casting. Almost everyone has the look of having come to life from an encaustic Fayum mummy portrait. Not an easy challenge to take on in 2010.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is about Hypatia, a philosopher from the 4th century Her mind is on the movement of the planets or wanderers, searching for a simpler representation for her observations. For once, the filmmakers got it right - the geocentric view of the universe is not wrong or less predictive - but it makes the math a lot harder and is far less elegant than a heliocentric model. Searching for simpler models that give insight is precisely what scientists strive to do.Not only is the science accurate but so is the portrayal of the scientist. In fact, it is one of the few good depictions of a scientist (the other being Brundelfly..) that I can think of. We see the obsessive mind set, the detachment from everyday reality, the blindness to all that is going around...Ironically, although Hypatia calls herself a philosopher, both she and her father are not particularly wise, except on the few occasions that they are forced to think about something other than science. That is their downfall and in the end stifles and destroys their research. The ivory tower is an artifice - one can not really isolate oneself from the politics of the world in which one lives. It is indulgent and pointless to know the answer if the barbarians at the gate do not care to hear it.Loved the film, (though the slave subplot was a bit weak...) and the message...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't really care if everything was depicted according to the history. All I saw was a true depiction of emotions and horrific beliefs which represent our human nature. People actually got separated and killed because they expressed their opinions. That was shown perfectly in the movie. I'm glad we live in a much better society now, but even now we can see a very similar behavior in reviews with 1 star for example. And guess who writes those reviews... Anyway, this is the one of those movies which makes you think - People are f**n dumb! Why everyone cannot see that "If two things are equal to a third thing, they are all equal to each other"? "More things unite us than divide us!" It truly hurts when I see someone has been murdered in the name of the murderer's beliefs. Why people cannot see we live on the same planet and we all have a common goal - to explore and survive the harsh conditions of the beautiful universe. Why people are still trying to hold to the imaginary worlds when they can be inspired by the beauty of the reality? But I think we're getting there, and that's because of people like Hypatia.</fullReview>
