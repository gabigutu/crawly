		<shortDescription>It seems critics are missing the point.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS ARE INCLUDED. THIS IS BOTH A REVIEW AND CRITICISM, SO PLOT DETAILS ARE NECESSARY.I find that most people who review this film are hung up on the premise, special effects, gadgets and the many cinematic references. It's my personal opinion that the film uses "artiforg" repossession as a backdrop for the true conflicts, such as the cognitive dissonance we face in certain occupations and/or the desensitization it takes to do our jobs.For example, we know that Remy was in the military, where dehumanization of the enemy is common practice. If an institution can convince its subjects that the enemy is deserving of cruelty, violent acts are subsequently less difficult to perform on another human being. So, it makes perfect sense that an individual like Remy has been socialized into doing his line of work. It's not apparent to Remy how atrocious his occupation is until he starts to recognize 1) his role in the violence and how it affects other people in his life and 2) what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a system that profits on suffering and loss.This, in itself, is a commentary on how corporations profit in our society today. Pharmaceutical companies would be out of business if our society had easily accessible cures for modern infectious diseases. It's necessary for a population to treat symptoms rather than solve a problem at its roots. "Artiforg" sale and repossession is the same thing. Thus, as a gear in the machine, Remy has to decide for himself whether or not his line of work is ethical.That's where the cognitive dissonance comes into play. I think the film did an excellent job of portraying. The metaphor here is are we correct in criticizing corporations while supporting them and working for them (I guess you could say it would be hypocritical then for this movie to be made, mass produced and distributed by a corporation also)? Now, I keep hearing a lot of criticism about the movie once Remy experiences (spoiler) the Neural Net reality (or alternative virtual consciousness) in which he and Beth repo one another, kill Frank, bomb the place and run away to some tropical paradise. All this complaining about the many cinematic references is kind of ridiculous, considering we know that this is Remy dreaming, essentially. Are anyone's dreams completely original all the time? I know a lot of my dreams borrow from movies I've seen. I know a lot of books and movies borrow from other stories, too, which has been the case for centuries. Why is this so criminal now? But anyway, Remy is (in my opinion) experiencing a fantasy while distracted from physical reality. That was the whole point of the Neural Net product in the first place. It's a means of deterring terminally ill people from experiencing painful deaths and/or soothing retired folks in convalescent homes dealing with prolonged loneliness. Remy's subconscious is borrowing from his vicarious experiences. It's quite possible an individual like Remy has seen movies like Old Boy, 2001 Space Odyssey and The Matrix. Why not? Anyway, I think this was a great film with a lot to say and it resonated with me quite well. I think what people look for in movies these days spoils a lot of the major ideas. If you get caught up in "the ending" or working your damnedest through copious Google searching to find blurry images of yet unrevealed movie monsters, you're not enjoying movies anymore. You're beating them to death with a spoiled outlook on plot, cinema and characterization. Repo Men is going to be misunderstood, in my eyes, for a long time because of this. Sorry so many of you let that happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly vapid dystopian flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, I found this movie quite a disappointment. I have a soft spot for sci-fi, and as several others have commented, Jude Law is a good reliable actor in sci-fi roles. But this movie seems awkwardly assembled, not quite thought-out, and a bit too proud of itself to be taken seriously. Throughout the film, at what seem to be important developmental points or even plot twists, there are one-liners tossed out with great sincerity, which in most cases either sound silly, pretentious, intellectually impoverished, or simply misplaced in this film. The first scene of the film, for instance, we are given a summarization of the 'Schroedinger's Cat' experiment, complete with some of the horrible logic underlying the film--- 'if something isn't definably dead or alive, then it must be both'. The fact that this statement shows a misunderstanding of both the scientific and philosophic merit of the experiment isn't the problem, because even incorrect junk science can be a good vehicle in a movie. The problem is that there's no reason to bring this up in the first place. the movie doesn't tackle whether things are dead or alive, whether being comprised of 'rented organs' is an crisis of existential definitions or what have you. The reference is just thrown in there to sound smart, to seem thoughtful, when the film is anything but. And this sort of pseudo intellectual posturing contaminates the movie.The whole film's pace feels quite forced, as well. Jude Law seems underutilized. One can't help but wonder if he got drunk for the majority of the shooting for this film. When his wife leaves him, there's almost no emotion in the scene. When twenty minutes later our hero has decided to dedicate his eternal love to a street girl he finds attractive, there's really no chemistry whatsoever--- but apparently the movie insists that there be a love interest, and so it's just thrown in there, pointlessly. Because even in this day and age, it's apparently impossible to propose a hero character without a token damsel in distress.Then there's the kind of gratuitous and uncomfortable 'surgical sex' scene. It's apparent that whoever choreographed it thought they were being clever, but the whole thing just seems like an attempt to force some sort of correlation between sex and surgical procedures that really just felt misplaced, and kind of heavy-handed. Granted, it has a purpose within the plot, but it's basically a slice of experimental film amid a sci-fi action flick, and like a lot of experiments, it fails.There are some positive points to the film. While Jude Law's acting is a disappointment, Forrest Whittaker delivers a solid role. The action scenes are quite good, and while the overbearing presence of music makes some of it feel like a weird music video, it's nonetheless well-choreographed fighting and slashing. Some of the sets are good, although a fair number of sets and sequences seem blatant rip-offs of 'Brazil' (to say nothing of the ending)...A pretty mindless flick. It's better than watching dust settle on your screen. A prettily-packaged emptiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May Not Be For Everyone, But It Was DEFINITELY For Me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being summarily clobbered by movie-goers and critics alike, REPO MEN will obviously not be for everyone. But it will be a great movie for the right person, and I was obviously one of those "right" people.So who is this movie directed at and why? Well, it's a combination of a smart espionage thriller in a science fiction setting, with a little comedy thrown in for good measure. This might sound like a recipe for disaster, but it is anything but. But is it right for you? That's a tough call. If you're in the medical field and are concerned about healthcare insurance, it will definitely pique your interest. If you enjoyed such films as KILL BILL and BRINGING OUT THE DEAD, this will be right up your alley.So why did I rate the film so high? Let's look at it for a minute...It's topical without being "in your face." It never tells you to believe that private insurance carriers are "bad" and simply shows us a ridiculous possible future where organs are built in factories and everyone who needs a pancreas, a liver, an ear, or whatever, can get one ...for a price. The Union is run by an unscrupulous business man named Frank (Liev Schreiber, DEFIANCE). He's basically a used car salesman trying to get you to sign on the dotted line for organs you desperately need. But make sure you don't miss any payments after you've gotten your new kidney. Why? Because if you don't pay the exorbitant prices and interest rates, your organ will be repossessed. Oh yes, even if it's your heart. How will you survive without it? You won't.Remy (Jude Law, CLOSER) and Jake (Forest Whitaker, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE) are two of these Repo Men and they're very good at their jobs. With surgical precision, they can track and excise overdue organ owners with gory efficiency. But when Remy is forced to get a new heart and begins falling behind on payments, he begins to see the other side of his previous life.This sounds like a pretty straightforward premise. A sort of Darth Vader understanding where his son was coming from plot. And that is only partially true. Jude Law does an excellent job playing a badass with absolutely no conscious about ending a person's life if their delinquent on their bill. He is absolutely believable as a disconnected man only interested in money and being a great contract employee for The Union. This is seen early on when we witness him retrieving a liver in a rapid manner, making a beautiful incision and ripping the organ out. He heads to the previous owner's sink, rinses it off, packs it up, and heads out while stepping over the now probably lifeless man. Impressive. The gore is essential here to show the audience exactly HOW disconnected Remy is from humanity.Jake, his partner, is even further gone than Remy. He enjoys his job so much that he's willing to do anything to anyone in order to ensure he and Remy can keep working together.In the midst of Remy's life is a relationship that's falling apart and a son who is the only thing that keeps him remotely grounded. But when Remy suddenly needs a heart replacement, things rapidly change. You can see the wheels spinning in the back of his head after he returns to work. Would a Repo Man come after him if he failed to pay? What does it mean to have a piece of metal in his chest where his heart used to be? Does this make him less human? Or, in some bizarre way, does it make him more human? These are questions that are left up to the audience to decide.The ending was telegraphed just enough to give it a fun twist without coming out of the blue. I kind of picked up on it after a significant fight sequence, and you might to if you pay attention. It is enough of an "a-ha!" moment that'll make some film watchers gasp.With the current, raw, political climate I think this film was excellently timed to hit the big screen. Think about where our healthcare is going and who you want to control it, and this film will cut into you, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Health Care Bill Gone Wild</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the economic crisis first hit, Clive Owen came out with The International, a film about an evil bank. With the health care crisis now in full swing, Jude Law has come out with Repo Men, a film about evil health care people. Repo Men is good, but seems to have come out a bit early because this seems like a perfect summer film.I cannot remember a time when Jude Law was this much fun. Fresh off a turn as Watson in Guy Ritchie's superb Sherlock Holmes, Law plays Remy, who work for the The Union, a company that supplies artificial body parts. If you can't pay for them, The Union sends Remy and his best mate Jake (Forrest Whitaker) after you. They cut you open and take the parts back. Its a bloody good time for all.Law is such a badass in this film. You would think a role like this would go to Jason Statham, but a renowned actor like Law, who really isn't used to being the badass, plays the part very well. With the amount of blood and violence and quick takes, you would think this flick was made by the Neveldine/Taylor duo. First time director Miguel Sapochnik does the film well, but you'd like to see what an experienced director could do with it.While Repo Men falls short with some of its blood for the sake of blood scenes and some acting shortcomings (Forrest is good but has too little to do), it makes up for it with Law and its twist ending. Go catch Repo Men. You'll rip your heart out if you don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A butchered premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like Repo Men are those that take interesting, even fascinating, premises and butcher them to the point of disfigurement; a bland cookie- cutter version of how the plot could have unravelled. In addition to the obvious plot arc that can easily be surmised from the trailers, any good will built up over the running time is similarly bastardized by a horrendous final twist that is not only nonsensical but cheap. This reveal is not only blatantly alluded to early on but even for those who did not pick up on it will not be surprised by the finale. In yet another paint-by-numbers dystopian future where highly advanced artificial organs are now a reality, we follow two repo men by the names of Remy (Jude Law) and Jake (Forest Whitaker) whose task it is to reclaim said organs from customers who have fallen behind on payments. They gleefully extract hearts, livers, kidneys, etc leaving their former customers on the wrong side of alive. Yet, after an on the job accident leaves Remy himself with an 'artiforg', as they are called, and subsequently is unable to make payments he goes on the run. With the help of a woman who is nearly all 'fake' so to speak (it is eye-rolling developments like this that make up Repo Men) he tries to bring down his former employer with Jake hot on his trail. Thank goodness at the center of it all we get three solid performances from Jude Law and Forest Whitaker as the titular repo men, and Liev Schreiber as their morally defunct boss. Without this trio to ground the movie in some realm of watchability this could have been an unmitigated disaster instead of just a near-disaster. The gore is ample in Repo Men but it appears in all the wrong places. Instead of using the violent repossessions as tentpole instances of shock, they pepper the story with such frequency, everything becomes white-washed (or should I say red- washed) and muted in effectiveness. I will admit, there are some well choreographed, badass action sequences but they can do little to lift the remaining material. Even with these kinetic bursts, the characters at the center are all so unlikable, whether they live or die becomes moot. Are we truly supposed to root for a murderer just because he had a moral epiphany and who in addition cheats on his wife after she condemns his job and then proceeds to abandon her and his son? All this is loosely strung together by a bland and sporadic voice-over which serves no discernible purpose. There are so many unanswered questions floating around Repo Men. What has happened to lead up to this future? What is government like to give this company absolute power to slaughter countless people? And where is the money in selling organs to those who cannot pay anyways? It is questions like these and more that leave Repo Men a vapid and unmemorable vision of the future with little to say about much of anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent premise requires suspension of beliefs though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the future, a lot of people seem to need organ replacements. Why? The movie asks questions regarding ethics. We may not yet live in the futuristic setting of the movie but we already have similar ethical concerns to answer.Is it right for heart surgeons to recommend surgeries that the doctors KNOW are only band-aid solutions? Is it right for financial advisers/stock brokers to charge you money for performing worse than the market's mindless index funds? Is it right to knowingly sell overpriced crap? A job is not just a job. I thought the premise was excellent. However, there were many strange direction choices and nonsensical events that maimed its brilliance. This is a far better movie than the 6.4 (as of July 2010) suggests. Definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, being a fan of action and mediocre movies in general, i was pumped when i saw the previews for this movie. The film was not quite what i was expecting but was pretty much all i could have hoped for. I knew nothing of the book it was based on going in so i really cant comment on how it compares to the movie. the story was good with great action scenes and at times just plain brutal. this is much more a guy movie than anything else. Go see it, it was really good. The star rating does this film a terrible injustice, this is one of the few times i completely disagree with IMDb. This movie is action packed and extremely entertaining, take it as nothing more than that....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pay very close attention - it is worth it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, Repo Men is both extremely good and bad. Even I didn't enjoy the movie on several occasion, mostly because of the extremely graphic display of gore and violence. But why is it so good? The ending turned the movie into a masterpiece. I was stunned that such a micro-twist could radically change my opinion. But it isn't how complex the twist was, it is how the viewer's perception of the second-half of the storyline changed. And that was a big change.The movie doesn't present itself as a psycho thriller, but as an action-flick. You might end up going in with the wrong expectations. Don't be mistaken - if your a fan of action you will definitely get your share, but it might leave you confused. It takes a little more work to understand the motivation behind Jude Law's character and how he tries to redeem himself, more than the average Joe is willing to provide. Now if your a fan of Inception (I can't really say I am), a movie that is pseudo complex and artificially deep with stunning visuals (of course?!), you won't get the benefit out of Repo Men. But if you are a fan of philosophy and human nature you should be willing to give this movie a try. All actors preform very well, I just think that a little British accent shouldn't throw you off too far.I'll recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repo Men Gets a Bad Rep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie with my wife, and quite frankly I bought this movie because of the two actors. This movie could have been about paints that dries and I still would have bought it, but since it was science fiction I could not resit.I liked this movie because it allowed me to think of the ending and the details of the ending. When a movie ends with a typical ending I say, "nice movie, next". So I read the reviews and have to say they completely missed the point, and maybe they missed the point of SciFi, which is unfortunate. So let me address some of the points made:1) Too much gore to the point that it all becomes muted. Well guess what that was the point of the movie. Imagine being a repo man, how would you be with respect to leaving people to die? You have to have a certain amount distance and muted feelings. Like Jude says when he talks about the serial killer. The first is the hardest and takes the longest. Thus the first gore is the hardest and the longest, but as the gore picks up you become muted.2) Believing the epiphany is not hard because the stage was set correctly. Namely up to this point he was always with his friend who had no problems with his job. But if you shake the basic premise then everything else must be questioned and since his wife left him (not the other way around) he had to question everything and he came to a new conclusion. Namely he understood that people were not numbers that could not pay.3) The plot and arc is not obvious. I watch lots and lots of movies and can guess most movies. But this one was harder. Yes I knew that the neural net had to get their somewhere, but how was the question.4) Naive ending and too easily brushed over the details. Well guess what another brilliant move because while we don't know it, he is dreaming. And when we dream we see the world like we want to see it. We want to brush over the details. We want to avoid the truth.In the end I REALLY did like the movie and it kept me wondering...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not looking for a moral message in this movie, instead I sat down and enjoyed it whole. Yes, there were certain illogical bits, the plot was simple and the whole turn at the end an old trick. But to be honest, it worked perfectly for me. I did not expect the end and it totally fixed the feeling of another "mandatory happyend" I was getting during the last 10 minutes of the movie.The action sequences were great. The bloody erotic scene behind the pink door was original and I almost had to look away. Definitely not recommended if you have weaker stomach.Jude Law was excellent even though I think less violence suits him better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory sci-fi with an obvious message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most important parts of any science fiction movie is creating a world with internal logic: it doesn't necessarily have to seem extremely realistic in all aspects but there has to be something to build on that is at least semi-plausible. I suppose the people who made Repo Men thought that they could do this by keeping most of the details close to the world we live in: there aren't that many flashy, futuristic gadgets in this film. The problem is that there aren't enough incredible things here to distract from the absurdity of a future in which "repo men" are able to break into people's houses and repossess their artificial vital organs on site, more often than not ending the lives of their deadbeat customers, without any kind of witnesses or evident due process.I suppose the film is meant to have some type of political meaning about a society in which banks lend people money on terms that can't realistically be repaid and a government which doesn't offer its citizens basic healthcare benefits but these obvious points generally are ignored in favor of off the wall action sequences with tons of gore. There's one scene where a couple of repo men (played by two actors who deserve better, Jude Law and Forrest Whitaker) find a "nest" of people attempting to flee the country with their unpaid for organs and proceed to violently slaughter what must be at least a couple of dozen people with a variety of (mostly bladed) weapons then cheerfully argue over which man deserves credit for a shared kill.The increasingly unrealistic action scenes became less and less entertaining as they went on, as did the equally unrealistic and clichéd plot. By the time the film's bloody denouement ended with a character doing something that should have been done much earlier I had long since ceased caring about the film, which made the last twist seem even more superfluous than it did in the hundreds of movies I'd already seen it in.</fullReview>

I am not normally a watcher of horror or graphic movies, but this one definitely kept me interested.

		<fullReview>O.k., so scientist are light years away from inventing artificial liver, kidney and heart organs which can duplicate the biological functions of the organic ones which we were born with. Other than that, the subject matter contained in this film isn't as far-fetched. Here in the U.S. the debate over health care reform continues to rage as to whether Americans should do away with our ineffective medicare system by adopting universal health care. The one that is currently in place favors malpractice lawyers, questionable medical billing practices and health insurance administrators, which drive up health care costs. Human trafficking, of which black-market organ trafficking capitalizes on the organ donor crisis, continues on the uptick, even here in North America. According to Repo Men, artificial organs cost as much as a house. And many of us are all too familiar with the bursting of the housing market bubble which led to the housing market meltdown and widespread foreclosures and mortgage defaults. During the greatest recession since The Great Depression, with mounting job losses, many families simply could not keep up with their mortgage payments echoing the inability many had with keeping up with organ payments as depicted in this movie. This film even appears to hint at the governments lack of regulation and laissez faire approach to handling the unethical practices of some of the largest corporations in the world. Throw in some violence, drug addiction as well as the scarcity of well paying jobs and we have a pretty good description of the problems which plague us now, and by the looks of things, the challenges that will continually confront us in the future.One of the strengths of this film was that it charged out of the starting gate and immediately commanded my attention. The beginning scenes had the atmospheric feel of sci-fi flicks such as Blade Runner, Minority Report and Total Recall. Unfortunately, it could not maintain this intensity for the entirety of the movie and would end up in Existenz territory, which isn't all that shabby either. But still, in my opinion this film underachieved if you were to factor in the talent of the lead actors as well as the intriguing storyline. Here you have a reversal of fortune premise where the hunter, after experiencing a bit of misfortune, becomes the hunted. So without question there should have been much more suspense and excitement as Remy runs for his life from landlords who are commissioned to take back his artificial heart. And having friends with ulterior motives such as Jake, who needs enemies? Jake was the one who threw a monkey-wrench into the whole situation by rigging the heart defibrillator which Remy was using on his last overdue client which nearly killed him and required him to accept an artificial heart so that he would be indebted to The Union, and thus be forced to continue being Frank's partner. Instead of edge-of-your-seat thrills, moviegoers are left with gore in the form of shootings, stabbings, and surgical incisions. At least I was pleasantly surprised with the plot twist which occurred half way through the film, yet wasn't revealed until near the conclusion, where we learn of Remy's brain being interfaced to a neural network. So in hindsight we would discover that from the midway point, the entire plot revolved around Remy's dreams. This explained why the last scenes were so over-the-top, although the first half had its share of outrageous scenes as well. For example, having a 9-year-old black market surgeon operating on me, because younger ones are said to have steadier hands, is unacceptable in my book. The do-it-yourself surgeries which Remy and Beth perform on each other without the aid of anesthesia are likewise beyond the realm of reality. During the final scene we come back to reality as Frank is pitching his latest and greatest technological breakthrough which will assist brain damaged patients such as Remy. So the ending was just as dark as the rest of the film. No, Remy did not defeat the amoral execs of The Union, nor was he able to retire to a tropical island retreat. His life, from here on out, is just a dream, while amoral businessmen such as Frank continue to exploit the system. Henceforth, the moral of the story is to take good care of your health--for even if full-functioning synthetic organs become readily available in the not so distant future--it could very well end up costing you your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nonsensical world and a botched attempt at social commentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men could have been a really cool cyberpunk type movie, but it wasn't. Think Bladerunner but not as gritty, intelligent, or good. Jude Law and Forrest Whittaker play a pair of repo men that work for an evil corporation that manufactures and distributes artificial human organs. When people fall behind on their payments the repo men come to take the organs back. I don't really understand the business model being used in this movie. The organs cost in the neighborhood of $600,000 and the interest rate on the loan of the organ is 19.95%. The salesman have a variety of payment plans available for a variety of lifestyles should you not be able to afford to buy the organ up front. Throughout the movie organs are repossessed from alcoholics, drug addicts, criminals, the homeless, and just about everyone else you wouldn't give a loan or an organ to. Sure the corporation just hunts them down and takes back their organs, but why did they give them out in the first place? It turns out that they do that because if they didn't Jude Law and Forrest Whittaker wouldn't have anything to do and the movie would resemble the Maytag repairman commercials. Anyway, things are going poorly for Jude Law because his wife has problems with her husband going out an effectively murdering people. Law decides to give up the repo business after one last job. Unfortunately for Law he suffers an accident that damages his heart and he has to get an artificial one. After recovering he no longer looks at things the same and can no longer carve people up for a living. As a result Law falls behind on his payments and his heart is ordered to be reclaimed.The movie doesn't do a very good job establishing why the company can just go out and hack people up, or why nobody seems interested in stopping them when they are. I guess the audience is just supposed to assume the corporation controls everything. With the high body count that Law and Whittaker rack up, just in the first half hour, it's a wonder that anyone is left alive at all, nobody seems to be paying for their organs. The public at large seems to be oblivious to this fact because all it takes is a few soothing words from the sales rep and they all sign on the dotted line. The big problem with Repo Men is that it simply isn't very believable and the movie makes very little effort to make it so.</fullReview>

Miss a payment and you are given a window of up to 3 months to get even. Make it past 96 days and you are flagged for repossession, at this point you had better pray that Remy (Jude Law) or Jake (Forest Whitaker) are not sent after you.Repo Men is a dark sci-fi thriller about a gifted Repo Man who goes from being a top hunter to being hunted. It is a psychological mind freak thrown into a neo-futuristic setting with decorations of blood, guts and gore to keep you uncomfortable throughout the entire ordeal. It paces well, and the acting talents of Jude Law and Forest Whitaker keep you interested. It is disgusting, Repo Men reach into freshly cut wounds in order to extract mechanical livers, kidneys, hearts, and even an esophagus. It is sexy, Beth (Alice Braga) is fire in the arms of Remy, she's a tough beauty, she has a gorgeous smile and the chemistry between the two makes you root for them. It is unpredictable, just when you think you have it figured out as another cliché whatever, it flips a switch and leaves you wondering at what point did things change from fantasy to reality ? or vice versa. Repo Men is a Sci Fi masterpiece.Plot Summary of Repo Men When childhood friends turned military brothers for life Remy and Jake take to repoing, it becomes a lifestyle that they have mastered. A job is just a job is the motto they parrot as they casually taze and slice open overdue organ holders to turn in to the Union ? headed by Frank (Live Schreiber) for payment via "pink slips". Remy's wife has a hard time dealing with the dangers and immorality of his job and threatens to leave if he doesn't take a job in sales. This puts him in a place of indecision as he ponders on giving up a career that he has grown to love alongside his friend. When Remy decides to take on one last job before changing positions to save his marriage, he is injured badly and awakes to an artificial heart beating inside his chest. Knowing that he is now under the same harsh law that he had exacted on hundreds of other people, he tries to return to repo and realizes that he has lost his nerve. In a fight against time, Remy is forced to make a decision on his life, can he ever cut someone open again, or can he manage to successfully run and hide from the Union.There is a moment in the film where Remy goes in to collect an expired heart from T-Bone (RZA). T-Bone is a recording artist that Remy has been a fan of for years. He is polite and welcomes Remy into his studio as he works on what he assumes will be his final track. Surrendering to the inevitable, T-Bone asks Remy if he could finish the song and even asks him to assist in the recording. The two sit and talk like old friends until the song is finished and placed on a thumb drive to which T-Bone hands it to Remy. He then asks which position would be best for him to be in when Remy takes his heart. It is a surreal take on the separation of business from emotion with these men. For me it was one of the better back and forths in the entire movie.I was pleasantly surprised by Repo Men, the twists and turns, the Sci-Fi element and the love that comes about between Remy and Beth. It's a movie that will no doubt catch many of you off guard with it's plot and director Miguel Sapochnik knocked it out of the park. Were I to change anything outside of the awesome soundtrack and everything that I have been propping in this review, it would be the cinematography. While I can appreciate the difficulty in conveying a futuristic landscape in a familiar urban setting, it was not as convincing as I would have hoped it to be. Still this is crumbs, mere pebbles of gripe for an outstanding movie. Repo Men is spicy, it is hot, and you need to check it out as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The idea for Repo Men seems to be based on a Monty Python sketch from their film "The Meaning Of Life (1983). This may not be true but the similarities are so great that Repo Men even shows a clip from the infamous Python sketch. The central premise of repossessions of Corporate owned body parts is a good one but the realisation of this plausible idea is ridiculous. Carving people up in homes, streets and taxis with butcher knives is not an ideal method of retrieval. It is a joke as ridiculous as Mr. Creosote.The film does not create anything that could be seen as a convincing world. The Special Effect Matte shots of modern sprawling cityscapes do not match the familiar production design and locations that surround the actors. Nearly midway into the film, the "director" has still not found his own style and plagiarises sequences and shots from better movies and more talented Directors. One sequence in particular is a direct copy of an action sequence in Oldboy (2003). This is then followed by a shot of Whitaker that is framed and cribbed directly from The Shining (1980). Originality? Hell, this is Hollywood!!!The casting is less than convincing. Forrest Whitaker and Jude Law's characters are supposed to be childhood school buddies yet one speaks with a mock cockney English accent. Why?I for one do not see any talent in Jude Law. He is not a particularly good actor and as has been proved in the past his command of different accents is rudimentary.The level of gore in Repo Men is gratuitous, unconvincing and solely a diversionary tactic. The desensitised "director" uses gore for the hell of it. Humans are claret spraying nothings. This is no Audition (1999) or Ichi the Killer (2001) where the violence and gore is shocking, thought provoking, of narrative importance and visually remarkable. Even the original Monty Python sketch has greater shock value than Repo Men.If this is what Hollywood has to offer the public then it is clear that moral malleability and a total lack of imagination is epidemic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great analogy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a great analogy between what happened due to "the innovations" in the financial world. Example: "Sure you need to buy this house and sign for the mortgage ... you owe it to yourself ... you owe it to your family" ... And a couple of years later they take away your house and leave you with a great debt that also ruins your life and may even cost your life. More and more people are not able to cope anymore and commit suicide and sometimes even kill their own young children to "spare them". The people that come to collect or sell your stuff can be compared with the repo man. They can do it, until they're a victim themselves ... What I didn't like about this representation of how the system has become way more important than what is was for ... is the amount of blood. Still, it makes it all the more horribly and painfully clear what we're dealing with here ... What I liked about the story, is how it's presented that the bond between two people ain't all that clear. It was astounding to find out how it finally turns out what Jake has arranged for Remy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to like this film, I really did, but the whole premise of the film was so skewed from any possible reality where the events in this film could occur that I couldn't suspend my disbelief for 5 seconds nevermind the whole film.In some future, where the USA medical system is even more f***ed than it is today, people can buy/rent/lease replacement body organs. If you rent/lease then you have to keep up with the payments otherwise the Repo men will come and take the 'spare' parts back. I can live with that idea.Where things start to go wrong is that the Repo men are allowed to kill you to get the parts back. Pardon? As a Repo man you can commit legal murder just to get a mechanical liver back? Really? I doubt it.Then Jude Law, Repo man, has an accident where a portable defibrillator wrecks his heart and he gets a mechanical replacement from the company he works with. Inevitably he falls behind on the payments and he becomes one of the hunted. However, the heart damage is caused by faulty equipment, supplied by the company he worked for, so surely the equipment manufacturer or the employer would have paid for the heart replacement. If you're going to extrapolate modern society into a future where you can rent/lease spare parts and have them repossessed, then surely you wouldn't agree to take on a spare part if you couldn't find someone else to pat for it.Once you start to question the setup of the future society more and more unlikely rules/laws intrude to ruin watching the film - such as not being allowed to fly out of the country with a rented/leased body part. Really? You get scanned at all points of exit to stop you fleeing with your stolen or overdue parts. It just doesn't make sense.There just isn't enough logical consistency to this film to allow the plot, such as it is, to unfold before you. You could try and keep watching it in a completely detached manner, but then what is the point of that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just one question. Who is paying for the Neural Net???? Why does this matter? Because there are only two possible answers and both result in a massive contradiction of character and plot. Let's start with the logical assumption that whatever the cost for the Neural Net, it isn't negligible. Now either the Forest Whitaker character decided for himself to foot the bill (having never offered to help with payments for the heart) or he has done so on behalf of the company they work for. In either case, this is a direct contradiction of the philosophy expressed by both that you can put a price on the extension of life and if one fails to meet that agreed to price, one's life is justifiably forfeit. In essence then the Jude Law character has been told "if you refuse to pay for your organ we are going to connect you to this other device of ours but for THAT we will absorb the cost."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fantastic premise, and an up-for-it cast... and a little too familiar all at once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Repo Men- not to be confused with another Universal Studios production, Repo Man, from the 1980's- one may want to jump right away to a reference point in recent memory. In the shallow scheme of things, one isn't completely wrong in comparing Repo Men to Repo: The Genetic Opera. Both films feature a character who works for a company in some un-timed future in an un-named city, and the job is to repossess a person's particular organ if it's not paid up by the company that provided it. Except that's really where it ends (at least, as far as I can recall with the Genetic Opera, which has its cult but is just beyond me how it's even watchable, but I digress). First point for not being the Genetic Opera then.With Repo Men, it's solidly footed in science fiction, where the main Repo Man in question, played by Jude Law, is content with his lot in life, and kind of enjoys what he does as a bounty hunter, along with childhood friend Forest Whitaker's character. But a hiccup happens when Remy gets electro-shocked on the job with a defribilator. He's given a 'new' heart by the company he works for, and finds that a) he can't seem to get the same repossession mojo working for him (he starts imagining silly things like the man's wife and kids he's slicing into), and, therefore, b) he can't get the money he needs to pay the monthly payments for his ridiculously priced heart. You'd think a company like that would offer some health insurance benefits, though it goes without saying in this future- a likely and frighteningly Orwellian progression into corporate health business- that's part of the irony.From here the story takes us into the realm of what is very expected- of the hero meeting up with a similarly afflicted woman (Alice Braga), and the two have to get themselves un-repo'd at the main headquarters, or find some safe haven overseas, or both. More-so the first one, but this comes after what is an otherwise interesting, if not amazing, science fiction story. While the movie is based on a book, and also written as a script, by Eric Garcia, I was reminded of possibly coming across a Philip K. Dick short story (and not just because of the Blade Runner visual scheme, though that's a VERY obvious connection). We get people who work in a future society, and its as much about personalities, how they're shaped in such a repressed but accepted world, as is the technology and the rules. And yet even with this I hoped the makers would have gone a little further early in the film (for example, why is it only Law and Whitaker go after scumbag guys who don't pay up, why not, for a more provocative example, a middle aged woman or someone more fragile, more vulnerable and recognizable than a common whatever).But this isn't really where the film goes wrong exactly. And it's hard to pinpoint because it's not the kind that goes off a cliff or anything at a specific point. It's like the makers still keep putting some interesting things on screen, the conflict between Remy and his former friend, and his developing bond with the woman (his wife and kid are almost left by the wayside - almost as in I'd rather not think about how they're brought back in the third act), but something just feels... off a lot of the time. The actors, primarily its stars Law and Whitaker, gives their all in their characters, and Liev Schrieber has some fun in his few minutes on screen as the quasi-boss at the branch of the company. But so much of the film, for all of its ideas questioning a society that could do this to people, feels 'cribbed', taken from parts (if you'll forgive the analogy) of the body of other movies. Indeed I have to put a spoiler here just to make note of the fact that the last act of the film, whether it's intentionally doing it or not, rips off Brazil's final act so blatantly Gilliam should give a loud WTF to the makers.I'm sure there's a lot of great things in the original book by Garcia, and Miguel Sapochnik, in his feature directorial debut, has some fun with his very visual world (look at that white room Law and Braga enter into with all of the workers lined up!) It's also, for all of its clever touches and thought provocation, derivative and not particularly exciting when it comes to the action - even in that warped last act. I wouldn't mind the 'cribbing' and taking from various films, both from the look and specific references (hammer used in fight against baddies in a long hallway scene, Oldboy much), if at least something really fresh were brought to the table. Sadly, it's at best a Saturday matinée, not the Matrix.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The biggest problem for me is that very few people would agree to this, because very few people could afford it... You can't make the payments? You're dead. You don't get a new organ? You're dead. Either way, you're dead! Now how would you rather die? Naturally, or hunted down and carved open? I think most people would choose the former. The people who could afford it would never need to see the repo men... but the people who are too poor would never take such a risk, to begin with!This could have been a really good movie if they had just made the price tantalisingly out of range, tempting people to make the gamble... Instead, they had to ruin a decent idea by over- exaggerating EVERYTHING to the point where it's too laughable to make a decent dilemma.It's entertaining in a ridiculous way - but thought provoking sci- fi, this is not!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Repo Men' is about two men employed at 'The Union' in the future, who repossess organs from civilians who have defaulted payments for the purchased organs. Things get complicated after an accident, when a repo man's heart is replaced with a Union issue Jarvik-39 Organ.The concept is really cool. The first half hour gives an insight into the brutality of the job, and the ease with which they execute repossessions. The second half shows the repercussions of the protagonist's violent actions, and the third act is redemption.But nothing will prepare you for the end. You have to watch it till the finish to appreciate the ingenuity of the screenplay, which is of no less caliber than Christopher Nolan's works. My jaw dropped when I saw 'The Descent'. The ending truly made the movie worth watching. 'Repo Men' has an equally twisted, shocking finale, which was absolutely unexpected.I was not a fan of Jude Law, until I saw his recent act in the movie 'Side Effects', which too was excellent, and so was he. I was an instant fan. Liev Schreiber is superb as always &amp; Forrest Whitaker's performance was excellent. I've always believed Liev Schrieber, Gary Sinise &amp; Sam Neil to be outstanding actors in the sci-fi and thriller department. They have great depth in their performances.This movie is a violent, gripping thriller from start to finish. No award winning performances here, but a very well made futuristic action thriller &amp; entertainer, and one of the best thrillers I have seen. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think something is missing in this movie,and this probably have something to do with adaptation incompatibility. Because sometimes a book have so many ideas,that to make a adaptation to cinema is just a impossible work. Its not possible to convert every single line of a book to a movie that have a standard 3 hours limit to tell a history. Sometimes a "lack of space to tell the story" happens. And i thought this happened with Ren.I do like movies in this cyberpunk style, the matrix for example is a great movie,however the matrix isn't a adaptation of a book or something,so the "lack of space to tell the story" isn't a trouble,obviously. Conclusion: this movie isn't so great as the book is, but still enjoyable. And the overall story is really cool,but some flaws in this movie are just unforgivable for me, and this fact really annoyed me, so 7 of 10 stars is fair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sandbox Film Experiment With Many Borrowed Film Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found nothing but copied aspects from other films. This movie was a collective mix of Logan's Run, Brazil, Minority Report, Total Recall and others. The association's are too frequent to be a coincidence. There was also some relation to Star Wars woven into the film when Forrest Whitaker's character is fighting in the nest and says "join the dark side" while holding a stun baton and the scene when Jude Law's character is sleeping, it's like he is trying to escape stormtroopers as you can hear blaster rifles right before he wakes up. When Jude first drives home and talks to his wife, there is this distinct James Bond music theme and atmosphere. It's like "Repomen" was just a sandbox experiment for the filmmakers to play around with. As such, it was rather disappointing and humorous for me to say the least. If anything, I felt a little insulted watching this film. It had so much going for it and I really started to enjoy the first half. I found many technological flaws with it from the beginning. As most science fiction films go, these are issues many of us sci-fi fans will "overlook" to ultimately take in the illustration of what the script writer is trying to convey. With that said, there comes a certain quality level in which even the most passive of sci-fi critics will eventually be forced to cross. Safe to say at that point, most remaining viewers not interested in the genre to begin with have already decided the outcome of the tragic film. "Repomen" is one of those films and I unfortunately, am one of those passive sci-fi fans that was forced to cross into low quality barriers with it.I found the political aspects and accuracy of future organ donation to be extremely far fetched. I laughed at the price they wanted to charge the one client for a new pancreas, they could have gone with a realistic figure at least for the film and how they covered up that mistake in the preview with a shopping channel advert that wasn't even in the film. What's wrong with insulin anyways? Many of the vehicles in the film had little to no modifications done to them to give them that futuristic look. There is product placement throughout and the props are just silly, notably the table at the end of the film is just trimmed with merchandise scanners and what I thought to be electric shavers. The organ depository looks so fake that when Forest Whitaker uses it, it actually shuffles like a desk drawer. Bombs look like large conventional batteries, and why would Repomen have bombs to begin with. Organs are sharp metal and hard unlike their real life counterparts. Cheap LED strip lights above the pink door's access panel. The list goes on.There is a sexual mutilation association that should have been caught by the film board and removed as it's pointless for the film and perverted. Special effects were dull, the synthetic organ lab with the technicians looked like the filmmakers just put up mirrors and had four technicians run around to give the image of a large spacious areas with hundreds of technicians, hilarious.I tried to enjoy it. However, if not for all those problems I found nothing but copied aspects from other films. I'm glad the filmmakers had their fun with it because I didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not what I was expecting, Jude Law and Forest Whitaker in a "hard R" film about the body organ trade, but nonetheless that is exactly what it is.Jude and Forest are Remy and Jake respectively and the Repo Men of the title. It is some point in the future and man-made human organs are all the rage, only you gots-ta keep up with the payments or the Repo Men will come and get the goods back.Frank (Liev Schreiber) is a salesman who signs the sick and generally poor suckers up to back ended high interest contracts in full knowledge that there is a high probability that the wretch can't keep up with the payments. As Frank says at one point the profit is not in the sale but the interest, and of course the organs can be used again.So the reclamation process? not pretty. In the opening scene Remy interrupts a young couple to inform the gentleman that he is overdue, the initial "but, but, buts" go nowhere, and Remy coolly and calmly extracts said organ from the corpse and takes it back to the shop. In this sort of work a degree of danger is standard and Remy's missus wants him to work in sales like Frank, away from the bullets and blood. After a BBQ turns into an impromptu vivisection she up and leaves him, taking their son with her.As a result Remy is having doubts about his lot in life, Jake meanwhile seems very content and thrives on the opportunity provided when the overdue organ sensor that finds their targets goes off. He tries to convince Remy to go into a partnership with him and focus only on the big high dollar cases.Nonetheless Remy has made his mind up and decides to retire after "one last job" (isn't it always?). That last job involves him repo-ing a heart from a music producer (RZA). When the job goes haywire though it is Remy on the floor, he wakes up to find he now has a new heart of his own? &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt; Now that Remy is simply another guy working to keep up with the payments things get a little more tense and serious. Remy wants to slot back in to the old job but he is suddenly scalpel shy and doesn't want to complete some of the basic tasks that the role requires. His boss decides to put him on notice, but Remy's new heart means new payments, and once he finds himself overdue Frank sends the boys round for a "chat".Meanwhile Remy finds himself with a kindred spirit, a woman that has multiple fakies and is also on the lam, they escape momentarily to the airport, only when that bid fails Remy decides on taking a more drastic course of action, something that Frank, Jake and co are very much against.I'm a little bit over the whole "in a dystopian future" thing but this at least tries to be different from the main, I especially respect and acknowledge the decision to make the film a Hard R, so many movies cop out nowadays There are some reasonable shootouts and a couple of brief chase scenes, nothing that jump out as awesome in any way. In fact aside from the premise this is all pretty perfunctory stuff and reminiscent of dozens of other movies, it is more the way they went about dealing with the material that earned the (limited) kudos from me.Oh, and it's not too often that you get Unkle and Method Man on the same soundtrack. As Ali G would say (if you paid him) Respect.Final Rating ? 5.5 / 10. Even if the film won't blow you away it is refreshing to see a film take some chances and go all the way R. It is also somewhat gratifying to know that Jude Law isn't always pretty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an interesting idea for a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the near future, a mega company called 'The Union' has sophisticated and expensive mechanical organs that can be bought on credit. When the customers can't pay, they bring in Repo Men. Remy (Jude Law) is one of those repo men. Jake (Forest Whitaker) is a fellow repo man and a brute. Remy has known Jake since childhood when Jake was a big bully. Frank (Liev Schreiber) is the cold hearted organ salesman. After a failed extraction with a faulty shocker, Remy is given an artificial heart. His wife kicks him out for still keeping the job. That's when he starts having difficulties with his job.It's a fascinating sci-fi concept. The audience badly needs a reason to root for these characters. It takes way too long to get the story to where Remy becomes compelling. It could easily chop off a chunk from the first half to speed up the pacing. The visual style has a slight Blade Runner vibe added to today's Toronto. It's not the best mid-range movie with big budget aspirations. The effects are not up to the top levels, and the action could be better. So could the movie have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Law isn't always right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE prospect of Jude Law coming to take a kidney or two is something that would send most women weak at the knees, but maybe not quite as much in his morally fraught profession in new thriller Repo Men. Set in the near future, the film follows two contemporary 'repo men' who make a living reclaiming artificial organs from people who have fallen behind with their payments for them. Law plays Remy, a high flying collection agent with a wife that's predictably, though somewhat understandably, a bit miffed with her husband's chosen vocation. Remy's best friend and partner on the road is Jake, played by the looming figure of veteran Forest Whitaker trying to be 20 years younger. The pair work for a suitably villainous multinational corporation called the Union and spend their time tasering moms, dads and kids, cutting them open and leaving them for dead depending on how much of a rush they're in to get home in time for American Idol. It would appear that in the near future the world has solved the problem of organic life but is still susceptible to universally conventional clichés, as Remy soon finds himself in a real pickle after unwittingly having to get a new heart and consequently dismays for an hour and a half at how he has become the hunted instead of the hunter. The concept of artificial organs is a smart one which brings with it a number of philosophical issues for exploration, but this is where the film becomes confused and wayward in its direction. It seems as if the director has given up the opportunity to discuss these interesting topics further, instead scratching only the surface of friendship, capitalism and personal responsibility, then feeling like he has to justify the film's 18 certificate by spraying everything in sight with blood and replacing the already flagging dialogue with knife fights. That being said, the soundtrack for the film redeems it to a certain extent. Blending classic soul with the electronic operas of contemporary pop culture it is an auditory joy and fits the overly graphic action scenes to perfection. Repo Men's other redemptive feature is the third figure of its acting spearhead, Liev Schreiber. On a rich vein of form coming off the back of WWII hit Defiance, pestering the X-Men as Sabertooth in Wolverine's Origin movie and about to play mentor to Angelina Jolie in upcoming summer blockbuster Salt, Schreiber plays the head of Union with cool conviction and slick, shrewd humour. Other brief chuckles come in the form of intermittent voice-overs from Remy. However, in aspects of both his narration and acting, Law leaves a lot to be desired. His aural descriptions feel forced and more scripted than they should, not wholly unlike his overly compensating English accent, which is a tad peculiar being as his back story depicts him growing up on east coast America, not in the East End with Oliver Twist. However, you cannot help but feel that Law is perfect for the role, as figuratively it encapsulates him. We hate him for his unbecoming arrogance, yet somehow his cool, charming swagger redeems him no end. Forest Whitaker is a whole other box of kidneys though. He appears to be playing Will Smith playing someone in his twenties. His inadvertent Fresh Prince impersonation is downright peculiar and has to be seen to be believed. In addition to this, the prospect of him being only three on-screen years older than Law is one that stretches the imagination almost as much as, if not further than, the concept of artificial organs and their collection agents itself. At times, Repo Men success in being a heavy handed exemplum of the world's ever increasing struggle with indebtedness, at others it succeeds in being a run-of-the-mill, gory action film with dialogue so stiff it could straight out of a Michael Bay movie. For all its faults there is a subtle, albeit very subtle, charm about Repo Men which keeps you interested from start to finish, it is just a pity that the final third of the film is so atrocious that it pays you back for staying with it by throwing your loyalty in your face and laughing as you curse the fact that you had any ounce of faith in it. See Jude and the gang's new flick on the big screen at your peril. But beware, this is nearly two hours of your life you will not be repossessing any time soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't worry i summarize but there are no spoilersSo its the future and you lay bye mechanical replacement body parts, if yours don't work correctly. If you cant pay your monthly installments someone is sent to take it from you . As unrealistic as this sounds there is a cold reality that i feel many people missed from this movie:The reality of cold hard cash vs human life. Corporate greed hits hard regardless of human life or worth and the violence in this movie hits the point home. I wonder what people think when peoples homes are repossessed and they have to live on the streets or they cant pay their medical bills and have to suffer without health-care. Thats what this movie is about. It doesn't matter how important whatever you have is(like a liver) if it is owed to us we take it.....and whatever the consequences are yours to face alone.... It really is an over the top dance of symbolism between our real life and the violence and coldness that is shown in the movie.I think the extreme violence and the far farfetchedness of this movie made people totally not see point. It isn't an easy movie to watch or swallow and definitely not for everybody. The movie feels a little uneven at times, and the characters are difficult to like.However in a world where wars are fought over oil and people are tossed out on the street because they cant pay their medical bills. This story is an over the top exaggeration of the security guard who tosses people out on the street. How does he sleep at night. How does he justify his actions? This movie is far from pointless...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possibly the first film that's irritated me in its opening seconds, Jude Law's monologue about the Schrödinger's cat was completely wrong, while you can argue that he's a meat head British veteran that somehow fought for as an USMC therefore couldn't understand a physicist's thought experiment, he was quoting something that he read, the only reason why the writers decided to rephrase the thought experiment is that they think we are too thick to understand it, which immediately annoyed me.The people behind the film seemed to struggle to decide what type of film it was suppose to be, at times the dialogues are extremely silly, what's with the freeze-frame and monologue just before a "funny" moment? I'm not watching a Guy Richie film. The relationships between all the characters are very weak, Remy and Jake are meant to be childhood best friends, yet Jake never once showed intentions of helping Remy pay the bills after the accident. Yet after he went through all the trouble of smashing him up, he decides to pay for all his expanses including the fancy Minority Report halo, why not pay for his heart in the first place?Remy's wife has also shown absolutely no sympathy towards neither the accident nor how she actually felt about his profession, if you married an assassin knowing that he is one, why try to change his profession that keeps food on your table? It's fine to say that the guilt slowly eats up at her, but at least show the build up? As for Beth, at least make an effort to show development of the love between her and Remy? He had gone through all the trouble to save her from the slum to clear her records because why? He saw her sing at a restaurant? Come on now. As for visuals, I have absolutely no problems with violence in films, or even the glorification of it, for the record I bloody loved 300, because they made it clear from the start, "everything you are about to see is for nothing but your visual pleasure, we do not care about story nor history, now sit back and enjoy". However in this case, like the rest of the film, they simply couldn't decide why they've included the violence, make up your mind! While it makes perfect sense to make sure the repo scenes are as gory and as "real" as it gets to highlight the brutality of the business, there's no reason why we need to see slow motion blood splattering knife fights (Old boy?) of the last pink door scene other than to please the audiences who came into the cinema expecting Gamer or Ultraviolet. The blade-runner-esque city was impressive while they showed the overhead view, but the second they zoom back in, I've completely forgotten about that future city, it doesn't seem to be filmed in context of the CGI'ed city. The 'It was all a dream' ending didn't even bother me, because by the time I've watched to the end, I honestly couldn't care anymore about any of the characters anymore.The film has all the ingredients to become a dark, complex film, if done properly with a little re-writing of the story I'd even go as far as to say that this could have been the closest live action version of Battle Angel Alita, however the end product turns out to be a half baked weak attempt to tackle a few serious ideas, to a down right silly action film. As for those who'd like us to judge this for what it is, well, how do I do that? I don't know what this is suppose to be! If you are expecting a mindless action film set in the near future? This isn't it. If you are expecting a cyberpunk film that deals with organ trafficking, this isn't it neither. The movie is worth a watch only if you are very bored, expect some occasional decent action scenes, frustrating moments, lots of plot holes, weak characters, cringe worthy dialogues, and an ending that makes you say to yourself "come on, I stopped watching Shyamalan's stuff to avoid exactly this.".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's is the near future, Jake and Remy are repossession men for body organs. After a repo' goes wrong Remy's heart is replaces and he finds himself on the run before his heart is repossessed.It's a high concept idea with a twist at the end. The gory repo scenes are cringe worthy and action scenes backed with a pumping music score are amazing. The sets, location and effects are attention-grabbing. Miguel Sapochnik's directing admirable but its failing is the screenplay, Repo Men is a jarring mismatch of a film, it doesn't know what it wants to be, one minute a social commentary, the next minute a comedy, then an action, a serious thriller and so on. It just doesn't gel and as a result it's a let down.Schreiber's Frank is menacing as one of "The Union" heads and there's a welcomed cameo appearance by John Leguizamo (Asbury). A lighter, healthier Forest Whitaker makes an impression in this odd toned movie, quirky lead and ever reliable Jude Law looks uncomfortable with the role Remy. Alice Braga's (Beth) performance is average and she isn't atheistically beautiful enough to convince the audience of Remy's infatuation with her. Unfortunately, Repo Men tries to cater and appeal to a spectrum of movie goers and as a result fails to entertain or satisfy in any capacity or arena.</fullReview>

Be ready to keep that fast forward button on you remote going. A lot. Any amateur ER fan can find so many errors in this movie its laughable. The only good in this movie is Forest Whitaker, who rarely do a bad job.The movie follows the basic plot we've seen in many other action movies. Starting with the main (almost evil) character who by some reason changes his mind and gets caught in a moral dilemma about his job, life and what he's really doing to other people. And the plot is unrealistic even by sci-fi standards.Im surprised that it was Jude in the lead role, and not Van Damme directed by John Woo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but probably divisive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men (not to be confused by the eighties cult flick 'Repo Man') is a new film, set in the near future, where people can buy replacement organs to either preserve or enhance their bodies (for health or vanity's sake). However, if you don't pay the full price on time, your organs are liable to be repossessed (in the most gruesome fashion) by a 'Repo Man' such as Jude Law.He's good at his job, but his wife wants him to quit. He's about to when - shock horror - something goes wrong and he's forced on the run by the very organisation he served.So it's one of those on-the-run films where the protagonist is chased through a series of different venues by baddies and picks up a girl along the way. It's nothing special, but it's not that bad either. There's action, fighting and some cool 'slow-mo' bits to keep the MTV generation entertained.However, before I watched it, I made the mistake of reading some reviews and learned a little too much about the plot. Therefore, I went into the film expecting something. I'm not going to mention what it is, but let's just say there's an element of the film that seems to seriously be dividing audiences. Because of this, you'll either love the film, or hurl your popcorn at the TV.Personally, I found the 'surprise' acceptable. You may not. Be warned.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Concept, Stupid Execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the not so distant future, organ donors are a thing of the past, replaced by mechanical versions of our vital organs. If you have a heart attack, contract cancer, or suffer an accident, a much more durable version of your affected body part can be put in at a high price. But if you fall behind on your payments, Jude Law and Forest Whitaker will show up and cut it out of you. That is, until Law has an accident and wakes up with an artificial heart in his chest and an outrageous debt to pay. When he can't get back into the swing of repossessing (and murdering most of the clients, mind you), he ends up on the run and wages war on the company that provided his heart.The problem with concept films is that the writers and directors of these movies focus entirely on the concept and not on the story or progression of the movie. Obviously this is an easy trap to fall into because it happens all the time. "Daybreakers" from earlier this year is a perfect example of this. "Repo Men" has an interesting idea from which to build a strong movie (and interesting enough to get me to rent this against my better judgment). But in truth this thing never really gets off the ground. The first 15 or 20 minutes does a decent job of setting the stage but everything after that is an utter mess. Weak story development, an over reliance on "shocking" bloody, gory shots, and embarrassingly one dimensional characters plague "Repo Men." A cast that includes Law, Whitaker, and Liev Schreiber should be a selling point but it's incredible how lackluster and uninspiring their characters are. "Repo Men's" final insult is a conclusive plot twist that has very little attachment to the rest of the film and lacks originality or even desirability. It is just a poorly conceived film all around the mercifully ends before too long.The Soap Box Office: www.thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings about this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say, I really don't want to criticise Repo Men too much, but don't want to give it too much credit either as it doesn't deserve either of those two. So I'll start with the good. A very interesting idea of a future world, where people have to walk around with transplants. Originality is something that the producers of the movie cannot be denied. Jude Law's acting is very good. The movie does follow that "the hero finds a beautiful girl and saves her" storyline, but does so in a good and interesting way. Overall the action isn't bad at all. However, the main thing that really did put me off is how disgusting this movie is. Now I don't puke when I see blood, but I never wanted to pursue a doctor's job either. The movie really does get into the details of removing people's organs, it gets to the point where it is simply disgusting to watch. I appreciate the idea, but this really was a put off... However overall this isn't a bad movie to watch. Assuming you have strong nerves - even the most realistic horror movies with gruesome murder scenes don't beat the extremely real scenes in Repo Men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Un-intelligible dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can somebody please re-assure me that the dialogue in this film was mostly un-intelligible. Particularly in all the scenes involving Forerst Whitaker but not excluding Jude Law, how different from 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'.This is a growing annoyance in a lot of movies nowadays and is not a problem with the audio soundtrack. Surely a Dialogue Coach or even the Director should notice this happening as he listens back to each scene? Incidentally, the films of Marlon Brando, a famous 'mumbler', are still crystal clear so it is definitely an affectation by the actors who probably heard that if you slur your words you are using 'the method'. How mistaken they are, so come on folks, stop your silly galloping through your lines as I am sure what you intend to say is fairly important.Otherwise the film wasn't bad!

		<shortDescription>Started as a good film, ended as a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Were to start, first of all let me get it out in the open that i went into this with no expectations what so ever. It seemed like an interesting prospect, the harvesting of organs, which was pulled off well and succeeded to make me squirm in my seat. The film starts well setting this possible future up well and Jude law isn't unbearable, i would even go as far as saying that it was a rare decent performance from him. So to list the positives: good idea, good leading man, good effects, good fight sequences and moderately good supporting cast. So why the low review score? Simply put the ending is horrific. Spoilers from here on because people need to know. The last 40 minuites is all a dream. It basically wipes away all the interesting progress the plot has made so the viewer wastes 40 minuites of there life. The director must have gone to the M. Night school of endings because this is the type of thing he does and gets universal hate for. Yet this films reviews let it off scott free because it 'symbolises' a lot, well it doesn't its just a cheap plot device to seem edgy and thought provoking. It physically made me angry and i felt sorry for all of the people who paid to see this as it ruins what could have been a perfectly decent film. Without the stupid ending i think it deserves at least a 7 but because of this it destroys the whole experience. I don't usually get angry over films but this not only made me angry but it made me sad as to what might have been if they had not tried to be pretentious inception wannabes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Repo Men starts with an decent premise, but descends into the cheap and nasty. Jude Law is great as the immoral repo, cutting open innocents for their vitals, but he stumbles when he's asked to play the victim.He's such an unlikeable character that the movie has to contort itself to keep you following his story with any interest. His wife is shown to be cold and heartless but if she really was, wouldn't she be relishing his work? If she's a saint, would she kick him out over not speaking to his boss? The movie keeps up this weird inversion of morality. The evil Union stuffs artificial organs into sick people who were going to die anyhow, which is much like any transplant doctor does, and then comes like the bogey man at midnight to cut them up and take back the artiforgs, when the (we assume) impoverished middle class patients can't keep up their payments. OMFG, The Union is the The Bankz! Wow, how profound! Not.The writer presumably got screwed by his ex-wife and this movie is mostly a fantasy about how she dies in a fire, and he (the writer, or Jude Law as he likes to think of himself) gets to score with the hot singer chick, and murder his ex-colleagues and ex-boss. That's the core of the plot and all the rest is just props and smoke to justify one more knifing.The gore at the start of the movie has some promise. It's cold, cynical, careful. Perhaps this is going to be an intelligent comment on American Psycho. Maybe his insanity will become a first class citizen in the movie and we'll understand what it takes to slice open strangers at night, and kiss your wife and son by day.But no such luck, there is no examination of our Hero's character except to note that he was bullied at school by his now best friend (oh, writer, you tell us so much about yourself), and was a soldier. Oh boy, that's so convenient. My friend Kevin was also a soldier, a real one, but does not go around knifing people. At least not that I know.By the finale of this movie we're into Robocop II body counts, apparently aiming for the maximum kills and blood splatter. The bad guys massacre the innocents, and Jude Law slices, stabs, saws, and hammers the bad guys.There's no surprise, no glory, no emotion, just graphic violence. C'mon, hacksaw? Seriously? A hacksaw is supposed to slice open throats like a katana? Why not use a piece of stale cheese?Of course the heroic duo (Jude and Sonia Braga, who he picked up along the way with as much emotion as a tin can seducing a lawn mower) were supposed to destroy the evil empire and save humanity. But in a last minute plot failure, they decided that wasn't going to happen, so instead all their friends and people who help them get killed in the most pointless and bloody way possible, while they blow up one processing room (presumably one of thousands), and then escape to South America to retire on a beach, like a pair of train robbers.It's not just sad. It's embarrassing. Forest Whittaker aids and abets this massacre of a movie, and the three excellent actors find themselves rolling in muck, praying for the end and hoping not too many people see this film. I won't call it a career ender, but it is really one of the worst films I've seen in a long time, all the more so because it takes itself so seriously, and has such a promising start.Perhaps the best way to watch this is as a comedy. But even then, the jokes are not really funny, and the twisting self-centered morality of the main arc leaves me wondering what tormented mind made this movie, and how much their therapy is going to cost them.What this movie should have been... sigh. The premise is great, the actors superb, the camera work and music acceptable. We see a loving family, the ex-soldier husband forced to work as repo man to pay the bills, tormented by the faces of those he kills, but keeping his family together by any means possible. His son, his wife, the bills, the knife and the paycheck, a painful but somehow complete circle.And then, the tragedy, his wife and son terribly hurt in a car crash, and his choice, the worst moment in his life, when he has to sign on the dotted line and allow The Union to fill them with artiforgs, or lose them forever.And suddenly he can't pay, the amounts are too large, and then it comes, the Proposition. Become head of unit, and get a pay rise, or else his lovely wife and son will be ripped open at midnight, and their hearts and lungs repossessed.And so he accepts, and takes the position, and then makes a terrible discovery. The Union is deliberately spreading disease, making people sick, so they have to buy artiforgs. He contacts his old army buddy Forrest Whitaker, and with his help they crack the security on the Union mainframe and open the file on his family.It was a setup! They set-up the accident! He was resisting promotion and they forced him!Now he's mad, and makes a plan to destroy The Union for once and for all. Forrest's girlfriend, Sonja Braga, helps. They infiltrate The Union HQ, in an elaborate ruse involving a container full of repossessed parts that actually holds the three heroes, and then they plant explosives around the Union's data center, and leave just as it all blows up.Add enough cardboard characters to kill and chop up that the youth segment is happy, and we have a story that is satisfactory, if not a work of art.</fullReview>

I started to get a deja vu feeling about 30 minutes in, when Jude Law's character became Logan 5, and Forest Whitaker morphed into Francis 7. They even have a Jessica 6 in the guise of "Beth." About half-way through the film, there's a scene that is lifted, almost shot-for-shot from "Logan's Run." I haven't read the book this is based upon, and maybe it's just the director who stole from the 1976 film, but either way, just watch the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have a Heart, Repo Men I'm not going to take blame for this for the following: I was so incredibly bored for the majority of Repo Men that when the pieces started to fall together, not only did I care less for the characters or their plight, I just tried to stay awake to get up to put another movie in.This boredom is the result of a sh|tty script, an almost completely unoriginal idea and two many styles/subjects explored that it felt like six directors had their hands on this.And what the f^ck is with Jude Law being an sci-fi/Matrix-ripoff action star? I thought I would never say this: as good as Law is, he's no Keanu Reeves?in the above reference ONLY. The way he looked in this movie, Steve Buscemi could've been his stunt double and his muscles were only as big as Forest Whitaker's one good eye.Okay, that's not really what the movie's about and I can't wait to get to that?so I can reveal that I'm on the bad guy's side!In the FAR distant future ? they say near, but that city in Repo Men looked suspiciously like the all-city planet, Coruscant, of the Star Wars universe?wait, Star Wars was set in the past. Anyways, a small part of our future is the artificial implants of credit cards, whereas people need new hearts, lungs, lips, whatever and this big-bad corporation called "The Union" will spare you the $600,000+ cost (wait, is that a lot in the future??) by extending credit.In a system that's practically set up to fail, everyone seems to be past due and it's up to the repo men to (extremely violently) reclaim The Union's property. Our "hero" Remy (Law) is conflicted in his repoing job and his nagging wife wants him to switch to sales, in which he has no chance.Whelp, as always in these movies, the wife gave an ultimatum, and kicked him out keeping their son. In some dumb twist, he's now the patient who needs a heart and gets one of these metal hearts.Shockingly, he falls past due and is on the run from his own boss, company and BFF and repo-partner, Jake (Whitaker). This is where things got fuzzy for me, perhaps because I seriously just stopped paying close attention. Apparently he meets this girl, he completely forgets about the love of his life ? his wife, and he escapes with this half-woman, half-all machine from The Union. She must've had excellent credit to get all those parts!Anyhoo? in comes them against the company, them banding with other "Matrix" victims and them trying to stop the big-bad Union.OK, here goes on why I agree with the big-bad Union, though they are as evil as them come: I worked for a credit card company for almost eight years and another almost eight years in the credit counseling side. So, I've seen both sides, I've worked both angles and know how these companies operate. And I have this to say to anyone accepting a credit card, or in this case a couple of tin cans in place of your lungs: DON'T MAKE DEALS WITH THE DEVIL IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE.I don't know how much LESS sympathy I can have for people who default and both blame the company for their problems and try and weasel their way out. Granted, these methods (gruesomely cutting open the people and grabbing out the artificial parts) are to the extreme, but I've been in (the monetary kind) their shoes. Not once did I blame anyone else but myself and did everything I could to keep up to my word to pay back my debts.In this movie and in these fool's defense, supposedly they didn't know what was going to happen if they didn't repay the debts. So that's basically how we're supposed to side with them. There's always consequences, you dopes, so again, I never felt a strong connection to anyone, especially the Repo Man, himself, Remy.Other than my soapbox, the movie's qualities lie in the cinematography and the scope of their version of the future ? but pretty much just the city. Other than that, the movie's a mess and gets progressively worse as it nears a really dumb climax and finale. It's enormously gruesome ? something I didn't expect and it contains our "hero" as a cold-blooded murderer. So, he's not only a dead-beat dad and a debt-runner, but he's a killer, too.And he's the good guy in all this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Repo Men, not to be mistaken for the opera version as i was initially mistaken (why didn't that come to our shores?) is a sporadically radical view of the world where mechanical advancement has outrun medical outcome. A world where man are like cars. Got a bald tire? Change them! Your carburetor is clunky? Change them! (Notice i don't know much about cars?) Busted your knee caps? Replace them with steel joints! Got a weak heart? Replace them with ready valve system of the future! BUT it comes with a price. I know it will possibly suck all your savings up but you owe it to your family. You owe it to yourself. Sounds kinda familiar aye? But just like real world, if you can't pay for it, the 'Union' will repossess it back from you. Hence the title of the film Repo Men, unlike what my friend took a shot at the title as Repository Men. I should give him a smack one of these days. Anyway, i'm just gonna jump straight into what struck me the most is how awfully awesome the gritty look of the future was displayed. The vast torn-down look that integrated with the new and old worked beautifully and matched the tone of the subject. But what struck me odd was the tone of the film. The first half of the film was almost a dark humor buddy film and then took a turn with the thriller and action. Complete with gungho Old-boy corridor fight sequence that followed by the most erotic gore/sensual scene ever. Its total love making... with pain and blood! With people like Jude Law, Forest Whitaker and Liev Schreiber, what's there to complain? Everyone had their moments. All well played to their own bad-assness but the only gripe i have with them is how boring their hand combat was. If only they had the same speed/technique of Jason Borne, it would have been perfect. Oh also not forgetting the smoldering, Alice Braga, the love interest who we should keep a look out for in the future. Aside from all the positivity, his film didn't really garner much attention of the audience. The reason? They totally pulled the oldest trick in the book. It really pisses me off! But upon thinking it further, there were pointers that made clear judgment of such..oh forget it. It still pisses me off. I guess if would watch this film and forget about the last 5 mins of the film, it would have been a good sci-fi genre for keeps. This is a guys movie for sure. A sporadic of bullets, blood and gore, enough to wet the appetite the adrenaline junkie craving the male hormones. For the ladies, fret not. Served on the platter, a buff Jude Law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid pointless film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say? 2 out of 10 at best.Stupid Concept - repo men cutting out people's mechanical livers, hearts etc when they can't make the repayments on them. I know I'm meant to suspend my disbelief, but it's implausible to the extreme. Surely, you'd simply zap people and take them to the hospital to remove them properly- - not cut them open with a knife! The rest of the storyline was stupid and predictable.Directing - all over the place.Visual Experience - Looked very low budget. Not convincing it was set in the future apart from the cliché shots. Why does the future always contain loads of tall buildings and stupid advertising everywhere (a poor man's Blade Runner)? Also, why is there a smart car in the future. Lets hope not! Acting - Jude Law was poor and so was the woman. Forrest was OK, but he over did it a bit. Good cast wasted.Characters ? dull and unconvincing. Not a believable character or relationship in the film.The ending ? some say it's clever, but it made no sense. Why would Forrest do that (you'll understand if you ignore my review)? The violence in this film was over the top and unnecessary and trying to make up for a weak storyline. The violence and gore at the end was pointless.Don't waste your time on it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries too hard without any proper thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was looking forward to seeing Repo Men, the synopsis sounded good and it had Forest Whittaker in it too.The film starts off slowly, save a few surgical scenes and a bit of moral dilemma, nothing much else happens. This is the best bit.It's a strange film and is badly conceived. Afterwards there were so many unanswered questions and points that just didn't add up. Jude Law's love interest initially shows up as a smouldering jazz singer in a busy bar, frequented by Repo Men. The next time she appears (after a day or two), she is a tramp, hiding in a derelict building from the Repo Men, with half of her body comprising of artificial organs that need to be repossessed. It doesn't get any better and the sheer amount of refugees that have implanted organs is just amazing, is there some sort of organ destroying virus out there?! Towards the end there is the most memorable scene, which involves Remy (Jude Law) and Beth (Alice Braga) surgically operating on each other and erotically scanning each others organs. It's like Crash (Cronenberg/Ballard) but so bad and cringe-worthy I burst out into laughter.This film just tries too hard and concentrates it's energy on the action scenes. There's just no suspense and it's difficult to connect or care for the characters; in one scene there's a Repo Man after Remy &amp; Beth where they can hear him coming up the stairs, it goes on too long whilst they just sit around and by the time he shows up, you're left hoping he'll do his job properly (Shame he ends up with a typewriter on his head) It surprises me that scripts like this get through without anyone reading them properly. The concept is good and it could have been a much better film. Unfortunately it's just another bad film to add to Jude Law's list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REPO MEN may be worthy of a bit of interest in the novel form 'The Repossession Mambo' by Eric Garcia (who co-wrote the script with Garrett Lerner), but as a film it is simply silly. After about fifteen minutes into the movie the greatest temptation is to turn it off, but since it is paid for you sit through it, hoping that it will have some redeeming graces. Mistake. Directed by neophyte Miguel Sapochnik whose credits are in art direction, the film for some reason has a number of outstanding actors attached to it: the payroll must have been big! Jude Law and Forest Whitaker, two fine actors, play the men who repossess internal organs (kidneys, hearts, livers, joints, etc) sold to them by a company run by Liev Schreiber - a company more interested in time payments with very high interest rates (sound familiar?) than with cash up front payments. If a recipient of one of these mechanical organs fails to pay the full amount in the given time, the Repo Men seek them out and take the organs back - leaving the buyer to simply die. The entire film is just that - killing and gory surgeries to take back or repossess organs. A bit of a glitch pops up when we discover that Jude law has one of these hearts whose payments are past due and he and a singer - Alice Braga, niece of actress Sonia Braga - both house expired organs and are on the run from the company in the leadership of yes, Forest Whitaker. It just gets worse as the chase moves into endless killings and raids and ridiculous situations. And the ending is a must miss. One wonders what attracted Jude Law and Forest Whitaker to this loser: more odd is why brilliant actress Carice van Houten agreed to the tiny minor and meaningless role of Jude Law's wife, or John Leguizamo singing on for an equally unimportant minor role. Maybe there is an audience for this film, an audience who doesn't mind the concept of making fun of organ transplantation as a fraudulent business, and who can tolerate the gore that is on screen throughout the film. It all seems a waste of talent trying hard to prevent this film from becoming a terrible bore - and failing. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Futuristic Reposession...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this one when it was released in the cinema. I quite liked it and thought it worthy of a second viewing when it came up on TV this week. Quite futuristic with certain visuals that are very reminiscent of Ridley Scott's 1982 classic, Blade Runner, although it's nothing like Blade Runner (unfortunately). Here is a brief summary before I give you my thoughts on the film (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please reclaim that man's pancreas while I write the next paragraph).It is the near future where medicine has advanced enough that human organs can be replaced with artificial ones. One company 'The Union' controls the world market and as such can dictate the price. It is so high that most people opt to pay in instalments. But if you miss three payments then the Repo Men will call and surgically remove The Union's property. Remy and Jake grew up together, they joined the army together and when the war was over they became Repo Men together. Their boss is Frank, who is only concerned with the retrieval of The Union's property, no matter how it's done. Remy is married to Carol and has a son, Peter but Jake stayed single. Carol doesn't like Remy's line of work and wants him to move into sales. The two guys carry on with their work, which eventually becomes too much for Carol and she leaves Remy. Soon after Remy suffers an accident that leads to him having an artificial heart installed. He now gets a conscience and finds it hard to get back into the Repo business. He tries sales, but that's not for him. Eventually he falls behind on his payments and becomes overdue. He goes off the grid and goes to live rough with others whose repayments have lapsed. There he meets Beth, a singer who has had many illegal artificial organs fitted. The pair decides to try and get their records erased when Jake is assigned to recover Remy's organs. I won't say any more, don't want to give too much away.It's a pretty well made film although there is a lot of violence and it is very gory, not recommended for those of a nervous disposition. Decent performances from all of the leading cast, honourable mentions go to Jude Law as Remy, Forest Whitaker as Jake, Alice Braga as Beth, Liev Schreiber excellent as the very slimy Frank, Carice van Houten as Carol and Chandler Canterbury as Peter.I pretty much enjoyed this film but I found it didn't quite hit the mark. There is a very nice twist at the end which I did enjoy, but over all it kind of left me a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's quite entertaining and there are some good performances, I just felt the plot could have done with a little more refining. So, over all, violent, gory, futuristic, entertaining but the plot needed a little work. Having said that, it's still recommended.My score: 6.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gruelling action film set in a future where those who can't pay for their artificial organs have them removed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the not too distant future medical technology has improved to the point where failing organs can be replaced by artificial ones? at a price. Of course there are finance plans for people who can't afford to buy them outright but if you drop behind on your payments your organs will be repossessed. This is where the repo men come in. Remy is one such repo man; he is good at his job but his wife is pressuring him to switch to the sales department. He says he will consider it but soon afterwards has an accident at work; when he wakes up he learns that he has had to have a new heart installed. Now he sympathises with those who can't pay and can no longer bring himself to do his job. His time to repay for his heart is rapidly running out so he goes on the run along with Beth, a singer. He is pursued by other repo men including his erstwhile partner, Jake.This is a solid film with plenty of action, some of which is fairly gruelling? but not half as gruelling as seeing the repossession work where the artificial organs are cut out. The story is told at a good pace without being rushed? it is quite a while before Remy goes on the run as time is spent introducing the viewer to the situation rather than just telling us. The basic plot reminded me of the '70s Sci-fi classic 'Logan's Run'; however it could have been a coincidence as there were a fair few major differences. The cast does a solid job with Jude Law, Forrest Whitaker and Alice Braga impressing as Remy, Jake and Beth. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. As the film approaches its conclusion the action is ramped up and we get a fight in a corridor that is almost on a par with that in 'Old Boy'. Over all I'd recommend this to anybody looking for an action film and isn't put off by some fairly gruesome moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can't keep up with the payments, your transplant is removed.Starring Forest Whitaker, Jude law and Alice Braga.Written by Eric Garcia and Garret Lerner.Directed by Miguel Sapochnik.This really wasn't my cup of tea.It's a good idea wasted. The whole premise was promising but it just turned into another 'shoot them up' action movie when it could have been much more.On a positive note the performances by Forest Whitaker and Alice Braga were decent. Jude Law, on the contrary, was pretty wooden. But the whole thing was way too far fetched and unrealistic and repetitive. The plot was monotonous and just kept on going around in circles,And it was too gory for my liking. It made me feel a little bit sick to be honest and I even felt like that a few hours after it finished. And I'm a nurse and blood doesn't bother me!I was yawning towards the end and that says a lot. If you've seen one movie where a guy spends one and a half hours taking on ( and killing) two dozen armed men single handed, you've pretty much seen them all. A wasted opportunity.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Law and Whitaker, men of action, in one electrically charged ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sci fi horror of this magnitude, we have been missing for a long time. Repo Men is so bloody exciting and fun, and a chance to watch Jude Law, who normally plays pussy roles, kick some serious butt. One scene towards the end, goes completely insane, and we lap it up. Law, is surprisingly good, playing one of the bad guys and he does it well, really giving off some menace in the earlier part. He balances this well with a good side. He plays Remy who works for this insidious, and lucrative operation known as the union. For a hefty fee, they can replace organs, hearts, etc, only with one deadly catch. If you fall behind on payment, they come and reclaim your new ticker, by of course, surgical procedure, where we see a few bloody examples, as set by the slackers, one happening to be a reggae singer Remy likes. He's even patient and respectful in his business, waiting for the reggae singer to first finish up his recording, while also singing to himself. See, Repo Men has humor as well. More so, what I like about it, is of course it's bloody original. When someone rigs a de fibulator, and Remy takes a shock that sends him flying back across the room, it's him who's now on the other side of the law, where not having the cost for his new ticker, provided by of course the union. He flees, teaming up with a washed up, drugged out singer, where the hunt begins, but it's so much adventurous and wild fun. Whitaker who plays Remy's best friend, and work colleague plays off Law well, but apart from Alice Braga as the singer, the other notable performance is that off the corrupt boss, played by Liev Schrieber. He's unforgettable. Of course, Repo Men not for the faint of heart, as we view a few dissections. It has some really cool scenes, like Law's son's shark/fish silhouetted room. We spend a bit of family time, as well, another thing I liked about it, as I never would of expected that in this, but I never expected the film to be of this quality, where there's also a great set up of story, and I'm talking too about Whitaker's selfish motives, which we'll become clear to you, later in the film. Repo Men will surprise you in the factor, as you won't expect such a quality product. We also see the whitest laboratory you've ever seen. Get ready for a twist, at the end, though I found it a real comedown. Dreadful matching song too, that's an old favorite. It was really good to see Law (an actor who I'm not really into) in something like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touchy subject for some people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Gattica with it's DNA plot, audiences aren't yet ready to find the subject of body organ replacements a topical issue. That's not to say they won't one day. This movie is just about saved by good acting performances from Jude Law, Forest Whitaker and Liev Schreiber. With a different plot it could have been turned into a great buddy movie between law and Whitaker. By setting the organ repossession story in the future with mechanical organs, it kind of lost it's bite for me. It might have been more controversial if it had been based upon the repossession of donated body organs. For most of us this is just a science fiction story, but for many people in the world with faulty organs it really is a matter of life and death today. But it did make me think how fortunate I am to have working body organs, or at least for the moment I do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining if formulaic sci-fi action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men came out during a time where another movie called Repo! The Genetic Opera with very similar plot lines with the difference being that The Genetic Opera obviously had some singing. Repo Men is a more straight forward action sci-fi film that makes some commentary on class division and healthcare with some well-executed action although it isn't that great.Good: I really like the pairing of Jude Law and Forest Whitaker. They work well together and provide a lot of great scenes and Law really brings it here. The action scenes are well done and the movie has a slick futuristic look to it. A good supporting cast with Liev Schreiber and Alice Braga.Bad: The movie is rather pedestrian at times with the commentary being done well in other movies. The movie is also pretty long and the middle section drags a lot making the movie very uneven. It also moves at a predictable route for the most part.Overall, it's not a terrible movie and it is entertaining, but it doesn't leave much an impression.</fullReview>

Interesting premise though, kinda BladeRunner-ish and great leads in Jude Law and Forest Whitaker -I haven't yet been able figure out how they were supposed to have grown up together though when they have different accents? Anyways, super gory in parts, great action scenes, with occasional weirdness, dark humour thrown in that is eventually explained by the "Neural Net." The final knife-fight/showdown is just awesome in a very Over-the-top (Kill Bill) kind of way. 5/10/14</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows how evil actions are typically justified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The part I enjoyed most about this film is it's portrayal of how reasonable, intelligent can justify their own evil actions. They remind themselves that "if they didn't do it, someone else would", they argue it from a capitalist perspective - if we didn't enforce the rules, then no one would pay and this service couldn't exist. They support each other in their actions as shown in the bar scene where they use humor to cast their actions in a less serious light.**SPOILER** In addition, I thought the ending of the movie raises an interesting question about whether it really mattered that Remy was in a 'dream'. In other words, did Jake actually make Remy's life better by setting him up with that neuro device?I also had to give it -1 for the gratuitous gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: Repo MenCondensed Storyline: In the world of organ repossessions a repo man gets into an accident where he needs to have his heart replaced, but he struggles to make the payments, this is when he goes on the run and becomes what he used to hunt.Notable Acting: The actors in this movie are casted great, I do enjoy the chemistry between Jude Law's character and Forest Whitaker's character, this is the most important part of a buddy cop movie I was feeling kind of meh about Alice Braga's character, but that is mainly because I would like to see a film where two characters of the opposite sex do not hook up together. I understand that she was there to show him the life of those who live in fear of repo, but I would have preferred that they didn't get together. Noticeable Camera work: The camera work is a mixture between faced paced work for when the action comes along but then slows down to a more relaxed way of viewing when it is time for conversations and such. The angles leave a bit to be desired though, they aren't all too creative. But they get the point across and you see what you need to see.Overall Feel: Chases are I will compare this movie to 'Repo The Genetic Opera' a lot as they are very similar movies. Fans of 'Repo The Genetic Opera' have mixed feelings about this movie as 'Repomen' basically took the entire storyline of 'Repo The Genetic Opera' and made it their own. Repoman does the job that family doesn't like, problems arise and he turns against the company his works for before dying in the end. But I feel that this movie does enough things differently in this movie to justify it, the more works more on the buddy cop theme than anything else, and the repo is just plot mover. They also take their character to different levels, because in this movie the main Repoman becomes what he is paid to hunt and gets hunted for it, whereas in 'Repo The Genetic Opera' the main Repoman gets hunted because he will not kill the friend of his dead wife. This movie uses bio-mechanical organs which is a nice adaption and would seem more feasible in their future time. This is the only movie which has sex, surgery, computer hacking scene. That is creative to say the very least. The twist that happens at the end of the movie is very nicely executed and my use of language gives you the hint, but it wasn't expected on my part. But I found it a great ending to say the least. The movie is quite bouncy in the fact that is switches from funny face to serious face a lot and generally back and forth a lot, not that I have a problem with it. I enjoyed this movie, but I still prefer 'Repo The Genetic Opera' as I enjoyed it's whole cast of characters along with its original organ repo idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few decent sci-fi's of the 2000's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a movie which received lots and lots of negative reviews which, in my opinion, it did not deserve. Yes,!!(SPOILER)!! it might look like the 1985 "Brazil" as so many critics claim, but then again most of the movies today (late 2000's and on) are in my opinion licked off their 20th century predecessors and big successes. For a sci-fi, this picture is one worth watching for at least two reasons: 1)the plot is wrapped in a futuristic cloak which quite frankly fits with modern world issues, a quality many movies lack today, and !!(SPOILER)!! 2) it is bloody, dirty and filthy exactly the way it should be, no less and no more. Now I have read some reviews where the movie is blamed to be exactly that, an unnecessary bloodbath, but it simply cannot be otherwise. As for the sarcastic comments concerning !!(SPOILER)!! the unrealistic fight scenes and surgical operations beyond survival reality, PLEASE do not forget that this is nothing but !!(SPOILER)!! a plot of the main hero's imagination, a dream. "Inception" was full of this, so why is "Repo Men" so bullied? More importantly, and that's really the point of this probably long and boring review is that many critics are missing the point of the movie: its message. Hurrying to bury it in "unnecessary violence" and "unchecked reality", many forget that it sends out a clear message about where we are going. It is really, as some said, a satire (and a very sad one) of our "merchandised", "customer-based" reality. The ending in my opinion is somewhat expected, but then again it is absolutely brilliant, wrapping and putting all the "rough stitches" back in place for the "meticulous" viewers. I especially liked the "cat reference" in the movie, something many have probably never paid attention to. Really, !!(SPOILER)!! Remy is exactly that, the cat. Everything came back to the beginning, a prophecy.I recommend this movie for people who are not afraid of gore where it is inevitable and who like their films to be with a grain of thought in them, something an awful lot of so-called "blockbusters" today absolutely lack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen this film twice now, I have to say this bloody, violent, Cronenburg-style medical futuristic sci-fi action film is under-rated. We start with the hyper-macho, viciously callous, ex-military world of the repo men, but soon the tables are turned. I like Jude Law in everything he's done, but it still surprises me that his range is wide enough to include something like this. And he has never looked better. He has the talent, class and magic to elevate a film like this to something more -- even when he's playing a thug. Forest Whitaker, Alice Braga and Carice van Houten were also quite good. Negative points: It was a bit slow in the middle. I cannot say I was actually moved by the film. Very violent and very bloody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superficially entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film whose entire storyline ? as slim as it is ? seems to have been inspired by a sketch in Monty Python's MEANING OF LIFE, which has a sketch of a pensioner losing their liver to a couple of repossession men. Well, those men are brought to life in this futuristic thriller which fills its running time with gobbets of surgical gore and a man-on-the-run narrative that will be overly familiar to even the most intermittent of modern film viewers. Jude Law is cocky and rather irritating as a brutish, cold-hearted rent collector type who finds himself on the run when his former colleagues turn against him.The look and feel of the film is very similar to Spielberg's MINORITY REPORT, albeit with a lower budget, and it's clear that there are some major problems here. The whole thing takes nearly an hour to get going before it starts to pick up momentum and become interesting, and then it seems to finish all too quickly. Also, for a movie advertised as an action thriller, it's rather light on the action; a stunning, OLDBOY-inspired corridor fight at the climax helps to make up for this, but it's not quite enough. And don't get me started on the absolutely stupid twist ending, which sucks out all the visceral enjoyment the viewer has just taken from the production.Despite the flaws and general coldness of the production, it's difficult to dislike REPO MEN. It's clear that this was written and created by young, slightly immature men content to riff on previously explored topics rather than delivering genuinely innovative product, but it still delivers on a superficial level; you want to know what happens next, and the thrills satisfy. The cast are perfunctory: Alice Braga and Liev Schreiber make virtually no impact in highly predictable supporting roles, and while Forest Whitaker gets a little more of a look in, even he doesn't get a great deal to work with. Law, meanwhile, plays it off-hand and it doesn't work; he needed to be much more tortured for a role like this. It's not bad as it stands, but it could have been a whole lot more with some real maturity applied to the premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "could have been great" kind of movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I said before that it's not bad to recall many movies while watching a new one. However, it's real bad when you find out that it's lower than these very movies. This what happens while watching (Repo Men), and it isn't the only shortcoming too ! In many places, (Repo Men) looks like (Blade Runner), (Brazil), and (Minority Report). And it isn't as good as any of them. Clearly, it wanted to make a sci-fi with social commentary about Man vs. System in dystopian world, yet with some action and heavy gore, to end up between a less meaty remake of many classics and a customary thriller ! The script causes many disturbances and dangerous questions. I hated how the wife's character was written semi-mute. The love story between the lead and that singer was so rushed. And the matter of how "the friend did it" disappointed big part of the movie's satire to eventually seem as just a movie about 2 friends, one of them is crazy ! I didn't get how that friend was so assured that the lead wouldn't leave his job "after" the heart transplanting ? Or how that so successful lead didn't save any money to pay for that transplanting ?! Or how could an ordinary typewriter explode a man's head ??!! There are many questions such as these by the way !Then, the dream part. It's stupid. For one reason, it's the same ending of a famous classic, so why to remake it, and not do something of your own ? And for another, it's not played smartly, where it harms your passivity as a viewer. Like it was done 3 years before in (Next), there is a mean manipulation with you. Why not discovering that putting the lead into that "sweet dreams" condition took place right after the climactic action sequence for instance? This way we ? as viewers ? wouldn't be that disappointed. It's lousy when a movie lies on you this long, let alone gives you the victory then tells you "Sorry, we were cheating you" !! Whatever the purposed shock effect you must detest the movie and your preoccupation with it. Thus while the hate, by this end, was aimed at the lead's weakness (mainly in you), it would hit the movie as well !Actually, the movie got silly and absurd in its third act, with many forced points like how getting into the company's headquarters required an organ, not a keyboard. And opening the door of that headquarters needed another organ (!!). Let alone the way how the lead suddenly turned into unbeatable Superman. It's not cleverness to do all of this then lay the responsibility on the fact that "it was a dream !!" While the story somehow had an inspiring side, the direction didn't utilize a lot to be genius or clever. I was really sad for certain scenes where they could have been made way better, instead of feeling so unremarkable (walking amongst the murdered-by-the-company poor people under the ground was of course one). There was no moving, aesthetic, or memorable scene along the way (maybe the bloody end where slicing bodies was done like making love). So the story was handled poorly compared to its potential.The fistfights were very well choreographed. The rest of the action wasn't any visually dazzling; such as the fight of the ship. And the last fight ? in specific ? was unsatisfied, with narrow area and illogical everything.(Jude Law) is a heck of an actor. He as if wanted a hit movie yet with a substance, where he does action along with acting. Here, I won't say that I loved his acting alone, because everybody acted finely. However, in the big picture, it is more than disappointing when you watch believable performance in the middle of unbelievable events !The soundtrack tried to enhance the human side of the lead, especially against the beastly career he lives, with many beautiful jazz oldies. If only the whole movie was as perfect ?! With little intellectual deepness and immoderate violence, (Repo Men) deflates to a usual B movie. And even as that B movie, it isn't flashy or amusing. Hence, it's generally a great idea in a cheap dealing, which makes it one of the "could have been great" movies, regrettably !P.S : I think (Repo Men) might be remembered in the future, not for its creativeness or entertainment, but for its unhappy end. Amongst all the Man vs. System movies lately, nearly none had miserable windup for its warrior lead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A job is a job... Until it becomes personal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within last decades, with the introduction and development of credit cards and installments, payment and debt collection has severely flourished, hence the events depicted can easily happen. Medicine and cure is closely linked to business and one can ponder where are the limits of action, especially if persons with active legal capacity have consciously opted for improve their health and living quality? And as there are thousands of people for whom dispossessing their car or luxury home would be more terrible than losing e.g. their kidney or limb... The screenplay is well tailored, thrilling and with lots of twists. The cast is evenly strong; Forest Whitaker and Jude Law outperform the others, but they spend the most time on the screen as well. But all supporting actors are equal to their tasks, there are no dull or dry performances. I liked the movie because - apart from the above mentioned virtues - it gives food for thought about several important daily issues and values. But if you dislike violence or surgical procedures, you better skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>7 Revolutions Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am currently taking a class called 7 Revolutions that focuses on the top 7 things that will be affecting our future at Fort Hays State University. I saw three of the seven revolutions pertained in this move. The first revolution that is relevant is population. With people living longer due to the artificial organs here would be more and more people added to our already growing world population. The world only has a certain carrying capacity and some say we have already hit that limit. With the introduction of commercialized extended life there would not be enough jobs/resources to support the type of growth. Urban cities as portrayed were overly populated with in the background skyscrapers raising exponetially up to the sky. The second revolution portrayed through this movie would be technology. It is not that hard to believe in real life that we are making head way to artificial organs. The medical world is one of the most advanced industries since they are always combating without remorse. Also the scanners can be associated with marking people and their where abouts like they try to implement in public schools, but as a nation wide motion monitoring airports like portrayed in the movie. The guns that shoot out electric pulse that knocks you out but is not fatal can be said to be the evolution of the taser. It makes you wonder about if you really have rights or are you just going to get tased.Finally, the last revolution that is most prominent is Economics. The artificial organs are extremely expensive, but they are open to the public. They allow for a payment plan that is set up like our bank loan system. Where you make payments but if you miss your payments or the collateral which is the artificial organ that they have given to you will be reposed by a repo men hired by the Union. This is the main premise of the movie. This is how the banks failed. When your average joe goes to the bank to take out a loan for a house they are under the impression that you believe they can make the payments or they wouldn't have given you the loan. Well when the housing market tanked everyone was sitting on a pile of debt that lead to the whole collapse of our loan system. The same concept applies to the Union and there dealings with life and death which forces people to sign the dotted line since they make more money with a loan system than full payments.Repo Men portrays the three revolutions of population, technology, and economics. With these three revolutions it gives us a brief outlook of what our future might look like in a certain situation. The seven revolutions are not just problems but challenges to help us better our world and make the earth last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tragic, Action Poem :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of the movie is very interesting, about how "debt" collectors or repo(repossess)-men forcefully take back your donor organs if you don't pay your installments(for "buying" these organs) on time. Although the idea sounds far-fetched, it was portrayed very convincingly in the movie.The directions, performances, the fight sequences &amp; the violence too were impressive.Forrest Whittaker &amp; Judd as the repo-men did full justice to their roles although I felt Whittaker had a slight edge. He was maniacal! Alice Braga as a bar singer is sexy and gives effective support to Judd.Shortfalls? Well I liked everything about the movie except perhaps for the visuals. The locations could have been better especially the interior shots which were not easy on the eye.Verdict: An interesting, action movie but thanks to the heartbreaking end, its more like a tragic, action poem :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of many bad consequences of so called privatisation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not too much gore or violence, no, too much action and cheap thrills - that's the negative side. Otherwise, this is private enterprise in health care taken to one of its many absurd consequences. Now, the point with a society, any society, is that we help one another when help is needed. Even a surgeon needs help when he gets sick and needs an operation - he cannot operate on himself if the operation means being put to sleep. We may be against government and we should be very suspicious about it - always. The best thing would be that all of us did some time governing in our lives and that nobody was allowed to be 'professional' about it. And societies should never be allowed to get to big. Small units and everybody in charge some of the time, that's a possible ticket.Meanwhile, we must understand that there is no nobler cause to spend our tax money than on health care for everyone as far as our medical knowledge is capable to deliver it. We are not put on this earth in order to enhance injustices created by fate. We are put here to give help where help is needed and compensate for the injustices of fate. Any other conception or tricky Darwinist schemes will quickly let us move away from all decency.The business men have no place in the temple and must be kicked out it a humanity, worthy of our care, is to survive.Collectivism has become a dirty word and it is a dirty word if it means unequal distribution of wealth. If however, it means absolute material equality, which is justice, for all people who do as good as they can with the abilities nature has bestowed them - then collectivism is the very opposite of a dirty word and the dirty word is instead individualism as in egoism, which, in truth, is the proper word for it.With absolute material equality there can be no individualistic leader and a bunch of collective cattle. The surgeon that is healthy operates on the surgeon that is sick, who becomes healthy and then can operate on the surgeon, once healthy who got sick. That is what true collectivism is about - helping each other and no leader!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non-Ethical Technologically Advanced Future Wasteland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men is, as far as I know, the proper debut film for director Miguel Sapochnik who has a relatively small amount of directorial experience, mostly for TV dramas and a sole episode of Fringe. I understand from his bio he did a\\\ science fiction short some 10+ years ago, it would appear the category may be a personal favorite.Based on his book called "Repossession Mambo", Eric Garcia's screenplay is straightforward without any engaging dialog as it paints a dark future where the Hippocratic Oath has been forgotten in lieu of Gordon Gecko's "greed is good" mantra. It would seem most human body organs are now available in high-tech synthetic versions for an extreme price. This service is only available through a particularly dark firm called "The Union". Using the model pioneered by no credit needed, small down- payment used car industry, The Union uses the organs to charge exorbitant interest knowing a large percentage of clients will fall 90- days or more behind on their payments at which time a swift repossession of organ means it is now once more for sale. Like the car dealer selling the same car for profit multiple times, The Union is thriving. Jude Law plays The Union's number one repo man, Remy. Remy has a nonchalant smooth efficiency as he goes about repossessing and killing. He also has a very gung-ho partner, Jake, played by Forest Whitaker. Jake truly enjoys his work and isn't interested in moral questions. These two make a formidable pair and "The Union" boss Frank, played by Liev Shrieiber, is reaping the benefits of their vicious o sell/repo/sell cycles If it sounds ominous, it most certainly is?And, you can throw in a good amount of gore for some shock value. Against this backdrop of a near future almost gone to hell, Remy begins to have a kind of conscience rebirth brought on by his wife/mate. She is leaving him if he doesn't get out of repo work causing a kind of disconnect whereby he no longer looks at The Union's arrear client like enemies the military trained him to kill, . His partner, Jake, knows he could lose his partner and he seeks to force a desired outcome where Remy is permanently bound to both him as a partner working for The Union. It doesn't work, and though too late to save his family, Jake runs from his former Union repo life. There's only one problem, the failed attempt by Jake caused Remy to be the recipient of a Jarvik Union financed heart, a heart he can no longer pay for. Remy, the hunter becomes Remy, the hunted. The Union is very much a "Big Brother" who is constantly watching and pulling the strings. More gore and darkness this way comes!I realize that this movie is fairly polarizing, even among Sci-Fi fans. Really, though it has no comic relief, no particularly snappy dialog, and some sensationalistic gore it still has a good enough premise done just well enough to be interesting. I think it's a minor Blade Runner type cultish flick. To those it appeals to it is quite good and is somewhat lauded, to quite a few others it is a failed humanistic sci-fi bore with some porn gore thrown in to further disgust: too dark, too un-redeeming, and a waste of some A-list talent.My take on it is it is a simple (no finesse) good premise of a Sci-Fi story not unlike Philip Dick would write. It has high production values with virtually no attempt at cute dialog or comic relief. So it's a straightforward indictment of a future where society is a victim of progress with no moral compass to guide. What seems a bit scary is the world is moving toward the 'big brother" is watching scenario (The Union = New World Order = One World Gov't.) with little ethical accountability (millions to Wall Street when citizens said no, allowing genetic medical breakthroughs to be patented even though they should be in the public domain in order to create potential profits in the trillions for the big drug makers, as well as general suppression of cures over profitable symptomatic treatments). If nothing else let this movie scare you a bit as to what a future with fewer freedoms and no ethics might be like. A bit sensationalist in the gore department, especially since it stars Jude Law who seems unlikely at best in such a role, and almost simply straightforward to the point of being flat, yet still undeniably compelling enough to warrant a recommendation to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repo Men (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mixed bag of homage, gore, and genuine delight. The basic premise may be interesting, with artificial organs being repossessed. Unfortunately, it follows the same lines as many futuristic films, in having one of the men from the system, having the system turn on him and suddenly having a conscience (Minority Report, Surrogates). I would have preferred something more original, but this was still good stuff. Your enjoyment of this film will depend on your views and morals. Many will see Law as the hero turning against the capitalist pigs. I was the opposite. The only people to blame here are the customers themselves. We are in a recession right now, so take note from this film. Don't buy what you can't afford! I loved the chemistry between Law, Whitaker and Schreiber. They had the right balance of friendship, workmanship etc. Plenty of humorous interactions to highlight some humanity that the ladies failed to bring. The gore is well done, being both uncomfortable and darkly comic. The second half of the movie was annoying to me, as the message seemed to suggest that when corporations treat their clients like meat, just kill everyone. Luckily, it turned it around, in what some people may see as a cop out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gaudy and Overcooked with Little Substance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Repo Men" has very little in common with the old 80's "Repo-Man" to my early relief when viewing. However I realized fairly quickly this new story and presentation was all style and zero-substance, a common problem with movies nowadays. Between the Blade-Runner-esque CGI'd city-scapes and the Logan's Run story parallels, this movie makes a weak and unoriginal attempt at Big-Brother Sci-Fi. Unfortunately the director Miguel Sapochnik has taken way, way too many liberties with picture and sound, smothering us with background bothersome music in 90% of the scenes, and out-of-place in most of those 90% as well. Even the violence is a rip-off from Matrix movies and mightily overdone. If this is supposed to be entertainment I'd grade it a D Grade. Mindless. Yes, in the end this movie has little original, and while the acting is maybe satisfactory, there's no punch or development. It feels like a hack, a cliché. It's a big disappointment given the obvious high production budget and the abilities of the main actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your usual sci-fi, far out, far-fetched but captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline was a very big turn-off when I read it but not after I saw the movie. Tell anyone that storyline while trying to recommend the movie and you'll get reactions, not the approval nod or the smiling support, but the "you're an idiot" kind of look. Anyway, I decided to see the movie strictly because of the body of work of Forest Whitaker, Liev Schreiber and several of the movies in which Jude Law was featured, particularly "All The King's Men". How bad can a movie with these three talented actors be? It took just a little effort to keep an open mind about the storyline and then what I hoped for quickly started to manifests itself, the drama of struggle. Whitaker, Schreiber and Law gave their characters all the power you could expect. The outrageousness of the story was irrelevant; the gamut of emotions of any other good story jumps at you. Treat this movie as just another sci-fi based film and you will be impressed. You must get over the initial shocking idea of repossessing organs. As I write these words, I realize it's a hard sell. The critics, reviews and ratings reflect just how hard a sell it is.If I managed to watch the flick till the end, it had some redeeming value. I recommend it if you have a strong stomach. I'll admit you probably have to be a fan of these actors to consider watching it and if so, you will not be disappointed; otherwise please ignore this review and forget you ever read it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious, but Too complex, while trying too hard too accomplish everything all in one setting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Credit IMDb the future humans have extended and improved our lives through highly sophisticated and expensive mechanical organs created by a company called "The Union". The dark side of these medical breakthroughs is that if you don't pay your bill, "The Union" sends its highly skilled repo men to take back its property... with no concern for your comfort or survival. Former soldier Remy is one of the best organ repo men in the business. But when he suffers a cardiac failure on the job, he awakens to find himself fitted with the company's top-of-the-line heart-replacement... as well as a hefty debt. But a side effect of the procedure is that his heart's no longer in the job. When he can't make the payments, The Union sends its toughest enforcer, Remy's former partner Jake, to track him down.I didn't mind Repo Men, but it didn't exactly leave me breathless either. The overly complicated plot is a bit much for me to handle at times, and I got annoyed with the finale because it was much too complex for me. The best thing about this movie would have to be its quirky style and the amiable chemistry between Jude Law and Forest Whitaker. The ending is brain scrambler; see if you have better luck figuring it out. Jude Law has his moments as our quirky, eccentric hero. I'm not into him as many people are, but he can be a fantastic actor. Forrest Whitaker is great in his role, and plays off Jude Law well. Liev Schreiber is a good antagonist for the two men.Bottom line Thoughtful, but too ambitious to even remotely fully get where it wants to be. This is a failure but an interesting one at that, worth a look, but not much more. Be sure to have your thinking cap in tip top order for this one.5 ? 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sci-fi movie that remembers what the whole point of sci-fi was in the first place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men is a brutally violent, intellectually provocative and superbly well performed tale of an amoral future where life is prolonged by revolutionary artificial organs and death comes when you can't keep up the payments on your new body parts.In a society of government bankruptcy and corporate supremacy that suggests what the world of Blade Runner looked like before everything went to pot, The Union offers people a way to overcome almost any injury or illness. They'll sell you a device to replace the defective part of your anatomy and even offer financing deal if you can't pay the exorbitant up front cost. If you fall more than three months behind on those payments, The Union will take care of that too. They'll send a repossession agent to stun you into unconsciousness and cut the artificial organ out of you.Remy (Jude Law) is one of those repo men. Though his wife Carol (Carice van Houten) is constantly nagging him about moving over into sales, Remy is like an organ harvesting machine. As far as he's concerned, you knew what the deal was when you signed your contract with The Union and if you can't keep up you end, that's not Remy's fault. Slicing someone open to take back their artificial liver or heart and leaving them dead on the floor means nothing to him. Well, it means nothing until an accident results in Remy needing his own artificial heart. That shatters his libertarian/Randian delusions of property rights and personal responsibility, sending him on the run with his best friend and fellow repo man Jake (Forest Whitaker) in pursuit.This is a very good film. It's quite gory and genuinely shocking on several occasions, so it might not be everyone's cup of tea. But this is a science fiction story that's true to the original purpose and meaning of the genre. It's about the effect of advanced technology on human life and behavior, about the social and personal implications of innovation.One of the most striking things about Repo Men is the moral and ethical complexity of its storytelling. The movie begins by inviting the audience to identify with Remy and Jake and to look with scorn at the pathetic souls who can't manage their own affairs and wind up with past due organs. The viewer is led to look at them as sheep and Remy and Jake as more-or-less righteous wolves. But when Remy becomes one of the sheep, that's when the film confronts you with the self-centered and callous arrogance of that perspective.And while Repo Men is about issues like health care on the surface, there's a more fundamental theme running underneath. This is a story about living in an unjust, immoral civilization and how people deal with that. Remy is the man who simply accepts order of his world until he finds himself on the wrong side of the rules and is driven to strike out against newly recognized injustice. Liev Schreiber plays Remy and Jake's boss at The Union. His character is the sort of shallow, soulless robot who can't question the dictates of his society. He sees the way things are and cannot imagine there's anything wrong with them or how they could or should change. And Jake is really more interesting than Remy and is beautifully brought to life by Forest Whitaker. Jake is capable of realizing and accepting what's wrong with his world but is so happy and content with his place in it that he wants to pretend nothing is wrong. When he sees his friend being ground under by the horrors of his country and culture, Jake knows it's wrong but thinks the solution is just to fix Remy's particular problem. He'll do incredible things to try and reintegrate Remy into the way things used to be, but he does not want to consider things being different.I enjoyed Repo Men a lot. It's smart and stylish and has plenty of visceral thrills. You should definitely give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very violent sci-fi film without too many plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was OK, with less plot holes than a lot of futuristic movies. The great Forrest Whitaker is in this and I thought he was good as usual and Jude Law did an OK job also. Law and Whitaker play Repomen, whose job is to reclaim organs from people whom fall behind on payments. Law's wife wants him to quit the job and move to sales, but Whitaker whom has know him since their army days, wants to keep his partner. So, Law does one last organ claim but suffers in accident that leaves him with a new heart. He can no longer do his job because he sees the other side now, so he defaults on payment. Not Law is being hunted by the same guys he used to work with. He teams up with a girl whom has a new everything as they try to escape.So, we get a lot of chase scenes and some cool action. And some of it gets really violent, like the knife killing scene toward the end. Why are executive looking people in suites carrying around meat cleavers? That scene was pretty silly but we learn why at the end, as in (spoiler: did it really happen).FINAL VERDICT: Worth viewing for action fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As always excuse my poor English gram. I will like always not bore you with the entire plot synopses and incredible dull 1000 lined review about how stupid/smart this movie or any movie suppose to be.I think like always that movies are like music, some like Beethoven and there the ones that love Nickleback. so i try to be objective and subjective as how i experienced it.The movie starts out pretty good i must say, but as it prolongs some of the parts did not make any sense. Also its pretty predictable when in the car Forest mentions the m5 dream system i already predicted "Mmmm this will comeback to bite either of them in the buttocks" and i was right.So to be frank to watch this movie for its amazing storyline/plot. There is none, it also to was pretty blunt how the repo men are able to kill so easy. Imagine this is really the future then you deal with a co-operation that sends a murderer to collect the organs.Anyways back to the movie, it is not a bad movie but its neither a very good one. Some of the most illogical things happen. For instance when Jude starts a knife fight with a group of ppl in the corridor (near the end of the movie) you even see one of them has a cleaver in his hands (seriously do you wear one on that type of job security!?) Not to mention, there tons of guns on the floor and he chooses to fight them with a pair of knifes. Then he gets overthrown by the many men that kick his *BEEP*. Then he gets up and the all start with the knifes again. OK thats just plain out idiotic is'nt the want to kill him, the get him on the floor then KICK HIS *BEEP* let him get up so the can all go back to the stabbing frenzy.The end was unlikeable, mainly when the "read" there organs out by simply cutting themselves open and put a scanner in there body by hand to read them out. Well i once went KO from locking my back up, let alone that a human being gets cut open and still is perfectly sane (pain would knock you out) or at least exhaust you tremendously.Well its all good tho its movie, this movie i give a 6. I liked the action and bloody parts. But do not expect a wow amazing flick factor with this one. I love it how Forest is the loose cannon in this movie as i find him a very likable actor! Thats all enjoy this movie, or hate it. With some popcorn and brain put on a low setting pretty enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a really strange, bloody movie, but mostly entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is somewhere in the future, when engineered replacement organs are in common use. Hearts, kidneys, lungs, etc. But these things are expensive, several hundred thousand dollars. But since we don't know what an "average" wage was, we cannot really relate it to a cost today, like a house, or car or airplane. We do know that often the recipients of these organs have trouble paying the notes and, much like a delinquent car loan, the organ must be "repossessed." Jude Law is Remy, and he works for the firm, he is one of many repossession specialists. He goes to work, gets assigned clients, and he hunts them down. He has a neat scanner that gives him information, and weapons that completely debilitate unruly clients. Then he cuts them open and extracts what belongs to the company.His sweet wife pleads with him to get out of the job, she doesn't like what he does, but would be OK with her if he would get a job in "sales" instead.One fateful day the client is cooperating, and as Remy is preparing to give him a shock to stop the heart, the instrument was improperly wired, and Remy gets the shock. When he wakes up some days later, after being in a coma, he finds that he has a new heart, the old one ceased to work after that work-related accident.(Now here is where it gets a bit dicey for me, story-wise. Usually when you get hurt on the job the employer takes care of restitution. But here the employer provides Remy with the mechanical heart, a very nice one, but Remy has to pay for it. If he doesn't within 90 days, plus the 6-day "grace" period, Remy will be hunted down and the heart taken back. It just doesn't seem right!)My wife and I watched it together, she thought it was pretty dumb, didn't like it at all, and I can understand that. I viewed it as an experiment with a novel story line and while I would never call it a good movie I can say I was entertained. That's probably all it was made for, light entertainment.SPOILERS: During the movie we are very briefly introduced to a new "virtual reality" system that allows otherwise incapacitated people to live their dreams. As the movie ends we see Remy and the girl apparently escape the system, and end up on a sunny beach. But then we find they didn't escape at all, but were incapacitated but alive, so they were plugged into this system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the other day on DVD from my neighborhood's Video Rental store. My first impression from the title was car repossessions. Boy, was I in for a surprise! Shortly after the movie had begun, I realized that I now was watching a movie in the not so distant future. Through the advances of science and medical technology, people in this new world have a second chance at life with the use of artificial organs, provided that they can make the payments for the organ or organs implanted in their bodies. When somebody falls behind in their scheduled payment(s), Repo Men are sent to recollect the organ from those people's bodies. This are indeed repugnant and sickening jobs, but this what the Repo Men do. One of the Repo Men (Jude Law) falls victim to a setup and he too becomes one of patients who now has an artificial heart; He too now owes a large some of money for his new heart. Soon he falls behind his payments and is sent after to recollect his heart by other Repo Men. While evading his hunters, he realizes that the only way to stop the Repo Men is to break into the Head Quarters of the Agency and wipe his account clean. However, the end of the movie offers a very strange twist to close this story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Review Comes from a Die-Hard Science Fiction Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I complain about how poor the plot, the acting, the score and the cinematography were, let me start with my main complaint: Why does there have to be so much gore and so many disgusting scenes in a science-fiction movie so much so that you'd need a barfing bag while watching it? Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of the horror genre and I enjoy watching occasional gory horror movies. The problem is I went into this movie expecting to see a science-fiction movie not a gore-fest. I had to fast forward many parts because they were completely out of place and belonged to the horror genre. I need to point out the fact that there's a difference between horror movies that aim to scare you and those that aim to disgust you. Sadly, this supposedly "science-fiction" movie falls into the latter category. My second complaint is about the pacing of the movie, which is too slow and boring. Oh and why isn't there a single good-looking actor in this movie? They are all unpleasant to look at apart from the black guy maybe. Couldn't they just pick a handsome guy to play the main role? I was really disappointed and if there were a zero rating I would've given it. This movie is ridiculously overrated. Avoid it like the plague.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flashy urban sci-fi thriller that tries to emulate "Robocop"s mix of social satire and action: In the future, artificial body organs are big business. A buddy pair of repo men (Law &amp; Whitaker) soon find themselves on opposite ends of this heartless (pun intented!) means of trade.Sound familiar? Well, what was a 2-minute sketch in Monty Python's "The meaning of life" makes the whole concept here, which in itself spells "unpleasant" with a most jarring mix of tones. Has its bits (and Whitaker always makes for an impression) but more and more, this becomes a masochistic excuse for excessive gore and violence, with sometimes laugh-out-loud preposterous story turns and plot holes big enough to shoot hoops through. And how many times can we swallow a lazy twist that nullifies one third of the film? Give us a break!4 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(this review does not contain spoilers however does reveal that drama unfolds in the movie!) Not the most amazing film I have seen however still commendable. I chose this movie from the store as when i read the blurb on the back of the box i was intrigued by the concept. An interesting film very thought provoking concept that makes you think. No ordinary gory action movie, you proceed through half the movie thinking the protagonist's surreal actions are comprehendable and shits just going down cus the characters a badass........then the twist blew my mind!! In fact to be honest this movie is almost worth watching just to experience the twist alone! could not have been expected!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor man's Logan's Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men licensed to kill in the name of organ reclamation are happy in their work. One, however, has a change of heart (quite literally, since his own heart is replaced with a less black one). He is then unable to continue his happy trade and goes on the run with a girl pursued by his former friend.If you think this sounds a lot like the plot of Logan's Run, you're not wrong. But while that film, a minor classic, was clear of its intentions, I'm not sure Repo Men intends to be.Partly it is a satire, or at least I assume it intends to be. It is not funny though due to gruesome surgery scenes through out. Some strange scenes such as the knee surgery by a 9 year old, are incongruous rather than amusing, and one cannot guess as to what their satirical purpose is. The only funny scene is actually the ludicrous and over-the-top climax, but this is unintentionally so.The character motivations seem odd and inconsistent. Forest Whittaker strangely (or maybe not- the ending is garbled) arranged for his friend to have a near fatal shock. Jude Law is not prepared to carry on his work although that means he will die, but is quite prepared to murder unarmed people in cold blood near the end. Again maybe not, depending on what the ending means.Many elements have not been thought through. The knee surgeon for instance does not seem to need to be paid for her work since Law and his girl have no money. But if this is the case why do not more people go to her instead of using the corporation known as the union? A sudden brief appearance by a resistance movement (fronted by an empowered black woman-this is modern Hollywood) is directly lifted from Logan's Run in a similar place. But the Logan's Run scene led to something, this merely peters out. There is literally an orgy of pointless violence at the end. A quiet scene set in an all white room is actually effective as a momentary respite but I'm sure it has been lifted from elsewhere. Then the armed guards of the union burst in and happily and pointlessly shoot their own staff. Oddly, showing this lack of regard they then stand back while another staff member is held hostage.The film is mediocre but the 'twist' ending is baffling and unsatisfactory. Its a pity more was not made of this film, since many of its ideas are good. In particular the potential for satire fell way short of its mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent Vulture Capitalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It makes no difference what the product is, a vehicle or a vascular device, salesmen and corporate types live by the bottom line. In this film we are privy to what might, and probably will, happen when health-care is left in the hands of these insensitive, soulless citizens. To say that this is derivative misses the point. It is only the logical expansion of the predatory nature of mankind. If it can be marketed for profit, it will be. If people won't pay what is owed they will be made to at all costs. This is just a variation on the time tested nature of Man.It is an inevitable future. It is a mess of bloodletting and vulture capitalism taken to its predictable, foregone, grandiose, conclusion. There isn't anything here that is unbelievable, just unsettling. The movie glorifies its gory-ness and loves every blood soaked scene. People here suffer so much pain to exist in this senseless world, one wonders why. The movie is, after all, more about fight scenes and splatter then capitalism vs socialism, it is Actionism. It slices and dices until you become numb and are anesthetized to endure the invasive surgical procedures that are revered as much as the gun play and knife yielding. It is fan-boy fanaticism and vile, violence junkie pulp. It is not deep and doesn't pretend to be, it just cuts that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all it was a good movie if they cut the last few minutes off. The last few minutes were severely lacking and kind of ruined the good feeling you get at the end of good movies. Jude Law was very good, but when is he not? Forest Whittaker was also good, but that's normal. We felt that the story line flowed okay but was a it predictable until the ending. The sci- fi theme was cool but the economic reality was bang on - We can almost expect to be in this place in the next 50 years if not sooner. We think this is exactly where we are all heading. I loved the car - when can we get them The action scenes were good &amp; just was enjoyable to watch, well until the final few minutes....There was good use of language and if it was a book it would be quite a good read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory film with clever twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally dislike Jude Law but thought he was fantastic in this. He definitely suits more of an action role than a rom-com and he played his character with both menace and depth. The boss also played his part fantastically although Jake I felt was somewhat lacking. I'm not sure what it was as Forest Whitaker is superb in all his other films. He just didn't seem to fit into the character and the friendship between Remy and Jake was hard to believe. It had a bit of a slow beginning-it didn't seem like much of a plot line with no clear direction and rather all over the place. It took about 20 minutes for it to really get going but once it did it was superb. The addition of his family, I would assume were there to show that he was a normal guy with a life outside being repo, however I felt that it hindered the film and scenes with his wife just felt stilted and pointless. Had there been more chemistry between the actors, I feel that there might have been more scope for this relationship to be a useful addition to the film. Whilst some of the plot was predictable to begin with, there are many surprising twists and turns from the middle of the film to the end and the ending was a complete shock. Whilst I myself was not a great fan of the ending, I applaud their effort to make a controversial climax. It's not for the faint hearted, with extremely graphic violence and bodily mutilation. I have a strong stomach when it comes to films but even this was too much for me and I ended up watching some of the scenes through my fingers. I would definitely recommend this film to those wanting a lot of action and who can deal with the gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film starts with some good sequences but all the ripping was disturbing and seemed unnecessary in the name of just taking out what is of the 'UNION'. It seemed so unnatural and funny that the government had nothing to do with all the killing. As if they just allowed the companies to kill in the name of giving items. Even if the concept is swallowed somehow than the sequence in which it is shown that they are inside a pink gate and have to destroy the system. they just keep cutting themselves for scanning their organs. It seemed so foolish i just was laughing for the script. But they certainly did startled us when it was revealed that the last sequence was all a dream after Jude law was hit by a heavy metal. And after that the union agreed to pay for him. At one moment earlier they were trying to kill him for their money and after he was killed(Almost) they just tried that he should live. Completely absurd Script.My suggestion - Do not waste time watching unless you are an action freak who would like to see any mindless action film. Also the acting of Whitaker and Jude law was watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I feel a 6.3/10 is fair.Like many others, I am a big fan of Repo! The Genetic Opera. And sure, it didn't get as much of a famed release as this one did, it still had a numbered following that will most certainly call it out when they see ideas ripped straight from others.And to be fair, Repo Men remains fairly unique. The major difference that 'sold' me to stop being so angry about it is the cause of the system: There is no major disease that caused organ failure. Indeed, there is no organ failure at all. A company called "The Union" simply created augmented organs to effectively remove the wait list of transplants. A very viable solution, despite the legalized murder.Everything else was adequate, and I'll say a couple more nice things before I ram the spike of hatred into the heart of this movie, which will effectively spoil the entire thing so stop now if you wish.Jude Law and Forest Whitaker had WONDERFUL chemistry. Their characters felt like brothers, and the flash back to them as children just added some much needed depth. I enjoyed every scene they were in together.The fight scenes were pretty wonderful, especially the one at the end with the hallway. Not much to say other than it was 'pretty cool'.The acting is really what saved it. However there's one major detail that I still don't like about the movie. Incoming spoiler.There's a scene where Remy and Jake fight each other, as Remy is on the run from his former employers. The scene ends with Jake throwing a rusted metalpiece onto Remy's head. He awakes and finds that the girl's interference caused him to miss, so they get back up and escape.Turns out, everything from then on was a dream-hallucinated sequence from a recent 'implant' for those with brain damage. So, in effect. Remy is now a vegetable and the love interest the movie spends all its time characterizing probably gets murdered for her various implants.Sure, maybe it was supposed to give me this reaction. However I -hate- it when movies TRICK me. "Next" with Nicholas Cage did something very similar, where the movie just swings back to what happened in the first hour and just, ends. It makes me feel like my time was wasted. Unhappy endings are fine, but again, not when it has to trick me.That is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree this is not a great movie. The script is particularly weak - what people actually say does not capture the attention. That's why all my respect goes to Jude Law. How he manages to express his personal turmoil through scene after scene is remarkable. We care about this bastard! We react against his wife who comes across as an uncaring, self-regarding cow. An attractive actress, admittedly. We warm to him for loving his son and realise that the boy's love for his dad PROVES he is a fabulous guy in some peculiar way. And my God, he's fit. Jude must spend his life - when he's not working - working out. It's not just that he's a wonderful, ice-cold, unique actor. He has always had this electro-magnetic presence on the screen. He's a star because he has an indefinable 'star quality'. Jude Law is the perfect actor for loner roles. But somebody should write a script for him which is the polar opposite. Maybe Jude as a doctor whose extraordinary compassion makes him unprofessional. Or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***DON'T WORRY THIS IS NOT A SPOILER! (I hate ppl that do that) Normally in movies like this you get introduced to the characters, then a problem occurs, and there is an anxious feeling of some kind ... I don't know, a build up. You feel like you are right there with Rocky, or The Karate Kid training along side him. But in this you have that uneasy-not-sure-who-to-root-for feeling... And it just isn't fun. Don't get me wrong the fight scenes are very good and have some highly entertaining kills. But I just don't like this movie. It feels like the director is trying something new because he is tired of the same old plot in EVERY movie. This is an intelligent film, and it makes you think A LOT! The problem is when watching this film you just don't know what direction it's going in until the very end... Normally that should be a good thing... A thriller even, with twists and a good plot, but there was just something not right about this film. Oh and before I forget acting was amazing good job by the entire cast. So BOTTOM LINE: Only watch this if you are in a horror movie mood. Not sure what it's classified as but horror/action/sci-fi (in that order) is what I would give it. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The future of mankind is uncertain to be sure. But some of the less elegant, yet perhaps more necessary, albeit more macabre are the necessary components which are even now being introduced to the on-going world. This movie is a jump or two ahead of present day, with what appears to be the Corporation giants having gained a decided advantage over the benevolent world we had hoped for. This black futuristic movie, directed by Miguel Sapochnik, is cryptically entitled " Repo-Men " where anyone with the where-with-all and the desire to extend life can purchase replacement body-parts. Although most people choose to buy a replacement heart, liver or other body part, there is a serious catch and that is if you can't make the payments, Union members can and will be sent to 'repossess' the spare part. Jude Law, plays Remy, as serious company man who has little sympathy for deadbeats who cannot honor their contract. Forest Whitaker is his partner Jake and the two play a lethal pair who for a small commission, will stop at nothing to retrieve what they consider Company property. Liev Schreiber, is Frank, their No-Nonsense boss who insists his men, do not think of their gruesome, grizzly work as nothing more than a job. When Remy, begins to have doubts about his work, he discovers the giant corporation has ways to insure his loyalty. To be sure, the film is not for the squeamish and audiences should be advised this chilling, grotesque and certainly horrific movie is only for those seeking thrills in a graveyard. With the addition of superb star John Leguizamo in a Cameo role, this is one Classic which should be stored in the vaults of the Twilight Zone. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moderately entertaining, but it could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men is based on the book The Repossession Mambo, written by Eric García, and its story shares elements in common with the film Repo! The Genetic Opera.Both movies are set in dystopian futures where a big corporation sells artificial bodies in order to extend the life from ill people.However, those individuals who cannot pay the monthly from their new "spare parts" receive the visit from collectors who, without any hesitation remove the bodies in order to return them to the organization.But while Repo! The Genetic Opera was a musical, Repo Men is more similar to Minority Report (adding a little bit of Blade Runner and big doses of bloody violence), due to its fatalist vision of the future and its fractured social satire which does not go as far as it should.The classic subject of "friends in opposite sides from the law" is a popular formula in cinema because it includes the interesting moral disjunctive of "friendship or duty?".Nevertheless, in order to work well, it must be supported by a credible relationship between the main characters, and that is one of the main problems from Repo Men.Forest Whitaker and Jude Law are good actors, but the dynamic created by the screenplay between their characters is very forced, and it spoils what should be the emotional axis from the story.In fact, their characters work better when they become into antagonists, because we do not have the artificial humor and irritating dialogs which are initially employed to establish their relationship.However, I found the movie to be moderately entertaining, specially because of its violent scenes, which are much bloodier than I expected from a mainstream film starred by famous actors.Repo Men pretends to incorporate a little bit of social commentary into the story, by satirizing the ruthless custom from the public health system from the United States.The problem is that co-screenwriters Garrett Lerner and García seemed undecided in the level of parody they should have employed, and as well as we have genuine moments of humor, we also have scenes of an undefined purpose, where we do not know whether they wanted to make us think or if they simply wanted to incorporate violent scenes.Besides, the film has a lack of cohesion during some parts from the first half, something which made it a bit tiring during those moments.I think that Repo Men would have worked better with a more sober style to analyze the future from public health instead of using an unstable combination of blood, black humor and ambiguous social morals which rarely feel fresh or well planned.Anyway, I think Repo Men deserves a slight recommendation because it is moderately entertaining and because of the solid performances from Law, Whitaker and Liev Schreiber.Alice Braga and the great Carice Van Houten do not have too much material to work with, since they are given the roles of disposable romantic interest and generic nagging wife, respectively.In conclusion, Repo Men is not a bad film, but it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent action flick with a good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men is marketed as a sci-fi thriller, but when you get to actually see the film , especially towards the end , you find out that this was more of a social allegory disguised as a science fiction movie. The main character ironically got to answer the question he brought out during the first scenes about being alive and dead at the same time, because that what happened to him in the end, The movie kinda tells us that happy endings and satisfaction in life usually comes off as a fantasy and that we were all born to suffer or something like that.Story aside, the movie is entertaining, has good action but gorily disgusting. It's very violent and disturbing.. Acting by the leads was great especially by Forest Whitaker.Over all,there's nothing really special and memorable in the film except for the twist in the end, I recommend this as a rental If there is nothing else to watch and you're looking for a decent action flick. with a story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repo Men doesn't deliver what it promises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨At the end, a job is not just a job, it's who you are, and if you wanna change who you are, you have to change what you do.¨ Repo Men has an interesting cast and an original premise, but the movie ends up being far from original. It begins with a lot of promise and some interesting characters, but halfway through the movie it begins to lose itself. The twist at the end didn't work for me and I suspected something like that coming. I didn't like how Jude Law's character changed all of a sudden after the heart transplant. It just didn't make sense how someone like him who had been doing his job for years without regrets would all of a sudden stop in the moment he most needed to continue. Everything seems to develop for the screenplay instead of developing the story. This is Miguel Sapochnick's first feature film and he really wasn't able to use the talented cast or the material to its fullest potential. The movie was based on Eric Garcia's novel The Repossession Mambo, and he also worked on the screenplay with Garrett Lerner who wrote several episodes of House MD and Boston Public. I expected more from this movie considering I enjoyed Garcia's book Matchstick Men, which was also turned into a movie directed by Ridley Scott and featuring Nicolas Cage. In Repo Men however, the screenplay is probably the weakest part of the film, which had to use several gory scenes in order to shock us because the characters weren't developed at all. I really didn't expect this movie to be so gory and violent, but it does have some entertaining action scenes.The story takes place sometime in the future although the date is never given. Remy (Jude Law) works for a company called The Union that specializes in selling artificial organs. These organs can be bought through credit and just as when you buy a car or a house and can't make the payment those things are taken away from you, so are your organs. This is where Remy comes in, once payments can't be made after a three month grace period he removes these transplants instantly. He is one of the best in the business at retrieving these artificial organs along with his friend from the fourth grade with whom he even went to War with: Jake (Forest Whitaker). They are called the Repo Men because they repossess what belongs to the Union when the high costs can't be paid. Their boss is Frank (Liev Schreiber),a heartless man who only cares about getting what belongs to him back and selling more organs. Jack and Remy also do what they have to without having second thoughts about it because a job is a job. Carol (Carice van Houten) doesn't like what her husband Remy does for a living and constantly asks him to stop being a repo man and work in sales so he can spend more time at home with her and their son Peter (Chandler Canterbury). Remy suffers an accident while doing his job and has to go through a heart transplant himself. Once he recovers he literally has a change of heart since he doesn't feel right about being a repo man because he begins to identify with them now. Since he can't do his job, he can't pay for his heart either and has to hide from the repo men who are after him. He hides along with another organ refugee named Beth (Alicia Braga) and together they try to fight off these men and clean their credit history.The movie looked promising at first with some good action scenes, but halfway through the movie I began to lose interest. It was hard for me to believe that Remy would have a change of heart just like that and the transformation he went through was not believable considering how cold hearted he was. The cast was pretty strong and they all gave good performances; it was just the story that didn't work. There was an interesting scene near the end that will remind everyone who saw Oldboy of the famous hallway hammer fighting scene. The difference is that this shot was filmed with various different camera angles and edited, while the one in Oldboy was made all in one shot without editing. This scene didn't work as well because all the editing took away the realistic feeling that the Oldboy scene gave. Some other moments of this sci-fi film remind us of Minority Report, but the problem with Repo Men is that we are constantly reminded of these other movies which were far more superior than this one. At the end Repo Men falls short and only is mildly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Best friends Remy (Law) and Jake (Whitaker) are Repo Men but they repossess human organs from people who cannot pay for the implant and become PAST DUE on the scanner used to find the deadbeats. Then an accident puts a new heart in Remy, but the new heart is not into the work he was doing and he loses his wife and kid and falls behind in payments and then??.guess what?Is this where we are headed? This is Sci Fi, but gory, and gruesome and really not that pleasant to watch. There is a lot of cutting into human skin and blood squirting/ dripping and the cringing (that was me), and crying (again me), and quite a bit of yelling (sorry). I wanted to shut this down and I kept asking myself why in the world I was watching something that I really didn't enjoy. Here's the thing: the pace was such that I was helpless. I wanted to see what was next. And, it was mostly in the beginning that all the mayhem above really came about. So it slowed down some. The acting was good, but the subject matter in the beginning was such that you don't want to watch it after a full meal, not even a snack. The fighting and killing stunts were some of the most brutal I have ever seen. They looked to be quite real. Movie magic, I know, but the cringing, crying and yelling continued (again sorry).This had a suitable ending, and I was fine with that; then it had another ending and I didn't like it at all. If you see this, you can decide for yourself. I have heard that this movie was taken, based upon, almost stolen from Repo the Genetic Opera whatever that is. I must say that Jude Law would make a good Joker for the next Batman movie. He really was terrific in a movie I really didn't enjoy. Forest Whitaker always brings his A game. The rest of the cast performed well.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, in the beginning. Language: Yes, mostly in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unequal and searching for a heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men is set in an unspecified near future pretty similar to now except that artificially-created organs are easily available provided you can pay the price. Of course, those being so expensive, you can conveniently play in instalments. However, what happens when you fall back and can't make the payments anymore? That's when repo men come in to repossess your artificial organ. Only problem is that if they do, you're very likely to die because you're missing a vital organ. What a neat simple concept that could provide us with some social commentary on certain issues such as capitalistic ethics, misleading advertising and the health care system. However, don't expect a particularly intellectual sci-fi movie. Repo Men is more of a buddy movie turning into a somewhat romantic one with lots of action and some understated sci-fi trappings. It doesn't seem to know whether it's a drama or dark comedy, and doesn't particularly excel at either, but it's not bad. Of particular note is the pivotal scene involving the repo man having to deal with one of his favourite singers finishing up his last song. I won't spoil anything by saying that our main "hero", played by Jude Law, an extremely effective repo man, eventually experiences a change of heart making him see things from the other side.I liked the first-person narration by Jude Law's character as I thought it would let us get more into his mindset. Unfortunately, it was used a bit inconsistently. The acting was solid, especially from the reliable Law, but the chemistry between two of the leads was doubtful hurting the romantic aspect, not talking about Jude and Forrest Whitaker's chemistry here that was a fine bromance ;-) I enjoyed the story arc up to a certain point about 3/4 through when I suddenly became uncomfortable with the level of violence and cold bloodiness. Heck, I was feeling sorry for the poor people, victims of such carnage. It also became more over the top. Why should we care about our repo man when he obviously doesn't care about (mostly) innocent people doing their job and likely not privy to its seedy underbelly? All this made the "hero's" plight seem less sympathetic and compelling. Granted, the fight scenes were very well shot and pretty exciting throughout. The cinematography itself was dynamic and competent. Something involving bar codes and organs near the end also made me cringe as it felt illogical, not cringe because I found it particularly disgusting but sensitive souls should be warned. Points for originality there, though. It turns out there's kind of a good reason for this tonal shift 3/4 through, but as it started happening, it just bugged me, it took me out of the picture. The ending, which could have been great, also left me somewhat dissatisfied, and not because it was an unconventional ending. It feels as if the movie should have been better. I wasn't moved emotionally as I would have liked to be. I didn't care much at all for the few last acts. I wouldn't mind watching the movie again though, so that's saying something.Rating: 6 out of 10 (Good)</fullReview>

The acting may be called fine but with all those shallow characters there was not much to do. Towards the end I really got mad to myself for picking this movie. I also got this feeling after watching Equilibrium, though I couldn't finish it and didn't figure out what Christian Bale was doing there. Anyway, I don't recommend this repo guys who far from being convincing or entertaining. The four stars I gave are just for technical issues but they don't bail out the film.</fullReview>

Because he does not do as she requires she throws him out of the house and keeps him from seeing his son. Then she has the nerve to be jealous of Beth! "Who's she!?" Carol demands when she sees Remy with Beth. Remy has every right to be with Beth! Carol threw him away so he is free to be with any woman he so chooses! IMDb still says that this isn't enough wordiness, so I'll try to expand on Carol's bitchiness. It just really struck me that Carol would be so jealous of Beth when Carol threw Remy away.

		<shortDescription>Not bad but I've seen much better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men is set in the near future with Jude Law and Forest Whitaker being the main characters in the movie. The story and the idea is a great one and depicts the story of the hunter becoming the hunted, however there were some points in the movie when it felt like it was steering out of control but luckily enough, it steered back on track. The acting was great and Forest Whitaker was brilliant, as he is in all of his movies and Jude Law surprised me with his good performance as Remy, he doesn't deserve any awards but he was good to watch and he made you believe his character. The characters were well created and you liked who you were supposed to like and hated who you were supposed to hate. The direction is great and the visualisation of a near future like this is quite a scary aspect. The greatest thing in the movie was the unexpected ending as it added a nice touch to a great idea.Repo Men is a good thriller movie that's a little heavy on the action but in a good way. Forest Whitaker is brilliant as the tough Jake and Jude Law's performance surprised me as he played Remy fantastically. Even though the acting is without a fault, the movie just wasn't so strong. Some of the action scenes were cool and slick but there were one or two scenes that I found a little ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, the movie was very enjoyable but it's not a movie that I'd remember in ten years time and it's not a movie that I'd watch again in a hurry.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it is actually funny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Summary: Jude Law and Forest Withaker star as Repo Men for an artificial organs producing and distributing company. Their work is a bloody one.Review: I never really understood "So bad it is actually funny". Until I saw this movie. Especially the organ-scan-mambo at the end; that was really worth not turning off in the middle of the movie when I cursed myself for watching yet another crappy movie cause I'm to lazy to finish the latest Bolitho novel. Possibly the worst acting performances of both Law and Whitaker. The director apparently really knows how to drown the last bit of acting talent in anyone... Never mind the implications of being a guy who kills for a company with the sanction of apparently most governments of the world. If you can't pay for something, you give it back. End of story. It's always the same with people, they pay for every crap but as soon as it concerns health, they want it all for free. Nevermind motivation for developing cures (money), reason for developing cures (money) and what you need to develop cures (money). And a question that bothers me since A.I.: Why does Jude Law look so Slavic when he is supposedly a pure bred Brit?Well, the postman always rings twice.Highlight: The MamboNotable Actors: Jude Law (A.I.), Forest Whitaker (Ghost Dog), Liev Schreiber (RKO 281)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good Sci-Fi -- Even Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta say that I really enjoyed this film. In my opinion, it does what a classic sci-fi story needs to: in neatly presents a unique science or future phenomenon and conflict, and it tells a human story that highlights human individuality, ingenuity, and self-determination. Moreover, it does so with humor, compassion, and without cumbersome scientific detail. I thought that all of the acting was excellent, and in-character, including the protagonist's son. Everyone made me respectively care about them or dislike them, as there were supposed to. I was happy with the ending. The film was an exploration of a possible future, not about some grand plan or vision. When the exploration was over, it had to end some way, and the way that it did worked for me. It offered resolution and a lingering ache that made me go on thinking and caring about what I had seen. In my book, all that makes a fine film. I wish that someone had suggested that I see it. I suggest that you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And that's one of the best compliments I think you can give to a movie.For whatever reason, I wasn't expecting much from Repo Men. But I was pleasantly shocked. It manages to be action-packed and thought-provoking at the same time. It also has this element of twisted humor that shows up occasionally throughout and works really well.The very best thing about this movie has to be the use of music, which is brilliant. The way the chosen songs go with the different scenes ranges from demented to ironic to heartbreaking, and it's all amazingly effective.The ending gave me chills.8 out of 10... *rewatching end*... 8 1/2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but I've watched much worse.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it this movie some people don't like, or just science fiction, in general? Compared to many attempts at showing a future dystopia, this one is really no worse. Actually, I think people are just loathe to see something negative that our wonderful world is on track to possibly become. Too much of a probable outcome for us to be comfortable, but isn't that the point? Futurists are predicting human brain implants for memory enhancement as early as 2040-2050. Is this portrayal, as strange as it seems, really so far-fetched? Even half-way decent science fiction appears few and far between. This one is not the masterpiece people want, but not every movie can be a masterwork. It's definitely above-average from my observation of the genre. Constant, harsh criticism creates an unrealistically high expectation, in my opinion. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for its entertainment value with some scientific and existential philosophy thrown in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, IMHO, is a future cult classic. On one level it is a mindless action film about the sale and eventual repossession of organs, on another it is a clever film that has a lot to say about human behaviour and the division between reality and fantasyUnusually the film seems to tackle complex issues without smashing you over the head with them, take for example the relationship with between Remy and his wife. His wife is desperate for Remy to quit the front-line work of hunting non-payers down and removing their organs and instead wants him to sell the organs (which they will never be able to pay for), to any sane watcher the two roles are as bad as each other!I also like the way in which the film implies a world without a free press, again without being explicit, it appears that the organ removal procedures are well known to those about to have them taken away but the man on the street is blissfully unaware of the consequences of what they are getting themselves in to.The ending is a work of genius, you are left not knowing what has really happened - were the last 30 minutes Remy's fantasy or someone else's. In a world where anyone can have their brain overridden anything is possible and you would never know whether what you were experiencing was real or fantasy (I love the scene with the kid shooting his mum, obviously a fantasy where the boy loves Remy the most)The acting is also top notch, the main three characters Forest, Jude and Liev are all superb and make what could have been a very lightweight film have far more depthIt is worth noting that the film isn't without issues but the above is just a fraction of the things I picked up in the film and therefore it challenged me more than any other Scifi film this year</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gory sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget anything to do with the Emilio Estevez movie from the 80s. This one is out and out sci-fi with buckets of blood. Spare part surgery is big business, mainly because you sign people up for huge loans to pay for it. Then, when they default, one of the repo men arrives and repossesses the organ, with inevitable results. Remy (Jude Law) is one of the top repo men, but after he ends up having to have a transplant himself, his viewpoint changes.I enjoyed this well enough despite a large number of reservations. For a promising idea, it wasn't handled very well. There were a lot of story elements which simply weren't handled very well - the two which spring to mind mostly are a) Remy being lumbered with the transplant cost by the company whose faulty equipment caused the incident leading to him needing the transplant in the first place, and b) Jake's risible motivation for interfering with some equipment. I was also highly bemused by just how many people had some sort of transplanted organ - Alice Braga's Beth seemed to be more or less made up of bits which didn't really belong to her.The sound was quite bad in places - there was a fair amount of dialogue I either couldn't hear or couldn't make out. Carice van Houten was underused, and I thought Jude Law was miscast. And the sequence in the pink room was ludicrous.On the other hand, I liked Forest Whittaker, and the ending, though not original (Jonathan Pryce, anyone?), was unexpected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Not Good Enough To Recommend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two childhood friends grow up to become repo men, but not of the ordinary sort. In this future, human organs (or the mechanical versions of them) can be repossessed by the firms that sell them if payments are not made. The problems inherent in that are obvious, but this film stretches the problem to the limit.This film has a lot of potential. A good concept, great actors (Jude Law and Forest Whitaker) and a decent plot. But for the most part it falls short. If you like blood and action, this has some really good scenes for you -- particularly the hallway scene where Jude Law's character eliminates an entire staff... that, and an erotic surgery scene almost redeemed this film.But overall, it's too dry in parts, seems way too unoriginal once you've seen "Repo! The Genetic Opera" (which is the better film)... and the ending just doesn't give you the sort of closure you want. Some say it saves the film, others say it ruins it... I won't say my thoughts, but I can say it's not as good as it could be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated and Misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People seem to be unable to understand this movie for whatever reason, saying "random one liners are thrown in for no reason.", "The love interest is unnecessary and doesn't make sense.", and "The surgical sex is just a way for them to score some points for doing something weird."...Let me fill you in, in case you're one of the chosen few morons who don't get it... The story about the cat in the beginning isn't a pointless thrown in story that has nothing to do with the movie. It's being told as he writes his story about his life as a Repo Man, as he reflects on a story he heard and never understood. "How can something be alive and dead at the same time?".. He mentions this because he is now being hunted by The Union who want to repo his heart which he didn't want to take in the first place, but needs it to live. THEREFORE: His heart is keeping him alive, yet at the same time, it's what is causing his death. Apparently that's too hard for people to understand?The love interest is the girl he saw singing in the bar, who he couldn't stop staring at while she sang. Due to all her artiforgs, she is also being hunted by Repo Men, and as he says, "I have an artificial heart, she has an artificial everything else. We're two pieces of the same puzzle.".. Without her, the movie would just be Remy sneaking into The Union store and taking his heart out of the system, as he tried to do before he got caught, but didn't have time enough to do all the artiforgs. So she is necessary for there to be a movie, or it would just be a 30 minute short film.Lastly about the surgery sex scene. You can't complain that this whole scene makes no sense. He kills about 40 repo men in the hallway defending the door, all by himself, then cuts himself, and her open in order to repo their organs and get them out of the system to buy his life back. This makes perfect sense, and if anything, should have been even crazier and more unbelievable. Because, as you find out after, THAT WHOLE LAST HALF OF THE MOVIE IS A DREAM. So yes, anything he wants to happen WILL happen, because that's what he wants. He's basically living the rest of his life out in his own personal movie. Was that too mind boggling to understand? He can make anything he wants to happen, happen.If you appreciate an awesome, well thought out, well written, and very well done sci fi, watch this movie, its probably one of the best sci fi's to hit the shelves in the last 10 years. Original story, sends a message, and just all out bad ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A watchable alternative to equilibrium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film for sci fi fans. There are numerous nods and winks to various other classics in this genre, some more subtle than others. Perhaps this is why i want to defend it, however, it does suffer from some poor dialogue, only the barest references to character development, and the plot is strikingly formulaic. This film feels like its trying to bring, Children of Men, Blade Runner and Brazil, with the action and plain aggression of The Bourne series. which despite law's best efforts doesn't really work, but only if you expected more. It does have it's positive points though particularly as a series of fight (whether these count as fights is debatable) scenes it's a perfectly watchable alternative to Equilbirum, although not as good, but still better than Aeon flux. But it's still fun, although it seems to take it's self a little more seriously than either of the previous and maybe that's why so many dislike it so. I get the strong impression that if it were remade with a laugher track and a joke or two it would be much improved. I also enjoyed the interesting division between the Blade Runner city scape with the very normal suburbs. It's nice to see that the future isn't that far away. Unfortunately, the blending of the two does lead to a classic sci trait of horrible cars, a problem which Gattaca resolved nicely. There are other questions about the future which go unanswered, but then again no one likes spoilers.In conclusion, not great, not terrible, but isn't too far off the mark when considered against it's peers. Incidentally, for those wondering about organ replacement and hire purchase schemes in this film, perhaps you should wonder about why the M 5 thing exists? if it only allows them to dream happily until death how is that different from a comma? or better than the person dying? and how can it be worth the expense?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the subject matter, I had hoped to get much more from this film than I did. Hoping for a sci-fi thriller along the lines of Minority Report and A.I. (fully expecting some gore of course), the support for the story was lackluster. Although it was a pleasure to watch Jude Law trot through a city very close to home for me, and to hear some of my favorite songs through the film, it was not enough to keep my attention. My main problems? Excessive and unnecessary gore, poor character relations and development (very unnatural), and a lousy surprise ending that seems to only serve as an explanation for some things near the end, amongst other things - all serve to make you feel like you walk away with nothing. It has been a long time since I have seen a film with such bad characters, that not even Jude Law or Forrest Whittaker could hold this film up on it's feet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking forward to watching this movie because it sounded like an interesting storyline. When it finally came out on DVD, I rented it immediately. I was disappointed that I wasted a few dollars on it, so I can only imagine how mad I would be had I spent money to see it in theaters. I couldn't even make it through this movie, I stopped watching about a half hour into the movie. While this is supposed to be set in the future, are we to believe that in the future they go around killing people who can't afford to make payments? A ridiculous story line kept me from taking this movie seriously at all. I am a huge fan of Jude Law, but have to wonder what he was thinking when he accepted this role? Save yourselves, this movie isn't even worth renting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Repo This Movie From The Theaters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Booo!! At least Repo! The Genetic Opera (a movie with a very similar plot) knew it was a fantasy and was able to laugh at itself, and so it successfully crossed the reality boundary and we could suspend our disbelief. But Repo Men, on the other hand, takes itself too seriously, and as a result, it just doesn't work, not for a minute, because it is completely unrealistic and we can't understand anyone's motivations.How can we believe, for example, that a corporation that is so technologically advanced, that it can create artificial body organs, would hire mindless brutes to hack up their clients with butcher knives in order to repossess said organs? And that such a corporation is run by a single individual, the bad guy from Wolverine no less? That premise would work if this movie had the tone of a comic book, but it doesn't. It tries to play out the ridiculousness in a real word scenario. So nagging questions bug us and keep us from enjoying the film. Like, wouldn't it be more economically feasible just to tazer the defaulters and then bring them into some type of sterile operating room where the extraction could be done more properly, instead of ripping their guts out right in the middle of the street? Or, at least, give the repo men some modern equipment like lasers for less sloppy surgery? And how could the public be ignorant of this brutal style of repossession when mutilated bodies are stacking up on a daily basis? And all that murder doesn't make the news? What kind of government allows this to happen? In fact, we aren't told anything at all about this futuristic society's structure other than that, well, oh my, repo men go around ripping organs out of people.Forrest Whitaker completely wastes his talent; he plays a stereotype of himself. He won an Oscar, so why is he stooping to this kind of dredge? Why doesn't he take on a more serious role like a new version of Columbo or something? He has that eye thing going on, after all. Jude Law is simply annoying as the Repo Man who is suddenly on the run, ala Total Recall or a dozen other movies. All the acting is horrible but the writing is worse. Even Minority Report makes more sense than this trash. It's as if they took some old formulaic script and simply replaced the Surrogates or Terminators or Robots or whatever with Repo Men but left everything else the same.As a story, Repo Men makes absolutely no sense. It goes from one preposterous scene to the next, as if what happened in the previous scene has no consequence. There is one scene toward the end in which Jude Law takes on a dozen men in a sort of music video fight scene that is halfway cool, but since nothing prior to that establishes Law's character as a martial arts expert, even that bit of relief to the boredom ends up coming off as pure stupidity. The film moves on from there into an admittedly pretty original scene of mutual surgery between man and woman, offering the only haunting images of the film, but by then we are already at the last ten minutes of the ride, so it is too little, too late. And even that is spoiled by a forced Vanilla Sky ending that simply adds to the pessimism of the entire show. And the special effects suck too.Blah!Repo Men tries so hard to be Blade Runner but it fails miserably. This mess is completely boring and predictable. If you must see it, wait until it comes to one of those one dollar movie dispensaries outside of your local grocery store. At least then you won't feel ripped off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll give it 9 stars, it's a good action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I viewed this movie Monday with a few friends, I was very happy. First, this movie is rated 16+ in my province, and being 14 years old, the man at the cash register was nice enough to let me buy a ticket for this movie. I was also happy that the film turns out to be an awesome flick that somehow managed to disappoint me within the last 30 seconds. Repo Men talks about a society (The Union), who, in a near future, is a group of people who can replace any organ in your body. But if you're not able to repay within a certain due date, the Repo Men (who are Jude Law, Forest Whitaker and a bunch of other people) take that organ back. Basically, it's like a bank, and the bank can loan it to you but the loan has a due date.Well Remy here (Jude Law) gets a heart transplant one day, a new type of heart that he knows he will never be able to pay. When the due date comes, Remy cannot pay the heart, so his boss Frank (Liev Schreiber) sends a bunch of people, including Remy's best friend Jake (Forest Whitaker) to find him. What follows is an explosive and adrenaline rushed chase that just never stops. Of course the film is high on gore, but right when the trailer came out, that was something you should have been looking forward to. The script was well-written, always keeping you guessing what happens next, and while some of the actions scenes were filmed a little too quickly, I felt that the result of those scenes still produced an adrenaline effect.The acting is pretty good. Jude Law is good as Remy, although many people will believe that this is not Law's best movie. Forest Whitaker looks awesome as Jake, it feels different to see him in that kind of movie. Liev Schreiber seemed perfect as Frank. The story was kind of disappointing in the last 30 seconds, because you are left to believe that everything that happened since Jake and Remy's fight was Remy's imagination, and I just couldn't make me believe that. That last sequence, with Frank describing his new product however was awesome, and left me hungry for a sequel. The visual effects were great, and while I wouldn't call it Academy Award worthy, they were still pretty good for what you usually expect from this kind of movie.All in all, I felt that this was a great movie. Although perhaps not worthy of a pure 10 out of 10, I agree with another IMDb reviewer that perhaps this will go down in history as being a cult movie that was rejected by both the public and the critics. If you're one of the unlucky people who hasn't seen Repo Men yet, don't be fooled by the critics. You might leave with a funny taste in your mouth but it isn't a movie that will bore you to death. I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I am rounding a very generous 9.5/10 to a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie that tried too hard...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had some ups and downs but eventually fell flat on it's face due to poor directing and horrible writing.First off, there were different components of the directing that weren't so bad. I felt as though I was IN the movie. The fantastic graphics, costumes, and lighting of the movie made me feel as if I was in the story. The writing, however, did the exact opposite. Some of the writing could have been saved by good directing, however, that did not seem to pull this one through either.The Writing: Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen a movie try so hard to be good. They tried everything! They tried over-the-top action, romance scenes, a "epic" ending, hell, even a cliché twist! What needs to happen in this type of movie, the "fall in love and save yourself and the girl" type movie is character development. This movie provided none. The main character "Remy" played by Jude Law was decently acted, but none of what he did made sense. He loved his wife and kid, gets kicked out of his house, and 4 days later hes having sex with a random girl he just met. Not only that but none of it was believable. A stupid comment about her lips gets them both head-over-heels in love! In addition, he talks about he can no longer kill someone because it's wrong and then goes out and violently murders other people. All of this makes you feel like the character is a wanna-be hero who is just a punk who has a messed up moral compass. The little curve ball thrown by Jake, played for Forest Whitaker is also extremely stupid and possible the worst part of any script ever. I want you to be my teammate forever, so now I'm going to almost kill you and ruin your life. WHAT.The action scenes were boring as hell and at times overly done. The music made them even funnier as it was trying to be intense when really the characters weren't doing anything exciting.Overall just a horrible horrible movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, if you have watched the musical "REPO", then you definitely want to sink your teeth in to "Repo Men", as they are right up the same alley. Of course, one being a musical and one being a movie, but still, they are basically about the same thing.The story of "Repo Men" is straight forward and easy to follow. If you can't pay your bills on your implants, they will be reclaimed by The Union, and here comes the repo men into play. (Just like in the musical "REPO").There is a steady stream of constant action and thrills throughout this movie, so you are never left bored. And the ending, well that I didn't see coming, that was a really nice touch! I am not spoiling it by saying how it ends, but trust me, it is nice.The actors in the movie was quite nicely cast. Especially Whitaker and Law play very well opposite one another, they support each other well and the chemistry works quite good.The effects throughout the movie was nice as well. Do not expect to see a myriad of CGI effects to dazzle even a blind guy! But this movie doesn't really need all that fancy CGI, it does very well with ordinary effects and gimmicks. The scenes and settings were nice, showing a somewhat bleak and lifeless future.In overall, this is a rather nice movie, but in my opinion, it is not the type of movie that you will watch again once watched. It just doesn't have that quality to it. But still, it is one heck of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the near future, the company "The Union" provides expensive prosthesis to improve the lives of the clients. However, the company sends repo men to retrieve the artificial organs for those that do not pay the installments. The former soldiers Remy (Jude Law) and his best friend Jake (Forest Whitaker) are among the best repo men of the company; however Remy's job cost his marriage and his wife Carol (Carice van Houten) leaves him. When Remy is ready to request to be transferred to the sales department expecting to save his marriage, he has an accident with a defibrillator and he needs heart transplantation. The prosthesis is very expensive and Remy changes his behavior after the medical procedure, and he is no longer capable of chasing the debtors. Meanwhile Remy helps the singer Beth (Alice Braga), who owes a large amount to The Union, and sooner they are chased by the repo men."Repo Man" is a gore and violent film with a predictable plot. The story has a poor description of this futuristic society, where a corporation has the power of God, tricking clients and using abusive means to retrieve the prostheses from those that do not pay the bill. When we see the line of production, it is hard to believe that the prostheses are so expensive that the company needs to retrieve them. If the intention is to intimidate the clients to pay, this type of marketing would never work. Therefore, the principle of the story is stupid and contradictory.

		<shortDescription>Some terrific stuff completely trashed by absurd and clumsy directing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men (2010)This could have been a powerful and exciting movie, with three great actors (Law, Whitaker, and Schreiber) and an interesting idea. The writing is either silly or redundant, and that doesn't help, but mostly it's a matter of direction and lots of bad decisions, too many to get into, ranging from pauses that didn't make sense to needless interludes to needless fistfighting.There really are aspects to the movie that are excellent--the many sets, for one thing, and the vision of a near future that seems pretty accurate (neon ads and large buildings and a crossbreeding of the modern and the industrially decayed). There are troubles even here, though, with scenes of ultra normalcy (bar-b-cues) and scenes of improbable (impossible) medical violence (removing a kidney in a cab a minute later). And back to the actors--even here it's an issue of casting. Jude Law pulls off a desperate bad guy better than you might think he would, but he's just not an action-adventure type. Forrest Whitaker, likewise--his canny sensitivity is wasted. Liev Schreiber has little to do and he does it functionally, which is not like him. Expect a clumsy production with some curious twists. At times there is such beautiful irony just at the tip of everyone's fingers (like the artificial organ factory), it's painful that it's in a rough and tumble action flick like this. Oh, and did I say it's downright stupid at times, like when the police never ever ever hit their target when shooting? Talk about gratuitous blood.The soundtrack has got to be terrific, however. Check that out somewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first scifi film i have actually hated. i love scifi, i wathc them all the Hollywood ones,the old ones,the b-movies (most of them are).i can forgive a lot for a scifi movie if the concept is good in its bones.This movie is based on two long time friends working as repomen. they basically take back modern version of pacemakers etc when they cant pay the bills.they cut people open in the street. they kill them in the homes and has some gore.But the movies has a twist. the difference between this movie and a good movie is if you use a anecdote detail to change the point of view from a film it must only change the way you see the same structure from a to b.but in this movie it actually deletes 1/3 of the movie and removes the reward for dragging yourself trough this black bitter depressive sludge that the other 2/3 are.this movie tells you that:friendship is false and pointless. love is false and pointless. that this movie is false and pointless. that the viewer is false and pointless.its the only scifi where i have wanted to meet the movie maker behind it and punch him in the face for wasting my time with some personal bitter scorn against the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although it looks like a sci-fi man-on-the-run thriller, Repo Men is substandard action that takes itself far too seriously and, in fact, isn't really sure what it wants to be when it grows up. Jude Law stars as an employee of a company that sells artificial organs to lucky ducks who need them ? at high interest rates ? and then repossesses them when the payments aren't met.The ads for this movie made it look almost like a satirical look at health care. Repo Men is set in the near future, when apparently everyone needs organs of some kind. Law plays Remy, the top employee at The Union (of course he is) who undergoes an epiphany when he blacks out and needs a new heart (of course he does), the payments for which (of course) he eventually can't make. Will The Union send someone ? maybe his longtime partner Jake (Forest Whitaker) to repo the heart? Or will Remy, who now sees how badly immoral he's been, somehow topple the evil predatory corporation? We'll pretend, for the sake of argument, that this is science fiction. After all, you don't see companies ? private companies, mind you ? attacking citizens and harvesting their organs, right? But that's about the only fictitious aspect of this movie, because it's mired in clichés of movies and everyday life anyway. Sci-fi can be tough to write; it has to be smart enough to stand under the weight of its own science but be entertaining enough to sell the plot. Repo Men isn't smart or entertaining, except to bloodbath aficionados, I suppose.What is Remy's motivation, except to survive? Are we supposed to see him as the plucky good guy going up against an evil company? Tough to do that when he slaughters scores and scores of people, even unarmed, even by hacksaw and sword. Remy doesn't seem so much as someone trying to do the right thing as someone trying to settle a personal score. Naturally, this culminates with an extended fight scene in which Remy ? and his new heroine, Beth (Alice Braga) ? take on not only tough goons from the corporation but also apparent office wonks, complete with neckties and pocket protectors and armed with almost nothing.The ending is especially ludicrous, involving a hare-brained scheme to get themselves out of The Union's system (which shows them as delinquent), as if that's all it takes. Remy accomplishes this in full view of the company's honcho (Liev Schrieber) and his own (ex) partner, Jake. "See, I'm not in the system! I rule!" Well, yeah, but they saw you do it and they know you're overdue, so what the heck, Jake? It's not Chinatown.Repo Men is riddled with plot twists that are either blindingly obvious or make little sense. Even propelling the plot isn't a task these twists are up to. To be sure, there's plenty of action, but it feels almost out of place. It's also very bloody, which you expect from a movie in which the main characters slice open living humans to grab their livers or whatever, but it's very bloody on top of that, with knives slammed into necks, limbs seemingly hacked off, and so on.The two twists near the end are almost Shyamalanesque, in that they seem to be there merely because they're twists of some sort, not because they're plausible or, you know, not ridiculous.Repo Men might not be the worst of the first quarter of 2010, but it has to be a front runner. A waste of a good cast, particularly Whitaker and Schrieber.</fullReview>

Forrester is really menacing and lends his heavyweight acting presence to the role. Still, I cannot believe people are rating so low , do they simply not get it? Its a sci fi action flick, entertaining and a good way to spend a few hours.(ie rotten tomatoes 22%!!! its captivating, thrilling and intelligent. The action scenes are awesome, really well crafted. Only bit that frustrated me was Jude Laws wife crackpot turn, I mean "a jobs a job" , right? well acted, good action, great pace, good twist , simply put- great film entertainment</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stripped of any ambition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paris Hilton got there first but Jude Law proves this material is just as bad with an A-list actor. Based on Eric Garcia's novel "Repossession Mambo" (and Hilton's off-key musical "Repo: A Genetic Opera"), "Repo Men" (scripted by Garcia and Garrett Lerner) takes place in a not-to-distant future where bodily organs are scientifically created and sold for a hefty price. Law plays Remy, the man assigned to surgically take those organs from you if you miss payments. It's grisly work, but he and his partner Jake (Forest Whittaker) see it as any other job benefiting society. Only Remy has a change of heart (in mores ways than one) after a freak accident and he decides to help a cocktail singer named Beth (Alice Braga), whose parts are almost all synthetic. So is the movie. Any ethical issues are put on the back burner for a straight-forward and predictable chase where Remy butts heads with Jake and his boss (Liev Schreiber) and participates in a lot of generic gun and knife battles. The blood and gore is infinite and this is another crappy-looking future complete with grime and the heartlessness of science. Neither is surprising or fun to look at. And the direction from first-timer Miguel Sapochnik shows its cracks, from the poor shifts from vicious action to playful comedy, to dragging it out way too long; but I doubt even Kubrick could have handled one bizarre interlude between Law and Braga where both must stuff a scanner underneath each other's skin to process their organs (don't ask!). Law makes for a bland action hero and the only one who seems to be having any fun here is Whittaker. This all leads to a twist ending that only thinks it's being clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the first 40 minutes or so, I wasn't sure if I liked this or not. I could see that the movie wasn't too ambitious, and seemed to shoehorn some elements (family problems, love interests etc.) that we just apparently have to have in every movie. But, it did get better towards the end. I can appreciate some aspects in this film, even though it does lack certain qualities."Repo Men" reminds me of many movies based on Philip K. Dick's stories. It isn't one, but it damn well could be. There are themes that are familiar from "Minority Report", "Impostor", "Equilibrium" and even to some extent "Total Recall". All those films are clearly above this one, but I'd say this is worth seeing at least once.The main flaw with this movie is that it doesn't always seem to know what it is and what it wants to make us feel. We do get basically everything: characters, drama, action, explicit non-PG13 violence, humor, sci-fi, a catchphrase and even a little twist - but it lacks a certain focus and some opportunities are lost, thus taking away from the impact. These tonal changes don't always work. Add a soundtrack that's sometimes very good and other times the exact opposite, and you get a movie that tries too hard for what it is, leaving many people disappointed.Jude Law does a decent enough job, and Forest Whitaker is always fun to watch, even though he's hamming it up a bit sometimes (not necessarily a bad thing). Liev Schreiber is entertaining as the face of the corporation.Think of it as a B-movie along the lines of "Impostor", that would be my advice. As such, it is entertaining and does it's job, and can possibly surprise some people in a positive way. There's no 100M dollar CGI budget either, so it's easier to digest this way. The sci-fi elements are certainly not hard sci-fi, so take it as it is. A simple adequate movie that often misses the mark, but never by a mile. If you have nothing to do on a rainy day, might as well see this - it's definitely not a disaster. I don't regret getting the blu-ray at a discount. Probably won't watch it again, but no regrets nonetheless.</fullReview>

I guess what makes the movie so great is the surprisingly understandable twists and turns. The plot is amazing really, if you think about it. This is a completely new idea of the near future. Originality helps so much; especially in movies. It keeps you interested, and thinking; but not as much thinking required for "Inception" gratefully. I just hope we never experience this. The main thing is to not forget humanity and everything it stands for. Peace to us all. Also, I couldn't help but notice the boy who played the younger Remy. Is Raff Law Jude Law's son?

		<fullReview>Yes, it rips off Repo: the Genetic Opera, Gattaca, Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, Dark City, Total Recall, and others. It also has stylistic similarities to movies like the Resident: Evil movies, (the icky) Aeon Flux, and (the cringe-worthy) Ultraviolet.But this isn't nearly as campy as R: tGO. This is a better screen adaptation, in my option, than Vanilla Sky. Law is a better actor than Ethan Hawke or latter-day Tom Cruise by far, and with Oscar winner Forest Whittaker as his sidekick, how could it truly lose in comparison? Have no doubt, it IS campy, most certainly a B-movie. It's no Blade Runner, for instance, for all that it hints capably at an ever more debauched and cynical future. But it is also nuanced and thoughtful and beautiful in its own way, much as Alice Braga is. While Cameron Diaz is a looker, most (some?) of the time (in a completely Hollywood sort of way), as she was in Vanilla Sky, Alice Braga is thinking man-gorgeous: rough around the edges, and never less beautiful for her lack of artifice or for the absence of make-up. Those eyes! That Mona Lisa smile! She has an easy sensuality no doubt inherited from her smoking-hot (and vastly underrated) mother Sonia; she's a tangible, real-world fox who seems not at all airbrushed, waxed and unattainable. Also, there's more of a palpable passion and attraction between Law and Braga than Cruise and Diaz, Hawke and Thurman, etc. Though director Miguel Sapochnik wastes little time on developing the "true love" relationship between leading man and -woman, he doesn't really need to, as his romantic leads (and Whittaker) speak volumes with body language, facial expressions, and chemistry.Tony-winner Liev Schreiber, as always, plays an smarmy asshole wonderfully. The RZA's turn as an over-leveraged musician rings true. And the soundtrack/score is both appropriate and memorable.Give this flick a chance. I think that successive views will force you to realise that it's not nearly as forgettable or easily dismissed as it might initially seem.And after all, for all its sci-fi trappings, it IS a tale of doomed love/rs...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overdue organs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We currently live in a consumerist world where almost everything is on a payment plan--car, house, flat screen TV--that comes with exorbitant interest rates and endless monthly bills in the mail. This film gives that sentiment a gut-wrenching yet darkly humorous and sometimes flashy twist as it shows a company in the slightly distant future that has a right to legally take back their manufactured organs from living, breathing people who can no longer make payments. A person is tracked down by commissioned bounty hunters called "Repo Men" who knock someone unconscious and then literally extract the merchandise right then and there in a hasty, gruesome fashion. No time for ambulances and hospitals, because guess what? You ain't gonna to make it.A suburban man named Remy (Jude Law) works in this corporate, uncaring business where humans are moved along and disposed of like cattle. Where there's money, there's always someone to do the dirty work to their own kind and over the years he's seen all the reactions and pleads that you can name just before they bleed to death. Except it pays the bills and supports his wife and kid, giving him more power to his do-what-I-have-to, do-what-I-can philosophy because at this point he's got all the reason and nothing can touch him. Though his wife wants him to move over to sales with less pay but more stable hours despite racking up the bounties by the boatload. His partner Jake (Forest Whitaker) is the true sadist of the two and the only person that he respects is his childhood buddy Remy, despite having two wildly different looks and accents. He's always been there with him and sees him stepping away from what they built up together as a slight in their close knit friendship.This switches between several tones as it progresses, going from a movie with some wit about the unstoppable power hungry, then turning the tables and gaining some perspective from an accident and Remy getting a manufactured organ of his own, to some romance with a former singer that played at a bar he frequented, and then a fugitive on the run flick as he by chance catches back up with her and has to erase both their names from the system. It manages to grow and expand, all the while maintaining a purposeful exaggeration and a certain pessimistic playfulness and sarcasm. This is a futuristic world where there are new gadgets and gizmos as well as space is small and advertisements are everywhere in the inner cities like "Blade Runner." Though Remy has to go through some gritty locales that are unkept like a World War III backdrop to avoid scanners picking up his and her organs being tagged as behind in payments.Forest Whitaker plays a frightening role by managing to keep you guessing if he's completely bonkers or has some reasoning somewhere under that bulky front. He holds their motto "a job's a job" to heart and the only thing that cools his heals is money: to making it or getting in the way of it. Jude Law keeps the various tones together, going from tough and untouchable to contemplative and caring. Alice Braga as Beth keeps it simultaneously strong and sexy as she kicks a drug habit, gets a few nasty injuries and manages to get intimate despite the often dirty settings. Some of the fight scenes are somewhat surprising for a Hollywood film, as there are still frequent edits in between takes, though the camera usually captures the actor doing their own stunts in plain view instead of showing a fist flying this way or a blank back of the head shot that. Not only that, when a guy gets shot or stabbed, he takes one for the bloody team in full view."Repo Men" is a modern day satire at its cruelest down to its twisted ending with a twist. There are some plot holes glazed over for poetic license though the movie moves at a steady enough pacing and gets its main areas right. Like "The Road" it has a message about what we can become and are capable of as humans when we travel down a dark pathway, though delivered in a lighter, jeering manner. This is a future where there's no human rights activists, just a cold and calculated empire that gets people hooked and then drains them. With diminishing health, drug dependency and addictions (here Q habit) our bodies are pushed to the limits of what they can endure, and it was only inevitable that a company would step in to capitalize and make a commodity out of it.This is an entertaining social commentary that manages to treat serious subjects like popcorn cinema with some black humor and homage to other films. It gives mention to our constant demand for possessions, health care, our obsession with bigger and better, and other contemporary disorders such as surgical and cosmetic addiction. In one way it is reminiscent of "Gattaca" in which we want to upgrade ourselves to perfection, not realizing those certain kinks make us unique even if they aren't what the supermarket magazines tell us who we should be. What made this film work was it was capable of balancing an excessive side and then include a certain bit of measurement to make it seem slightly possible enough to raise some questions for productive debate.

		<shortDescription>An above-average, entertaining sci-fi action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie a lot when I watched it, mostly because it met my expectations, and even exceeded them a little. (Recently I tried watching Surrogates, which I thought would be awesome, but I found it literally unwatchable - I only survived the first half of it. Therefore: expectations for technology- and action-centric, dystopian future society movies = lowered.) I figured Repo Men would be a neat sci-fi action flick, emphasis on the "action", with lots of gore and - more importantly - lots of Jude Law. Not a movie that I would think about for a long time after watching it, but a movie that could take my mind off things for a little while. It was exactly that - with a little extra.It wasn't super deep, it wasn't super thought-provoking, it's not the best movie that's ever been made. You could write paragraphs about how the plot isn't solid. Many people already have, so I won't bother. Suffice it to say, it's true - when you start to think too hard about the plot, you realize logic is thrown out the window on multiple occasions during this film. But then again, we're talking about a movie built around the premise that a private company hires, well, assassins to come into your house, cut you up, and repossess manufactured organs if you're overdue on your exorbitant payments. If you're going to suspend some of your disbelief, why not suspend... well... a little more of it than you think you "should"?I'd say Repo Men is an above average film. There were some parts of it that I really enjoyed. For instance, the opening scene when Remy cuts out some guy's liver while indifferently listening to music? Well, "nice" is the wrong word considering the gratuitous blood and guts involved (this movie is definitely not for the squeamish), but it was well done. Right from the get-go, it established one of the major themes of the movie - how desensitized can a person, a company, a society, become? People complain that the Schrodinger's cat analogy was completely pointless because it opens the movie but doesn't highlight a major theme (the issue of "does my artificial organ not make me a real, 'live' person?" never crops up), but I think this particular argument misses the point. Remy is referring to himself being technically alive, but so distant from the reality of his work that he meekly sits back and allows the atrocities to continue.I loved the twist ending, because it did catch me by surprise and it carried a powerful message, in my opinion. People complain that it made no sense with the plot and that it was a total cop-out to have Remy actually be wired to a "neural net" after his first confrontation with Jake. The plot logic complaint has some merit, but if you decide not to nitpick, what happened was this: instead of Remy escaping, basically by himself, cut off from all resources and hunted down by the most malicious, high-tech corporation on earth, and managing to bring down said corporate empire basically single-handedly, he gets caught and actually accomplishes nothing in the grand scheme of things. That moment at the end of the first fight with Jake, where we see him bash Remy's head in yet somehow Remy miraculously finds himself alive and basically unharmed afterwards, was where things really started to get ridiculous. When you find out that everything after it was all in Remy's head you understand why and it's brilliant. He only imagines himself the hero. In his fantasy world, he imagines that he takes the Union down to make up for his sins as a Repo man, so that he can forgive himself, but in reality he's only a small portion of something much bigger than himself that will keep going even after he's gone, no matter how much he regrets his actions. In a world of Hollywood happy endings, with implausible heroes who, against all odds, save the world from cataclysmic events and/or unspeakable evils, this was refreshing (call me a sucker for depressing endings).My rating lost stars because - like many other reviewers - I recognize the untapped potential behind Repo Men. This movie could have been fantastic. It could have made my top ten movie list. It just fell short - as many movies do. Well, if all movies were perfect, how could we pick out and enjoy the spectacular ones? To sum things up: I recommend Repo Men, but don't get hung up on the plot details. Just... go with it, and you'll enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Repo men, a film about a couple of Repo personnel who go out and repossess organs for which the recipient loses their right to the organ because of default payments. A corporation known as the union, hires Repo men to find and take back the organ no matter who or what status you come from. If you do not pay, you lose the organ which could be from a heart to a kidney or a lung. Yet in this facade, a Repo man stops his skills because of an accident which causes him to become a recipient of a heart, but loses his abilities to do his job. Now near broke, his payments stop which make other Repo men go out and look for him to take back the heart. In the middle is his ex partner who does not want him to die, but keep his job as a Repo man, but in his resolve, he decides to destroy the main computer for which all accounts are held. This was a good story, with lots of twists. Thoroughly enjoyable, bloody, action, humour, and a scheme for those thinkers out there, that there just might be something to the Repo business. Wonderful cast, and music to fit that bill of the strange noir film like Repo Men.</fullReview>

The movie is not as good as Braveheart, but the gore is there.Basically there is a company that will sell you a body part that you need, for an extraordinarily high price, ridiculous interest, but people will buy it because they don't want to leave their family. When they don't pay, and they get past due, they will send Repo Men to get the said appendage.One of the Repo men get a new heart and starts falling behind on payments, and there you have it, an all out knives a throwing, guns a blazing, heads a smashing, saws a sawing, bloods a spraying movie. Loved it, found it funny how they so nonchalantly talk about taking someone's body part and keep on living their lives.It's a good movie, you will enjoy it if you don't look too much into it, sure there are plot holes, sure it's over the top, but it's an enjoyable movie.

		<shortDescription>Repo Men entertaining but not original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men is a futuristic movie about a company that sells lab-grown internal organs to their customers. When customers fail to pay, Repo Men claim the organs that leads to the termination of the client (since the organ is what keeps them alive). Since the organs are very expensive, it is very common that customers can't keep up with their payments and end up dead.The story develops into more chase-action sequences in the second act when Repo Man, Remy (Jude Law) needs a heart himself and predictably enough can't pay it back. It is a classic story of hunter becomes the hunted or killer becomes the victim. It has science fiction elements and driven by action scenes. It is entertaining. The problem is that there is nothing unique about it.At the end, you may feel that you watched slightly different version of another science fiction or action movie you have seen before. I don't want to tell you the names of those movies in case you have not seen them (or if you have seen them, you will probably guess how this one may conclude). I think 6 is a fair rate for this movie.</fullReview>

It wasn't the story that let the film down, it wasn't the acting, perhaps it wasn't the script or perhaps it was... Overall I think the director just couldn't make full use of what they had. A real shame.This isn't the worst film your ever going to see but it won't leave you excited after the event, dying to discuss it with the people you just watched it with or aching to tell your mates to see it. You'll just finish the movie, go do something and forget most of what you've seen.Meh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the previews of this movie a while back and thought what a strange premise for a movie;repo men who go after people who don't pay their bill for an organ transplant,morbid stuff.this reminds me a little of Logan's run in a wild way,great action,great plot and very good actors.Jude Law and Forest Whitaker play the repo men,and liev Shrieber plays their slimy yuppy boss.there's a lot of action and some gross out scenes but its never boring.i don't think this was a big hit at the box office but it is a very well made movie.it makes you think what if they actually did this to people if they don't pay their bill for an organ transplant.with all the sequels and remakes in Hollywood these days at least this is a fresh idea.Jude Law is one of the greatest actors in Hollywood these days,did'nt see sherlock Holmes yet because i always thought the Basil Rathbone ones were the best and hard to think of another.i totally recommend repomen its a great flick and these are hard to come by lately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I gave this movie an 8 because it simply is not a B movie, and the spoilers contained are vague enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction movies can have a variety of different goals. The goal of most movies is to entertain and this is what we rate movies on. Repo men will hold your attention but not because it is entertaining. Repo men is a good movie because it accomplishes its goal and that is what I rated it on. It's goal is that of the different distopic books and movies that came before it and that is to make the viewer feel sick to convey the distopia. If you don't want to feel sick, don't go see repo men, but it is a very good movie because it accomplishes this goal. The distopic future is one that we have all seen before in different books and movies all put together to form one movie. Homages are paid to Clockwork Orange, Matrix, and most specifically 1984. Our hero is basically playing Winston Smith's Outer party character, the implementor of the world we are introduced to. Unlike Winston Smith however he doesn't feel sick at the beginning and is instead more like A clockwork orange's main character enjoying the thrill of the ultraviolance (making the viewer feel slightly ill but still enjoying themselves because it's told from the bad guy's perspective) However like in clockwork orange, and the matrix the main character then goes through a transformation (explained in the movie) and can no longer perform his function in this sick society. After this point all semblance of the movie being fun is gone and you are really going to feel sick in this future as you are no longer experiencing it from the point of view of it's enforcers, but instead you are experiencing the point of view of it's victims. This will make you sick reinforcing the distopic feelings the movie is intented to convey. The movie is further developed with plot twists that bring in every thing you've seen from other science fiction movies into one movie with the exceptions of Artificial Intelligence, aliens, space ships and time travel.The action scenes are well done, but are not that freequant and it is apparent that this is because the movie was on a budget. The CGI is top notch but also infrequant (only really at the start to illustrate the future). ie: a future with flying trains for some reason has ttc street cars and subways from the mid 20th century (the current ones they use today). They didn't even bother changing the colours or blocking out the TTC icons. It doesn't detract from the movie unless you live or have been to Toronto.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting premise; some bright spots; great music; hated the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmmmmmmmm...I just finished watching a high def BluRay cut of Repo Men and I'm sort of on the fence about the whole thing. I liked the premise, even if it's been done before. I'm a big Forest Whitaker fan, and I thought he was one of the bright spots of the movie. I also thought that Alice Braga, while not really pretty, was definitely hot.The pace of Repo Man was somewhat up and down. Some parts flew by, while other parts lagged. All in all, it was better than a lot of other movies out there.And as someone pointed out in a board post -- the music was definitely the highlight of the movie. A nice diverse collection of very good tunes.The most annoying character in the movie was definitely Carol (Carice van Houten). I have to assume it was intentional, but her bitterness struck me as too one-dimensional and over the top. She showed no complexity whatsoever -- it was just one big biyatch session for her.I also thought Liv Schreiber did a great job portraying Frank, and Jude Law did a good job as Remy.All in all -- I've seen better and I've seen much worse. Repo Men was slick, entertaining, yet a bit disappointing. It could/should have been tighter, and as noted above -- I really hated the ending. To me...endings like that are the ultimate cop-outs, which leave the viewer feeling cheated.</fullReview>

A dystopian organ transplantation story? What is wrong with you people?! Starship Troopers all over again.It is a satirical allegory of the free market economy and in particular the ruthlessness of our bankers. Why is it that you are taking this at face value? Did you think "Animal Farm" was about animals having a bit of an argument? A Farm-Fi horror perhaps?And for anyone complaining about the dream world ending, setting aside the obvious parallels to our existence, would you be bleedin' happy if the film ended with them drinking margaritas with a slice of LEMON on the side?Bring on eugenics is what I say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked it overall, but I'd agree w/ the poster who called it vapid. It was gross, blood and guts, exciting, and interesting at times but it just seemed like a few changes could have put it into very good category. Just some nonsensical story scenes, some obviously implausible action scenes (hat to nitpick fighting scenes too much but it wasn't the xtreme fighting, it was just case in point- the heroine runs out of ammo in her pistol-; at least 3 guys who she killed still have rounds in their former pistols, but she continues on unarmed; her pursuer of course picks up one of the dropped pistols to shoot her), and more careful story and character development would have made it a lot better with relatively minor tweaks by a professional screenwriter, especially since there was a lot of good to it. 7 may be a stretch for this picture, but overall I really did enjoy it more than most 6ish movies. The 3 main leads all did pretty well with what they had to work with- to me Forest Whitaker does about as much as he can with every role he's in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Repo MenAccording to the media, repossession is at an all-time high. So, if you've been exorcised, make sure you have plenty of holy water and priest collars on hand.Whoops! Apparently the repossessions in this sci-fi thriller pertain to human organs and not human bodies, mansions or antique dolls.In 2025, humanity has a new lease on life thanks to artificial organs. Loaning theses devices out is a company called The Union, which also relies on ruthless repo-men to retrieve organs that owners have defaulted payment on. One such repo-man is Remy (Jude Law), an aspiring author who has grown tired of his job. But before he can resign an accident occurs and he finds himself indebted to The Union for a new heart.Unable to make the payments, Remy decides to run. While on the lam, he falls for a woman who's also being sought for her abundance of overdue organs. While the concept is fascinating, Repo Men itself needs dialysis: the script is muddled, the acting is tacky and the ending is trite.What's more, all this hubbub over missing organs makes me think that The Union may, in fact, have a subsidiary company that manufactures hot dog wieners.

		<fullReview>If you think that Repo Men will be the FILM THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. you're wrong.. but if you're bored, you might wanna see Repo Men. The story is good and the acting is OK,however the film is far from perfect. Jude Law is great in his role as a bad ass agent that can kick your ass in a heartbeat, and surprisingly Forest Whitaker is also great in his role as Jude's partner. In the near future there Will be an organization that can give you artificial organs that work perfectly, but if you don't pay them in time the agents will come to take your organs out no matter where you are. As I said in the beginning the story is good and the acting is OK, sure there are a lot of questions and I can assure they will not be explained throughout the movie, honestly is an OK sci-fi movie without a lot of explanation, but just when you think is a horrible movie, the ending will surprise you, that's why I think this movie goes from a "Mediocre" to an "Ok" movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Either love or hate it: Brasil meets Existenz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie this reminds me most of is Brasil. It uses an exaggerated, metaphorical world, a caricature of the world we live in, to show us how it really is. The gory scenes are almost taken from Existenz, another Jude Law movie with a strong moral and an exaggeration of the present as the backdrop story.The thing is that I loved both Brasil and Existenz, but this film I had issues with. I understood the idea behind it, but there were so many scenes that had no purpose at all, mostly the violent ones, and that bothered me. It also may prove difficult to watch because medically or logically, some scenes just don't add up. Suspension of disbelief comes only when accepting the film is not real, and that is a major flaw in a movie that wants to criticize the real world.So, a good mark for the moral of the story and the feelings of empathy to ourselves that it provokes. It is a bad time when we need a film to bring to life our own feelings in order to recognize them. A bad mark for useless violence, unrelated to the story and not enough effort trying to make the world consistent.Overall, a barely above average for a film that could have been a lot more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting premise but uninspiring direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the future humans have extended and improved our lives through highly sophisticated and expensive mechanical organs created by a company called "The Union". The dark side of these medical breakthroughs is that if you don't pay your bill, "The Union" sends its highly skilled repo men to take back its property... with no concern for your comfort or survival. Former soldier Remy is one of the best organ repo men in the business. But when he suffers a cardiac failure on the job, he awakens to find himself fitted with the company's top-of-the-line heart-replacement... as well as a hefty debt. But a side effect of the procedure is that his heart's no longer in the job. When he can't make the payments, The Union sends its toughest enforcer, Remy's former partner Jake, to track him down.Despite a great premise and a visually attractive futurist setting, Repo Man never really got it going. It has some great ideas and a lot of potential but the execution isn't the best. The direction was very uninspired to say the least. Regarding the cast, I think they did an OK job. Jude Law is one of my favorite actors and undeniably a talented one but the material is so poor that his performance suffered from it. No one, has such a change of heart, after a literal change of heart. No one changes that much from day to night, he just doesn't happen. Forest Whitaker's character is completely unlikable and I thought the actor's mannerisms were extremely annoying. The gorgeous Alice Braga was OK as the female interest who's body is more mechanic then human, but again, she didn't have much to work with.Any moral debate or philosophical discussions were sadly pushed to the side in favor of sleek and shiny sets (when the film should have a mysterious and decadent, almost noir feel to it) and flashy slow-motion action sequences with a bit of gore and lots of blood. I enjoy action sequences as much as the next guy, specially when well executed but, this story should be all about morals and humanity and what makes us human, where do we draw the line and so on, all things that were never addressed. In the second half of the film, things start to move a bit faster and with more vigor and there's a very interesting scene near the end when Remy and Beth have to open themselves up and register their organs so that they can be free; which I thought was very well done and probably the best scene of the entire film, however, I have to judge the film as a whole. The huge twist in the end is clever and unexpected but not exactly satisfying, plus many have been saying that it's a rip off of the film Brazil (1985) which I haven't seen. To me, it actually reminds me a lot of the final twist in Vanilla sky. Overall, Repo Man, suffered from a uninspiring direction and a very poor script which is a shame because it had the potential to be a tremendous sci-fi film.6/10</fullReview>

Paging Philip K. Dick in this scattershot hybrid of "Total Recall"/"Blade Runner" &amp; "Minority Report" with Law even echoing his android from "AI" (!) as the repo man who literally has a change of heart when he finds himself the hapless recipient of a techno-ticker. Bloody to a fault is one thing but the convoluted plottings by Eric Garcia (based on his novel "The Repossession Mambo") and Garrett Lerner runs on fumes by the final act and Miguel Sapochink's muddled direction doesn't help (but kudos to recognizing Monty Python's "Meaning of Life" segment featuring "We're hear for your liver" segment ? even if it's just on a TV screen the main characters are enjoying).</fullReview>

They took practically every thing from Repo! The Genetic Opera and just made it from a different point of view, more serious and without any music. The original is so much better, that the writers of this movie should be ashamed and embarrassed. I can't believe they got away with making this movie without saying it was partly based off of Repo! The Genetic Opera. If the writers/director had said it was based off Repo! The Genetic Opera, my opinion on it would not be so bad. Really, don't waste your time on this movie. I feel bad for the actors in this film, that they had to be apart of it. If you want an awesome, better (and original) version of this movie go watch Repo!

		<fullReview>This film is about two men working for a organ transplant corporation, who take back the organs from people not keeping up with their installments."Repo Men" is technically well made, but has an awful script. The film starts off as a sci-fi action film that appears credible. However, the action is too infrequent and too short-lived, and the pace is too slow. I was thoroughly bored by 30 minutes. Then, the film becomes a senseless slasher violence film. It is a bit like "From Dusk Till Dawn" but without the style or coolness. The ending, mixed with sex and gore, is downright ridiculous. Am I expected to believe that or entertained by that? Further still, just when you thought the film is ending, the real ending twist comes in. This ending twist is no good either, and ruins the film. I wish the film just stopped before the ending twist, so that the film could be half decent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody, Violent, Sardonic Saga About Transplanting Artificial Body Parts In The Future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, "Dreamer" director Miguel Sapochnik's violent, outlandish science fiction thriller "Repo Men," co-starring Jude Law and Forest Whitaker, bears no relation to director Alex Cox's cult hit "Repo Man" (1986), with Emilio Emilio Estevez and Harry Dean Stanton, about repossessing automobiles. Instead, "Repo Men" concerns the sales and manufacture of artificial body parts in the unspecified future and the ruthless ruffians dispatched to repossess these state-of-the-art organs from individuals who fail to maintain their payments. Although it features many suspenseful scenes, some appealing characters and charismatic performances, "Repo Men" looks more often than not like an uneven blend of "Brazil" and "Blade Runner" with an ending that leaves an unsavory taste in your mouth. Derived from Eric Garcia's 2009 novel "The Repossession Mambo," this slickly-produced dystopian chiller--vaguely similar to "Repo: The Genetic Opera"--boasts its share of twists and turns that will keep your hands clenched into white-knuckled fists until its one-too-many endings alienates you. Jude Law toplines an incomparable cast and you'll find yourself cheering for him, even though he qualifies initially as a quasi-villain. Forest Whitaker and Liev Schreiber play unrepentant villains and they milk their roles for every ounce of villainy that they can muster. An opening metaphor about a cat trapped in a metal box filled with a deadly nerve gas will most certainly offend feline animal lovers, but the crowd that this Universal Pictures release is targeting will take pleasure in the adrenaline fueled action sequences and the high-tech equipment with which the principals deal. Hopelessly far-fetched in every detail, "Repo Men" has some elements that should undoubtedly absorb sci-fi fans. The aerosol foam that seals up gashes in the human body like fast-acting super-glue and the miraculous resiliency of the victims as they endure hands probing around inside them is pretty far-out stuff.In the future, a billion-dollar corporation, the Union, fabricates high-tech artificial organs, nicknamed "artiforgs," so that nobody's loved ones need endure the heartache and torment of biding their time awaiting genetically compatible body parts. The catch, however, is the sky-high cost of these miracle organs. In fact, few people can afford loan-shark interest rates imposed by the Union once they have signed a contract with the company. As a result of not being able to manage their credit cards anymore than their debts, these unfortunate souls wind up not only paying through the nose, but also often losing those pricey parts. When a recipient falls behind more than three months on their payments, the eponymous men materialize when they least expect them to gut and retrieve the Union's property. Remy (Jude Law of "Sherlock Holmes") and Jake (Forest Whitaker of "Vantage Point") are childhood pals, and the best repo men at the Union. They waste no time when they are on the job and show no more compassion that a repo man in the car business. Standard operating procedure dictates that our heroes provide the victim with the option to call an ambulance before they eviscerate them. Meantime, Remy's wife Carol (Carice van Houten of "Valkyrie") wants her husband to stop repossessing organs and move over into sales so he can allocate more time with their adolescent son, Peter (Chandler Canterbury of "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"), who doesn't see his dad as often as he'd like. Eventually, Carol puts her foot down and refuses to let Remy sleep with her, much get gain access to their comfortable house. As much as Remy wants to accommodate Carol, he loathes the idea of a buttoned down suit and tie existence on a 9-to-5 schedule.Matters come to a head during one job when Remy visits a musician. As he is about to give the guy a jolt from a defibrillator to take his heart, the device malfunctions and knocks him unconscious. When Remy recovers, he finds himself in a hospital bed with Jake and local Union branch manager Frank (Liev Schreiber of "The Manchurian Candidate") hovering over him with their smiling faces. The horror of what has occurred sinks in and Remy wants nothing to do with his new high-priced ticker. Nevertheless, Jake and Frank bring him around and Remy is back on his feet in no time and prepared to pick up where he left off repossessing organs. The problem is that Remy is no longer the same guy and he no longer has his heart in his job. In fact, he ends up in the same predicament that virtually every Union creditor finds themselves in and has to worry about Frank sending out Jake to repossess his heart. "Repo Men" is a darkly-themed satire that never takes itself seriously, and Sapochnik stages several visceral action scenes involving blood, gore, and stabbing galore that may challenge your ability to keep from chucking up, when body parts are repossessed. Like the hero in Terry Gilliam's "Brazil," Remy winds up on the other side and helps out other organ recipients who have gone to the black market to save themselves. Like the heroes in a Sam Peckinpah western, our life-long friends?Remy and Jake--find themselves on opposite sides. Clearly, the producers couldn't have picked a better time to release this sardonic nail-biter about high-tech medicine as Congress has passed a new health insurance bill. This compelling, sometimes convoluted, amoral thriller shows the two sides of humanity. Ironically, once it has eliminated the problem of obtaining human body parts, our capitalistic society has created a larger problem, footing the bill for manufactured variety. Organ donor epics will never be the same with the advent of "Repo Men."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this movie made?? What does it want to tell us??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me just say at the onset that i have pretty much agreed with every one of the reviews here that call this a pointless, plot-less, meaningless, message-less, torture porn of a movie.But this one is so bad that in spite of agreeing with them all, i still had to write a review to calm myself.As soon as you watch the movie, plot-holes start to emerge. First, there is no way on earth that the actions of these repo-men is kept under wraps given the methodology they use to repo the organs. When Liev's character was explaining a potential customer that he should not believe the 6 O' Clock news, i started laughing. Why? Because a few minutes before that Jude's character had repo-ed out a person's liver in front of his girlfriend. And then later there was Whittaker's character repo-ing an organ in the back of a taxi cab.But i had still kept my mind open because if nothing else, the premise promised a lot of kick-ass action. What do we get instead? In the words of another reviewer: "The amount of blood and guts in this film was just revolting - excessive and pointless. The scene in which Jude and Drippy Girl proceed to cut each other open, whilst kissing and loving each other up, in order to stick various implements into gaping body cavities to reach the bar-codes on their artificial organs, was just torture porn, pure and simple." Usually there are the plot twists that can be called the saving grace even for a crappy plot-less movie. Not here! The first one wherein we find out that Whittaker's character rigged Jude's character's defib unit so that the would lose his heart and would need an implant was a laugh-out-loud moment. All that to prevent him from going into sales!? Ridiculous! The second one was when we find out that whatever happened after the first plot-twist was a dream. By that time the torture porn had drained all interest out of me to even acknowledge it with a colorful adjective. There are movies where it works, though, like Total Recall and the more recent Pandorum, but they work because everything leads up to it. They work because they serve as anti-climactic moments which gives an outlet to all the pent up adrenaline you have accumulated watching the movie so far.This movie makes Surrogates look Oscar-worthy! At least Surrogates was trying to give us a message, no matter how halfhearted it was. The only message i got out of this one was, don't ever let the economy collapse. Else, this may be the future! OOOh, look, i am shaking in my boots!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where are the good screenplays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the most recent recession era, we have seen quite a big variety of recession movies! This is definitely one of those... At list not in 3D. TI think this was a very good story, especially for the United States of the health propaganda. While Mr.President Obama is trying to save one hundred million people without health insurance, there are people who is making movies about how things can really go wrong with privatized health care. This is the good side of this average movie. The bad side is definitely the screenplay, where an quite interesting story falls into a action comedy. Too bad, but this is just my review. Main character is very very weak, as well as his beloved cyborg. The rest of the cast is actually quite good indeed. Not a boring film, not a waste of money... I just liked ways better Gattaca, since they both talk about a similar theme, and they both star Jude Law in a futuristic old city.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disgustingly violent pointless film with a plot full of holes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could very well be the worst film ever made. The harebrained, inconsistent plot is delivered with a degree of senseless violence never seen before and with the artistic conviction of a teenager. The actors don't really care the part they are playing (quite understandably so). The remaining question is: why didn't anyone see the disaster coming after reading the script? This radioactive piece of cinematographic vile reeks to high heavens and - I'm sure - the cast members are kicking themselves for poisoning their careers by having anything to do with it. The film can't be recommended even as a camp-trip, as it is so disgustingly violent, juvenile and - for the lack of a better word - pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Repo Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Corporations and banks exist to make a profit, and that is its basis of their existence. To have somebody pay you in full means an opportunity to make more money gone from the loss of interest that can potentially be earned, so installments are the way to go. Being no saints, more money will start to come in should there be a default in the repayment scheme, and in the best case scenario they get to seize whatever is yet to be paid in full, and liquidate it. Not a bad way to make money actually, provided nobody thinks about the social consequences, adopting a job is a job attitude, with zero personal attachments.The fine print though reads that a default in payment beyond 90 days means The Union (the shady corporation in question here) will send their repossession team after you to reclaim the part. And yes, if it's something crucial for survival, that's just tough luck because like banks, they don't really care if they have to throw you out on the streets. It's purely business and nothing personal, though in this case it involves life and death.Jude Law plays Remy, one of the best of the best in the business as an employee of The Union in its Repo department, perfecting his skills of breaking and entering, fights, and generally overpowering and immobilizing his victim long enough for him to exercise his surgical skills. He has no remorse to do what he's doing as a career, although his long and irregular hours is taking a toil on his family life, with wife Carol (Carice van Houten from Valkyrie and Black Book) giving him that ultimatum to do a sales job, just like what his boss Frank (Liev Schreiber) has made it his calling to convince those who are sick to sign on with the company's scheme to provide medical and financial assistance.Law has now starred in two of what I personally deem as some of the best science fiction stories Hollywood has done, this and Gattaca which coincidentally also deals with genetics and such. His turn in Steven Spielberg's Artificial Intelligence is something forgettable, and amongst the three I prefer his role here best, since it offers him a wide range of emotions to showcase, plus to balance that off with some hard hitting action, which was missed in Gattaca since his character in that film was wheelchair bound, though no lacking in emotional intensity.Repo Men primarily follows Remy's story arc, where we see a transformation in a man in his attitude and conscience once he's made to belong to the other side, not by choice. After all, why bat for a losing team? An accident during work meant that The Union feels obliged to save one of their own, after all he's the best, though with no worker benefits, meaning that Remy too is subjected to the same terms and conditions as those whom he hunts down. It's a tale of losing a physical heart to gain a compassionate one, and he soon finds himself dangerously close to not bringing home the bacon because of his natural affiliation, that his defaulting of payments meant his best friend and buddy in the business, Jake (played by Forest Whitaker) has to systematically hunt him down.Filled with plenty of violence without remorse, gore, and what I thought was gore-porn with that state of sensuousness and extreme pain experienced by both Remy and his new squeeze Beth (Alice Braga) in a scene that will really raise some eyebrows as they go to the extreme in wanting their freedom back, there are plenty of action sequences here that will thrill that action fanboy in you. And if you think V for Vendetta's fight scene at the end with V utilizing his knife to dispatch opponents was one of a kind, well, you ain't see nothing yet with a similar sequence here executed by Remy, which I think is the best amongst all the other fights crafted for the movie, hands down, made all the more sweet when set against UNKLE's Burn My Shadow song. This scene alone will make you sit up and take notice that Jude Law can be that drama king turned action hero too.And let's not forget the other supporting cast that equally boosted the film through their fine delivery. Forest Whitaker shedded a lot of weight for his role here to act as that counter- balance to Jude Law, and carries the film with his witty one liners (that seemed to be ad- libbed) and comical demeanour, though he's no pushover when it comes to the crunch. Alice Braga continues to be a comfortable casting choice in action films (just as she was in the recent Predators) and her romantic subplot with Remy grows to culminate in that unbelievable scene I mentioned before. I think we got to keep our eyes peeled if filmmakers see her as the new Linda Hamilton able to take on more masculine roles in future, because I think she has what it takes to deliver such tough-as-nails roles quite effortlessly.Unlike the schmuck in the show who will pitch that you owe it your family, I'd just say you owe it to yourself to catch this science-fiction action thriller for adults with a great story backed by unflinching, violent action, with enough twists and turns to surprise you. With certainty Repo Men enters my shortlist as one of the best the genre has to offer, and is this year's equivalent of Children of Men! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Come on guys, keep your reviews of a movie fair. This is a solid 8+ movie but somehow people have ripped it down to a shameful 6.4.Look this is not a thought provoking drama, but it isn't Terminator or Predator or Die Hard pure action, no thought either. It is closer to Blade Runner. The actors and director did a wonderful job of portraying a violent futuristic scenario while also keeping it realistic by balancing character development. It wasn't just guys chasing down people then cutting them up. There is a mix of the toll such a job takes on the actors family life. The struggle with doing a job that you are good at and needs to be done but conflicts with your ethics.So definitely a worth watching movie. This is what action movies should be.</fullReview>

Strangely because I can see quite a few story/pacing flaws and inconsistencies but still was entertained enough, to like it quite a bit more than I would think.Might have to do with our two lead actors, might have to do with the ending (which I really liked, though I guess some would say it does not really fit to a movie like this) or the nicely shot action scenes. Whatever it was, it wasn't so much the wearing off story, which is more than a bit cliché and is more or less foreseeable (maybe apart from the end, of course).If you like action that is set in the future (speaking from the year 2010 onwards that is), then you will might find yourself intrigued by this movie too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad, not great, but beat my expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging by the trailer I had a feeling this movie was going to suck, but to my surprise the first half was actually sort of pretty entertaining. The second half started to drag and started to get boring, and as you start watching you will discover a lot of plot holes but the twist near the end explains it so it's forgivable I guess. Forest Whitaker put on the best performance in this, it just made it really believable that him and Jude Law's character are best friends. So the movie is basically about Remy(Jude Law) and Jake(Forest Whitaker) and they work for a corporation in the future that produce artificial organs and limbs for the people that need it, but it comes with a big price tag and if they can't pay people like Remy and Jake comes to take them away from the people that can't pay up and if they take a vital organ the person that can't pay up is basically dead. But later Remy gets into a accident where he needs a artificial heart himself, and soon grows a conscience and since he himself can't pay for his artificial heart he is now on the run from the corporation. I couldn't buy the world in the film as being realistic in the near future, but that isn't to say it was somewhat entertaining. You won't miss anything by not seeing it on the big screen because it gets tedious at some parts, but it's a good rental.6.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it! But a few annoyances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I loved this movie, and loved Jude Law... so sexy.Anyway, the point of my post, is to see if anyone else noticed these things.1. In the end, when we see that Remy has actually been hooked into a Neuro Net, we see Jake with multiple (presumably repo'd) artifogs. He states to the technician that 'installed' Remy with the Neuro Net that, "there are at least 50 commissions there, that should be more than enough to pay for his heart and the down payment for the neuro net." My question--why didn't he just pay for Remy's heart in the first place? Why did he beat him literally senseless, and then pay for his heart and the neuro net? Seems odd, that rather than keep his friend alive, well, and happy, he would bash his brains in and then hook him up to an artificial consciousness. Possibly a level of sociopathy or an obsession with controlling Remy? He did seem to have attempted at a certain level of control over him throughout the movie.2. What happened to Beth?3. How did the Chinese women acquire the black market artiforgs? Furthermore, how did the recipients of these organs avoid automatically being flagged for REPO? Such that the organs were black market and obviously unpaid for? 4. I forgot--at what point does Remy black out (and not until the end is it revealed that he has been beaten to the point of severe brain trauma)--was that before or after the airport scene, the raid on their 'nest' camp when they find themselves pulled into a back room with others on the run... ??? I was very surprised by the ending of this movie. Shocking, really. I am so used to futuristic thrillers ending on a more positive note, along with a fleeting hope for humanity in the near future. This one begins and ends by painting a bleak and horrific future for our society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repo! the Genetic Opera and Repo Men: both the same, both different, both worth your time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a great deal of controversy surrounding this film's blatant similarity to Repo! The Genetic Opera. Some call this malicious larceny, and others offer coincidence as a possible explanation.The first difference between these films is obvious. One is a rock opera. The other is a drama. But these are not the only differences.While both films are character studies of a man who repossesses human organs for a living, the approaches taken are quite different. Nathan Wallace in the Opera is a loving father, and caring person who has been coerced into doing a job he finds horrific. It drives him mad, and effectively splits him into two people. One of the Opera's main themes is emancipation and redemption; both his own and that of his sheltered daughter, Shilo. Remy, in Repo Men, is a thug, pure and simple. He jokes about the people he kills. He makes a game out of the slaughter. His change of heart only comes when just this happens: he needs his heart changed.The Opera seems to focus more on moral decadence. It's a society obsessed with plastic surgery, drugs, money and power. It is a world where not only is human life cheap, but death is profit. Imperialism is the main villain. Repo Men makes a statement, but it's more of an afterthought than anything. The Union in Repo Men really seems to think that it's doing good. GeneCo in the Opera makes no such pretence. It doesn't have to. Organ failure in that world is epidemic. Anyone who doesn't go to GeneCo simply dies. They've got the world by the balls.Both these films are very well done. Both have some serious flaws. Other reviewers have commented much more effectively than I on these, so I won't get redundant and repeat them here. I will say that while the imagery, and the rock opera approach to Opera is far superior, Repo Men has better dialogue. Each movie should be seen, as they both compliment one another very nicely.Now, back to that controversy:For me, there are several nails in the coincidence coffin. The marketing strategies are virtually identical. The Genetic Opera used comic-book animation to fill in some of the scenes which they lacked the funds to shoot. On the Apple trailer website, a seven minute motion comic teaser for Repo Men appeared just a week or so ago. The stories could be coincidence, but the same language and the same imagery? Unless someone switched on Arthur Dent's Infinite Improbability Drive, the likelihood of this is incredibly low. No whales have materialized miles above the earth. The moon did not suddenly turn into a giant floating blancmange. No team of monkeys has written their own version of Hamlet. The Improbability Drive is off the table. The huge nail for me, though, is the fact that whatever powers that be in the movie industry seemed determined to kill the Genetic Opera before it had even begun. It was denied widespread distribution. Its trailer appeared on Apple once, and to my knowledge, nowhere else. Production on the film was delayed, hampered, an stonewalled. All this supposedly because the execs thought the Genetic Opera wouldn't sell. Now we have Repo Men (admittedly, coming from a different studio, so different execs likely at work), being granted massive publicity, funding and widespread distribution. Perhaps someone at Universal saw that the concept actually would sell, and decided to go for it. I think it much more likely, though, that someone at Universal had already sunk a substantial amount of capital into Repo Men before finding out about the Genetic Opera, and demanded of a friend at Lions Gate that it be killed.This is, of course, pure speculation. However it is not an uneducated guess since money can be everything in an industry as expensive as film. If enough of it were sunk into a project that fans of another highly original film might brand a rip off, then this could be devastating, and it has caused trouble at the very least. Unless you believe Eric Garcia's unverifiable claim to a short story written in 1997, the Opera is the first incarnation this story. The two films were made at roughly the same time.Re-telling a story is no sin. One of the greatest writers of all time, William Shakespeare, often would draw his ideas from plays and stories that already existed. The problem here is not the similarity since, as I said, both films seem to compliment one another rather than copy each other. The problem is the fact that Repo Men's writer, Eric Garcia, is determined to play that tired old "You stole my story!" game, though there is no doubt that Genetic Opera fans have been unfairly vicious, as well (I'm sorry to say that I am not innocent of this, either).Had Garcia given a friendly nod to Darren Smith and Terrence Zdunich (or hell, simply claim that his was a different take on the same idea) there should have been no problem for anyone other than a greedy lawyer. These are both excellent films. But if this is going to come down to a copyright war, then it is a war that Garcia will lose.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Misunderstood Gem in the Rough!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just joined IMDb with the sole purpose of criticizing not the movie itself, but other reviewers who misunderstood the movie. This world is going down the drain precisely because of people who cannot read between the lines. I was actually hoping for more people to figure out the obvious reasons why this movie was made in the first place...and that is TO EDUCATE! Why does the protagonist find it so hard to commit the killings AFTER he gets a new heart? And why heart? Why not liver or kidneys? The heart is associated with love and basic human emotions and this is PRECISELY why the world is taking a downward plunge. We forgot what it truly means to be human.People are born chaste and uncorrupted, and it is the society that makes them think and behave like emotionless creatures capable of killing other people without feeling any guilt whatsoever (Forest Whitaker). After he gets a new heart, the protagonist finds that he cannot go on with his life killing other people. Additionally, the fact that his partner changes sides in the end shows us that there is still hope left in the world and that people can change for the better.If you explicitly state such ideas in today's world, you will be prosecuted and labeled as a conspiracy theorist or worse. So, a handful of people are trying their best to make such movies hoping people will figure out there is something SERIOUSLY wrong with today's world. If we continue to miss these signs, there is no hope left for us and the world will become just like the place depicted in this movie. This movie has nothing to do with health care monopoly, like many stated. Open up your eyes people or we will our humanity pretty fast!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is solid 7 votes for me. Couple of things. This movie is little gory and little bit of blood, but overall it is a cool movie. This movie is in the nature of The Matrix. There is a lot of cool and interesting plot to this story and when it deals with the future of human civilization, the story is intriguing. The story, plot and the gritty commonsense nature of the acting and story were pretty convincing for me. Jude Law, the main character does a great job in this movie acting wise. Forest Whitaker was also intense and convincing in the movie. The directing aspect of the movie is what made this movie good. The director was practical and commonsense in terms of the actor's emotions, intent, timing and not very comical. Without a good directing, this movie is little easy to become something not real and comical.Acting was great, plot was wide and deep, actions were practical except in couple of scenes. It has a lot of bloody action. It is definitely a R rated movie.Overall, good movie with great story, great directing, production and acting. For me it is not as great as The Matrix, but this movie was satisfying. If other directors and writers elaborate on this film's plot and story, it might become a more better compared with others. This movie is also little like Minority Report too, but the scope and production I think might be little less, but the story was definitely good as Minority Report, if not little more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Repo Men' is a rough mixture of sci-fi organ parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the near future, artificial organs can be bought on credit from a company called "The Union." If one can't pay the bill, "The Union" will send a highly skilled repo man to take the organ back, often killing the victim. Jude Law plays Remy, a repo man, who after an accident finds himself with a new artificial heart, a heavy debt, and unable to work. When he can't make the payments, he finds himself on the run from the repo men, one of which happens to be his former partner, Jake (Forest Whitaker).Many things happen in this thriller, many of which are familiar. There are parts you've seen before, and some areas work as an homage. There are elements of Blade Runner, yet not as slick, and perhaps a bit of Demolition Man. This is, admittedly, expected from this genre and is welcomed. However, look-wise, the film could've had something really original, given the budget and plot.The action scenes are aplenty. They sometimes contain the familiar, MTV style quick cuts, occasional stylistic and gory moments, and a hallway scene that appears to be an homage to Oldboy. To appreciate scenes like these, one must first buy Jude Law as an action hero, of sorts. While Jude Law has the good-guy thing down, he isn't exactly built like a tough guy?but, perhaps it's something one needs to get used to given that he has mostly been considered a character actor. The action scenes itself seemed by-the-numbers, although it does pick up later.Admittedly, Jude Law in any sci-fi film is always a treat?he simply has that clean, other-worldly look about him?I thought he was amazing in A.I. While Jude Law does a commendable job with his role, his English accent isn't explained too well in the film, given that he grew up with Jake (Forest Whitaker) since grade school, and Jake himself doesn't particularly sound British. Of course, anything like this can be explained away by saying he lived somewhere else since then. Seeing Forest Whitaker (as Jake) in front of the camera is always a treat?he does fine in his complex, bad guy/good guy role as Remy's former partner.Director Miguel Sapochnik appears to walk a fine line between whether the film is meant to be an action film or a sci-fi film. While it appears like the former, I think this film would've benefited more if it had more of the latter. The sci-fi elements and the plot was interesting, but felt somewhat sloppily put together. The whole atmosphere of this film's world felt claustrophobic, giving a B-movie quality.As much as I enjoyed the plot itself, it appears to lack the details I often enjoy in any sci-fi film. To add, much of the film spends its time going from one location to another, with occasional memorable scenes (such as an underground surgeon scene), but nothing that figures too much into the general plot. There were occasional quirky, and almost fun, moments of interior monologue that reminded me of a Guy Ritchie film, but even those moments happen sparsely. If the film had went for that quirky, European satiric style, that could've been fun, too, but this film is not like that either.On a whole, the film felt like a Frankenstein monster of many elements and styles. Meanwhile, I found the underlying story still interesting and everything that happens does eventually lead somewhere. There is a big plot twist I think makes this film almost great. Even if I had problems with the film, I'd still be interested in reading the novel this film is based on, as there are some good stuff in here, even if I didn't prefer the execution of it. Overall, I give this film ** ? out of ****.You can also follow my reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men seems to take the only thing I liked about Repo: The Genetic Opera (which was the concept of someone's organs being repossessed) and making it into a full-length film. Repo: The Genetic Opera was pretty terrible overall with a few moments of brilliance and it looked like Repo Men hoped to capitalize on that. I really like the concept, but it just seems like it's never been executed properly. After seeing this film, odds are that theory won't be put to rest.Jude Law and Forest Whitaker are easily the best part of the film. I've heard some people say that Law doesn't fit this role, but it seems to be the other way around. Law makes this role fit him. This is his story and he makes it worth sitting through. Whitaker shines during the scenes where he struggles with doing his job and helping his best friend. I'm not familiar with a lot of Whitaker's work, but he's one of those actors where his eyes tell the story better than his body language does.The over the top gore seems to be a big issue for a lot of people. As a horror aficionado, it didn't bother me much. In fact, it made me feel right at home. The gory scenes are the most memorable scenes in the film. The hallway scene in front of the pink door is easily my favorite. It may be because it reminds me of the far superior yet similar hallway sequence in Oldboy. And despite the theater not being very full, the film received a pretty big reaction during the film. The gore scenes, especially. People were applauding the pink door scene. So even if blood and gore may not be your thing, if you see this film, they'll probably be what you remember most when you're walking out of the theater.The film has a pretty fantastic ending. In fact, it felt like the action thriller had a fairly strong beginning and ending with a rather mediocre middle. Certain things about the story bothered me. After Remy gets his heart transplant, he can't find it within himself to be a repo man anymore. Even though it's "just another job," all he can think about is the fact the person he's cutting open has a family. It leads one to believe that he can't kill anymore. Then later on, it shows him killing other repo men that work for The Union. Do they not have families, too? Could he kill these men because he knows the ins and outs of the job they perform everyday? There were several other similar inconsistencies throughout the film that stuck out like that (anyone else notice "Repossession Mambo" was misspelled in Remy's first draft of his novel?).Repo Men should have been one of my favorite films of the year, at least thus far. I love the idea of repo men repossessing organ transplants people can't pay for a little too much. That idea and two strong male leads should have made this film stellar. Other than the excessive gore (which I loved) and the questionable parts of the storyline, it's hard for me to pinpoint what exactly about the film didn't sit well with me. The film reminded me a bit of films like The Transporter and Underworld. Not so much in content, but in the sense that they were films that contained elements of things that I love but just weren't executed properly. I don't really think Repo Men is an awful film or as bad as all these ratings from top critics are making the film out to be. It's still worth seeing, but it just doesn't live up to expectations and is a bit disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware. The IMDBers are overrating another stinker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The experienced moviegoer will feel some apprehension even before viewing this film. It's a first-time feature director with an ambitious story but a budget well below the studio tent- pole level, a lead star who isn't quite the highest of the high A (and whom we don't think of when we think action), and a side-kick whose strange acting technique, a kind of maudlin distractedness, seems particularly ill-suited for a genre picture. The apprehension is well placed, but things turn out even worse than one imagined. The film's art design is ugly, modern and dystopian of course, but not in an interesting way (a la Bladerunner), and the film stock itself appears grimy (even on a new print). The actors are generally out at sea, miscast and understandably befuddled by a tone that ranges from serious action, to silly (embarrassing) buddy pic, to Guy Ritchie-wannabe frozen frames and pretentious hipster dialog. The characters aren't especially sympathetic: their unarmed victims get shot like fish in a barrel so we don't ever buy the "heroic" status of the protagonists. Jude Law's uxorious character is henpecked by a nasty, dour-looking Carice van Houten (so wonderful in The Black Book) and our empathy for him isn't heightened by his friendship with the psychotic Forrest Whittaker character, who delivers the head-tilting wide grins and lachrymose pouts he usually does, only this time as an improbable violent action figure. It all makes for slow going with 45 minutes needed for a shift into the 2nd act and a story we all knew was going to happen anyway, with the hunter becoming the hunted. Things don't improve here either with the filmmakers determined to make Alice Braga unappealing, and doing their best to keep the action going with expected twists and louder music. Can't tell you how it ends, I was driving home long before the finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was able to see this at a preview and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a creepy, engaging, quirky, science-fiction, buddy-movie thriller. It had a compelling and unexpected story that was at times darkly funny. It's really a scary cautionary tale about the convergence of greed and consumerism with the medical industry. Oddly appropriate for the conversation about Universal Health Care that the United States will be having this year. The visual world that the film draws you into is very eerie, slick, modern and showy for the people who can afford health care and dark and grimy in the underworld shadows. Jude Law was quite a surprise - I've never seen him play a character like this. He did a great job at being both tough and vulnerable (and handsome). This movie is definitely not for the squeamish. But, if you like watching surgery shows you will love this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jude Law, who played an intelligent, British gentlemen in the recent Sherlock Holmes flick alongside Robert Downey Jr., returns in Repo Men as hardcore, butt kicking repo man with a little bit of James Bond persona.The plot mainly surrounds Law, a man whose job is to repossess organs of the living, who is the best of the best in his area of expertise, being hunted down by his former partner, Whitaker, and employment agency The Union when an accident lands him on the opposite side of his job.The film itself is good throughout its entirety with a few parts going from good to great. Law and Whitaker have great chemistry on screen together and Liev Schrieber is great in his role as usual. The bad ass Latina girl from Predators, Alice Braga, is also good in her role and this also contains a surprise appearance from John Leguizamo.Finally, this movie contains a well thought out and very shocking twist at the end that will leave anyone who watches it wanting to see it again.</fullReview>

Loses his wife, can't see his kid, meets a new woman, gets jiggy with her a few times.You know, the usual - suspend your disbelief, it's still quite enjoyable even though it's thriller by numbers.until that is, the ending.SPOILER ALERT!And it was all a dream! (I kid you not)In essentially a move ripped off from Vanilla Sky (which was a bit of a mess to be fair), our repo man Jude Law had been hooked up to a fake memory about half way through the film when he got caught by his mate.Essentially this made the last half of the film a made up, pointless entity, which left me feeling hollow and unfulfilled.Such a cop out. Kids could be more creative with their ending...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When will movie makers learn to end their movie when it makes sense and leaves the audience happy? This movie had the most disappointing ending I have ever seen and I regret having bothered with i. The premise of this movie is repossessing organs. As we can guess from the commercials, Jude Law's character ends up as the recipient of an organ. This is where all other flaws in the movie start and continue through to the end of the movie. It is through the company he works for that the heart is require, he did not want the organ, he did not want to continue in the business, he loses his wife because of his job and his partner, who could help him with his quota refuses to. There were many poor similarities in this movie to Repo! The Genetic Opera. From a drugged addled singer to the ruthless repossession of organs. There were too many flaws in this movie to mention. If you want to see a good repo movie, stick with the Genetic Opera. You get a good story line, music and the brilliance of Darren Lynn Bousman. I give this movie two thumbs way down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't find this movie to be as bad as a lot of other reviews I read, before seeing it, indicated.I was actually sort of questioning going to see it because of the bad reviews -- it was one I'd been waiting for since I had first heard about it.I thought about going to an early show to spend less on it, but decided to just go ahead and spend the $8.75 to see it tonight.I don't know if the bad reviews are because this just came out after the Oscars, and everyone has been catching up on superb movies? Maybe getting used to well above-average flicks? It's not going to wow you, but it's certainly enjoyable. Then again, I think I'm sort of a sci-fi geek, so my threshold for enjoying this sort of movie is probably lower than for someone who isn't.I read a lot about how the plot never reconciles all of its angles together.. it's just a blood bath film.. et cetera..I can certainly understand those opinions.However, the gore was far less graphic than what I had expected. Don't get me wrong, it's graphic, but it's not Reservoir Dogs style graphic.The plot conflicts didn't stand out to me as much as they seem to have for other people. Driving home, I spent a good bit of time rehashing it all. I'm not going to include a spoiler, but, when it's over, you're going to try to rethink the entire movie -- that is, if you cared enough about it to spend time putting it all back together in your head.If you like sci-fi, and you aren't a film snob, you'll enjoy it. Maybe not for a $9.00 ticket, depending on your level of disposable income, but certainly for an early showing. If you're very critical of film, you won't.I give it a 6 / 10. In my experience, 6 / 10 is 50/50 in regards to whether I'll enjoy something. 7 / 10 is roughly 70/30 in favor of enjoyment.I'd rather put this in the middle at a 6.5 / 10, if I could scale it more accurately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mambo. Do it for yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. A sci-fi action thriller set in the near future, the film is based on the novel by Eric Garcia. It stars Jude Law and Forest Whitaker as organ repo men. No, not Wurlitzer pipe organs ... artificial body organs. The idea is that any vital body organ can be replaced for a price. Just check the repo clause before signing anything! Liev Schreiber is the supervisor of Repo Men at The Union. Judging from the size of the building and the mass of the lab,business is booming in the artificial organ transplant business. And who could be surprised? The Union sales team has a perfect sales pitch - sign here or die. And actually, they don't expect you to stay current on your payments, hence the Repo crew.I never did figure out if this was supposed to be a comedy/satire or dramatic thriller. The actors seem to play it straight, but that actually adds to the humorous moments. Despite some fine and interesting songs on the soundtrack, the film is a bit of a mess at times ... though there are also some fun action scenes. The warning must go out that gore abounds and the actual repo scenes are a bit squirm-inducing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two years ago, I had the honor to go on the Repo Men film set. It was a great experience and I couldn't wait for the movie to come out. I received premiere tickets in Toronto on March 14th. I can confidently say, I was not let down. The start had a lot of jokes, and just the way the film was flowing, you could tell it was different from others, in a good way. It drags quite a bit in the middle, but the end in my opinion, is fantastic. It gets really gruesome in some parts, and sometimes a bit too much. But the actors are great, action is phenomenal(especially the ending action sequence), the directing is great, and the story is fresh. Definitely go see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really excited to see this movie when I saw the trailer. It had action, gore, and a seriously cool concept. Unfortunately, it suffered from identity crisis. Seriously, I couldn't pin the genre of this movie, even looking back.In the second act, it began suffering from what I call action movie syndrome, as the action suddenly became over-the-top and occasionally I'd look at the screen in disbelief and just utter, "really?" When it got down to it though, that wasn't the bad part, movies like that are really nice every once in a while, but I think the sudden shift just made it kind of difficult to swallow.At the same time, the first part of the movie had trouble deciding exactly what it was. There was a plethora of subtle jokes and a lot of self-evident, "hindsight" sort of jokes. But at the same time it wanted to be that action movie that I wanted. Then came the action packed second act. Which was a bit strange following the first act, as previously stated.Then came the ending. I could go on about how bad it was, but I'm trying to keep this spoiler-free. I can put it this way, though, some movies can screw with your mind and get away with it, Pulp Fiction and The Prestige come to mind. This film tried such a tactic with the ending, and just fell flat on its face.In short, your money is better spent on something else in the theater right now. Something with not only a coherent ending, but something that knows what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great sci-fi thriller, gives a new meaning to health care reform and the future</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the original, nor did I read the book and watch the 2008 horror musical. I don't like musicals anyways. Those should stay in theaters and not on the big screen.Repo Men will become a cult classic, and an under-rated gem that will or will not do so well in theaters. But I assume it will do well since it's about health care, and many Americans can relate to this.Repo Men takes us to the future, where part of the old society is a crumbling city, but the new metropolis is a growing one. In this type of world, the health care is premium, and it available to anyone who needs it. It does wonders than what a human organ can do. It can keep an extremely obese person without a heart attack for a lifetime, or cure diabetes. There is a catch though. It isn't exactly cheap. A liver can cost up to 600k and since the organ is a loan, it has a due date, like banks and anything with a contract. Once that due date is up and the person hasn't paid, he or she has 48 hours. If the money is not delivered by then, the repo men come to take the organ back.They leave you with the option of having an ambulance come to keep you on life support, but your heart will NOT be replaced because you have a standing credit balance. You might as well accept that you will die. Of course, the system is controlled by a big corporation like most health insurance companies these days and they want your money, because that's all they care about. In this world, people are expandable, and as long as their payment is still not delivered, they are forced to donate their organ back to the labs for another buyer who has the money.This movie delivers a great soundtrack and has a great intro and ending that will be remembered for a long time. This movie shows us that we could live in this type of future one day. The question is, when? 10/10 for and outstanding job well done.</fullReview>

Watching this movie in a relaxed way, well.. it's been fun. Sort of. If I want a deep, topic oriented cinema, I generally reach for non-hollywoodish one - so I haven't really been upset with the fact that, as other reviewers pointed out, the story is cliché and the ideas used are VERY far from being used to their full potential. But 1. The ideas/problems film deals with are out there and are worth a though. Although for all of you who are not writing a thesis about Sci-Fi, I would recommend reading a book instead. 2. The slasher-porn scene (term borrowed from another review) is absolutely gripping for me. And you can hum to the music, too! 3... nah. That's all. I'd give it 2/10 or so but slasher-porn (and yes, F. Whitaker) are worth those extra 3.If you're really into S-F, you'll watch / you've watched it anyhow. If you're not - skip to ~1:37 to see a absurdly mindless fight scene and proceed to the scene described in point 2.Fare thee well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cast, alright movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Repo Men is a blatant rip-off of Repo: The Genetic Opera, a musical with the same premise. The premise is that people buy kidneys and livers, but if you cannot pay the down-payment, they will kill you and take your livers and kidneys. That's where Remy (Jude Law) &amp; Jake (Forest Whitaker), two good friends come in. They are the guys who kill you. They work for an evil corporation called The Union run by an evil man named Frank (Liev Schreiber). This is a talented cast, but the film's violence and stupid mistakes become redundant. The cast sometimes rises above the material, but that is too far and in between. Some of the killing is cool (sawing off people's legs, stabbing people in the leg, shooting people coolly, etc), but there's so much of it, it's exhausting. The film's stupid mistakes starts with the fact that The Union is in the middle of a mall. It's such a stupid film, but sometimes entertainingly so. It really picks up the last 30 minutes, but that's not enough to fully recommend it. I was disappointed that it wasn't as enthralling as Repo: The Genetic Opera. It's not a terrible film, but by the end, most people will want their 2 hours back. I am guessing only hardcore gore fans will like it, and don't see it if you have a weak stomach, you will hate it. Unfortunately, I do not have a weak stomach, but granted I like gore, I am not a hardcore enough gore fan to recommend this film to anyone but.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie! Jude Law, Forest Whitaker and Liev Schreiber combine to make a fantastic sci-fi feature that is not only plausible but may already be happening. This movie scores a direct hit regarding its underlying message, that is, what can happen when monopoly capitalism is allowed to go out of control. The most glaring abuses are business as usual with tragic consequences for those who are victimized. This movie makes that Michael Douglas movie look like a G-rated romp in the park. At first the movie seems to be little more than your typical Hollywood fare but soon evolves into a complex story about characters who have to make ethical decisions and this involving, of all people, repo men, people not usually known for their sensitivity. Perhaps the strongest performance is that given by Mr. Schreiber who plays a company executive with a mixture of wry humor combined with cold-blooded ruthlessness. The story is fast-paced and robust, and combined with strong acting, makes this movie a must-see.</fullReview>

But when he suffers a cardiac failure on the job, he awakens to find himself fitted with the company's top-of-the-line heart-replacement... as well as a hefty debt. But a side effect of the procedure is that his heart's no longer in the job. When he can't make the payments, The Union sends its toughest enforcer, Remy's former partner Jake (Forest Whitaker), to track him down.Now that the hunter has become the hunted, Remy joins Beth (Alice Braga), another debtor who teaches him how to vanish from the system.

		<fullReview>Uh oh......here comes an attack on the new health care bill. Well, sort of.......if you give it a long enough time line and tweak some of the extremities. Sci-Fi movies have always done well in this department........they have been able to see most of the writing on the wall and somewhat predict how the future will turn out. No im not saying that all the flying cars and bizarre science is accurate, but the human reaction to it all seems somewhat spot on. Who knows, maybe something like this could very well happen in the future.Well like i said, the message in this movie is pretty clear. And in a way, it's pretty enlightening. It's just a shame that is wasn't presented in the same fashion. The plot surrounding the main character is. nothing original at all. We have all heard the tale time and time again. A man who is once a predator, and then by some misfortune, becomes the prey. Sure its been done hundreds of times, but this new twist could offer something fresh and different, right? Well, not really. And i think the main reason why this concept failed was because of the character drive. If you are going to transform the main character into the thing that he once hunted, you really need to create a sense of feeling for not only the main character, but by the people he is now surrounded by. This movie did neither of those things. It just sort of drifted along with its story, filling in small gaps until the next gory action sequence came up.......and believe me, the movie is pretty gory. Sure the movie had some cinematic moments that were worth while. But the main reason why they were so great, was because they were scenes stolen straight out of other Sci-Fi movies.Also, the script was kind of weak. You really could sense that Jude Law and Forrest Whitaker were really trying their best to pull something out of this. But there wasn't anything there. This movie was filled with a lot of empty sequences. The sort of small love story, empty. The relationship with his son and wife, empty. The realization of what he had been doing all this time, empty.Bottom Line, this movie really did have potential. But it failed with its dialogue and character depth. The best comparison that i can give for this movie is that its like a weaker version of "Minority Report"........way weaker. Its pretty much the same thing, just with people removing other peoples organs. Now to some people that may sound like a cool concept, which in a way, it does, but i assure you its not.</fullReview>

It is everywhere. Q, the city shots, the city itself, and advertisements are one of MANY identical parts in Repo Men. Im sorry but if you have seen both films, (we are not judging the quality of both films here mind you) than all of the similarities should be as bold to you as they were to me. The only real differences were that a family did not run the union, The basic plot, and no feuding siblings. All in all Repo Men has some funny moments, fun action scenes, and some good gore, but over all it falls flat on its weak story arc, unlikeable characters, unfitting dialogue, and Forest Whitakers constant character changing. Nothing in the film was cohesive and flowed and seems to me thats is purely Universals way of saying "Hey DLB we told you we could do it". Im not trying to say Don't SEE THIS MOVIE or BOYCOTT, I paid my 9 bucks fair and square, I didn't trying to ruin the experience by shouting comments during, before, or after (ok one comment after "I liked it better as a musical). I wanted to give it a fair chance but o sweet baby Jesus did it smell of 'stolen movie idea' See it for yourself, form your own opinion, but like I said, if you have seen both movies it is near impossible for you to not see everything that they have in common. O, BTW for those of you saying 'the book came first', you do know that the book came out this year and the screenplay and book were written at the same time shortly after DLB went to Universal to green light Repo!

		<fullReview>Repossession Mambo was a heady, interesting, unique, visceral action film. It surprised me on multiple levels -- Jude Law was unlike I had ever seen him before -- muscled, tough, an action hero -- the film was a gritty, action-packed sci-fi thriller that for me evoked films like FIGHT CLUB and CHILDREN OF MEN. The violent action was fast-paced, nail-biting and at one point near the end, uniquely sensual. The audience I saw it with seemed to heartily enjoy the film as I did, and the comments I heard likened the film to other long-admired science fiction films. The cast was amazing -- Jude Law, Liev Schrieber, Forest Whittake and Alice Braga all give excellent performances. The movie's not for the faint of heart -- it's appropriately bloody for a main character whose job is to repossess people's organs before they are done using them -- but it gets across its timely themes in a way that is fresh, edgy and unexpected.</fullReview>

Who knew that Jude Law could be so physical? (And let me say, I thought the lack of singing was a bonus). Perhaps more than anything I appreciated the LOOK of the film and was pleasantly surprised by its sense of humor! Despite the dark nature of the material there were laugh out loud moments of ironic humor. It was another layer that made me appreciate the movie all the more. For that I credit the director. The ability to think outside the box and create a unique viewing experience is all too rare nowadays and Repossession Mambo accomplishes that. It's the kind of movie that when I walked out, I was still thinking about it. Maybe not everyone will love it as much as me, but it's the kind of thing everyone should see. It's a conversation starter. Decide for yourself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is basically a copy of Days of Thunder, but instead of cars we get human organ trafficking. Extraordinary camera-work, wizardry technical effects, and big name stars - the thrilling "sub-genre" of adrenaline rush has to come to Bollywood with a bang! Cards on the table, here, "Repo Men" was my introduction to the delights of NonBollywood cinema. They switch focus from the whole to a single part. But they cut all the good parts that the original had out. Like the feel that the world had. From the trailer this dystopia is clean lined and not nearly as Gothic. Plus no one is breaking out into song - I enjoyed the use of split screen at various points through the movie and the cinematography is glossy and polished. The film is quite amusing, it has some decent action sequences, the songs would be likable if there were any and the pace is somewhat fast-moving.Clearly, it is an idea stolen from the writers of Repo Opera. This is a moderately engaging Black Market Organ Harvesting movie. It's not very exciting but is reasonable time-pass entertainment. Jude Law plays the one of the best amoral organ repo men in the business and while he's an average actor, he certainly looks cool with sunglasses. Denzel Washington is surprisingly funny and not as annoying as usual. Avery Schreiber is stuck with the conventional role. He tries hard but the focus of the film is clearly on Jude. The title track "Repo Macha Le" is pretty catchy and you may leave the theater humming the tune. Alice, Tanya and Carice have little to do except look gorgeous. Watchable film.Overall 2/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the powerful team of actors and apparently brilliant script, Repo Men in itself is not a new idea that is fresh to the market, but is unfortunately the competitor of a movie that was swept under the rug, nearly two years before this release, and ran for 10 years as a rock opera under the radar. For those who desire something more, or felt that Repo Men could not deliver, the original piece, Repo! the Genetic Opera, is far superior, and is no doubt more inventive.Jude Law, a brilliant actor, blew me away with his performance and genuinely made the movie worth acting in its own. The gore was moderately realistic, and the plot was unoriginal, but I feel that Law's unique portrayal and distinctive performance made the movie worth paying for, but perhaps only once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great action sci fi flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it was eerie, gory, slick, violent and funny. and i'm sending all my friends when it comes out. i've been talking about it ever since i saw the screener. i'm praying it becomes a video game. jude law is amazing. all the acting is strong and compelling. and the plot is surprising and unpredictable. most action movies have no substance whatsoever and you can predict the ending before it even starts. this film had excellent action sequences but also shocked me. it stands out in my mind from all other action movies. plus that actress alice is hot as all hell. and there is nothing like watching a hot chick kill people on screen. i can't wait to see what it looks like after they add the effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie rocked my world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i cannot wait for this movie to come out and to send all my friends. first of all, it was eye candy. the action sequences are brilliant and bad ass. the gore was beyond rad - there is actually a love scene in which two people operate on each other while kissing. it blew my mind. this movie is filled with original material. stunts like you've never seen them mixed with satire. and it was funny. it's rare to see a action movie that makes you laugh. the acting was great. the stars have great chemistry. if you like futuristic movies, you will love this movie. if you love action movies, you will love this movie. if you like movies in general, you will like this movie. it is truly for everyone. not only was i captivated the entire time, but the story and the scenes stayed with me. i keep thinking about them. don't miss this film, seriously.</fullReview>
