		<shortDescription>A true original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had the sad history of being blackballed in the United States due to the incident at Columbine...which is a real shame, because it is a treasure...written and directed by Troy Duffy, Boondocks is set in Boston...it is the story of fraternal twin Irish boys (Connor and Murphy McManus) who work in a meat packing plant...when their friend, Doc, is being stiff armed by the Russian Mafia, the boys and their friends step in to help...and away we go! Two of the most interesting characters in the film are played by veteran actor William Dafoe, and a newcomer to the silver screen, David Della Rocco. Dafoe's character is Paul Smecker, a gay FBI agent specializing in organized crime...Rocco plays an Italian Mafia package boy who is a close friend to the Irish brothers...the central theme of the film is the indifference of good men...Connor and Murphy are not indifferent, and after helping their friend, Doc, the two embark on a crusade to rid the streets of Boston of criminals...with the assistance of their comical and zany friend, Rocco...This film had positive elements on all sides...humor...a moral message...and incredible actors...you will no doubt find yourself repeating the many memorable quotes from the film...I am a woman, and not at all into your typical "shoot 'em up" guy films...this is not another one of those films...it has become an underground "cult" sensation...See it...you will not be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Saints Come Marching In!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in my years of watching indies, and it proves conclusively that you don't need a massive budget to do a terrific action film!Two blue-collar Boston Irish brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, who are both terrific!) rid their favorite pub of an influx of Russian gangsters, and soon decide they are on a Mission from God to execute all the 'heavy hitter' criminals from the city. While this makes them local heroes, it also sets sympathetic detective Willem Dafoe on their trail.The story is reminiscent of the 'Death Wish' series, without the glossy superficiality of the Bronson films. At times funny, at times disturbing, it never loses momentum, with a twist ending is both satisfying and thoroughly insane! While the violence is graphic, the story is character-driven, and never allows the executions to overwhelm the plot. You actually like the brothers, and may be hard-pressed NOT to root for them, even if you do feel a bit guilty about it!The Boondock Saints is a fabulous film, one that deserves your attention!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great unusual action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very intelligent action movie, about two Irish brothers who kill 'sinners' to punish them. The movie is a bit different from the typical action movie, as it doesn't have car-chases or explosions. The action consists of stylish shooting sprees. It also has a fairly original idea that is utilized in nearly every action scene in the movie, and that should be used more often in action films; first you see the aftermath, the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc. After/as the police come up with theories to the crime, we see the actual scene, of the brothers punishing criminals. It's a different kind of vigilante movie. It's particularly gory and bloody, but this just makes it all the more realistic. In real life, there is a significant amount of blood when someone is shot in the head. The movie has some Christian subtexts, I think I've heard about five major theories about the whole movie's meaning. This shows, in my opinion, that there was obviously a lot of thought put into the movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who can stand the gore, even if they aren't Christians. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've either seen it or you haven't; you either love it with a fiery passion, or curse it for ever being thought up. Boondock Saints is one of those films that people just can't seem to be apathetic about.I happen to be one of the those who love it with a firey passion. I thought that Willem Dafoe's character was fantastic and created a gay man unlike the stereotypes of "Queer Eye." I also thought Duffy's was well suited to the tone of the movie, and created several fascinating shots that I love as a film student. The credit sequence strikes me as brilliance; the film raises a lots of questions of where the line between good and evil lays and about perceptions of God. The writing made me laugh, the music made me shiver (the opening sequence is The Blood of Cu Chulainn--fantastic if you like that genre), and the characters made me care. On a purely shallow feminine note: just as straight boys have twin fantasies, so do I with a pair of fraternal Irish twins...thank you Troy, thank you.Of course then there's the opposite side of the coin. Allowing yourself to be immersed in the story takes some huge suspension of belief. Common examples: Conner jumping off a building and not breaking bones--possible, but unlikely, and the boys falling through the air duct after magically taking a coiled rope, untying it and getting tangled in it enough that when caught would hold their weight allowing them to shoot every major boss in the Russian Mob--yeah, I don't buy it either, but it's extremely cinematic! Some people would point to that and say "divine intervention! God loves them!" Yeah well, God loves us all, but you don't see people flying off buildings because of it--well you might, but you get my drift. So my point is that, while I love this movie, I could very easily see where someone else wouldn't.If you haven't seen it; you should. Give it a chance. Don't listen to anybody else before you do. Hell, if you haven't seen it why are you reading this? Go rent it, burrow if from your friends, whatever; watch it and form your own opinions and then join in some huge fight on the message boards. Good fun can be had by all, whether you loved or hated it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Purely just a Fun Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know there's a lot of people who either worship this movie or hate it. Truth be told this movie is just a fun action movie with a good plot, great characters, and very good direction. Compare it to whatever you want, but you can do that with any movie out there. If you haven't had the chance to catch this flick, go out and rent it! it's one of those movies that shouldn't be missed. I guarantee that once you see it you'll be quoting it left and right. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus have amazing chemistry together, and David Del Rocko just adds the comedic relief that makes the trio one thats hard to take your eyes off of. See the Boondock Saints and get ready to have a good ole celtic time.(B)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great (but not always new) ideas - great realization. Entertainment in the tradition of "Pulp Fiction".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preliminary remark: the comments refer to a pre-release version that was shown at the "Fantasy Film Festival" in Cologne, Germany, in August 1999."Boondock Saints" is a clever, funny, sufficiently violent movie with an overall high entertainment value. The story revolves around two Irish-American brothers and an excentric gay FBI agent (awesome: William Dafoe). The brothers - devout Catholics - who speak several languages fluently and work in a slaughterhouse find themselves equipped with money and weapons and subsequently start their very own crusade against the evil men of Boston - professional killers, mafia bosses and drug dealers. The agent is at their heels from the outset, but he has to realize that justice is on the side of the brothers...This basic plot is the foundation for a highly energetic narrative: we get excellent and at times highly comic dialogues (with a high F***-word ratio), running gags, and lots of crazy situations and plot developments that are as absurd as they are funny. The action/shooting scenes are well-choreographed with a fine eye for the detail, but it's the main characters, their dialogues and developments around which the movie is develops rather than the action sequences.On top of this, we get a fractured time/place structure that's already familiar from movies such as Kubrick's "The Killing" or Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs", but "Boondock Saints" takes it to new extremes - and thus it's fun to watch.Of course, the characters are a bit shallow every now and then and one would love to learn more about their background, but that's only a slight criticism. Overall, and measured by its own intention, "Boondock Saints" is great entertainment. More, it doesn't need to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fourth year film student with a chip on his/her shoulder will probably tell you that this film is simple, uninspired, derivative, gratuitous..... ignore him/her just like you always do and see this genuinely funny movie. It has an inspired performance by Willem Dafoe and enough new ideas to keep you glued. The social commentary should probably be looked at as more of a plot device than intelligent thought, but I found myself watching this movie repeatedly and enjoying it more the second and third time around. This is definitely a naughty pleasure for the movie enthusiast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My son called me from Korea (Army Medic) to tell me that I had to see this movie. He brought it home with him on leave and we watched it together and he was absolutely right. It was "off the chain" as he says. It was so different from the standard fare that only substitutes different faces into the same tired story lines. We love it and I am now buying my own copy. I recommend it to any one that I know is a discriminating movie lover. I can't wait for the sequel. By the way , I'm a 43 year old mom of three so it's not just for 20 something males. Willem Dafoe was over the top but absolutely perfect for this movie. My husband hates movies and any TV that doesn't have a ball and a score, but he actually loved this movie too. It kept him on the edge of his seat and he actually laughed out loud several times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boondock Saints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*A lot of Spoilers*Almost all of my friends told me to watch this movie. "It's so sick", "Great Movie", "It's so badass", and "It is in a category of it's own"... well, I can honestly say that "The Boondock Saints" was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and had it not been for Willem Dafoe, it would have easily been the worst movie of all time. (A title currently held by both The Exorcist II and The Amityville Horror). This movie is crap, there is no way around it. The cult status it has climbed to is baffling. The fact that many people enjoy this movie is beyond the realm of human comprehension. I cannot understand. It has a lousy story line, and it doesn't gel or make sense. The action is GARBAGE. I don't care what anyone says, it blows. Its cheesy, dull and anticlimactic... Half of the "action" is bad quick-cut scenes zooming in on aftermath, or shots of people shooting up a storm. For some reason people can't seem to shoot each other from ten feet away, and while dangling upside-down in a room full of gangsters, these jerks kept their bearings and shot up the joint, killing almost 10 mobsters (How can they shoot so well? why can't mobsters shoot? what was holding up the rope?). Why were they so smart? why did they pack meat for a living if they could speak multiple languages? How come he didn't die after jumping off a building at least 5 stories high into an alley? What the hell was the writer thinking? The acting, with the exception of Willem Dafoe (why did he have to crossdress? honestly...), was ghastly. The Irish accents were brutal, and the overdone villains were just as horrendous. The whole "we're catholic, but we execute Mobsters" thing was also swill. The prayer being spoken in unison was so lame!! Who writes this crap? The whole symmetric action shots of them lighting cigarettes, praying, shooting, etc. were so corny I was ashamed of myself for watching, and I was hoping nobody would come into the room and watch... I would have been reprimanded for watching such trash. The accents from the "Saints" were like a poor man's Mickey, from "Snatch"...a good movie. This movie is so flawed, so cheesy, and so boring I was shocked after I watched it. Also, another atrocity is that its being compared to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. How dare someone make that comparison? Those movies are masterpieces, with good actors, excellent dialogue, perfect direction, fitting music (this movie had the worst music I think I've ever heard in a film) and reasonable story lines. This movie was the polar opposite of that. Irish people should be appalled by this... anyone from Boston should be appalled by this... every person on the face of the earth should be appalled by this. What gets me the most is the alienation that people who don't like this movie feel. They become outcasts in the conversation... I Just don't get it... we need more movies like Commando, Terminator, Aliens, Rambo, Cliffhanger, or Predator... hell, even Marked for Death or Cobra (that's right, 1986 Sly Stallone) is better than this. Its a sad day when people think that Matrix movies and this refuse are excellent action films. Shed a tear for a near dead genre. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you want to watch it in order to make a subsequent film look really good. ? star/ 5. This movie is on par with Jaws 4 and Barb Wire... despicable... May god have mercy on Troy Duffy's soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Non-linear storytelling executed well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always enjoyed non-linear storytelling. A number of people seem to have picked up on this aspect of the movie and thus dubbed it similar to Pulp Fiction (though no one mentions Reservoir Dogs) when this movie takes non-linear storytelling to a level beyond where Quentin Tarrantino was ever able to go.Now, certainly Memento came along afterwards and transformed the entire art of non-linear storytelling. However, Memento uses it to keep the movie watcher guessing until the very end, whereas Boondock Saints puts the pieces on the table, letting you try to put them together, but then will continue handing you pieces until the picture becomes clearer.Clearly the movie is designed to be over-the-top, both from Williem Dafoe's character to the action sequences themselves. Williem Dafoe makes this movie for me. The plot, which centers on religiously-inspired vigilante justice, has an air of being somewhat cliched, although I would be hard pressed to name another movie which handles it in this matter.I still fail to see how others consider this movie vacuous and without meaning, when its message about the pitfalls of our current legal system and the need for something that transcends it is quite clear. I thought the ending, in which various people are interviewed about their opinion of the "Saints" and how for some vigilante justice was an incredibly sensitive issue, made this point very clear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess it'll take a while for the effect to where off. I saw the unrated edition of "The Boondock Saints" two days ago and I'm still reeling in from the experience, which is surreal, to tell you the truth. Quite frankly, a movie that is this sharply written, acted, and directed is a true rarity these days. Writer-director Troy Duffy dives into the murkiest depths of the "law," and its apparent futility in modern times, and how it takes two Irish fraternal twin brothers, Conner and Murphy (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus - both of whom are a little too convincing in their roles), to stir up enough debate about vigilantism to become media heroes. The release of "The Boondock Saints" was sidelined in 1999 because of the Columbine massacre and the plot about Conner and Murphy being on a mission from God draws some eerie parallels to the motives of Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. As the film opens in Boston after St. Patrick's Day, Conner and Murphy get into a bar-room brawl with a couple of Russian toughs and said toughs are discovered the next morning in an alley in piles of their own blood and guts. FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) shows up on the scene to show the local cops a thing or two about criminology and theorizes it was a revenge killing. Soon enough, both injured brothers waltz into the police station and claim self-defense. They're let off after a night in jail (plus experience a cathartic jail-cell baptism) and no charges filed. But soon, more bodies turn up, and Smecker learns that Conner and Murphy (and a third, David Della Rocco) may be the ones behind the mayhem on the streets. Duffy's film is a bloody one (most of the gruesome violence is extended in the unrated special edition), with a cackling screenplay that includes 246 uses of the f-word and assorted Irish-Euro-slang, and has earned a fearsome reputation in recent years and has been embraced as a cult phenomenon. (It's easy to see why, if one is a fan of relentless violence and bloodshed. P.S.: The action is so balletic in its style and excess that it's almost reminiscent of a John Woo picture.) I can't believe I stood away from this movie for so long, darn it! The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action (which there is quite a bit of and, as stated earlier, is extended in the unrated version) is quite bloody, there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture. And still, there is a sense of beauty and tragedy underlying much of the action in "The Boondock Saints," and its ending will certainly leave a bitter taste in the mouths of some. Lastly, I would recommend reading up on as much about the controversy surrounding "The Boondock Saints" as one possibly can; it'll make the experience much more hypnotic.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was like finishing one of those paint by number kits and calling it "art". Every character completely contrived and unrealized. Plus the obvious inconsistencies were so annoying. Case in point - one moment the twins can knock off nine mobsters hanging from a rope upside down and the next they can't hit the broadside of a barn in the shootout with Il Duce. Then Il Duce turns out to be daddy! And the way the director condescends to his audience is a joke. Wanna see how all of the dead bodies got to be that way? Wait a minute and I will will show you. Can't come up with any original dialog? No problem. Use the F-word 200+ times. Dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic atrocity (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a lovable pair the MacManus brothers are. They're Irish, they're religious and they horse about at work, hitting each other in the face with pieces of raw meat. What cracking fellows. Oh, and in their spare time (surprise, surprise) they drink a lot. The only problem is that some Russian Nikolai Volkov look-a-likes want to buy their favourite bar. They can't be having this, so they beat the guys up and set one bloke's arse on fire. It's just a bit of crack. However, the Russians don't see the funny side. The day after this incident they chain one brother to the toilet and take the other down to the street to kill him. But then the chained brother frees himself, and from the top of the apartment building looking down onto the alley, he drops the toilet down onto the head of the Russian shooter, a man who is cackling like a cartoon villain, and then jumps several stories down onto the other, hitting him with remarkable precision. Then the brother that is still conscious beats the Russians to death with fragments of the toilet. As if it needed stating, the film is a load of crap.Watching The Boondock Saints is kind of like performing a DIY lobotomy. You lie down on the sofa and relax, and by the end of the ordeal you're a drooling, shambling, glassy-eyed zombie. It's just a shame it's so hard to find a big Chief to put you out of your misery once the credits have rolled.But what makes the film so bad? Well, the idiotic morality doesn't help. Apparently it's okay to kill people as long as you think they're evil and as long as you believe in god. But what constitutes evil? Well, instead of going after politicians, corporations and religious leaders, the brothers decide to kill gangsters. Well, fair enough, they're bad guys, but the brothers themselves aren't any better. They manhandle women, they terrorise priests and their best mate gropes the breasts of an unconscious woman. Wow, these are such great guys. However, their dumb mate makes up for the groping by slaughtering more wicked men. So that makes it alright, then.But their dumb mate, a 'reformed' Italian gangster, also threatens his girlfriend with a gun. Remember, he's on the side of the righteous. And earlier on in his life, he stood by and watched a man slaughter an entire family. Of course, this non-response is justified by him being scared. However, at the very beginning, a priest says that the indifference of good men is just as bad as the evil of wicked men. Therefore, with this bloke turning a blind eye to violence and then embracing it, he's surely doubly evil.Another stupid moral detail is that the brothers are supposedly protecting the Irish community. Yet this is a community, in the film, that is proud of not talking to the police. That's more indifference. So why should I give a tinker's fart about a community that wont help itself and which takes pride in allowing gangsters (the church is certainly included in this, as they're the biggest gangsters of all) take control of their lives? But the most dubious piece of morality occurs at the end. The two brothers and Billy Connolly terrorise a court while spouting religious claptrap. Apparently they're right and you're wrong. You have to do what they say. "These are not polite suggestions. These are codes of behaviour." So do I get shot if I use prophylactics? I mean, the Pope hates those things and he's god's messenger on Earth.But although I could spend ages ripping the religious nonsense to shreds, the film also fails spectacularly in terms of entertainment. For instance, there's the idiotic way it's filmed. Basically you go from crime scene to crime scene and then in flashback you see the murder itself (in mind-numbing slow-motion). It's incredibly repetitive. And Willem Defoe's character, the FBI agent who's assigned the case, is a cheap rip off of Gary Oldman's character in Leon ? he listens to classical music as he puts everything together (he also reaches for the sky in ecstasy when he solves puzzles). But to try and add some colour, the character is gay. However, for some reason, despite being fierce Catholics, the brothers don't mind this fact. They call him a good man. Maybe it's because he's the sort of homosexual who just loves bum sex ? he doesn't like hugging. But again, it's further evidence of the way the brothers pick and choose what's good and what's bad ? of course, we all do this, but most of us aren't going to shoot people if we don't agree with their personal choices.What's really bad, though, is the action. There's one scene where the brothers and their mate are standing there having a shoot-out with Billy Connolly. No one moves but even at point blank range no one can hit the target. And what makes it even more stupid is that Connolly's character is supposed to be a lethal killing machine (he's kept in prison like Hannibal Lector). Someone give him some shooting lessons.And then there's the scene where the brothers fall out of an air duct, and hanging from a rope, manage to kill a bunch of gangsters. Only someone with an IQ lower than Forest Gump could find any merit in that.And the less said about the scene where Defoe re-enacts a shoot-out by using his fingers as guns, the better.But what makes this film so depressing is that it seems to have such a strong following. I have no idea what they see in the film, because all I see is rightwing religious claptrap fed to the audience through idiotic characters and preposterous situations. To admit to liking this film is to admit to being an imbecile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...albeit a little too proud of itself. I waited a long time before actually watching this film, then an ex-girlfriend loaned it to me telling me I wouldn't be disappointed. And I wasn't. Boondock Saints looks and feels like a fan film, and it is well done. The actors, I felt, were carefully chosen, did a wonderful job, and composed themselves well. The only real annoyances were Willem Dafoe's character being a know-it-all, and David Della Rocco who screams his head off throughout the whole movie. Its rare that a movie of this genre has a gratifying ending, and when the credits started rolling, I was a little sad that there wasn't more. This movie kept me entertained thoroughly, and I was happy that I finally watched it. For those who haven't seen it, sit back and enjoy the violent ride, for it's a fun one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Go ahead. Accuse me of being a square who just doesn't get it but for the love of god please read the review before you get overly sensitive and click no! I never heard anybody talking about this movie. I only saw it because a website where I usually go to look up recent movies kept promoting this garbage so I sat down and watched this rubbish out of curiosity(for free...what, you'd think Id' actually pay to see this?). There goes two hours of my life that I will never get back. I rushed to Amazon.com to see the reviews but much to my dismay it has a four and a half star average on Amazon. I went to IMDb.com and my jaw hit the floor. This movie is in the top 250! I had to get surgery to keep my jaw off the floor.All bad jokes aside this movie is so terrible that it defines bad. Its not even enjoyable in its badness like some movies can be. Its so terrible that it makes you give up hope on life. Yes its THAT bad. The whole movie is about two idiotic Irish brothers, Connor(Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy(Norman Reedus) that decide that they are ordained to kill evil men in South Boston. Thats the whole movie in a nutshell plus throw in a stupid plot twist involving the homicidal hit man trying to kill them being their father. Willem Dafoe must have been blackmailed to appear in this monstrosity of a film( as a homophobic homosexual FBI agent). I don't see any other reason an actor of his talent should appear in this so-called movie.The acting is dreadful. Norman Reedus played a decent bad guy in Dueces Wild but he sucks here. Sean Patrick Flanery is just as bad and David Della Rocco needs to be kept away from every movie studio with armed guards,tanks and rottweilers for safety reasons. He is just that awful. Willem Dafoe chews scenery like a locust. Now we all know that Willem Dafoe is up there with all the great actors like Denzel Washington, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Tim Roth, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey, Harvey Keitel and the slew of others. We all know that Willem Dafoe even shines when he is in a movie that is a total train wreck(Think State Of The Union) but not here. in this movie he is reduced to a goofy FBI agent that re-enacts each crime scene while channeling Jim Carrey and Dame Edna in a performance that is so over the top that its eyebrow-raising for all the wrong reasons. The film is a total bore and its blatant attempt to rip off films of Quentin Tarantino, Luc Besson and Guy Ritchie come off as pitiful more than flattering.The acting and the action scenes are not the only things that suck. Nobody in this movie seems to speak a coherent language and most of the time are using cheesy action quips that nobody says. Not even in action flicks! They say this movie is style-over-substance. I agree that there is no substance but there is also no style either. Style wise this movie is like a guy wearing a plaid suit with a Buffalo Bills hat and Florsheim shoes. He'd like to think he was cool but he's not. This movie has achieved cult status. You have no idea how sad that makes me feel. Whatever happen to movies rightfully earning a cult fanbase. This movie gained fans off an obscene amount of hype and we all know its true.All of you reasonable people out there PLEASE tell people the truth about this movie(screw what your friends will think of you). Tell the people that this movie is incredibly bad so that they can save themselves the torture of having to sit through a movie that can only be enjoyed by people who sniff glue. Two thumbs all the way down.To the director, Troy Duffy: Don't even think about making a sequel to this dollar bin bust, you talentless stool bucket!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not deserving of its semi-cult following</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is Willem Dafoe in this movie? It demeans him. It starts well enough, with two Irish blue-collar brothers ridding the world of some Russian mafia scumbags. However, it soon devolves into the worst kind of bad acting, improbable situations, and ridiculous developments that you've ever had the misfortune to see. Ron Jeremy is one of the best actors in the film -- that should tell you everything! He's actually better at playing his scumbag role than Dafoe is.Willem Dafoe as an openly gay, long-hair hippy psychotic FBI agent is insulting to anyone who is not certifiably paranoid. Later in the film, the scenes when he is "conducting" the crimes he is investigating are so ludicrous that they are actually amusing. Amusing, and embarrassing. I hope they paid him well for this particular buffoonery. Willem, hang your head in shame! Yakovetta? Who decided that was an Italian name? One of the Russian mafia bosses (a man) was named "Petrova" -- a female name. The writers of this travesty are idiots.I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever finished. There are a few more that I've turned off, or walked out of, but after finishing this one, I felt soiled. I can't believe that someone told me this was a good movie.The soundtrack was not bad, but I felt embarrassed and ashamed for the musicians, as the music was overly grandiose for the trivial and idiotic scenes it was attempting to embellish.The moronic scene where the moronic "Funny Man" Rocco has died, and the moronic Irish brothers pray over him, is, well, moronic. I overuse the word purposely! It's insulting and incredibly amateurish. A high school film student would have done better.I can't believe that Dafoe can sleep at night after having made this incredibly horrible film. I bought the DVD on a discount rack, and I'm going to throw it in the trash where it belongs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>worst movie I've seen in a while. this movie will appeal to younger viewers who haven't seen a lot of good films and who think that a movie with an absurd plot and lots of shooting is "awesome". All the Big Movies nowadays have these "cartoon stereotyped characters" and absurd situations and dialog that passes for originality.I thought the movie was a silly waste of time. FBI agent Defoe does a little river-dance at the crime scene? a guy jumps from a 5th floor window and doesn't get hurt? why not just allow the character to fly? Here, I've made up some more stupid plot ideas they could have also used: the brothers turn out to be aliens. the brothers can stop time. every time someone is killed their soul ends up in a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Detroit.Just making up outlandish plot points doesn't make a good movie. the characters were so superficial that I didn't care about any of them. if there's no basis in reality...if anything can happen...then what's the point in investing in caring for what happens to the characters if you know they can suddenly be saved by a crazy plot twist at the last minute? Total Crap!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematic Abortion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints was released in 1999 and ushered in a fan base possessing cinematic principles rivaling those of The Godfather Part III supporters.This heap of thrown together crime drama is brimming with horrendous plot elements and is accompanied with ear-raping dialog that ultimately appealed to a thoughtless audience, easily enticed with the notion of guns, violence, organized crime, and being 'cool'.There is not one redeeming factor to this film. And so begins a rant with just a few of the fallacies of the movie: it was extremely ridiculous that the Irish superhero would know where the Russian Mob evildoer would take his brother. Yet somehow he does and meets him there with porcelain.It was not 'cool' or 'awesome' when the audience is introduced to Dafoe's character dancing around a murder crime scene (ooo ahhh its so remarkably well thought; his methods are so unorthodox, but doggone it do they work) in addition to the subsequent banter that took place between the (painstakingly made aware) more experienced Dafoe and a lesser-experienced detective.The gun battles were absolutely ludicrous. The battle between them and the individual sent to kill them was mind-numbingly lame. The main characters stand perfectly still in the fight and yet the world-class sharpshooter assassin is unable to land a fatal shot on either of them.Their reconnaissance mission through the air duct in which they are arguing about rope was vomit inducing. Oh wow, that's so absurd they are arguing about rope. Actually, it's not. It's sad and it's lame.Ron Jeremy is in it; Dafoe cross dresses and subsequently canoodles with an Italian man; fun stuff, a wacky adventure straight from the dust-ridden pages of the mystery gang's Shaggy and Scooby Doo.The entire experience felt like a bombast attempt to make a crime movie akin to Goodfellas, The Godfather, Miller's Crossing, or Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs; yet it failed miserably and formed the on-screen abortion it is today. It was trying so hard to assimilate that it forgot about making a place for itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb and immoral movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When i read the annotation to the film i had a great expectations. I thought it would be a serious film about men who, driven by their strong moral feeling, i.e. desire for the happiness for good people and aversion for such people being harmed, will attempt a crusade against those who are obtaining wealth at the expense of other people sufferings, especially gangsters.I was wrong. The film is about two guys, who, not having a slightest moral feelings (in the above-mentioned sense), are suddenly mystically stuck with a idea of "eradicating evil" and with a fanatic joy are putting it into practice. In their minds it means to kill everyone who has a connection to crime activity. With the exception of their friend Rock who being himself a gangster, joins them to repay his boss and his fellow-gangsters for a set up. Him they love and never care that he is a scum and obviously lead by the selfish anger. They never bother themselves with a thorough selection of targets. A word from Rock, for example, is enough for them to visit the house he pointed and slain everyone inside. That even if they are killing gangsters there could be an undercover officer or debtor among them never come to their minds. While doing all this they are obviously having fun, getting especially exited when they are able to rob their victims.To sum it all up, the movie is about fanatics, motivated solely by the desire of putting their ideas into life. The same kind of motivation that now occupies so many people from Middle East. That this type of motivation can bear some resemblance to real moral will perhaps misled some to consider this movie as delivering moral message. In my opinion, this a most disgusting and dumb movie i ever saw. However if you don't care much about moral basis, this movie will entertain you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cannot understand the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard nothing but rave reviews for this movie. One of my best friends stared at me incredulously when he heard that I had never seen "The Boondock Saints." Apparently, it's reached cult status. Well, with all the hype surrounding the movie, I reserved it on Netflix.com and I couldn't wait to receive it in the mail. Last night, I watched it with a friend. Ten minutes into the movie, I was so disappointed I wanted to turn it off. But I held in there for the full duration of the movie just so I could write a review about it today.Well, here's the premise: two Irish Catholic brothers in South Boston, on an apparent mission from GOD, start killing members of a Russian mafia. Willem Dafoe, a clever FBI agent, is sent in to investigate but ends up admiring the brothers. Written and directed by any other person, this story would have been incredible. Instead, in the hands of Troy Duffy, the story was reduced to the level of a made-for-TV movie. All the stars in the film overracted. Yes, unfortunately, even Willem Dafoe. The most blatant overacting, however, was done by Rocco, the "funny man" mobster. He wasn't very funny, though he told one racist joke that drew a chuckle out of me. Besides the overacting, there were horrible cliches I couldn't stomach. For example, Willem Dafoe is a gay FBI agent. This was milked for laughs several times during the movie. At one point, he calls his lover a "fag" and the bartender at a gay bar a "fairy". Why this was included in the movie is beyond me, especially the scene in the gay bar. It just didn't fit, but I guess the director found all of this comedic. Another cliche was the old Irish bartender with Tourette's Syndrome. In the beginning of the movie, he curses infront of nuns in a hospital. Yeah, I know, could it get any worst? I could not stomach this movie. The comedy was less than mediocre, the story was underdeveloped, the acting was terrible, and the cliches gave me a headache. I cannot understand the appeal of a movie like this. Very poor work by Troy Duffy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite possibly the most overrated film of all time; maybe even the worst film of all time. Far from the great streetsmart action film that it is praised to be, Boondock Saints is a severely banal and contradictory film that contains poor acting, poor accents and even poorer performances. From the two brothers who are flawed, contradicted and pathetic characters, who are in the movie to tote guns and sport bible lines all to a hip soundtrack and Troy DUffy's pathetically uninteresting vision. THis movie is sacrificed to be what it became- pure Hollywood movie-making; produced only to make money and look entertaining, filled with archetypes where everything leads to something else, with no point and no vision. THe film reaches its sad low-point when Dafoe's uselessly gay character (why? why is he gay?) lets the killers go, because, well, we just don't know. That and the fact that their dad joins in the cause. THe whole movie sums it up; we don't know. And it sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So "cool" it sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I can see how so many people could've been hoodwinked into thinking this was a good movie. It just piles a bunch of "cool" imagery and ideas together and flings them onto the screen. "Boondock Saints" is one of the more shallow bits of cinema to cross my path in a while. The twins are fantastic shots when hanging upside down from twisted rope while spinning and wearing ski masks. But line them up in front of one man in broad daylight and they're lucky to escape with their lives. Speaking of shallow cool and that particular gunfight... It looks cool when a man opens his overcoat to reveal a vest with 6 holsters, each containing a badass looking handgun in slow-motion. So while he's constantly running out of bullets and, lightning-quick, whipping out a new gun, the twins have their divine guns that never need to be reloaded. That's one of the main problems with this movie, it can't decide if it's going to be one of those "reload during a gunfight" flicks or a "just keep shooting and never run out of bullets" flicks. Just when you think the movie's going to laugh at itself ("THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!!!!!!!), it actually shows you that it doesn't get its own joke.As far as the murky morality goes, it wants to come across as leaving the judgement as to whether the twins are right or wrong to the viewer. But the camera and the script love these Irish rogues a little too much. Lingering on their nakedness, their wicked grins, and their righteousness a little too long.Willem Dafoe is a great actor and he does his best with the unfortunate script. But behind every great actor is a great director and Dafoe's performance makes me think Duffy was never there to reign in Dafoe's fantastic imagination and energy.Finally, I can understand the need for Rocco's character; the twins need a spaz around so they look even cooler by comparison. But did the actor have to suck SO MUCH?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vastly Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is the epitome of an over-hyped movie that people will themselves into believing to be better than it actually is. And, on first glance, it does look like a decent movie. But when you look closer, it becomes extremely apparent that it's all flash and no substance. Duffy masks the contrived plot and silly, inexplicable motives for characters with violence. Characters become superheroes on a whim, no one is developed to the point where emotional development has zero impact. Instead, the film plays up the emotional moments as over-the-top as possible to cram that emotional value into your head.There are very admirable performances in the film by Billy Connolly and Willam Dafoe, but the problem here is in the direction and the writing. Some of the most absurd moments come from the direction of the actors. For instance, the scene in which Willam Dafoe attempts to reenact the shootout between the Saints and the Duke doesn't pack the emotional punch that Duffy intends, it only comes off as silly and cliché. The best you can hope for in this film are some brief funny moments and a lot of nonsense that you'll have to wade through that it's really just not worth it.Ultimately, the film can be summed up with a quote from the movie itself, "Movies. You see this in bad movies." Even if Miramax had picked the film up and set the budget at $15 million like the original plan, it still would have fallen to pieces due to Duffy's incompetence as a director.As a big, stupid action movie, it's mediocre. As the movie that was supposed to save the industry, it's weak even by dumb action film standards. There are plenty of better movies, so why rally around this one?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark Comedy Done Right!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This intelligent, crafty, dark comedy is a breath of fresh air. Though not completely original, this movie really works. The story centers around 2 Irish brothers (fraternal twins), who wake up while spending the night in a prison cell, and are "chosen" to take out God's vengeance on bad guys.What develops is an excellent dark comedy/drama that explodes from the first frame till the last. Quick, fast paced camera work and excellent photography helps to move the story along. The action is non-stop and the dialogue, though very "offensive" (alot of the "f" word), is right on target for the setting and mood of the movie.The showdown at the end is a little less intense then the rest of the movie, but still, nonetheless, works!The relationship between the two brothers is right on. Flannery and Remmus really do act like 2 brothers (the fighting in the air shaft, hilarious).One of the main highlights of the movie is the performance given by Willem Dafoe. Diverse, witty, and totally hilarious. He delivers and excellent performance as the FBI agent. He is intelligent, comical, gay, and doesn't want to admit it right off the top, but agrees with what the brothers are doing. He had me laughing throuh the film...and seeing him in Drag...Oh, you just gotta see this movie.Though some plot points weren't totally developed, (what happened to "F**k Ass?), this movie is still an excellent example of a lower budget movie that really kicks ass, and offers a fast paced, action packed joy ride.Check this movie out...It is well worth the time. I would like to get the DVD, and watch all the extra's that are on it. I would also like to get my hands on an uncut version.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially interesting movie marred by absurd plot and bad acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers I saw this movie on glowing reccommendations from many friends and was sadly disappointed. Where to start? Rocco's acting. I read somewhere that he was a friend of the producer or something and not an actor. It shows. This guy couldn't cut it in community theather. Particularly awful is the scene where he runs into the apartment and starts yelling at the two women on the couch and holds the gun to his head.Also we are asked to suspend about 1,000,000 pounds of disbelief on the spiderweb of this movie. My personal favorite, after the toilet bowl bombing in the beginning and one of the brother's four story dive and safe landing on a mobster, is when Il Duce and the twins waltz into the trial. At the trial of a big Mob Boss, three grim guys in black, with duffle bags full of guns can simply toss their bags over the metal detector, proceed to murder a witness, and escape. AFter giving a five minute sermon, in a courtroom, in a major US city, in broad daylight. I could have gotten into the action, which was (stupidly)fun, if I wasn't asked to go with the ridicoulus set ups.Another big one to swallow is DaFoe's cop going against every single thing he was trained as a cop not to do to save the boys at the mansion. Showcasing this movie's lack of gray matter, that any character would believe DaFoe in drag as an actual woman...Stupid, Stupid, Stupid.This movie is amateurish. It lacks logic, plausibility and a brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less than 'Saint'-ly...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing more frustrating than somebody who doesn't get the joke. The punchline rolls by and he's left sitting there?gazing awkwardly into space struggling to figure it all out. Troy Duffy's first feature film, "The Boondock Saints," rests in that type of eternal limbo. At first glance, it seems to bounce back and forth from payoff to payoff, giving the audience a good deal to chuckle about. But, as the film keeps rolling, we begin to get the feeling that "The Boondock Saints" is becoming choked-up by its own gag. Half-way through, the uncomfortable silence of an unrealized ruse seeps into the room. And, sadly it becomes apparent that the filmmakers don't quite get their own joke."The Boondock Saints" is a simplistically rendered adult-male fairytale. Whereas children relish in tales of knights and princesses, Duffy makes his Camelot a kingdom adorned with stylized hit-man and generic mafiosos. Two Irish Brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) attempt to save the world from the evil and the corrupt by becoming (what else?) the embodiment of a Tarantino fanboy's fantasy. Adorned with dark sunglasses and nifty accents, the MacManus twins strut around the streets of Boston, muttering pleasing Catholic prayers in a futile attempt to somehow try to veil their inherent vacancy. Amidst all the good natured killing is a gay cop, played by Willem Dafoe with bombastic comedic zest, who is attempting to stop these vigilantes with hearts of gold. Dafoe's character?easily the most charismatic of the bunch?is a walking, talking caricature. He smiles and slaps around his compatriots, all the while flicking his bouffant into the air like a swimsuit model leaving the ocean.This is all not to say that "The Boondock Saints" is a complete failure. Sure, it's over-the-top, but at least there are plenty of gun shootouts and interesting carnage to keep the ball rolling. The slightly non-linear story is managed well. As Dafoe handles one crime scene, we get to see the whole shindig played out in real-time. It's a slow-motion gunfighter's dream! Bodies fall and bullets soar as Dafoe reenacts the entire massacre with emphatic precision.The true problem with the film is that it is so engrossed in its own mythos, that it actually takes itself seriously. This becomes apparent as haunting cathedral choir musical adorns the madness with Gothic foreboding. All the while, we're shaking our head wondering why Duffy isn't capable of accepting the ridiculousness of his own creation. Heck, even porn star Ron Jeremy enters the fray, but the movie doesn't pause to giggle?instead it continuously plugs along with repetitive and ruthless abandon. It seems that Duffy actually believes that not only is what the MacManus brothers doing right?but that it is actually possible. In that sense, "The Boondock Saints" is like the elephant in the room?the dinner party guess who fails to get the big joke. And, not surprisingly, the audience isn't laughing.</fullReview>

Now it is easy to understand if you kill innocent people, that is wrong, but what about going to a strip club? Is that evil too? I don't want to be judged by two brothers cracked out on a power hungry drunken binge. How does this make sense for all of the fans?

		<shortDescription>A few good elements - otherwise rubbish! 1/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The good elements consists of Dafoe's wonderful acting, and some nice filmic tricks, especially the mixing of past and present. However, this is totally offset by a series of badly thought out ideas. First of all, this film states that it is correct to kill the bad guys, as long as it is done in the name of God -'turn-the-other-cheek' and 'love-your-enemy' appear to have been forgotten for this advertisement for vigilantes and the NRA. And moreover it states that it is legal to define precisely what is bad - e.g. the scene in the sex shop where two irrelevant people are shot for no apparent reason. Watching nude women behind a window (safe sex if anything?!) suddenly becomes bad also. Secondly it states that the more violent you get, the better. Especially because the film states that even the law enforcers prefers to use the old-fashioned western-style lynching methods to the judicial systems of the democratic nation of the USA. Finally, this film tries to walk the path of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels'. It fails miserably. While 'Pulp' and 'Lock' both are quite violent, the Boondock Saint has absolutely none of the charms of its predecessors. And it lacks the stringent plot-line and brilliant manuscripts of the other two and loses its story in a pool of blood and gore. Thus it becomes boring. Too bad - it is rubbish, and deserves my first 1/10 at IMDb.</fullReview>

Granted, the influences are good (the aforementioned Guy Ritchie and Scorsese), but too obvious, and the film brings nothing new to the table. It only comes to show that when you're dealing with a time-honored genre like this, you better be able to hold your own. And the makers of this film don't. While the first 45 minutes still seem to deserve the benefit of the doubt, and there are some nice things about the film (Willem Dafoe's flamboyant character, specially), it is clear after the confessional booth scene that the plot is going nowhere.

		<shortDescription>Religious extremists go on rampage..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a general review or synopsis of the film, please see other reviews. This review is to add some important points that I have not seen written or very well articulated.In many ways the film is poorly done, the lines are cheesy, the plot is repetitive, but I can take all that for something great behind it all.. but this is about as bad as a movie can get since, in addition, it's foundation is senseless in the worst way.What way? Well, it glorifies religious extremism, and I want to expand on that beyond it's brief mention by other reviewers. This premise of religious extremism COULD be good if it were properly treated, but it wasn't treated at all. In fact, this movie is straight up dishonest because it made no attempt to be CRITICAL or take the premise anywhere at all. Yet there are so many subjects opened up in this film: notions of judgment, and Judgement, punishment, good vs. evil (and whether such a distinction should be made in the first place), religion, fundamentalism, etc etc etc... SO much material here.. yet it doesn't deal with ANY of it! Seriously, are they kidding? In fact, if any of the themes of the premise were investigated thoroughly, it might have even been.. good.What ideals are being sold here? What are young minds (like mine was the first time I saw it) going to take away from it? Well, obviously, it glorifies violent extremism. Perhaps those who like the movie like it because it's their side, the "right" side, that is glorified. That this makes it OK? That makes you not question it? What IS it? For those of you who love this film, ask yourself how you feel about Jihadists, or other extremists. I'll bet if this film was done EXACTLY the same, but with two Muslim men trying to get rid of the evils of capitalism by killing CEOs, or whatever, you'd be in a rage. You'd spend the whole movie wishing they were caught and then slowly murdered in full cinematic detail.I'm not religious, I'm don't think that swearing or other trivial things are "bad", and normally stuff like this doesn't bother me. But seriously, if this film DOESN'T bother you, you might want to think about the glaring contradiction you might be living, and how truly scary your beliefs are. This film could just as easily have been financed by some ultra fundamentalist wing of the catholic church. Actually, it would make a lot more sense if it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First and foremost this film is morally repugnant, especially for it's interpretation of what is religiously moral and it's fake "street interviews" at the end. A calculated but ham fisted way to pretend that this film speaks for common folk.But getting beneath that, this film is a train wreck.Terrible cartoonish characterizations. Overblown acting. Gaping plot holes. Troy Duffy desperately wants to be Quentin Tarantino, but he is frankly not clever enough. The film looks alright, and the editing is almost as good as you would expect from a first film, but largely it's a gimmick film and a derivative one at that.Duffy clearly has an agenda (and a pretty crappy worldview.) I think he would be well served to learn more about the world before he creates propaganda on how to fix it.Lord help us that he is making a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two Irish brothers accidentally killed mafia thugs. They turned themselves in and were released as heroes. They then see it as a calling by God and started knocking off mafia gang members one by one. Willem Dafoe plays the detective trying to figure out the killings, but the closer he was to catching the Irish brothers, the more he thinks the brothers are doing the right thing. Surprised?This movie is genuinely horrible. It's directed like a cartoon and I am convinced the only reason it's gotten some good reviews is because Dafoe plays a gay cop and some people like to push the agenda. If you review the film on it's merits, it's silly and poorly acted and horribly directed. The entire film is like one big joke without the punch line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boondock Saints has the dubious distinction of being a film that virtually every adolescent male with a bloodlust fantasy falls in love with while at the same time being a really terrible piece of moviemaking. It's a sad bastardization of the films of Sam Peckinpah, Sergio Leone and of course, Quentin Tarantino. The plot is beyond ridiculous, concerning two bad actors with bad accents who spend most of the movie executing mobsters and reciting pseudo Irish prayer crap and being followed by a gayfornoapparentreason detective who decides that maybe they aren't so bad after all. Willem Dafoe (an on and off actor to begin with) seems to have stolen his performance from Gary Oldman in The Professional. If you liked this movie, please go rent Straw Dogs or A Fistful of Dollars or Hard Eight or any other gangster/vengeance film that doesn't suck and then get a life. Beware of any film in which a character delivers a line like `for a few minutes this place was Armageddon' with a straight face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is easy to see why this screenplay created a buzz in Hollywood. Movies today are all about other movies. Tarantino references nothing but. He isn't the inventor of this, but he did bring it to a new level of self-aware irony.So its something when a script comes along from a fellow who knows nothing about other films. This is more a sketch for a clever book. But then he applies the same veneer as Ritchie and Tarrantino and the 'Go' guy. It is a reverse irony, a selfconscious goof on their own selfconsciousness. To make it obvious, he has our hapless murderers deliberately act like they were in a movie, often arguing about it 'Bronson always takes a rope.'He directs, and the results aren't pretty. He muffs all the effects he is quoting, but that is so entirely apt, so entirely what he is all about (without knowing it) it works.The key role here is played by Dafoe, who knows something about reverse self-reference. He played a key role in one of the earliest reverse self-referential projects 'eXistenZ,' and more recently in the very best, the gold standard: 'Shadow of the Vampire' a film about a film about filming vampires where the top level has the vampire as real. He knows what to do and since the director is weak, he does what he wants.His character is the cross between the detective who is trying to discover the story and the avatar for the director who is writing the story. There's a rather nice scene where he is anachronistically in the action, narrating it -- and getting it wrong.I'll take one of these over twelve McMullen brothers any day.Ted's evaluation: 2 of 4 -- has some interesting elements</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many people, I had never heard of this movie until recently and was shocked that such "a well regarded movie" had slipped past me. I immediately went to the store but unfortunately found this movie already checked out. Furthermore, the clerk instructed me there was a waiting list and my name was buried at the bottom of a very long line. I had to smile to myself and proceeded across town desperately looking for another copy.I should have stopped looking then.Let's get the obvious right out of the way. Don't worry about spoiler warnings. You've seen it all before. Boondocks Saints is a cut-and-paste version of better movies and blatantly lifts dialog from another films. (ie "No women. No kids.") Mentioning these directors or comparing this movie to others would be a disgrace. You want to compare this film to something? Feed a baby some Ex-lax and watch what comes out. It'll be the Boondock Saints.Director Patrick Duffy also squandered a great opportunity to explore a somewhat complicated premise. In today's society, is murder ever justified? By Hollywood standards, this would constitute a real head-scratcher, but instead you get the some old cliché explanations and the movies marches forward looking for another opportunity to drop the F-bomb. I still don't know why the two protagonists even did what they set out to do.However, Boondock Saints does sets itself apart the other films it's desperately trying to emulate. At least twice toward the end of the film, the screenwriter implores the viewer to emulate the main characters and makes an argument for killing ACCUSED criminals. Not convicted criminals or prisoners mind you but perceived criminals. Twice the movies says: "we should have two of you in every town" and twice mentions recruiting others to their cause.You want to make dumb mindless action movie that depicts the killing drug dealers, rapists and contract killer, be my guest. Go right ahead. Make a dozen of them and I'll wish you luck every step of the way. Just don't insinuate that the audience should pick up a gun when they leave the theater.After watching this movie, I learned that Boondock Saints was blackballed from theaters in 1999 for unknown reasons and the movie only opened on 5 screens. Hollywood hasn't done many things right over the years but shelving this cinematic mistake was step in the right direction.Thinking of renting Boondock Saints? Heaven help us all.</fullReview>

The rooftop jumping, toilet dropping scene is proof enough for this.If the goal of these two Catholic boys was to destroy those who were considered "bad" in the eyes of God, why did they not kill Willem Dafoe's character, seeing as homosexuality isn't accepted in the eyes of God, especially by the Catholic church?I'm wondering why Willem Dafoe even entertained this script. Maybe he bought too much junk on eBay and needed some cash. Maybe he just wanted to wear that pretty dress some place.

Directed and written by a sped who knows less than nothing about directing and writing, the cinematography is dull and ugly, acting is some of the most awful I have ever seen (and yes, I did see Cyber Tracker 2), etc. Not to mention that this movie is not funny at all, not even by accident.Well, now that I think of it, there might be one good thing to come out of this vomit-inducing bore-fest. If you somehow manage to make it completely through this crap from start to finish, then you have seen the worst movie ever made. You can now watch Michael Bay movies with a big smile on your face, thinking "hell, this ain't so bad!" But me, I'd rather try sneezing with my eyes open than have to suffer this kind of agony again.The only reason why I somehow managed to do the impossible and watch this from start to finish is because I was in a state of physical shock after seeing how incredibly awful it was. No word of lie...I watched this for the first (and only) time with 4 friends who all claimed that it was great. They all fell asleep within the first 30 minutes...and we watched it in the day time.That being said, this is nothing more than the cinematic equivalent of having a 400 pound man with chronic diarrhea squat over your open mouth for a full two hours. If you are ever so incredibly bored one day and decide to watch this, take my word for it...do anything else at all. Go down to Taco Bell and sift through the dumpster outside for the food they throw away...and eat all of it. It will be a lot more healthy, satisfying, and a lot less likely to cause gastrointestinal cramps...and chronic diarrhea.Troy Duffy should quit film-making and find something that he's actually good at.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints, a power trip macho-vigilante flick from 1999 has become a bit of a cult item within a very specific crowd. Why? Who knows, cult movies are not always good movies by default. Boondock is by far one of the most worthless movie that could had ever get any kind of following whatsoever. Let's skip right away the vigilante agenda going on, which goes without saying that is silly and one dimensional beyond belief. Let's even skip all the poorly made attempts of "black humour", which for Troy Duffy just consists of having the "heroes" molesting corpses of females, saying the f word a million times and using a toilet as a weapon in the most improbable way you could think of.No no no, forget all that, what it boils down to it's this: Boondock Saints is not a fun movie to watch, at all. Duffy thinks he's John Woo in his prime, and decided to shot every single shooting sequence in this mess in SLOOOOOOOOW MOTION, making it a complete bore to watch the same gimmick over and over. There's never any tension whatsoever in any of the confrontations, the "heroes" just blast everything and everyone without any effort. Then there's the second gimmick, Dafoe's character pretty much just telling you what happen in each scene, and then show us a flashback of said scenes, with even moooooore sloooow motion. It's like if the movie was repeating itself to just cover the fact that the plot is invisible, an insult to your intelligence, that the action is sub-par and that the whole movie has no reason to exist other than bore you to death with it's absurd fetish of violence and it's "unique" sense of humour.There's just so much stuff to point out, i'll just throw one more example right away: there's a scene where our two "heroes" and a third character are shooting each other within a very small range of distance. They never hit each other, at all, really. This is some Godfrey Ho level of silliness going on, and even Godfrey's movies can be enjoyable out of their sheer will to ham it up. BS on the other hand takes all this stuff so dead serious, this is no parody, no spoof whatsoever of the dumb clichés of the action genre. The movie is 100% sure that it has created a "cool" action piece, and that it's pro-vigilante/religious fanaticism message is something to be taken seriously.There's nothing to like here, not even in an "ironic" way. The humour is Family Guy level of comedy, the plot just a mess, and the direction the disaster i just described. It's a movie that will remain buried in the sewers of bad cinema, and for the better.</fullReview>

The dialogue is without any merit or reason. It's simply lots of swear words in an attempt to seem gritty and tough when in truth its clearly just someone with out any talent or voice as a writer using f**k coz he hasn't got anything else to say. It really did feel like a film written by a particularly untalented 12 year old boy that gets bullied at school every day. There is nothing of merit or even sense to this. This man has no talent!! And as a director... Jesus! His cast is so lost to the point where even the likes of experienced Willem Dafoe is just wondering around, jumping on tables and pulling strained faces just in an attempt to give the non character..... something, anything. But even he can't do anything but look really uncomfortable and out of place. Troy Duffy isn't Tarantino. Killing people on screen and smoking cigarettes doesn't make you a good writer. And he isn't even in the same league as Guy Ritchie, who he obviously tried to steel from just before he began photography. Guy Ritchie has a consistency to his films and isn't confused about weather it is a cartoon gangster tale, or a down and dirty gritty morality tale. Even Over Board was better than this utter bilge, in fact The Boondock Saint makes Over Board look like Dr Strangelove. There is absolutely nothing about this film to redeem it. Its not even enjoyably bad. It's beyond painful and at just over one and a half hours it feels like one of the longest films you'll ever force your self to sit through. If you are thinking of spending any hard earned cash to see this, or even not so hard earned... or even, for that matter, if some one is offering to pay you to watch it, don't. The only way I could possibly suggest that you do is if you were one of the few that actually like the Ronny Wo turd The Fifty First State. If, indeed, that person even exists!

		<fullReview>Like Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho," "Pulp Fiction" is a great film. This movie is to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs what "Slumber Party Massacre 2" is to Psycho. It is a sad attempt to remake the whole "cool and tough criminals kill bad guys in a really cool and tough fashion while saying cool and tough one-liners" genre. Unfortunately, it lacks all originality and the script is far from clever. Every character is one-dimensional; the so-called organized criminals are just a bunch of morons who get slaughtered in their hundreds by two meat packers from Southie. Meanwhile, entire scenes are lifted from Pulp Fiction: the cat accidentally being killed (paralleling Marvin's unfortunate fate in Pulp Fiction), the bible quotes before executions, and the constant oh-so-cleverly random conversations that don't come close to stuff Tarantino probably wrote in Grade school. By the way, the acting sucks. Finally, the message that it's good for vigilantes to kill the brainless ethnic stereotypes that pass for mafiosi in this movie (as well as random guys at a strip club; I guess they're criminal scum as well) whenever they feel like it will appeal to armchair suburbanites scared of those big city lowlifes whom they've heard about on the news--it will seem ludicrous to anyone else. Skip this and throw on "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver"... or practically anything else you can think of.</fullReview>

Is it just me or was that embarrassingly stupid? Especially when he dances/prances around. I think that they made him gay simply to use the one joke about cuddling being for fags. And yes, any street urchin can speak five languages, because that's what their mother wanted.And then add the Hannibal Lecterian über-evil villain, fresh out of prison and looking for violent fun. Thousands of bullets fired without a drop of tension. That's hard to do yet most directors are up to the task and this one came through brilliantly.

		<fullReview>As is obvious from the reviews here, this movie is polarizing - you'll either love it or hate it. I certainly recommend giving it a try, and seeing for yourself what camp you fall into. At worst, you waste an hour and a half. You can even watch it for free on YouTube, so you don't have to waste your money. My main warning is that the R rating is certainly earned, by both language and violence. Some of the pluses? The characters. The relationship of the brothers - they are rowdy and boyish and great partners. While they can be serious, they can be lighthearted a moment later. And very fun accents to listen to! Willem Dafoe's character - completely over the top, but great to watch. I like him better here than I do as the Green Goblin. Others find Rocco very amusing, though I'm not personally such a fan. Doc, the older bartender with Teretz, is more amusing to me. The fantasy. Wouldn't it be nice if someone could just take care of all the scumbags out there? The vigilante theme hits a chord. While I don't know of anyone who would take this seriously (ie, go out and start shooting people), there's enough to it to find appealing in the context of the movie. The storytelling. I really enjoy the out-of-sequence scenes as a way to keep the parallel stories of the law enforcement and the brothers interwoven. Smecker becomes more and more involved over the course of the film, and this device makes that happen. The soundtrack. Some great music! The drawbacks?Don't expect well-sketched villains. These are caricatures of the mob. I liked Papa Joe most of the time, but still. Language. I'm sorry, but when you have to use the F-word 250 times, that's overdone. There were times it was amusing or relevant, but not in every f'in line. See? Completely unnecessary. It loses its effect when you don't save it for its intensity. Morality. The attempt to justify the film's actions are not terribly...convincing. At least Smecker was supposed to be drunk/hungover while delivering those lines! The brothers convince their best friend to switch from 'you're crazy!' to 'you should recruit!' in a matter of minutes, suggesting that everyone's convictions are rather shallow. After all, they're not exactly saints themselves...just not mobsters. I think a lot of people are uneasy that the movie doesn't try harder to condemn vigilantism. This is *not* The Oxbow Incident!I love the movie, at the end of the day. I'm a 30 year old woman who doesn't curse or have tattoos. Just sayin'.

There just happens to be two brothers in particular, who seek out the evil of Boston and hunt them down at all costs. I thought this was a great idea. So did Troy Duffy, Troy is the director, writer and creator of the Saints. Troy apparently wrote the script at this bar he had been working for at the time. Some director came to the bar one particular night and helped Troy begin the Saint movies.I personally think this film deserved more credit then it was handed. The movie did not receive a nomination for any award whatsoever, witch I think is ludicrous, that movie deserved at least some recognition. I thought Sean Patrick Flannery did an excellent job as well as Norman Reedus as the MacManus brothers. Anyways I highly recommend watching this movie, it is simply awesome. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why such opposition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie for the first time and while it was not anything spectacular i found it to be entertaining. Yes almost all the action scenes were completely outrageous and unrealistic but that is hardly something to be appalled at. How many times did you say "Oh Come on!" when watching John McClain kill bad guy after bad guy non stop with one gun and limited ammo, or Rambo slaying entire armies single handed, and how about Dutch being the only one of many to kill the predator with makeshift weapons while covered in mud. What pure action film isn't ridiculous and unbelievable. What surprises me is the hate offered by people who disliked the movie. Take the people who write the good reviews. They say what they thought of the movie and for the most part leave it at that. But the people who write the bad reviews not only trash the movie but deem anyone who liked it childish or just plain idiots. Personally i find it childish and idiotic that these are things such people are so bothered with. Look, its by no means a great movie. But if you want to see some Irish boys defy all odds and kill endless hoards of gangsters while saying the lords prayer, then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could quite possibly go on to write an essay on why this film is so intensely great. I'm surprised Troy Duffy hasn't sat in the director's chair again, although I am very anxious to purchase the sequel, which he did direct. Where to start, well obviously this film's amazing cast. One of my favorite actors ever, Willem Dafoe steps up and delivers a spectacular performance for a very original and genuinely well written character. Sure you could despise the film with all your heart for the fact that Dafoe is playing a homosexual, but that'd make you two things: (1) a very close-minded conservative and (2) a person who has no desire for originality and genuine character design in films. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus have a natural chemistry that made it seem they were actually brothers. and were just plain bad ass through out. Billy Connolly is awesome in it as well. He has a majestic and menacing presence through out as Il Duce. And David Della Rocco was just great, playing 'himself' as Duffy would have it. He was just another well played and interesting character, one to truly remember in film history.Aside all the great characters, the movie has a very involving storyline and atmosphere. It's a very graphic, violent and intense one, yet along with it all is some very well placed dark humor. It all just feels so natural you'll be laughing constantly and embracing these characters. By the end of the film, I guarantee you'll be tempted to quote them. And to top it all off, the premise in itself is a statement. The message being that perhaps the reason the world is so corrupt and defiled today is because of the flawed justice system. Whether you view it as a well-themed masterpiece or a simple-minded action film is up to you, regardless the mark the film leaves behind is unmistakable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good structure and simple concept to deliver genre standards but otherwise melodramatic, unimaginative and a bit daft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Irish-American brothers Connor and Murphy get into a bar fight with a couple of Russian gangsters, which ends in them killing them. The gang nature of the killing brings FBI expert Paul Smecker into Boston but before he can even get going, the brothers give themselves up and are found innocent. The ease of the crime and the general local opinion that they did a "good thing" only encourages them to carry on and, with masks and heavy weaponry, set out to take down those that the law cannot touch ? but Smecker and the authorities are only a few steps behind them and the criminals themselves have weapons to strike back.A few years ago I saw the documentary Overnight which charts the implosion of the writer/director of this film and shows how fame reveals just what one is like ? in this case, arrogant and obnoxious. Anyway, aside from what a c0ck Duffy is, the film reminded me that I hadn't seen the cult film Boondock Saints for quite a few years and wondering if it were anything other than the "OK" film that I remember. Well it took a few years for it to be repeated on television but eventually I got round to seeing it. The truth is just what I remember it to be ? an OK film but nothing more than that and certainly nothing to justify what Duffy thinks of himself. The best thing about the film is the structure, which sees us following Dafoe in regards seeing the aftermath of the action sequences before we see the action itself ? this I liked and thought it added some interest to the delivery that the very simple plot didn't.Other than this though the story is quite straightforward and offers nothing particularly good in the way of dialogue or content. The greenlight obviously came thanks to Tarantino's success because this story of criminals is clearly indebted to him; however the dialogue is nothing comparable by any means and instead is either lazy rubbish or heavy religious material. The action is the second appeal and it is delivered with the usual style that one would expect from a director who has learnt his "trade" from watching other films. Slow-motion, jumping while shooting etc etc, it is all here and it is all good enough if you are in the mood but certainly nothing special. Disappointingly (but unsurprisingly) the film doesn't have anything challenging or insightful about the vigilantism it depicts. The closing credits are the closest it ever gets and that is too little, otherwise it does nothing to challenge the viewer or even to promote a political view ? it just uses it to produce a generic action film.Of the cast, all credit must surely go to Dafoe for the wonderful way he hams it up. The transvestite bit is a jump too far and is just silly but otherwise his overblown FBI agent is just the bit of fun that the film needs. Conversely both Flanery and Reedus are both surprisingly flat in the title roles, doing simple Irish-American roles but not bringing much to it. Rocco is OK in his character ? at least being lively, while Rota is a strange find for 24 fans. Connolly is there for the money and his character is superficial at best and a cameo from pornstar Ron Jeremy is just a pointless and obvious bit of casting.The Boondock Saints is a cult film but it is far from a good one. At its base it is a simple genre film that offers nothing special to make itself stand out. Disappointingly it has so-so dialogue and nothing to challenge or engage the viewer in the content and really, outside of doing everything that other similar films do, it only has a wonderfully daft turn from Dafoe to make it stick in the memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageously Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd say over half of the people I know say this is their absolute favorite movie. However, every one of those people I know who say it's their favorite movie aren't big movie-watchers. They like movies for mindless action, or stupid comedy, or cheap scares. I've noticed most reviewers who dislike this film have problems with the morality of this movie. I think movies are movies, and immorality is a part of life, so I think it should be shown in movies. However, this movie has a huge list of other problems that make it virtually unwatchable to the knowledgeable movie-watcher.Now, there's nothing wrong with just watching movies for mindless action and such, because if it entertains you, then it serves its purpose. But as someone who appreciates the artistic aspects of movies, I have to review it in that manner. This movie has horrendously cartoonish acting by basically all of the people with smaller roles. It is riddled with generic, stereotypical portrayals. Now, if this movie didn't take itself so seriously, that would be perfectly fine. Unfortunately, this is a low-budget movie trying to be an epic Hollywood masterpiece, and it really shows. In taking itself so seriously, it falls desperately short of what it's trying to accomplish. The plot is just a formality in this movie. You can tell it only has a plot because it has to. They seem rather disinterested in the scenes involving character development.I felt sad for Willem Dafoe. He's a great actor, but here he is in this role he doesn't seem to fit at all. He gives the best performance of anyone in the movie, but even he fails to be believable. I wasn't sure what he was doing in this mess the entire time I was watching it. The two lead actors, Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus, serve their purpose well enough. You can tell their goal was to just not mess up, they weren't really interested in delivering powerful performances. They manage to not be laughably bad, but are far from good. However, by the end of the film, how can you care about the characters? The movie expects you to be on the side of these terribly boring, uncharismatic characters. You can't have an emotional finish without any form of emotional scenes in the earlier stages.Finally, notice how this movie is the director's only one. He's no ace director, and the comparisons to Tarantino are disgusting. Even if you like this movie, how can you think it's made in any way like a Tarantino film? The backbone of Tarantino's films and what makes them so great is the consistent brilliant dialogue. Not only does The Boondock Saints not have any brilliant dialogue, it isn't even trying to be big on dialogue to begin with. To compare Duffy to Tarantino isn't even fair, considering Tarantino has consistently made incredibly brilliant films, and Duffy has just made one cult hit that in my opinion is extraordinarily poor. This movie is certainly for those who just watch movies for entertainment. If you are looking for depth, stay far away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetic attempt to rip off John Woo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will try to be as concise in my review as possible. This movie is bad. And not in a 'so bad it's funny' sort of way, it is just plain bad in the same way that Swordfish sucked. An absolute waste of time action movie with pious pretenses of being a thought provoking play of morality. This is the kind of trash that frat guys must think of as cutting edge cinema.In a nutshell, the film is about two violent Irish brothers that decide to kill people that they perceive as being 'evil'. Right. Because acting as a bloodthirsty vigilante and undermining the justice system just because it doesn't meet your undefined standards of efficiency gives you the moral high ground. Sure. It almost saddens me that so many people on this site think that these two savages are somehow hip or cool when in reality they are just thugs.The dialogue is lame. The acting is less than first rate, with the notable exception of the always fine Willem Dafoe. The action scenes are probably the only real thing this film has going for it, but even they are rather cliché'd shoot outs in a style so reminiscent of Woo that you almost want to turn off the DVD in the middle of the film and watch some Hong Kong cinema. The one saving grace of the film is the realistic depiction of Bostonian Irish as uneducated lowlifes with a propensity towards violence. Unflattering but dead on. Unfortunately, the only distinction between the protagonists and antagonists of the film is that some delude themselves into thinking theirs is the "good" violence.If you want to see an ultra violent film that actually has some substance to it, check out basically anything by John Woo, but especially The Killer or A Better Tomorrow II, both of which have style and substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incoherent attempt at raising some moral questions at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not immediately apparent what goal Troy Duffy had in mind when he wrote The Boondock Saints.In this film, we follow two Irish brothers on a mission from God to rid Earth of all evil, but the film is vague regarding the questionable righteousness of their deeds. Instead, it shows the brothers as they see themselves, as martyrs suffering torture and self-mutilation rivalling the scourging of Christ (or at least, that seems to be the idea) in their quest for holy righteousness.They also receive approval from the FBI agent assigned to their case, but in the end, it's left very much up to the viewers to decide whether the brothers are doing a good thing or not.One could suspect that that was the point of the film, but while I see no problem in a film raising such questions, The Boondock Saints hardly does that very well, with its imbecile jokes, and lack of plot and believable characters.Could it then be that Troy Duffy is merely expressing his beliefs, and genuinely wants us to sympathize with these two holier-than-you brothers and their vigilant justice? If so, it's not working at all - for me, anyway.In the end, one reach the sad conclusion that this is likely just another violent action film trying to attain depth, but failing miserably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If not for a few interestingly conceived and staged action sequences, I would have walked out of the theater before intermission (that's why there are no more intermissions in movies: too many people would just leave most films). Fortunately, and for good reason, "Saints" went straight to video and I got to watch it from the comfort of my easy chair. I watched it because others said it was good. I can almost see why others liked it but this just wasn't my bag.Boondock Saints is about ridding society of its problems through violence, violence justified by a criminal justice system that has failed us. There's a lot that first-time director Duffy gets right. He certainly communicates what he perceives as the collective ideology and does it with considerable visual style.Though it may never happen in today's Hollywood, this might have been good as a silent film. The best reason? The script is aweful! Every character (except Willem Dafoe's character) is a cardboard cutout. I didn't know Conner and Murphy MacManus (the title characters, played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus respectively) any better than I did after I saw the film than before.Fraternal twins who are all the family each other has, end up killing two members of the Russian mafia and in doing so become heroes of the Boston Police. Instead of waiting for the mafia to hunt them down, the twins become vigilantes and begin systematically executing criminals that, for whatever reason, the police can't bring in. I think what Mr. Duffy has done with Conner and Murphy is intentionally treat them as one character. Neither, other than having a different face, is distinguishable from the other (being a fraternal twin myself, I find this interesting at best). You'd think that between the two of them, they might be able to come up with enough personality to fill one whole person. Doesn't happen. Despite this, we're expected to find these two intriguing simply because the odds are against them.Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this film. Willem Dafoe's gay FBI agent is a leap above anything we've seen and Dafoe gives it his all. If this movie could be saved, this would be the character to do it. The character, Paul Smecker, takes over the investigation of the dead, broken bodies of two Russian mobsters found in an alley. Before the mobsters' bodies are cold, however, more criminals start ending up dead. As the investigation progresses, Smecker becomes more and more enraptured by the executioners' style. From the moment we meet this guy, he's re-enacting each crime moment by moment. One thing I will say for Duffy--the guy's got potential as a director. The crime scenes are usually shown and THEN we're shown the executions themselves. We watch it unfold as Smecker breaks it down. There's one superb scene in which Smecker WALKS THROUGH THE SCENE with the Saints as they go about their work.The innovative directing, however, isn't enough to save this movie from its too-often stupid dialogue. I see that on this movie's main page, the user comment calls it "entertainment in the tradition of 'Pulp Fiction.'" It's violent, has characters who enjoy using the f-word (on an unprecedented scale), and it messes with time the way only the film medium can, so of course we have to compare it to Pulp Fiction. When anyone learns to think, visualize, and write the way Tarantino does, THEN we can make those kinds of comparisons. I expect that Duffy is continuing to write and improve his craft. He has the tools, but needed a second set of eyes much of the time here.Blockbuster's been promoting it heavily, making it seem like more than what it is: amateurish. It's like a student film that manages to look like a studio film at times. I fell for it, I admit it (had it not been for the fifty copies sitting on the shelf, I wouldn't have gone anywhere near it). Unfortunately, more people will see this movie than it deserves.Grade: D</fullReview>

Furthermore, you mean to tell me that the brothers didn't know that they were having a shootout against their own father?. This movie is mediocre at best.I understand it's just a movie and its art blah,blah,blah but come on now.

Get Troy Duffy out of the the film business please! There are very few good parts in this movie. One is in the beginning when they are in the chapel, two when the cat is shot, and three when Willem Defoe's character is in the confession booth. And I'd have to say all the other scenes are very poor and quite stupid. Especially the final scene of the movie when people are being interviewed.

		<shortDescription>further proof that any movie featuring Ron Jeremy is no good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I checked "The Boondock Saints" out from my friendly college library, I was told by an IFL teacher that the film was "very popular among male college students." I believe she excised the end of that phrase, which was probably: "...under the heavy influence of several pints." After hearing a lot of word-of-mouth recommendation (including a former drunken college roommate) for the past few years, I finally broke down and picked it up. Regardless of how good or bad "Boondock" wound up being, I would at least be able to say "I saw it." (Someday, I hope to have that etched on my tombstone.) And exactly how bad is "The Boondock Saints"? (Puts on Professional Party Pooper Hat) Pretty damn bad. Here we have a movie that tosses the stylings of Tarantino ("Reservoir Dogs"), Rodriguez ("El Mariachi"), Woo, Scorsese, Winner ("Death Wish"), Stone ("Natural Born Killers" in particular) and even Singer ("The Usual Suspects") into a blender, and the end result is uniformly awful all around.The Plot: Sean Patrick Flanery (proving there's no life after "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles") and Norman Reedus ("8mm") play devoutly religious Irish brothers living in Boston; when the Russian mafia begins to infiltrate their territory, they become relentless vigilantes, not only offing the Russians, but any generic scum who crosses their path. In an outrageously flamboyant performance, Willem Dafoe (who provides the film's only glimmers of humor) plays an deductive FBI agent who pieces together the crimes. The plot, however, is such a mess--perhaps deliberately so--that the film jumps from one clumsily-executed setpiece after another, pinning us to the wall with so much badly-edited 'action' that one questions whether the filmmakers were so naive to think we wouldn't take notice.As written and directed by novice auteur Troy Duffy, "The Boondock Saints" is pretentious, would-be crime thriller dreck that carries a pungent aftertaste of arrogance on the filmmaker's behalf. The film is ineptly edited, poorly acted (everyone kicks 'shrill' and 'shouting' up to the highest possible decibel), lazily satirical ("Death Wish" and "Natural Born Killers" did it first, and--mostly--better), and--for all the slow-motion action contained within--no fun to watch. Potential stabs at humor are lost in the sea of poor sound recording and even worse accents (sheesh, could it be any more obvious that Flanery and Reedus ARE NOT Irish?). The one 'joy' of "The Boondock Saints" is watching Willem Dafoe wig out grandly in a role he probably thought would never see the light of day, but even his presence doesn't elevate this above borderline-unwatchable 'entertainment.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's lucky for Troy Duffy that he managed to sabotage his own production and ensure that his film developed a reputation that preceded itself, if it had been released and judged on its merits alone then it's highly likely this film would have slithered off into obscurity mere weeks after its release.From the shoddy acting to the pretentious tacked on biblical aspect of the plot everything about this film displays a writer and director with far more ambition than talent. The script isn't funny in places where it's intended to be, but is absolutely hilarious when it's being serious. In terms of production Duffy tries to throw gritty gangster film in with stylish action movie but just ends up with scenes that don't flow together at all. The overused "fade to black" cuts between scenes don't help this problem in the slightest, in fact all they manage is to remind the viewer of an episode of Law &amp; Order. Even the subtitles on this film are badly designed.However none of this is the worse aspect of the film, that honour must go to the characterisation. The overblown New York cop and mafia persona's combined with stereotypically Irish drunks give the impression of NYPD blue crossed with an episode of Father Ted, the Irish bar owner in particular is a direct rip off of Father Jack. On top of this the Irish accents of the two main characters are awful. The attempts at adding quirkiness to most of the characters are cack-handed at best and simply makes them seem unbelievable and at times embarrassing to watch.The only possible saving grace for The Boondock Saints is the plot idea of not showing the various set pieces within the standard chronology of the narrative but only revealing them after the detectives have theorised on what happened. However, the makers obviously exhausted their creativity with this trick and the continuous repetition of what might have otherwise been an interesting plot device just kills it's novelty and leaves the middle of the film languishing with no real direction.If you do have the misfortune to see this film then I highly recommend watching the documentary of it's production (Overnight, 2003) afterwards, as the funniest thing about this atrocious piece of cinema is the utterly misplaced egotism of it's creator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like it. Here's why....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that you will either like because you pick out the good parts or hate because you simply can't get past the bad parts. I couldn't get past the bad parts. For starters, the film is very improbable as well as unrealistic with too many silly elements that do not at all mesh with the very serious and dramatic tone maintained throughout. Because the film doesn't contain the necessary parts of a satire it can't be argued that it was meant to be one. In the end, the movie ends up being 2 hours of outlandish violence and very irritating characters that received way too much screen time. I found myself wanting to fast forward any scene containing the minor character Rocco. And the 5 minute flaky detective scenes where he is singing to opera music and dressing in drag was just too senseless and foolish for me to stomach. I would have at least felt better about movie if, at the end, the Irish brothers recognized Rocco's annoying mannerisms and shot him for being so aggravating and stupid! The only `saving grace' about this movie, and the only reason I would ever consider re-watching this movie, is the `coolness' of the two brothers. The brothers interacted well together and were very entertaining to watch so long as they weren't in any scenes with any of the other characters. In conclusion. I found this movie to be annoying and very disappointing. It has a good premise, though not original. Nothing was special about the editing or special effects, or even the characters themselves. If you want a movie with good shootouts, and `cool' guys with real accents check out movies like Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. These movies are a lot of what this movie wishes it could at least be compared to. As for the director's debut: He needs a lot more practice and I'd like to know how he goes from an absolute nobody to getting such a movie budget to make such a horrid film. I guess some ideas sound better on paper.</fullReview>

The writing was atrocious, the music was painful to listen to, the acting seemed like it should have belonged to a 3rd grade skit. Never have I had such a horrid film experience as watching this ridiculous excuse of a film. The whole thing screamed junior high film festival. It reeked of elementary ideas. Hardly ten seconds went by without a visible mistake. The swearing was extremely annoying and unnecessary, as if Boston just learned what the F word was. The Boston accents were absolutely laughable. The only funny parts of the movie were when I could tell they were trying very hard to be serious, but failed miserably to pull off an actual decent film. This is the first time in my life a film actually made me angry because of how bad it was.My advice to you: watch this movie so you can rate it a 1 because it certainly does not deserve a 7.9 on IMDb.</fullReview>

It's a movie full of "characters" played by actors that are always trying too hard to camp it up. It's a Tarantino clone and, as such, you would expect it to have more style and maybe some good dialogue. But it has little of that. And I'm being generous by saying little instead of none. It just isn't funny and its vigilante message has been done before and better so it doesn't even have something new to say. The action is uninspired; just lots of shooting. Big whoop. I'm giving it a middle ground score but just barely. It's a pretty overrated movie, at least as far as IMDb is concerned. Nothing memorable about this, good or bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's a point to this movie, I fail to see it. When I read what it was about and when I read certain reviews I had the feeling this was a movie with substance. A movie that wants to explore the human urge of their own justice. Of being judge, jury and executioner. What I got was something else. No big deal right? Well, every person in the movie (except maybe the 2 leads) act like lunatics. They are all cartoonesk characters who say the F work all the time. I don't care about the F word but it didn't have substance so it got real tiring real fast. Annoying even. Maybe the erratic behavior of Willem Dafoe and consorts are meant to be funny. Well, I for one don't see what's funny about it. I only chuckled a bit at the end. And have to admit that the movie get's better in the end, the last 10-15 minutes are somewhat enjoyable. But that's about all the positive I can say about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had trouble understanding this movie,, for some reason a lot of it was just very hard to piece together, I will have to sit down and re-watch to see if I can get it better, Willem Dafoe plays an FBI agent on the trail of who is killing off all of the big time criminals in Boston,, A pair of fraternal brothers decide to rid the streets of Boston of all of the big time Hoodlums by whacking them one by one,, and in a very big fashion. there is lot'ts of guns . blood, and all other sorta of cool things,, but to me the reason why I didn't like it was that when a lot of the scenes were going on you had the FBI agent talking in the background,, like he was piecing the crime site together,, I could have done without that,, and all of his mimicking the shooters every move,, the movie for me drug on and on,, it's okay but not what I had hoped for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Important Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film proved that if mindless action films want to draw a cult following they should be even more mindless, because apparently films that cater to the low end of the bell curve just weren't aiming low enough.You will leave this film with only one of two impressions: 1) "It was GREAT! AWESOME! THE BEST!" You will proclaim this loudly to your friends between swigs of Natural Ice and bong rips, in your Cheeto-dust covered apartment.(Coincidentally this same demographic has no idea what the film Idiocracy is about) 2) You will realize that this film's popularity is proof that war, starvation and economic inequality are inevitable. On the whole, humankind is too stupid to avoid them. You will realize that we are far closer cousins to chimps than you previously wanted to believe.What's even more fascinating than this post-burrito-diarrhea ejection is the documentary Overnight, which observes in painful detail a fool and his ego. But at least that film has a happy ending: Troy Duffy goes back to the being the nobody he should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How often does a viewer get a chance to see an Irish character on screen that fights for good? There have been Irish actors who portray other ethnic characters but not Irish characters. It's actually kind of strange too because there are several Irish actors that could have been casted to use their real accents. Instead, two Americans star as the main leads. Whatever, I can deal with it.Anyway, the story is about two fraternal twins, Connor and Murphy MacManus, played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus who take it upon themselves to start their own crusade of killing bad guys just because, they're bad guys. It's a cool idea, who doesn't want the evil people off the face of the world? But here's where I get confused. It never is explained to why these boys decide to do this. Was there an event that happened in their past that made them change? Or was it self driven through pure excitement for the sake of killing? I don't know.I do give credit to Flanery and Reedus though for their acting. Because they're brothers, they will tend to act like brothers. For example, they do things synchronized and they tend to bump heads. That's fine because it allows them to become more believable to the audience. Their accents are also fairly well done for Americans too. But the weird thing is that even after all that, I really didn't care much for the duo. Accompanying them is an unstable Italian called Rocco played by David Della Rocco. Rocco makes his character unstable by giving him emotional spikes of anger and happiness. This is goofy and should create charm but for me, I didn't get attached to him either.Following their trail of hits is FBI agent Paul Smecker played by the usually chaotic Willem Dafoe. What people should like about Dafoe's performance is how well he is able to use his deduction skills to show not only his fellow cops but the audience as well to how the MacManus brothers carry out their business. It's really cool how he can figure that kind of stuff out. What was even more interesting was how the scene was setup. First the audience will see the aftermath, then Smecker will go about what he thinks happened and then a flashback will occur showing how the event actually happened. It will keep audiences locked to the screen.However, one character I found the least compelling was Il Duce played by Billy Connolly. There was a tiny back-story about him but it still never explained to how he seemed all too familiar with the MacManus brothers. That also wasn't explained well. Lastly, the music was rather average. Jeff Danna, who isn't a novice to this kind of job mixes rock with electrosynth and opera. In places it works and it others it doesn't which left me feeling indifferent about the film as a whole. The opera part I felt was a little too much. It should satisfy viewers but not to the highest degree of entertainment.These Irish mercenaries are cool to watch in action along with their detective counterpart played by Dafoe. Just don't expect much explanation for anything when it comes to characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The coolest thing about "Boondock Saints" is the name</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The coolest thing about "Boondock Saints" is the name. The stylized shoot-outs come a distant second.It begins with an interesting enough premise for a plot: A pair of Irish twins living in Boston listen to a Church sermon and agree for no particular reason it's a good idea to rid the world of bad men. When a few Russian Mafia threaten a friend, one thing leads to another and the Mafia end up dead in the back alley.The twins take that as a cue to assassinate all of Boston's gangsters. Here the movie stalls, because we don't know who these gangsters are or what they did. You could drop any of these scenes and it wouldn't make the slightest bit of difference to the story. The stylized shoot-outs are however entertaining, but the movie ends up more like a series of disconnected music videos.I have to admit the twist at the end made me smile, and Willem Dafoe is fun to watch.The paper thin plot is nonetheless full of holes: In one scene Billy Connelly as supposedly the world's greatest hit man, the twins and their ex-Mafia friend exchange fire at point blank range. The world's greatest hit man having emptied six pistols without bringing down a single man turns and runs. Everyone else walks away saying 'F' a lot."Boondock Saints" has gained cult status, no doubt because of the disconnected music videos. It isn't a great movie or even a good one, but I've seen far worse and it does provide mindless entertainment and a few laughs. For those reasons I found I quite enjoyed it."Boondock Saints" was made by a bartender with no prior film experience. If you had to compare it to another in the genre, you would pick "Reservoir Dogs" made by a video store clerk with no prior film experience. The name of the bartender was Troy Duffy. The name of the video store clerk was Quentin Tarantino. If you're wondering why Tarantino became so big while Duffy has disappeared, check out the documentary "Overnight". It turns out the making of "Boondock Saints" was far more entertaining that the movie itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get the hate...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be quite a bit of hate among the user reviews. Mostly to the tune of not only insulting the film but insulting the intelligence of those that do enjoy it.This is most certainly not the best movie I've ever seen nor does it deserve the praise as one of the "greats" because this doesn't even crack my top 20 action movies.All that being considered, you have to look at many things. Every character in this movie is clearly meant to be a caricature, hence their extreme outlandishness. Secondly, no matter what your feelings on religion in general it is perfectly reasonable for it to exist and be quite real in the world of a film (while I don't think that was the intention films are open for interpretation). So that being said the scene where they fall from the vent and make 8 extremely well placed shots, and the voice-over of scripture(I believe it is scripture) says as much, can be taken that they are actually being protected by their faith.Moving on, most of the complaints ring pretty true. The acting is average at best, the brothers accents sound like the lucky charms leprechaun, the dialogue is idiotic, the whole flashback to the murders gets old, and it has plenty of glaring plot-holes. However, I do find the movie entertaining for the most part, particularly the scene where Willem Dafoe's character is "there" while he recounts the poker game murders. If only for the same reason that I am able to enjoy any popcorn film (like say Transformers), because after I watch a heavy film (ex. 2001, Apocalypse Now, Manchurian Candidate(1962), the list could go on and on) I enjoy watching something less involving.I would have to say this movie is a 6/10. It's far from the worst I've ever seen or even the worst ever made. Anyone that says so has clearly never heard of Mystery Science Theater 3000 haha(yes those are real movies). This is not a must see, I could easily come up with 100 other movies you should invest time in before this one, but it is fun if you can give you're discerning film loving mind a rest for about 2 hours.If you've read this far forgive me. This is my first review and I did not give much time for compiling my thoughts and just wrote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it does not make a crap film great. When you imitate to pay homage, you are expected to bring something new to the table to justify the indulgence. This is a very lame attempt to mimic the previous years magnificent _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_, but devoid of its wit, style and elegance and likewise devoid of any meaningful plot. This goes straight into the "most overrated films of all time" pile. Willem Dafoe, who I normally love, is simply awful here, over acting in an effort to bring some substance to an otherwise shallow character. I somehow doubt this is a film he would place prominently in his resume. The film itself is equally shallow - being little more than a series of highly stylized and gratuitous violent set pieces glued together with bubble gum and cardboard. And what exactly was the purpose of portraying Dafoe's character as gay in a single scene with an Asian toy-boy if there is no relevance or expansion on the theme? It's all just like a bunch of Youtube clips glued together in a collage.I will not say "don't see this film". It is something you should view, if only to further aggravate yourself to see how Hollywood can ruin anything. It is one of those rare films that made me want to hurl my beer bottle at the TV. Pretentious, vapid crap and an absolute waste of resources that could have been spent far more wisely elsewhere. Simply awful.</fullReview>

Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus worked together beautifully as brothers and show the importance of family to them. As for the rest of the cast, they all do a great job bringing the movie together and Rocco does a wonderful job as a crazy Italian guy.

		<shortDescription>The World's First 70-Hour Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should come with a warning that it will absorb more than 70 hours of your life. Here's how that time expenditure breaks down:* 2 hours to watch the movie (or 3 hours if you've had to pause it several times to resettle yourself, grit your teeth and carry on) * 2 hours to prepare and soak in a long, hot bath to remove the soiled feeling that you've been 'had' by the director, the producers and the 'friends' who recommended it and said it was 'great'. * 6 hours to read the reviews on IMDb and elsewhere, to see if others in the world agree with your feeling that this was a terrible experience. * 60 hours of therapy because you're finding that you keep replaying some of the worst scenes over and over in your mind at the most inconvenient times. The distraction is constant and you can't work, sleep or make love to your spouse.In desperation you seek out a therapist to find answers to the questions that plague you: How did this film get made? Who sanctioned it? Has Willem Dafoe experienced any subsequent embarrassment? Who designed his suit? Have I seen any other movies this bad? Does the writer/director really believe my IQ is sub-92? Who makes that kind of orangey fake blood, and why do they still use it when it looks so false? Have I seen acting this poor since our high school production of Grease? Has any previous movie stolen so widely, so indiscriminately, so artlessly and so cynically from forerunners upon whose success it's hoping to hitch a free ride? Why don't directors tell the actors to stop moving their eyes after they've been killed? Is it really true that all evil people in the world are bald, tall and weigh 300 pounds? Has Billy Connolly ever been worse than this? OK, accepting that he has - because even Connolly's huge ego must remember his string of dire performances in such things as Timeline, Beverly Hills Ninja and The Man Who Sued God - will he now go back to supplementing the Connolly millions only through stand-up comedy, which he does exceptionally well, and give a real actor a chance to make a few shillings in the acting world? Or is Connolly committed to raking in the shekels no matter how dishonestly earned?I could spend time critiquing this film's dubious and infantile morality, the hokum posited as philosophy, the poor writing, the self-indulgent, careless and flabby directing, the 'by-the-numbers' acting, the terrible Irish accents ('to be sure, to be sure ... ah begorrah!') and the immature plot, but I won't because it's already been done in numerous other reviews on this site. This film is poor. Very poor. To get sucked in and carried along by this storyline you don't so much need a suspension of disbelief as a full lobotomy, and the Director is shameless about reminding you of that every few minutes because he really is an arrogant man who genuinely believes you're far too dumb to notice.In conclusion, here's the main question: How exercised about a film do you need to be to go and write a review about it? For most people, I think the answer is 'pretty gol'darned exercised'. For the majority of us with bars to visit, drinks to drink, lives to live and no interest in the hobby of review writing, we either need to really love, or really hate, a movie before we can be motivated to share that love or vent that spleen.This movie has 800+ reviews on IMDb alone. To put that in context, major movies like Godfather II with 500+ reviews, The Good the Bad and the Ugly (540+), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (500+), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (680+) and Goodfellas (750+) are all lagging waaaay behind this gem!! I believe that you, as a potential viewer, need to ask yourself why that is. And when you go on to check those reviews you'll notice with a start that a lot of them exist purely because their writers needed to vent their spleen. Look at mine ... I don't normally write reviews but felt I had to do something cathartic to try and rid myself of the noxious residue left by this pestilential offering.And now I feel cleansed. It worked! The therapist was right.</fullReview>

There's enough suspense, action, and comedy to thoroughly satisfy anyone watching it.... not to mention the two exceedingly attractive lead actors. Shallowness beside, the very concept of the movie was amazing. It's not just one of those movies about mindless and graphic violence, it has a clear MESSAGE that's plainly beautiful to everyone, even those who don't agree with the message. The filming techniques, too, with the style of flashbacks, creates a thrilling movie experience overall. The whole thing is rounded off quite nicely with the actors, NOT just because Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery are so attractive, but because every single actor in this movie is genuinely good at what they do. If I had one hundred hands, I would give this movie one hundred thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great premise, horribly flawed execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The general concept of this movie was good. Two Irish Catholic brothers decide to bring their own brand of justice to the world via masks and silenced pistols. As they kill off the scum of Boston, they are investigated by an FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe.This movie has 2 major pitfalls. One of which, is the character's over-acting, especially Willem Dafoe's. You really don't have to be a movie buff to pick out the bad acting in this movie. Dafoe's part is so overplayed, it takes away from the gritty realism this movie might have otherwise.The other problem with this movie is its rather predictable story. There are really no surprises in this one. It would've been nice to see the writer take the movie into a darker path exploring the moral conflicts between the religiosity of the brothers and their actions. Instead, they are pretty much hardened killers immediately after their first kills. This brings a lack of depth to the main characters, leaving you detached from them.I also had problems with the gratuitous use of slow motion in this movie. Sure, slow motion filming has its uses, however it almost always detracts from grittiness and realism. Action scenes in good gritty movies are almost always filmed in regular speed and with ambient noise.All in all, The Boondock Saints is an interesting idea written and filmed with disappointing and predictable Hollywood cookie cutter styles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Get It: Tattooed Irish Twins = Cooool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boondock Saints" is one of those films that have achieved an enormous cult-status over the past few years, and even though I can see why some people like this film, its cult-status is not at all justified in my opinion. Not that the movie was entirely bad. I actually found it to be quite entertaining, but the obvious (and constant) effort to create the hippest thing in the history of motion pictures was quite annoying and, as far as I am concerned, it had an opposite effect. Sure there are certain ingeniously funny elements (such as a stuttering bartender who suffers from the Tourette Syndrome), but then again, there's at least as many 'hip' elements that are annoying more than anything else. Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) MacManus are Boston Irish brothers who work as meat-packers (in spite of their ability to speak dozens of languages). When Russian mobsters try to take over their favorite bar on St. Patrick's Day the brothers successfully fight back, and they are henceforward acclaimed as 'Saints' in their neighborhood. Their sudden 'saints' status gives them the idea to cleanse the district of the mob entirely...There are several points that I liked about this movie. It is quite bloody, which makes it more entertaining in my book. There are also some interesting characters, my favorite being 'Funnyman' (played by David Della Rocco), a long-haired and full-bearded small-time crook with an anger issue. He's a buddy of the MacManus brothers, who are well-played by Reedus and Flanery, but whose exaggerated coolness begins to annoy at times. Irish folks are cool - that's one of the central messages in "The Boondock Saints". Now what about two Boston-Irish brothers sporting huge rosaries and 'meaningful' tattoos saying "Veritas" and "Aequitas" - That must obviously be as coool as it gets. The two also have a strong tendency for semi-religious drivel, which is to make them even cooler (I guess). Apart from the phony coolness, the story (which starts out OK) keeps getting dumber and dumber throughout the film. What annoyed me the most is the narrative style that resembles a video-clip. Director Troy Duffy has been compared to Tarantino, but I assure that these comparisons are unjustified. Adapting tarantinoesque elements is legitimate, of course (even more so since Tarantino himself is a master of tributes). The mere fact that he adapts some of these elements, however, doesn't make Duffy some kind of new Tarantino. Still, "The Boondock Saints" is an often amusing film. The performances are satisfactory. Reedus and Flannery are good enough in the leads, and David Della Rocco is quite funny as their irascible sidekick. The cast includes the great Willem Defoe as a gay, slightly nuts FBI agent, pornstar Ron Jermey as a mobster, and Billy Conolly, who always delivers solid performances. The blood-soaked action sequences are entertaining enough and the film has a certain sense of humor, and even gets hilarious in some parts. I cannot say I didn't somewhat enjoy watching "The Boondock Saints". As far as I am concerned, however, the film does not deserve its status as an acclaimed cult-flick. It is slightly entertaining at some points, but it is definitely silly and immensely over-hyped!</fullReview>

It instead remains the stringing together of flashy scenes without much if any coinciding explanation. The director relies on alternate camera techniques and freeze frames to make up for the lack of real plot. It has achieved success as a cult hit mainly due to the controversy that surrounded the film as it was kept under wraps because its original release date's proximity to the columbine incident. There are some enjoyable scenes but only from a visual standpoint. Overall it does not break or transcend the stigma of simply being cool but ultimately pointless.</fullReview>

The characters in general are shallow sketches. Willem Dafoe goes way over the top. The il Duce character is a strange cross between Hannibal Lecter and Leon (The Professional) that just doesn't work.Many of the characters' actions seem unmotivated and there is quite a lot that is never really explained. Early on we discover that the MacManus boys are fluent in many languages and the FBI agent asks why educated guys like that are working in a meat packing plant. We never get an answer. And why have these characters be multilingual? It serves no purpose.Even their motivation for wanting to clean up the streets is not made believable.See La Femme Nikita. See The Professional. See State of Grace. Don't see this film unless you want to see a hapless cat get splattered and watch Ron Jeremy with his clothes on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're Oirish, come into the parlor?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally any movie with a good score on IMDb is worth watching, so I sat down to enjoy "The Boondock Saints" expecting enjoyable action. The first thing that made me worry was the opening scene, which is set in what is presumably a Roman Catholic Church. There was obviously no effort whatsoever made to ensure that the service was accurately portrayed (for example -the Lord's Prayer which is recited was not the Catholic version, but the reformist "Protestant" one, which is never used in a Roman Catholic service). If filmmakers decide to set a plot in any particular geographical location or ethnic community they should show at least enough respect to get the basics right. This on its own is a minor point but it was only the beginning and should have warned me about what was to come. It seems that the only reason that the main characters are Irish is to fulfil the necessary religious link needed by the movie title, by using the stereotypical off-the-shelf Irish Catholic, hard drinking, hard fighting but with a heart of gold model. It would have been far better to have done without the painful attempts at an "Oirish" accent which were amongst the worst since "Finian's Rainbow" and painful to an Irish ear. (If you want to see how it is possible for non-Irish actors to get the accent perfect watch "The Proposition".) All of these faults aside the movie could still have been entertaining. Unfortunately the plot is so weak and predictable that not even an actor of the quality of Willem Dafoe could save it. I had to struggle with the desire to switch this movie off after the first twenty minutes, something I almost never do. There are a lot of movies in this genre and my advice is to pick a different one ? especially if you're Irish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though, I admire its ambition, this amateurish piece of work is quite literally a bloody mess. 'The Boondock Saints' wants to be 50 things; it's as if the director/writer (also well known prick) Duffy tried to put all of his ideas in one screenplay, knowing this would be his last film. (I stand corrected; he has, to date, 2, if you count the sequel to this movie.) It almost was his last movie. SEE: the documentary on this film: 'Overnight.' And I had. Years ago, but now finally got a chance to see the movie it refers to. Honestly, 'Overnight' was 4x the movie this was, but that's another review. In 'Boondock' we have two Irish brothers who amazingly speak 60 languages, but that's an irrelevant part of the plot, and stumble upon a life of vigilante violence against the mob and a FBI agent, who happens to be gay, but that's irrelevant part of the plot. I could go on and on about what's irrelevant, so I will stick with what's relevant: enormous stereotypes (Willem, please, please tell me you don't think all gay men talk with their hand on their hip), enormous overacting or simply no acting during numerous sloooooow-motioooon shots (heck, there are plenty of scenes people are just reading lines vs. acting them out) and enormously unbelievable leads as, I guess, superheroes to the community. Style is thrown in here, there, different angles used, then straight forward shots. Almost nothing is consistent in this film. Again, it's almost as if Duffy had a hundred of ideas roaming around and had to fit them all in. I was waiting for cartoon elephants to appear to guide the so-called "saints." Not really recommended, though not a complete waste. It does prove just about anyone can be a filmmaker.</fullReview>

The acting is dull and uninspired, and a lot of the lines of the actors sound like they are reading cue-cards or something. What I also thought, is that a lot of the action seemed out of place sometimes and even kinda random. I don't know why, but this movie just tries too hard to be ultra-violent I think. Willem Dafoe does a miserable job of trying to portray a detective that desperately needs some vacation. Some scenes with him are just plain ridiculous, and thats a shame because I know Willem Dafoe is a good actor and I enjoy a great deal of other movies he has played in.The plot (if there even is a plot) is also a big problem. Its just so damn random. The only thing this movie is about are 2 Christian brothers who are out to kill every 'evil' person in the name of god. Thats it. Other then just being a ridiculous concept, its just unrealistic in every way. Maybe some die-hard christians will love it, but even they have to admit how utterly uninspired the plot is. I'm not going to spoil any of it, but I can tell you that the film doesn't have any type of development in the story what so ever. The whole movie just seems to be random a lot of times. The 2 brothers find somebody who is 'evil' in their perspective, they kill him, and detective Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) tries to solve who the murderer's are. Paul Smecker also does a shitty job as a detective seeing how much of a mess the 2 brothers are leaving.The Boondock Saints is a popular title nowadays and I can definitely see why it got so many hype, but the truth is that it really isn't all that special and the content that is worth watching I can bet that a lot of people have seen already in either a Quentin Tarantino movie or in some other movie. There is nothing wrong with mindless action-movies, but every movie needs some kind of spine, and this movie unfortunately doesn't have that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that this picture is pure fantasy and entertainment- to be taken about as seriously as The Rock or Alien vrs Predator- but I find it kind of repugnant.#1 - Characters: Two brothers who are told by god to "kill bad people" go on a vigilante murder spree. These are our heroes. Willem Defoe plays not just a stereotypical loud and mean Investigator- (Telling fat cops to go eat more donuts is beyond tired) - but he portrays possibly the most ridiculous homosexual character ever put to screen. He dances through crime scenes, calls his lover a fag- and even cross dresses in order to aid the brothers when they are infiltrate some more bad guys. Wow.#2 - Huge plot problems - The man hired to hunt them down and kill them was their father!? The movies climactic scene is a public execution in a court room?! There is more- but those two are the craziest.#3 Waste - The action is undeniably well handled- and the cast does everything they can to sell this crazy concept- but in the end it comes off as the most frustrating kind of terrible movie: The kind of flick where you could see that with just a little bit of thought, and a little less heavy handedness- could have been quite good, or at least a lot of fun.I am stunned at the cult status and high score this flick has obtained on IMDb- It is an empty exercise- and I am sort of shocked more people don't think so.To be fair- I guess this picture does not ask or require you to think while you watch it- So- If mindless action is your thing- I guess check it out- just maybe turn the sound off.Just saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie a while ago(about 4 or 5 years ago). Saw it again last night. The two impressions heavily differed one from another. This time I've noticed many flaws on many levels of this flick. First ,the storyline is very thin. The message this story tried to carry out is,I suppose, the influence that media (even the preachings as a form of media) can have on individual(s)... So to wrap that message in commercial package our storytellers came up with a 'heroic avenger'(x2)... O, there is a religious allegory implemented as well (some of it's elements are handcuff-made-stigmata, holy water dripping from jail ceiling , pre-execution prayers...and so on). Bringing the Justice by killing heaps of 'bad guys' with 'rage and vengeance in heart' and all that with no tactics nor plot? Sorry-it's already been seen and is very thin... Second...physics. e.g. Fall from the fifth floor? Rambo shootouts(firs killing 10 mobsters with 10 bullets,but later on missing at least 100 bullets aimed at horrid 'Duke'(who also cant shoot?)...wright. Third...acting is a bit unbalanced,probably because some roles lack characters finesse(except for Willem Dafoe who skillfully managed to improve his role of 'Paul Smecker' ). Four... the story composition could be better led,with some shifts in rhythm which would enable (no not enable-create )a strong(er) catharsis... But I've liked it before? Well back then I knew substantially less about semiotics, form and details of which fine movies should be built.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints is a movie with one or two original ideas and lots and lots of stolen ones. Ultimately, it's just a violent, pretentious, idiotic rip-off of a movie. Even the title of this movie is stupid. Whoever heard of one boondock?After viewing this movie I'm starting to understand why Italians are so incensed about the stereotypes of Italians in all those Mafia movies. In the same way, Boondock Saints will certainly not do much for the Boston Irish - or even for the Irish Irish.I thought the carpet chewing performance of David Della Rocco was the only good performance in the film. The other actors were just wallpaper, and Willem Dafoe was positively annoying. The writing, too, is extraordinarily bad. At one point Dafoe sends a cop out to buy him a "latte with a twist of lemon." Coffee with milk and lemon must be an acquired taste, which is exactly what would have to happen to be able to appreciate the tripe in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terribly overrated. Lots of stolen ideas of movies such as Pulp Fiction, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, James Elmore Novels, etc. Quoting scripture ala Jules from Pulp Fiction. Accidental shooting of the cat, also reminiscent of Pulp Fiction. The tone of the movie was confused: was this a serious movie or a comedy or a tragedy? Defoe and Della Rocco's characters are absurdly overacted, almost to an embarrassing extent. Lots of "cool" posturing. The director took pains to make a couple very normal acting Irish kids look a lot more hip than they really were. This movie was just bad. The lead comment in which this film was rated 10 stars mentioned that even if you are a Christian you should still watch this movie. How silly: as if only Christians would be offended by the banality of gore?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1994 Quentin Tarantino made an academy award winning film that would influence many films, even today. Many filmmakers have tried to duplicate Tarantino's style and "Boondock Saints" is another one of those films. Do you know what that original film was? Your right, it was "Pulp Fiction." Regardless of how much "influence" "Pulp Fiction" has had on the making of "Boondock Saints," is "Boondock Saints" a good or a bad film?Two Irish brothers feel that they have had a mission from God to get rid of evil human beings. FBI agent Paul Smecker, while trying to figure out the murders, discovers that what the boys are doing is right. By fighting for truth and justice, are the Irish brothers accepted by the public or are they considered cold hard murderers? "Boondock Saints" is a lousy film, and it is not only because it is a "Pulp Fiction" wannabe because throughout history we have seen film, television, and or literature that borrows significantly from something else. "Boondock Saints" had a lot of potential because of the premise but the writing is not very good. Even though they infused many bits from "Pulp Fiction," if this reviewer had a lot of fun of viewing the movie, it would not have mattered.Like "Pulp Fiction," "Boondock Saints" puts a lot of emphasis on the crime/action genre, sprinkled with comedic elements throughout, but the problem is "Pulp Fiction" was actually funny. This reviewer laughed more unintentionally then intentionally. In fact, the funniest intentional part of the movie was done a lot better in "Pulp Fiction." It got to the point where it felt like an unintentional parody on the genre.The acting was okay. Billy Connolly is one of the bright spots as Il Duce. William Dafoe is the main reason to watch this film as a gay FBI agent, Paul Smecker. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus plays two Irish twins. Though they are twins, the viewer will feel that they are just a bit closer then that (if you know what this reviewer means.) David Della Rocco was just as pointless as his character, Rocco. The biggest error of film is casting Ron Jeremy as a member of the mafia, Vincenzo Lipazzi. Lesson in film, if you want to be taken seriously, never cast Ron Jeremy.In conclusion, you could watch something a lot better then "Boondock Saints." If Billy Connolly and William Dafoe were not in there, this reviewer would probably say that this film could not have gotten any worse. The whole film felt like it was trying to be too cool. Though just because you say the F-word and fire many bullets, does not mean that you are cool. Unlike "Pulp Fiction," there is not that character or phrases that are very memorable and there are no characters to root for. It was just a mess all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually, the movie was cool, but the script was garbage. And I mean, DOG SH*T. Aside from the gratuitous spraying of curse words for the hell of it, the characters are paper thin caricatures of clichéd action film personalities. What was up with Willem Dafoes character? Why not just tattoo "badass experienced cop guy" on his forehead? And him rippin' on the "rookie cop" cliché? Ha-ha, Dafoe makes fun of the rookie for no reason. Ugh...Ridiculous.And that "what are you a fag?!" line... Was that supposed to make me laugh?!And I didn't "question my ethics and morals" by the end of the film. These characters said they were on a mission from God. People who are on missions from God are CRAZY. Always. Yes, them too. So, yes, they're wrong. No, really, they are. Ugh, what a crappy movie. I cannot believe it has the rating it does. Are these the people who voted for Armageddon and Independence Day?To sum it up, this movie just feels so lazy to me. Desperado was a vigilante film, but at least it had better characters than this. C'mon people, you seriously have to reconsider the high score.PS: That reenactment/flashback scene in the house after the shootout was pretty badass though. Very well choreographed and shot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well made movie with a terrible message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie a few weeks ago and boy was it terrible.First off the two main characters are pretty hard to relate to. They are extremely religious, Irish, fraternal twins. Religious to the point of tattoos in Latin. And of course, they are vigilantes. With all the evil in the world they chose to take down the mafia. And being vigilantes they decide that the best way to do this is to kill them all.Another character is the expert crime scene investigator played by William Defoe. He is incredibly smart and seemingly perfect at his job. The real problem with him is that near the end of the movie he turns to the side of the Irish brothers. "Why," I asked myself ",would he turn to the side of the religious Irish vigilantes?" Because his messed up priest told him to! Another thing I found disturbingly wrong with this movie, is how the brothers preform a weird ritual that involves pennies and a prayer for every criminal they murder. As if they really care about the people that much! They also seem to be trying to prove a point that killing bad people is good when linked to religion. The movie tells us the lie that two wrongs make a right.Don't see this movie unless you like to rant or you don't care about the mental message the movie tries to show.Thank you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfortunate misinterpretation of Tarantino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another of the Tarantino obsessive genre films that pays far too much attention to Tarantino's strategic use of obscenities in dialogue and his intermittent extreme violence. Tarantino knows how to insert these unusual elements in order to add depth and force to different aspects of his film, especially the characters. But these elements themselves do not comprise the genius of Tarantino, rather they are only a small part. "The Boondock Saints" is 2 hours of constant obscenity and violence, never pausing to explore a character, or contrast the mood of the film. Every scene however is loud, bloody, and shallow. The film's philosophical premise is strong, analyzing the nuances of vigilante justice, but nuance and complexity are very difficult to discover when the characters are so simple and distracted by the frequency of extreme words and action. Tarantino is a favorite of mine, and I'm sorry I had to use him in the same sentences as this movie.</fullReview>

I guess I don't get the hype from fans that surrounds this movie. My buddy bought it and had me come over claiming that it would be one of the best movies I would ever see. Now, prefaced with that kind of statement I guess anyone would be a little let down unless the movie was, say, a true masterpiece. I felt the movie was forced and very pretentious in almost every way. The dialog, the acting, the direction were all void of originality or personality. I actually think that the story surrounding the making of this movie with it's director's rapid rise and fall in Hollywood is much more entertaining. That should be a full length feature film. (I know, I know. There is a documentary already). I generally like Willem Dafoe but he drove me nuts in this. I do not recommend this movie at all, however judging by the other member's reviews I am definitely in the minority.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am baffled. I saw Boondock Saints after reading glowing reviews and hearing about how great it was from everyone that mentioned it. They were wrong.Watching Boondock Saints requires an inexcusable suspension of disbelief. In one of the first sequences of the movie of the bothers rips a toilet out of the floor with his bare hands, drops it out of his fourth story window on to a mobster's head, and proceeds to jump out of this window. He survives with only minor cuts and bruises. That alone would raise a skeptical eye, but then there's the acting and characters.Every character in the movie from the unrealistically intelligent-cross dressing-over the top FBI agent to the dull charaictures that are the protagonist is ridiculously ill thought out. Having terrible dialog doesn't help flesh out these characters either. I certainly don't mind cursing in a movie, but hearing the f-word repeated the upwards of 3 times in one sentence isn't only unoriginal, it's immature. Welcome to 9th grade, Mr. Duffy.I could go on but most has already been said. Avoid this movie and go watch one of the Tarantino films it rips off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints. Wow. No, I don't mean that in a good way. It was shocking to sit through the hour I managed to watch. To think that someone actually paid money to make this blows me away. At least I only wasted the three bucks to rent it. The first thing that struck me about it's silliness was the ham fisted way that we're shown the twin brothers are very close. Every movement they make is in sync right down to them taking off their shirts to go to sleep in their small bedroom. Actually this comes off more as homo-eroticism than anything else. Just when you think the film has settled down and can't get any more lame, you're treated to something even more ridiculous. The brothers can speak every language, they can survive leaps off of high buildings, they can kill anyone and the police will applaud them. Since I don't care enough about this steaming dog turd to write much more I'll just say Willem Dafoe's character was completely unbelievable and it was a shame one of the legit films Ron Jeremy appears in was this. I'll end by saying, if you love films with Will Smith, Tom Cruise, you'll probably love this. If you can't stand films that those guys make, stay far away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't understand why this movie has such a high rating. Oh, wait, I do - there is quite a large subset of people who want a tangible reason to go out and murder people. If you have said to yourself recently, "I think that guy's bad, I should be allowed to kill him," this movie is up your alley. If you truly don't find anything wrong with that statement, this is probably your favorite movie. Despite what is logically wrong with the above statement, every other sentiment in this movie is reprehensible. One of the main characters (Dafoe), is a self-hating gay homicide detective who FINDS HIMSELF SIDING WITH THE VIGILANTES IN THIS MOVIE. There are at least two things wrong with that statement. He portrays the most unlikable, unsympathetic character in cinematic history. The two main characters (the brothers) are bad actors. Most likely, this is made far worse by having plot holes one could navigate a cruise ship through. Dialog is bad, plot is bad, characters are bad. This movie is cheesy. It appears that a 12-year-old with behavioral problems wrote it. I would hope that people watching this piece of dreck would not let their personal politics enter into their view of this "movie" and see it for the awful film it is, but I guess they do. Beyond my feelings about the ideology behind this film, I still find it nauseating. It's like a somewhat thought-provoking TV movie (the low-budget feel is ever-present). The thought-provoking, sadly, is paper thin. The people who think the brothers are right are just as bad as the people they are killing.Unless you're a passive-aggressive 12-year old who wants to find an excuse to satiate the bloodlust in your heart, skip it. There is nothing redeeming about this film, despite its purported "high ideals". Anyone can justify murder if they think hard enough. This movie doesn't even think hard enough for a bowel movement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.. you are no Quentin, and I don't even like Tarantino. Just another mindless violence-fest which tries to follow in the footsteps of classics such as Trainspotting, and Way of the Gun. How do you fight evil? Well according to this movie, you become evil yourself. I could not think of the brothers in any other light but vile, evil creatures who murdered men who had families and lives that they could have eventually sought retribution for. Whatever happened to letting the police or FBI take care of it? Yet this movie TRIES very hard in fact to make you believe these blood thirsty butchers gone murderers are in the right. Not to mention their friend Rocco is a low level gangster himself who likes to kill innocent animals. But that's funny, right? Like tossing a hampster on the hood of a car in 110 degree weather.The comedy bits are cliché, as are the characters themselves. It seems like every film like this these days has to have an unrealistically gay character. (Much like "The Mexican") Then to cumulate into the final appearance by "Il Duce" (somebody shoot me) played by Connolly so horribly that it makes you want to vomit, in the most unrealistic point blank shoot out to ever grace movie screens. The prayers are vapid and utterly stupid. The accents are unrecognizable as they seem to switch between Northern and Southern Ireland at whim. The heroes are whiney little brats with bloody mouths. The gun fights are utterly unrealistic, and attempting to be somewhere along the lines of the poetry John Wu creates in his film, but fails. Then you have the title of the sequel. "Boondock 2: All Saints Day". Must have a special education kid working their promotional office. Can you think of a more cliché sequel name, please?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had this movie reccomended to me and was encouraged by reading the reviews on this website, but oh what a disappointment. The cast seemed to be in competition with each other to see who could shout and scream the loudest, the clarity of the dialogue deemed superfluous, and the credibility of the plot non existent from the outset when one of the brothers rips out a toilet cistern and jumps from several storeys up taking out one bad guy himself and the other with the cistern. Eh yea right. Billy Connolly's Irish accent was as convincing as Groundskeeper Willie's Scottish one. His shoot out scene with his adversaries (soon to be comrades) displayed ineptitude of aim not seen since several thousand Germans all missed John Wayne over a period of 10 minutes at a range of 10 yards whilst armed with sub machine guns. This film is certainly original in many ways, I wish that its originality overcame its down side but I'm afraid not.Alan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't heard a word about this film before some of my friends mentioned how great it was and advised me to see it. So I took their advice and rented it soon after. Currently, the day after seeing it, I can think of very few qualities that made this film worth watching. It was obvious to whom this film tried to appeal, young men, ages 15-22 who think that nothing would be better than to roam the streets killing `bad guys'. Unfortunately, many of my friends fit this description. In general the film was overdone. It simply tried to shock the viewer with profound amounts of outlandish violence, extended periods of extreme language, and by making one of the main characters gay, in a disturbing sort of way. The inclusion of Ron Jeremy destroyed any slight credibility that the film may have strived to achieve as the mere sight of him makes me want to shoot myself in the head. It was no surprise that he was the only character in the film to engage in sexual activity (in front of the camera, as there is other sexual activity implied in the movie, e.g. Willem Dafoe's character, agent Smecker, sleeping with his flamboyant male lover) Other moments were downright embarrassing, such as when Smecker first makes an appears as the super cool FBI Agent who's intellect is, of course, far superior than that of the individuals in the Boston Homicide Unit initially investigating the murder scene. The most ridiculous part of the scene is when Smecker investigates the scene while swaying to opera music, and closes the crime within seconds. Madness. The next most ridiculous scene is the shootout between the old man who is released from prison to kill the Saints and the Saints themselves. The scene consists of the Saints, their friend Rocco, and the old man shooting at each other at point blank range for several painfully unrealistic minutes and the four men walking away from the skirmish with mere scratches. Ridiculous. Not only did the outlandish scenes get on my nerves, but so did the entire religious message that the movie painted. It's interesting how the Saints, being the cold blooded killers that they were, were so religious as to pray over the bodies of the men that they brutally killed. O and the prayers that they recited over and over and over were nothing but an annoyance while they were intended to be poetic and beautiful. Overall, this film is a waste of time for anyone who has realized that there is more to life than Metal Gear Solid and Grand Theft Auto 3.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Dafoe's performance was incredible... but the rest of the film left me to wonder why he would get involved in such a cliched ridden lemon. I am thinking that Dafoe may have been intrigued by the director's use of quick cutting and editing of the film. LeCompte, the director of Dafoe's theater company The Wooster Group, says that she is very interested with MTV and the quick cutting that comes out of it... and how it gives all of today's generation a mild form of ADD. Maybe that is why people like the film. "It is fast." I guess it is so fast that some people can't realize that the film is full of cliches. A lot of people have referenced the Quentin rip-offs... so I won't elaborate. But remember the scene where Dafoe puts the headphones on and listens to classical music? He is a crazed guy who loves classical music! Great! What a paradox. It was cut together so quickly. quickly. quickly. Quick to his face. Quick to his movements. Quick to the place around him. Quick. Fragments. But then what are you watching? You are watching just fragments thrown at you. Has anybody seen The Professional? Leon? A crazed guy who listens to classical music? A direct rip-off! But maybe our eyes were too glossed over at this point to remember. Rent this one and kick back some brews and try to just let your eyes glaze over. Dafoe is great, but make sure you don't watch the dramatic sequences too carefully (particularly when the two brothers lose their good friend) or you will realize that the acting, Dafoe excluded, Sucks. Who are these people? Why do they decide to start killing people over religion? Why don't they feel remorse when they kill them? If they are supposed to be religious, they should feel remorse... if they are insane, then pulling a trigger would not have any psychological effect. But then LET'S SEE THE INSANITY! Don't kill our brains with quick editing, underdeveloped characters, cliches, and Fragments.</fullReview>

I have NEVER literally, i promise, been physically ill after viewing a film until i saw this terrible piece of crap. THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!! I'm not exaggerating either. There was not one good, quality scene in the whole film. Awful.Top Ten Out of the Uncountable Problems with this movie (random order) 10. horrible characters...all of them9. horrible plot...every aspect of it is pure crap8. Willem is a GAY FBI AGENT who get his nipples kissed by an Asian guy while talking on the phone about the case, then when the guy says "I just wanted to cuddle" Willem says, "cuddle? what a fag." I thought it couldnt get worse, oh how wrong i was.7. A supposed professional hit man with 6 guns does not just tag a finger off of one of the 3 stationary guys he's shooting at after firing 60+ rounds at them.6. 3 stationary guys who not only kill people day in and day out will not miss an old fat guy when all three of them are shooting at him. Even with ONLY one finger, you should still be able to shoot this guy.5. The whole air vent scene....what the heck....they are about to kill the 9 most powerful criminals in the city by coming out the air vent when they decide to start having a natural sibling rivalry scuffle with each other and they fall through the ceiling prematurely, but it's ok because the magically unattached rope clings onto something strong enough to hold both their weight as they hang upside down and shoot all 9 men...4. It's impossible to a) uproot a toilet when u've been beaten up and handcuffed to it, b) know where they are taking your brother to kill him c) make the decision to walk up the stairs to the roof d) throw the toilet you are hand-cuffed to off the roof directly onto the gunman and then jump off the 10-story roof onto the other guy e) live through it3. The whole dead hooker/stripper scene...the annoying American guy grabs a dead hooker's breast and later in the film, after his friends get mad at him for doing it, says "i gotta make up for that tit thing." and I'm supposed to feel sad when this guy dies?2. They take over their own court hearing and kill the witness and recite their little sayings and make it all "holy" to off yet another "evil" person...I'm almost in tears at this point in the film.1. Willem...He dresses up like a woman, walks right up to a bad guy's mansion door, knocks, gets invited in for sex, is face to face with a bad guy's unzipped fly, then doesn't go through with it b/c his wig accidentally falls off...if thats not bad enough, the whole movie he's trying to catch these guys and when he finally does, he decides he agrees with their cause??? WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND HUGE PIECE OF CRAP. HOW ON EARTH DID THIS MOVIE GET A 7.7 RATING????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost everyone I know has been raving about this movie for some time. After seeing it, I'm wondering what all the fuss is about. "Boondock Saints" borrows so liberally from the visual/narrative techniques of Tarantino, Fincher, Smith, Ritchie, etc. it's almost embarrassing. Fragmented narratives, ultra-hip protagonists, kinetic montages, the F-word every other sentence -- it just seems done to death by now, especially when executed by what seems like the "How to be a Cool 90s Filmmaker" handbook. The two leads double-fist handguns like a pair of Chow-Yun McFats and have enough time to get in some witty, at times pop-culture concerned, repartee. People get into tough guy shouting match confrontations because that's what all tough protagonists have done since the early-mid-90s. Dafoe's FBI agent character listens to opera when trying to figure a crime scene so it'll lend an air of pseudo-artsy-fartsiness that people will mistake for some form of profundity -- the religious aspect also seems added for a similar reason.Still, the movie does have it's brighter moments. When "Boondock Saints" stops aping other movies and comes into its own, the film actually starts to get good. The moral ambivalence of vigilante justice is an interesting notion, but it hardly gets developed in the film until the very end. This issue is passed over instead for shouting matches and flashback-driven fragmented narratives. If the movie just didn't try so hard to be edgy and just tried to be true to its material, a better movie more worthy of such praise would have been the end result.If only "Boondock Saints" had just been itself (a rather modest crime and vigilante movie) and not what it turned out to be (a flick too hip for its own good), maybe then I'd see what all the hype was about. It is an entertaining movie, but in my opinion is not on the same level as the movies and filmmakers it so blatantly takes from. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie I have seen in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. It seems that every "gangster" movie since Pulp Fiction has been absolute crap. (ie Killing Zoe, Way of the Gun, BOONDOCK SAINTS). SPOILER ALERT This movie starts out with some guys going into a Catholic church, walking down the aisle in the middle of mass and kissing the feet of the crucifix and then walking out. Right, very religious. From that point I remember a bar scene. Some thugs come in and start harrassing these two dudes friend, a highly annoying loser, and one of the worst actors ever to appear in any movie in the history of the world. Well the thugs punch this dork, and then everyone jumps in and beats the living crap out of them. The next day the same thugs come to the Boondock saints house and "rouse" them out of bed. They didn't like how they were treated and want to teach the Saints a little lesson. Well, some very stupid things happen like a guy ripping a toilet clean out of the floor, climbing to the roof of the building and jumping off and landing on the guy below just before he shoots his brother. The two Saints proceed to kill the thugs in broad daylight and then leave.After this little escepade they think they have a marketable gimmick. Why don't they just kill all the criminals in their town (and maybe the world? WOOHOO). So, they team up with their stupid annoying friend and go around killing bad guys. The main crime boss doesn't like this so, I guess he pulls some strings and gets this crazy guy (Billy Connoly, ya that's right, that COMEDIAN guy, well I guess he is pretty funny in this movie too) out of prison. THis guy is in a body cage like Hannibal Lecture in a maximum security prison and they just let him out. Real believable. Well this guy goes after the Saints, but doesn't manage to kill them even though he fires about 10 guns in all and only manages to hit one in the arm. Anyway, the saints get caught, but this psycho saves them. I guess you are supposed to assume he was their dad.Oh, did I mention there is a gay cop played by Willem Defoe that is after them the whole movie, until he realizes that they are doing RIGHT? Blah.This is one of the worst movies EVER. I guess if you are a 15 year old boy or a 20 something year old dork that lives at home with their parents then you might like this movie. But if you are looking for something entertaining, don't watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste yr time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend has been insisting for over a year that I see this movie. I finally shelled out my hard earned money and all I can wonder is why bother? It's quite surprising that this film scored a 7.6 out of 10 with viewers. Director Troy Duffy is a film buff but the quality of this work is lacking. The main problem that I have with this film is the meandering plot. The script wanders aimlessly from one incident to the next without any real plot development. The conventional use of flashbacks and slow motion become rather mundane. After the first 10 minutes of the film I began the elaborate process of matching scenes from the Boondock Saints to other films. I think that director Troy Duffy should really consider the script for his next work and ditch the cinematic pitfalls that plague this film. Character and plot development will go a lot further than the use of the F-word 50 times in one scene. After a while it just becomes tiresome. The film ended with some rather interesting faux documentary interviews with the typical man on the street. Unfortunately, as the saying goes, it was too little too late. If you want to see a film that deals with the same subject matter then rent Leon: The Professional. Don't waste yr time with The Boondock Saints.</fullReview>

The plot is ridiculously improbable as are most of the characters. I kept hoping it would get better, then it mercifully ended. There are so many errors in the film it becomes more comical than the comedy that's supposed to be there. Some people are comparing this to works from Ritchie or Tarantino. Sorry, I can't see it. Both those directors have a style that's entertaining and grabs your attention. This film misses by a wide margin. There's no style, no originality and the violence becomes boring. Mind you, it gave the squib guys plenty of work.</fullReview>

The killing is relentless and endless, with frame after frame of gratuitous, slow motion violence, some of it even repeated in case you didn't get enough of it the first time.Violent movies can still make valid points and be worthwhile endeavors, as Kubrick and others have shown. However, the difference between Kubrick's violent movies and this one is the same as the difference between the nude paintings hanging in the Louvre, and the photos in Hustler magazine.Spend your time doing something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was curious, but now I'm not...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard about this film while working at a multimedia department store a few years back when a customer had asked if we carried it. It wasn't in the store, and he said something along the lines of "*snicker*, probably because it was banned." I was never able to confirm whether this film was actually banned or not, but I don't see why it would be necessary to ban it (or ANY film that isn't snuff, for that matter) when films that are arguably much much MUCH more violent and much more blasphemous had been released before it. And I see nothing about a ban being placed on it in the trivia or on the message boards (unless I've missed something). So I'm venturing a guess to say that this guy didn't know what he was talking about.Regardless, I came across a cheap copy of the DVD at a used store and decided to check it out, because usually I'm interested in a lot of films that have an aura of "controversy" or are rumored to have some element of "extremity" in them, so I figured I might get some form of enjoyment out of it. In the end, the only thing I really liked about it was the fact that Willem Dafoe was in it (note that I didn't say I necessarily enjoyed his *performance*, but rather just the fact that he was IN it was somewhat amusing). Oh, and I laughed during one scene when David Della Rocco's character was so completely flabbergasted by all the death that surrounded him that he just kept stammering the F-word over and over again, trying to form a sentence, but eventually just gave up and jumped up in the air, dropping a big F-bomb -- in a film with 246 occurrences of the F-word, that was the ONE moment where I felt that the absurdity of the language really matched up with the absurdity of the situation. Bravo.Otherwise, I was not very shocked or entertained by this film (though I suppose I understand where its appeal lies). Generally what irks me about a lot of modern action films is, to invent a term, their "cultural consciousness" - that is to say, it is very conscious of its own "edgyness." While the Boondock Saints has an interesting gimmick going for it - the idea of killing in the name of God - it winds up being no more than just that: a gimmick. The rest of the story is just a matter of keeping the audience entertained. Throw in some heavy guitars and some big-beat electronica in the background of every action sequence, saturate the dialog with obscenities, and have the characters act like they're constantly on edge and have them do "crazy" things, such as reciting prayers just before they blow someone's head off (oh, and throw in a character with Turrets just for the hell of it). This style seems directly catered to an audience that wants to see something that's "edgy," "unusual" or "extreme" but has little or no concept of just how amazingly extreme and sophisticated things can get once you go beyond Hollywood and the block-buster world (note: This is NOT a Hollywood film, but it is not unlike something I would expect to see come out of Hollywood {and props to the director for being able to achieve this on a shoestring budget, but I have to wonder, if you're an indie film maker who wants to make something "extreme," why would you look to Hollywood as a model for extreme film-making...?} Also, I do not mean to imply that nothing in the mainstream is of any value, because there are a LOT of major films that deserve their successes... but rather more often than not the most valuable films tend to come from people who are not trying to mass-market their art {and in modeling his style after Hollywood film-making, it looks as though he is trying to achieve this... and I imagine he'll get a bigger budget for the sequel}).Ultimately, as I said before, this film comes across as being VERY conscious of its own "edgyness," and it is this quality that ruined this film for me, as well as countless others. As for all the comparisons to Tarantino - they simply are not justified. Sure, Tarantino is fond of incorporating absurd violence and excessive foul language into his films, but what drives his films is the way he sets up his narratives and dialog sequences to generate implicit meanings (rather than EXplicit) so that the violent scenes seem all the more absurd, not to mention his style which is essentially taking references to a zillion other films and combining them all and reshaping them to create something that is entirely his own. So in essence, saying that the Boondock Saints is "like a Tarantino film" is like saying Santa Claus is "like Jesus." To be honest, it's not a terrible film (there are MUCH lamer action flicks out there, and much lamer things being produced by Hollywood in general), and I'm certainly not going to be the asshole who says "this film is morally corrupt and therefore it is harmful to society," but I was ultimately disappointed by it after being exposed to all the hype.-adam</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Couple o' spoilersSigh... At the time of this writing, y'all have seen fit to bestow upon Boondock Saints a coveted 7.7 rating and any number of rave reviews. How does this happen? Who sees this convoluted, simple minded exercise in right wing propaganda and actually buys into its half-assed morality lecture? Setting aside the moronic dialogue, hopelessly stereotyped casting and would-be John Woo action sequences, this is just a ridiculously dumbed-down portrait of vigilantism. Remember all that hubbub when Rambo came out about the U.S. soldiers "not being allowed to win" in Vietnam? Here the theory is that restrictive ideas like due process and fair trials are keeping our police from winning the war on crime. I disagree with that viewpoint, but I would accept a film that presented it in an intelligent, illuminating manner. Films like Taxi Driver, Falling Down and, lord help me, even Original Gangstas have tackled the subject with much more insight into the workings of the vigilante mind and better arguments for such action. I detested Straw Dogs for its philosophy of preemptive aggression over pacifism, but I still respect it for the vivid and meaningful argument it put forth. Boondock Saints simply says "These are good guys. These are bad guys. If the good guys kill the bad guys, we will have no more bad guys," then uses that simple notion as a frame on which to drape a whole lot of boring shooting and cursing. If only the real world were that black and white. The director makes a weak effort to ground his work in reality with the pro and con interviews at the tail end, but the film's sympathies are never in question. Oh, and was Willem Dafoe's surprise drag appearance supposed to make me laugh? Because to me it played like sheer desperation brought on by a total lack of original ideas. Can't wait for the sequel.

Maybe they're just the first to spot this rarely watched movie."I can see why the aforementioned audience liked it. There are a lot of fire-fights.There are a lot of highly, highly unrealistic, disgustingly one-sided fire-fights.The plot is hackneyed and underdeveloped. Had the writer gone through one or two more drafts, maybe it would have been entertaining. The characters were very flat. There really was no development of the characters, with the exception of Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe).There are also gaping plot holes (or things that are entirely left out).As I said, there is an audience for this, and once members of that audience watch the movie, they take it, well, religiously. This movie is compared to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. There are vaguely similar themes, but The Boondock Saints lacks all of the style, wit, intelligence, and originality that the other two films have.But if you don't mind seeing a film about vigilante justice (I am still not convinced that that is the motivation behind the whole thing; it seems to me that the characters' sole purpose is fairly motiveless violence with socially acceptable targets [read: 'evil people']) with lots and lots of shooting, go ahead and check it out.Just my $0.02..</fullReview>

Add into this mix a ridiculous subplot of a gay cross-dressing FBI agent and, well, what more needs to be said? Incidentally, I have not heard the "F" word used so much in a movie. I am not a prude, but this was so repetitive as to be abusive to the audience. If you like non-stop swearing, murdering, slow motion slaughter, straining to understand dialogue buried in Irish brogue, and attempts to rip off Tarantino's style then go ahead and sit through this turkey. Otherwise, go see Taxi Driver, Death Wish, or The Star Chamber or any other vigilante movie. I can't imagine any other vigilante movie could be worse than this one.</fullReview>

Otherwise, I would have pushed the ejector switch in the first 20 minutes.All the talk about Columbine, and it being the reason this cult classic wannabe was not theatrically released is pure B.S. Although I admit the production is technically fairly well done, Boondock Saints makes even the most fatuous Hollywood offering look like Citizen Kane. Any comparison to Tarantino's work is simply a sham. Actually, what we have here is a horribly failed and misguided attempt to surpass some of the unpleasant elements found in Tarantino films.That would explain the ludicrous overuse of bullets shattering, blood splattering, and F-bomb chattering. Forget any attempt at character development, or anything approaching a coherent story. Instead we are presented with an awkward array of soggy cardboard characters that stumble through meaningless action. There is no need for resolution, no need for redemption, no need even for an ENDING. All we end up with is hope - HOPE THAT THE SEQUEL WILL NEVER BE MADE!As for Willem Dafoe, he should be grateful that this travesty was never released. His goofball performance as a creepy, campy FBI agent rivals Tim Curry in Rocky Horror. Unless you're the sick sort of person who enjoys endless gratuitous violence, an F-bomb in every line, and a splattered cat thrown in for good measure, skip this monstrosity, and screen Jackie Brown again.</fullReview>

As soon as the final credits roled I felt it was my duty to speak up. This movie SUCKED!!! I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed...a terrible script (with holes so wide you could drive a truck through it), incredibly bad acting (especially Rocco and the Russian mobster who had his ass bandaged), poor action scenes (why the slow motion?), and some of the worst Irish accents I have ever heard. The next day I went to IMDB to see what the masses had to say. I was stunned to see such a high rating. I thought there was something wrong with ME so I went back and watched this movie again. Much to my surprise I did find two redeeming qualities in this flick. The first was when the cat got his head blown off and the second was when Rocco bit the dust (no sequel for him). I'm sure Mr. Duffy is a good guy, but next time write a script that doesn't seem like it was written by my 10 year old nephew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The funniest piece of crap I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend recommended this film to me and so a group of us got together to watch it. Not understanding that Dafoe was gay at first and then realizing in hilarity that he was, I laughed my way through this absurd attempt at a good independent film. The casting of Ron Jeremy in any role in this film immediately diminished any legitimate value it held. I especially like the need for a Ron Jeremy sex scene, (give him something he knows guys, don't let him stretch his characters beyond porn). There are too many horridly overacted Willam Dafoe scenes to recall, and for this reason I figured it was made early in his career. 1999! Less than five years after the English patient (though four, after speed 2) it is so sad to see a good actor acting badly in such a ridiculous film. Willam Dafoe has had a rollercoaster career of inspiring roles and hilarious flops. The sad part is that, (I imagine) Dafoe and the makers of this film thought they were doing something truly important. Save this stuff for film school, and Willem...I'm disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie was remarkably unintelligent, and a waste of time. all it was was a bunch of guns blasting all over the place, and ppl yelling out the f-word and ranting and raving about who to go kill next... and a gay transvestite cop, who was also an idiot (dafoe). it tries so hard to be all stylish and cool (with the irish brothers always reciting a prayer before they pump rounds into the back of someone's head, amongst other things), but fails miserably... well, okay, i suppose i have seen worse movies, but this one was pretty bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Plain Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: Good visuals; decent soundtrack; good general idea for a movie.Cons: Utter cr*p for a script; very bad acting overall with only few exceptions; laughable, pathetic characters; illogical, predictable, stupid.I can't believe action movies can get THIS bad these days. The idiotic excuse-for-a-script serves only two purposes: some excuse for on-screen violence and the use of the f-word as pretty much the only verb the "characters" use in their communication. Is this supposed to be funny or have some "deeper meaning" or something? Compared to the others in the genre -- "Pulp Fiction", "Reservoir Dogs", "Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels", "Natural Born Killers", "Dobermann", "Dogma" -- this one is an unbelievable pile of garbage and a real PAIN to sit through. Do not even bother to rent.p.s. A Russian mafia boss with a surname of Pavlova? Heck, why didn't they just name him Mary-Ann?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An insult to Boston.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I forced myself to travel far and fork up $5 to see this film on the sole basis that it was shot in Boston (the world's greatest city) and the great story behind the writer/director, Troy Duffy (an ex-New England bartender, he apparently pitched "Boondock" to a producer/patron and the rest is Hollywood history). I'm sorry I made the effort. Tip to Duffy: Tarantino excelled in ripping-off dozens of films by twisting them into new, more exciting cinema - you, on the other hand, have ripped-off Tarantino, "The Professional" and "Things to do in Denver When You're Dead"...and very, very, very badly. I was terribly bored. If I were Troy Duffy, I'd be asking for that bartender job back real quick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How bad can one movie be??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my God!!!! This is by far and away the worst movie I've seen since Mo' Money. A friend of mine recommended this "cult classic" to me and b/c I normally like independent movies that go overlooked, I gave it a try. This movie is bad on so many levels that I can't even begin to imagine what was going on. It's uneven, stupid, corny, and inconsistent just for starters. The action is over the top bad, the actors are over the top terrible, the story is just plain idiocy and the directing is extraordinarily lacking here. This is amateur hour at its worst. Anyone with any sense of taste in what is a good movie or bad one would know right off the bat just how horrible this movie is. IMDb doesn't allow for me to write everything I want to say about this movie, but my point here is that this movie should have never even made it to DVD. Don't waste your time or efforts with this trash unless you're curious to see how poor and terrible one movie can be. 2/10 (it gets 2 b/c there was potential for a great movie here and there is some effort in originality that was poorly executed).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints:"Thou shalt not kill. It's the one commandment they cannot keep. Tough, stylish and extreme, fans of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction will thrill to the action, intensity and intelligence of this modern day morality tale written in blood. Starring Willam Dafoe (The English Patient), Sean Patrick Flanery (Powder), and Norman Reedus 8MM. When the sadistic Russian mob starts muscling in on their South Boston Irish neighborhood, Connor and Murphy McManus know what must be done. Feeling that the vengeance of God is flowing through their veins, they set out to rid the streets of gangsters, criminals and lowlifes. As the body count rises, the brothers became local heroes. Now, one unorthodox FBI agent must be cunning enough to bring them down. "What a stupid piece of trash. First off, there ARE no more Irish gangs in America. The "south Boston Irish neighborhood" was poor in this movie. There ARE no more poor new england Irish neighborhoods. This movie reeks of a screenplay and director that desperately want to make being Irish in America look glamorous, amazingly catholic, and violent. They're so Americanized that it's the best they can do to rely on outdated stereotypes to assert their fading heritage. Please- i saw right through it. Second off, the only 3 times i saw a woman in this masturbatory, gun filled male fantasy was when they were being threatened with guns, pulled by the hair, and cussed at. The one woman who was respectable was the cute "Irish" news reporter. Notice that. Could this get any more irritating? Yes. It could and it did. Not only were there Irish "gangs," there were evil Russian mobsters, snide Italian gangsters, and the lone Jewish clown who serves as a punching bag for jokes and physical clips throughout the movie. All of these people fight, say "fuck" like it's going out of style, and kill, kill, kill. And please, a detective that listens to opera while examining a crime scene? I can almost hear the director coming all over himself. "Cult movie" or not, this is ridiculous and a total waste of time. It's so full of itself as to suggest pretension. I'd have to say the historical inaccuracy got to me the most.Note to the director- Hey. You may have some Irish descent (wowie!), but you must get used to the fact that you've been doing fine all your life (no gangs or drugs, a life in the suburbs) and that most people of Irish descent don't glamorize it the way you do. Nor would they ever. Stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Checking another major site the reviews (not written) aren't very good (barely over 2 stars). I saw a 7.7 average on IMDb, which I've always trusted as a reasonably accurate site. How this movie got the votes it received I have yet to figure out. It's not the movie the IMDb voting would have you believe. Acting isn't that great, plot is ridiculously filled with Hollywood hype and it's not very likely anything like this would ever happen in our lifetime. Aside from that there are technical flaws that are so far beyond belief, it leads me to believe a few amateurs were behind the scenes in fitting the story to the director's vision. Mechanical ductwork from elevator shafts leading above an occupied hotel room? Get real. Isn't reality in any sense of the word. Ductwork other than exhaust ducts from the top of elevator shafts do not penetrate elevators, and no ductwork I know of can support the weight of two men inside of it, let alone be large enough to fit two men, but I guess that's how the two stars dropped into the ceiling of the room and killed 9 people. Hollywood really needs to drop the duct technique for sneaking around buildings. It's utterly ridiculous (ever notice how clean these ducts are?) and laughable at best. Totally unbelievable and trite Hollywood movie with little to redeem itself. I'm a huge movie fan, have rated over 3300 movies on other sites and have seen them all, plus more. Don't believe this rating as anything short of a testerone filled waste of time with pipe dreams filling the cracks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe I was just expecting too much?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film first was released I had NO interest in seeing it, however after hearing from four consecutive people how incredible and entertaining this film was I changed my mind quickly and grabbed a copy to enjoy. That was my first mistake!I truly can't put into words how disappointed I was in this movie. I went into it expecting some fresh exciting crime film with good acting and directing. I was let down in all of these areas! Especially in the acting degree where, in my opinion, Dafoe gives his worst performance that I've seen to date. The story itself I thought was done very poorly as well. I mean the concept of the story, I still believe, is a good idea BUT this film shows just how badly a good story can be ruined! but that's about as much time and effort I'm going to give this waste of film...at least until Troy Duffy apoloizes for putting me through his version of a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is so incredibly bad, I eventually embraced it with a sick fascination, watching as it ripped off so many of my favorite movies ("Oh, I remember that form that Tarantino, Rodriguez, Woo, Ritchie, Stone, Scorcese Movie!"). I almost don't know where to begin, so I'll start with the one scene that I liked. It was between Willem Dafoe and a priest in confessional as Dafoe struggles with his conscience. It was surprisingly well written and well acted and is the only redeeming scene in the whole film, to be honest.The fact that this movie blatantly steals scenes from other, better movies is not what makes it so bad (but now that I think of it, stealing is one of the crimes that is punishable by death according to the Saints. We should be so lucky). No, what makes Boondock Saints bad is that it does such a poor job of ripping them off. John Woo might consider dying early so he can start spinning in his grave. I can practically see him taking a razor to his own wrist during the laughable shoot-out between the Saints and Billy Connelly (that's right, I said Billy Connelly). Woo might say something like, "What have I wrought? The horror, the horror!" right before his arterial spray covered his big screen television. Another tragic, Boondock Saints related death.You might find yourself asking certain questions while watching this movie. Fear not, for I have the answers you seek! For example you might say to yourself, how are these guys with so good at killing when they have no experience and their basic attack plans involve standing in the center of rooms surrounded by bad guys with only a handgun in each paw and some cool sunglasses. That's easy - It's obvious that they've seen John Woo films and know that a guy firing two guns at once looks too damn cool to get killed, and because all these scenes are in unnecessary slow motion shots it gives them plenty of time to dodge the bullets. Another question you might ask is why is the Willem Dafoe character gay when it's obvious that writer/director Troy Duffy knows even less about gay people than I do? What a silly question. It's so that Duffy can have ridiculous scenes where Dafoe prances around crime scenes while listening to CDs on his portable disc player as if he were conducting an orchestra instead of gathering evidence. So he can include clever scenes of Dafoe calling his lover a fag because he wants to cuddle and saying something similar to a bartender at a gay bar. See, he's a macho homosexual. He's a rebel. He doesn't play by the rules, and he sure as hell doesn't cuddle. Oh, and we must not forget the scene where Dafoe dresses up as a blond prostitute so he can infiltrate the mob's headquarters. I would have liked to see how this movie played in San Francisco. I can picture men turning to the person next to them and saying, "We don't act like that, do we?" Why do they say a prayer before whacking the bad guys? Don't you know anything? It's because they've seen Pulp Fiction, only Samuel L. Jackson's character was more honest about his motivations for quoting the Bible.Some random complaints I have - an extremely poor attempt at capturing the randomness, shock and surprise of Vincent Vega and Marvin's "explosive" conversation in the back of Jules' car in Pulp Fiction. A little of Rocko goes a long way, and I felt cheated when he wasn't given a slow, painful death. It would be my guess that Rocko's command of the english language is not the greatest as he seems to only know about fifty words, half of which begin with "F" and end in "K". How did Billy Connelly become such a feared hitman when his method of whacking a guy involves standing in the middle of the street in broad daylight with a bunch of guns under his trench coat and waiting to be seen before firing. This could only seem like an ambush to the Saints, probably thinking, "Why didn't we think of that?" Rocko's extremely old and lame joke that grinds the movie to a dead halt. And the list goes on.Those wacky Weinstien brothers - when they're not frequenting bars looking for the next Quintin Tarantino or Kevin Smith, they're buying Oscars (I'll never forgive them for robbing Saving Private Ryan of Best Picture). Guys, stick to what you know best. The money spent making this film would have been better spent on the catering budget on the next Scream film. Someone really has to feed Courtney Cox. Apparently lack of food has made her dizzy and she accidentally married David Arquette. Someone get her a Twinkie, STAT! But I digress. This movie is a terrible waste of time. It was recommended to me by some young crack addicts who thought it was the greatest film ever made. But that seems to be the general consensus regarding this film. People love it. So I guess that makes me wrong this time, does it? No, that can't be it. Everyone else is wrong, I'm right. 2/10 stars for this turkey. G'night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should be avoided at all costs. The acting is terrible, it is so cheesy its ridiculous and the only reason Willem Dafoe took this role was for the money because even he is terrible in it. The lead roles have THE WORST Irish accents I have ever heard in a movie, they sound like Leprechauns with Scottish, American, Australian and South African twangs, absolutely cringeworthy. I was told that this was a great movie and a cult classic. Oh my God please tell me this was a joke. If Marlon Brando had used an African accent as Don Corleone in The Godfather it would have been slated. This was a shambles of a movie and the acting and script is terrible. If you think this movie is anyway half decent then please pass me some of whatever you're smoking, because this is a disaster. 1 out of 10 only because I had to give a mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, Awful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is done by, clearly, a Quentin Tarantino wannbe. Only, the writer/director of this movie doesn't have near the talent. (At least at this point in his life.) The story is horrible; you can drive a truck through at least 5 major plot holes. The acting? So-so. The directing? What directing? After the opening sequences of this movie, the directing devolves to a hack job.I just watched the movie "Overnight," which is a documentary about Troy Duffy, the director. I can totally understand why this movie didn't sell in Cannes, even with Cassian Elwes as the agent in charge of selling it. No distributor would buy this movie for a theatrical release (of course), but home video, yeah, there was a market for this there. It's got lots of violence and gunplay, so if that's all you care about, you'll probably like this movie. The fact that half of the violence in this movie is not motivated (and gratuitous)... hey, who cares as long as there's blood and guts, right?? ***Spoiler Alert: And the cat killing scene is a total rip-off from Pulp Fiction. I mean, c'mon, dude. How lame.I can also understand why this guy hasn't been able to get his 2nd movie off the ground to date. I'm sure he will at some point, but if I was an investor, I wouldn't invest in this guy. At least not till he develops his writing and directing ability more. Much more.For those who aspire to be filmmakers, or enjoy the inside scoop of Hollywood, rent "Overnight." It's a fascinating account of Troy Duffy's self-destruction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate whenever I read on whatever comments titles like (I Hated it), (I Loved It), (This is Not Good), (This Is The Greatest Movie Ever), BLA BLA BLA !!. Those frank simple declarations or that kind of natural impression used to make me sick, because I've always thought that you must be the perfect accurate analyzer when you're talking about a movie, it deserves that. But you know what ?! I have had it.. and let me scream : this one doesn't deserve it at all !!WaW it's great to be alive and say the words which you really want to say. I will not be that objective diplomatic cool person anymore. I will declare it to the whole universe.. IT SUCKS ! I'm a scriptwriter myself, and how I just suffer to find a director or a producer whom wants to make my little foolish work. And now I watch this trash which is unbelievably the rock-bottom, the lowest known level of foolishness and they DID it !! That would make me so angry for sure ! I think it happened like this : there was one idiot writer director who convinced some idiot producers to make such a CRAP ! Well, it's the story of every day, but in this stupid situation it didn't make my day ! It's a wicked formula, a bad recipe, a silly song they played the way a crazy D.G might play : a lot of pure violent killing scenes, some kind of unlikeness in putting it (by flash backs !?), some strong premise in the end to make everything look good for that thickhead critics !However now I'm no one but a very poor viewer who watched that and HATED it so much. I didn't (as a viewer) find anything to love or to enjoy (Willem Dafoe as a whore !?.. Oh God.. That was so horrible !). I didn't (as a writer) find anything to be happy about !. And finally I didn't (as an unspoken critic) find that decent thing to talk about in here (the war of the minority's gangs, the achievement of the lost equity as a mission from God, the media's mania over those saint killers who never kill an innocent human ???) Get out of here !.. Give me a break !.. Are you kidding me ?!! Just imagine how funny this movie would be if any censorship wants to delete the (F) ward or the (S) word out of it ! That would help it to be a lot funnier (BEEP BEEP all the time !). Or let the Chinese people take the movie and play with it like (Steve Oedekerk) did with (Hu hao shuang xing - 1977) in his movie (Kung Pow: Enter the Fist - 2002) to make a Chinese comic copy of (The Boondock Saints) that should make it better, a real useful thing! I get sick with putting an Opera singing or music in the background of the killing scenes in any cheap movie now to project a sense of holiness or as an epitaph for human civilization, or to imitate (Stanley Kubrick) in (A Clockwork Orange - 1971) or anything ! Finally if this movie wants by his very weak ending to make a satire for the American system which creates such a bloody phenomenon or the media which glorifies it in unintentional way, then (by its very own logic) this movie is one of those ceremonials of those killers or a crime in itself especially with this long free show of executions and corpses is on without a solid meaning, without a serious study for such disturbed men or society. It's a silly rough video game which tried to be a diligent satire and turned out to be a foolish video game and a fabricated satire ! So it's not that meaningless movie, it's a meaningless movie which alleges that it actually has a meaning, and that's the worst kind ! I'm sad to say it.. but I'll say it : I've seen uglier. but this is even the ugliest !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film serves a great purpose: whenever someone tells me that they love Boondock Saints, I feel justified in ignoring everything else they have to say about cinema. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. The only people that have ever said anything positive about this movie have been highschoolers that don't know anything about cinema.This movie isn't entertaining to me, but that's a subjective claim. This movie also happens to be completely unoriginal. It's about vigilante justice (70s crime movies anyone? Dirty Harry? French Connection? They all do it better.). It's about Irish-Catholic violence in Boston (even though it came afterwards, Gangs of New York portrays this theme more powerfully). It has characters marked with meaningful tattooes (Belly, Memento). It includes a cross-dressing detective (David Duchovny in Twin Peaks? What was that, 15 years earlier?). It depicts prayers before murder (Godfather Trilogy, Pulp Fiction). This movie was so unremarkable and derivative that I can't even remember more things to criticize.On a final note, it's just not a cool movie. The things that the filmmakers and the appreciative audiences think are cool are just not. The violence is sluggishly portrayed. The gay detective is just a caricature of an emphatic queen (unlike Gay Perry in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). The whole movie sucks. There is nothing to like about this that hasn't been done a million times better in other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie perfectly fails in giving an impulse to think about taking law into own hands. Don't get me wrong, I knew it was a crime/action movie. Does this mean, no criticism needed? It claims to be neutral in the end, but through the hole story it sympathizes with the poor handsome men who kill for a better world. My first opinion was, it is intended to see the main actors with sympathy, I waited for these guys to turn bad. Instead you watch them enjoy it to kill, still they are cool, funny, loving brothers and we should be entertained. I liked the nonlinear storytelling, but what does it help with this stupid story? Even Defoe looks awful in such a dumb role with this senseless habits and disgusting opinion. Create a REALLY bad character, let him be executed and let people watch it: in fact, many of us are enjoying this, there is no other reason for black and white hollywood. No other reason for high ranking of "The Boondock Saints" either. At least, quite a BAD right-party propaganda movie.</fullReview>

This is a movie that appeals to disgusting bottom-feeders. You can tell that the person who wrote it never graduated high school.The acting is sooo bad. Willem Defoe, listening to music, while walking around the crime scene, at the beginning of the movie, was almost worth seeing this garbage: You will laugh so hard your stomach will hurt. Actually, there's another crime scene investigation, almost as funny as the first: Defoe gets so worked up that he sweats, tears his shirt and fires his gun in the air- AT A CRIME SCENE! My friends and I laughed so hard we were all crying. It was so bad.Even the action scenes are so ridiculous that people stand in plain view, 15 feet away of each other, shoot for 30 seconds straight and no one gets shot! Also the 'saints/nazis' walk in to a courthouse with guns by throwing the bag that's carrying them over a metal detector! It's so stupid that it's hilarious!The writing is horrible! You can tell that troy duffy isn't a very intelligent person. He believes...get this (LOL!): that having people go around killing drug dealers, etc, is a good thing! He obviously has never read any books on poverty or crime. As I mentioned earlier, there's a scene where they walk into a courthouse... Well, this movie is so dumb that the 'saints/nazis' kill the accused BEFORE the verdict is even read!! I'm laughing even as I write this!Ok, on the theme: I'll get serious for a second and say that this movie would be supported by neo-nazis. They'd love the message in this film.That's one of the main reasons why I think this is one of the worst movies ever made. Don't let anyone tell you that this movie is anything like Pulp Fiction- IT ISN'T.I'll state again that is movie is FASCIST. It is targeted for bottom-feeding low-lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had To Handcuff My Hands Behind My Back To Be Able To Finish This "film."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints - ReviewOK, I looked up this film here on IMDb to surely see everyone giving this "film" the same type of bad review I am giving it. I was shocked to see that there are many out there who claim to love this film. How can that be? Did I unknowingly fall asleep after the opening credits and dream a really bad movie? I must have for my "dream" had so many things wrong with it. I will have to disagree with some of the people on here and say that in my opinion Willem Dafoe did not do a bad job of acting at all. He was unfortunately just badly directed. I find Mr. Dafoe to be a very skillful actor to be quite honest. The actors who played the two brothers I think did a good job for what they were given as well but that is where the accolades stop. The Italian "funny" guy who joined the brothers as well as the dumb, young detective were the true definition of bad casting and over acting - WAY over acting. I am a fan of Billy Connelly but do not feel this was the right role for him to break his usual comedic ways. Not that I felt he did a bad acting job at all, just that he was not given the on screen time and direction for him to display his talent. I know he has now been cast to reprise his role in All Saints with a more prevalent showing but with such a bad first film and a part two without Mr. Dafoe, I feel Mr.Connelly's talent and time will be wasted with this role. OK, back to bad casting... the rest of the cast was horrible. Yes, that's right I said it! Not just bad... horrible! Do you blame the actors? No, not all. You blame the casting director and the producers for green-lighting their choices. I mean really... Ron Jeremy? Give me a break! If a pretty face like Traci Lords can't successfully make it out of the porn world, what makes you think this hedgehog can? Also, can anyone tell me what making Mr. Dafoes character gay did to help the story? Could he have not been a great detective who enjoyed opera music without having him be gay? All that dancing in the alley and in front of the house was just too much. Shame on you Mr. Duffy! Alright I know I should stop now with this review but cannot as there are so many holes in the story as well. If these two brothers turned themselves in to the police in the beginning for killing those two Russian goons, then why was it so damn hard for anyone to figure out who was killing the REST of the Russian mafia? Supposedly the Boston P.D. in this film is beyond stupid but THAT stupid? I recommend the city of Boston view this movie and consider banning Mr. Duffy from filming there again. So, OK, I'll go along though just for kicks. Boston is stupid and can't figure it out, OK.... but what about Detective Dafoe? So smart yet so naive? It just does not make sense. The only reason in my opinion that the director and writer, Mr. Troy Duffy, plotted it so is only to fill the hour and a half he needed to. This film ended when the brothers walked into the police station. The next hour and fifteen minutes were a waste of film, time (mine included), and money. I read in another persons review that this movie kept them on the edge of their seat. Well, I will have to agree, it did me too but only because I was handcuffed.I hope I have given you a glimpse into this horribly acted, poorly casted, badly written Tarintino rip-off. As much as I have written on it, it is just that, a glimpse. I can only recommend this as a fun venture ... to find some of the many other flaws I did not list. If you are a student of film and action/drama is your calling, then please watch this so you will have an example of what to stay clear of.Thank you for your time and maybe I have possibly stopped you from seeing this and saved you some of yours.Have a great day!

		<shortDescription>Most Over-rated Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't waste your time. While this movie could have potentially provided great jokes, beautifully artistic scenes, and cinemagraphic innovation, it falls into the category of failed Film School projects that simplistic audiences are duped into liking. Ironically enough, the cast is extremely strong and the script was absolutely wonderful. However, the director's abuse of power ruins any merit providing a few ridiculously melodramatic "detective-recreation" scenes by Willem DaFoe coupled with a Cliché'd depiction of our "Hero's" in Church and surrounded by G-dlike figures.Overall, this movie doesn't deserve the cult following it has and provides people an excuse to claim they support something artistic. Unfortunately, bad taste and art go hand in hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7.7/10 (33,989 votes)7.7? Are you people serious? 7.7 for an obscene movie about two blokes with intermittently-disappearing Irish accents galavanting around Boston and executing people in the back of the head while reciting verses from the Bible?I'll remember "Boondock Saints" as being one of the only films that I could not sit through fully. I'd had enough after an hour of the ridiculous premise, the poor acting, and the repeated claims of my friends accompanying me that this movie was "great." Ignore the ubiquitous use of the f-bomb and this is an instantly-forgettable superhero shoot-em-up movie for middle schoolers with an unsettling penchant black nail polish and playing Doom.The following is a brief list of the offenses committed by the director against film-goers with an IQ above 60:1. A man leaps from a the roof of a multi-story apartment building, only to land conveniently on top of a standing bad-guy and continues forth unharmed. 2. The two "heros" are inside an HVAC vent shaft in the ceiling, above a meeting attended by the "bad guys." Predictably, the vent breaks and instead of falling to the floor, our two "heros" are magically tied together by a rope and suspended from the shaft opening, where they emerge victorious in a fire-fight, despite being grossly out-numbered and more vulnerable than a pi?ata at a children's birthday party (which is indicative of the type of people who gave this movie favorable reviews, I suppose). 3. The "heros" are portrayed as champions of moral integrity, despite, you know, killing those that they perceive as depraved by shooting them in the back of the head as they kneel before them, a method of execution and terror that would even make an Iraqi dictator stand and applaud. The Bible verses are a nice touch here--clearly applicable during scenes of cold-blooded murder.This is a terrible, horrendous, ghastly, lewd, appalling film that I would not wish its viewing upon my own worst enemy. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Among the pathways of depravity there lays a mile marker for The Boondock Saints. A film so inertly void of humanity and purpose it rarely saw a theater screen. Although perhaps it should have, the growing number of fans has made this film an alarmingly enormous cult sensation.The plot is a simple vigilante story of two brothers who murder those they see as reprehensible. The fact that they are reprehensible as well is never understood. Masked behind the idea that they are good Irish Catholics, the duo set forth in a violent fury ridding the world of those they deem evil. The detective assigned to apprehend the two is played by Wilem Dafoe in a performance so over the top we forget how good of an actor he really is. And yes, the cop is just as screwed up as the crooks - this is one of those stories. Though he is sent to arrest the wanted men, Dafoe's character is much more interested in making dramatic gestures and compiling evidence while listening to classical music, in a scene of eye-rolling silliness.Along the way the criminal pair pick up a psychotic counterpart who yells a lot and seems so much like the loose cannon they do not need. We learn very little about why the two have set forth on this rampage or where this idiotic third wheel came from, or maybe we do. By this time I had lost any need to pay attention.Following in the ancestry of Tarantino films, The Boondock Saints has the appearance of imitating (badly) a genre on the edge of what is permissible. Because Tarantino's characters utter "nigger" does not give clearance for the word to be used in any random situation. This film as a result comes off as racist, xenophobic, homophobic and certainly doesn't put religion in the best light. If there is anything positive about the film, it does excite the thirteen-year-old thrill to see novel executions involving commodes and kitty cats. But like that feeling the film is at best immaturely titillating and at worst dangerous. .5* out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had to be one of the most unethical movies I've ever seen. The best movies are the ones that make you think about about their message afterward (debate over the premises and conclusion) or the movies that tell their story in a captivating way; Boondock Saints did none of that. It was built up to be just like a Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs but it doesn't come close to those two classics. This movie's underlying message, if universalized, is "anyone who is perceived as bad should be killed in the name of God"; seems to be the same logic that any terrorist would use. It's sick to think that people condone the killing that occurs in this movie. A person may try to argue that any superhero acts in this way but a spiderman, batman, or superman all help people that need it at that time; they also never execute people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there is nothing good about this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film starts with a badly acted &amp; scripted opening credits (which also have no significance to the movie) and then just gets worse and worse. How so many people can give it good reviews I just don't know. It tries to be funny, but none of the jokes are worth even a snigger, they are just crude and childish. All the comparisons to Pulp Fiction are because both films are violent and bloody; however unlike Pulp Fiction the violence here is unsubtle, unnecessary and handled amateurly. Indeed the whole film, from script, to acting, direction, lighting and editing is amateurish (and not in a good way at all). I don't care if it's the directors' first film &amp; they had a tight budget, you can make a good film with a video-phone and match-stick men puppets if you at least have a good script. This sure didn't have a good script. The only thing consistent in this film is how bad it is all through. Actually i'm not sure about that because I could only manage to watch about half of it (and even that much was a real struggle). I've never posted on IMDb (in about 8 years of using it) before but after reading all the praise for this movie felt I had to register and post in the hope I'll save somebody else from wasting time on this drivel. I see (and am frankly amazed) that they are making a sequel, I think it'll be one of the first times a sequel is better than the original movie because I really don't think they could make it any worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it sucks...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film and was ashamed I was Irish. Whether it be the cheesy cliches, the fact that they do everything in unison (EVERYTHING), or the awful dialogue, etc, this proves to be the worst film on the planet. I figured movies like "The Exorcist II: The Heretic" had it taken care of but this takes the cake. The worst part is that it could have been so cool. Irish guys take out Italian mobsters, sickness! Oh no, not this movie, instead we get a couple of pansies hanging from ropes upside down killing people, that may sound cool but it's not. They seem to have perfect aim upside down, but when they shoot at one Russian guy out in the open, no, instead we got stuff flying everywhere and all sorts of crap as Willem Dafoe over does it completely. The worst part is that most of you losers like this movie. I don't get it, what is to be liked. Every actor sucks here, ALL OF THEM. They all need to be butchered for this movie. The script makes no sense either. How can they speak so many languages? The action sucks. The quick cuts and MTV style directing is straight out of the minor leagues. Then we have the two bit s***head mobsters. These guys are more one dimensional than the fans of crap movies like this. I read on the back that fans of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction would like this, no chance in hell. Those movies had witty dialogue, class, and a soul. This movie has bad dialogue, bad directing, and bible preaching. Let's see, choppy directing that sucks, bad actors (except Willem Dafoe who could do nothing with his poorly written part), bad action, awful script (simply putrid), a foolish fan base, one dimensional characters, etc. make this the worst film ever put on film. The only way this film can be used is as a torture device if we capture Saddam. Avoid this trash at all costs unless you want to find out your pain tolerance (which will be high after this). This film makes me want to die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Films I've Ever Seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is not so much a film, as a pastiche of better films. There is not one single element of this production that has not been used before. The writing copies Tarantino to the letter, the "wiseguys" are third rate Scorsese, the Il Duce character is swiped from LEON ("no women, no kids"), the twin brother angle is apparently stolen from THE KRAYS. This film is overwrought with religious iconography (seemly only to add some depth to the shallow characters), pretentious without shame, amateurish, obvious, predictable, confusing and dull. The director, Troy Duffy, steals ideas and set-ups from the following (in general, specifically when indicated): Oliver Stone, Luc Besson (LEON), Gary Fleder (THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD), Peter Medak, Phil Joanou (STATE OF GRACE), Walter Hill, Sam Peckinpah, Antoine Fuqua, Michael Bay (THE ROCK), Michael Mann, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott, Alex Proyas (THE CROW), Robert Rodriguez, John Badham, Michael Winner (DEATH WISH), David Fincher, Guy Ritchie (his "cool" Irish films), Danny Cannon, Bryan Singer (USUAL SUSPECTS), the list goes on and on: Paul Verhoeven, Brian DePalma (THE UNTOUCHABLES), John Frakenhiemer, Quentin Tarantino (as director, PULP FICTION), David Mamet, James Ellroy (author), John Woo would be embarrassed with the amount of slow motion in this film. This is just the short list of the most blatant instances of plagiarism. Duffy imitates the proven techniques of the above mentioned without understanding why they worked in the first place. He has made a carbon copy film of littered cliches and comes across as desperate to make a name for himself.I simply cannot understand the praise this film receives, it is a turgid mess. The "deep moral ramifications" are transparent. You have two guys running around murdering people in cold blood. Has anyone noticed that most of the people they dispatch are unarmed and begging for their lives? The statements that they make are completely ambiguous: if someone shoplifts they're okay, but if they are part of a shoplifting syndicate, they are marked for death? What if they repent and never sin again? How did this ever pass as real film-making? The staged "interviews" under the closing credits only cements the plebian handling of this material. It seems more like a cop-out really; Duffy did not want to admit that he has made a violent, sadistic, empty film simply for his own benefit, but why not? Hollywood is awash with such films, he is only jumping on the band-wagon! Good for him, at least he has found a place to call home. All the fans of this film, do yourselves a favor (before you deify THE BOONDOCK SAINTS), review the work of those mentioned above and read Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment' to understand the taking of another human life from a more literate viewpoint. 0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Film Of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read an announcement for a public screening of this movie at my university and everybody I asked about this movie was full of praise. I think I just asked the wrong people about their opinion. This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Not only does it show incredibly disgusting violence and tons of blood, it tries to excuse it with a `black and white' fanatic religious point of view that there are just `bad' and `good' guys and if the `good' kill the `bad' it's right. No matter if they brutally murder a cat for example during that process. The script is absolutely amateurish and bad, so bad it will make you scream for your money and the time wasted on this atrocity back. There isn't a single sentence in this movie without excessive and dumb vulgarity and bad jokes. The directing and photography rank between `simply amateurish' and `so bad it's funny'. The only famous actor in this movie is Willem Dafoe, and I guess he's praying every night that nobody sees this movie. He plays a smart FBI agent who is same-gender attracted and (surprise, surprise) his character is thrown into nearly every gay stereotype possible. Not a surprise at all, from a movie as feeble-minded as this, can you expect something else? During that process Dafoe gives some ridiculous examples that imitating Tim Curry in the Rocky Horror Picture Show can a)go completely wrong and b)can go just more wrong when it's out of place and just to feed the stereotypes of a silly script obviously aimed on a certain audience, that, to my great sorrow, does seem to exist. My verdict: `The Worst Movie Of All Time' just seems to be right for this one. It's always frustrating to see that a movie like `Plan 9 From Outer Space', whose only failure is the lack of budget and that otherwise has a complex statement and very good directing is labelled `The Worst Film Of All Time' and movies like `Boondock Saints' are not. Who is the guy whom we have to thank for this monstrosity? I just hope someone stops him from throwing his disgusting and sick fantasies obviously heavily influenced by a sick fetish for weapons and violence at us. Besides, there seem to be plans for a sequel. To quote Plan 9: `May God help us in the future!'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie ripped off every other film ever made, including "The Care Bears Christmas"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't attempt to argue the ethics of vigilantism. I would like to point out that this movie did not pioneer the concept. Here is a short list of films which have also touched on the idea. This is not nearly all of them, but it's a highlight of the ones produced in English, mostly in the USA, in the last 40 years.The Punisher, Batman, Spiderman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, every other comic book hero (give or take)[******The Dynamite Brothers (1974)*******"Two brothers accomplished in the martial arts take on a vicious drug lord." &lt;--- sound familiar?]Every movie ever made starring Steven Seagal, Charles Bronsen, or Clint Eastwood. Taxi Driver, The Untouchables, The Annihilators, The Limey, The Brotherhood of Justice, Falling Down, Road House, Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Out for Blood, Outside the law, Above the Law, Extreme Justice, Instant Justice, Street Justice, Streets of fire, Fighting Back, Walking Tall, Body Count, Death Wish, Raw Deal, Next of Kin, Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except, Vigilante, Urban Menace, DaVinci's War, El Mariachi, Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Lethal Weapon, Only the Strong, When the Bullet Hits the Bone, Ms 45, Angel Town, Sin City, Rush HourI found almost nothing in this movie to be original. What was up with "Captain Highliner" the F***ING fish stick killer? AKA "The Ghost". Not only does he reek of Sean Connery in "The Rock" (another movie you could add to the list) but his tactics were Neanderthal, some expert killer! He can't even ambush with a sniper rifle or ask the mafia for a bomb. And what's up with that anyway, working for the mafia? Isn't he one of the morally "shit don't stink", "chosen ones"? He obviously doesn't need much evidence to justify the killing of a "bad person" because if he were a little more skilled then he'd have killed those three idiots before having a chance to find out who they are or what they've done.At least in "The Rock" Sean Connery was released from prison under the authority of high ranking government officials. How does this movie explain the release of said "Ghost"? That the mafia can have anyone they want released from maximum security prison on a moments notice? Well thought out, in fact bravo on no plot holes throughout the movie.The brother's little Latin Bible quote before shooting (only the main target, who they were lucky wasn't taking careful aim on them as they had to leave him to last) strikes me as a rip off of Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction. There are so many more direct and indirect rip offs I won't bother mentioning them.OK so I'm gonna tackle vigilantism a little. If anyone is allowed to be a vigilante, then each individual is left to decide if they are intelligent, informed, and perceptive enough to judge who deserves to die. Assuming we can agree that some people deserve to die for their crimes there is still the issue that... STUPID PEOPLE MAKE BAD DECISIONS AND WILL KILL THE WRONG PEOPLE!During a wave of publicity in Britain around year 2000 about paedophiles, the public media reported these cases where vigilantes took action against the wrong people. Likely there were other cases which went unpublicized:-* A man with the same surname as a known paedophile in the same area. (2 cases)* A man who lived in a house where a known paedophile lived before.* A paediatrician, because his job title starts with the same 4 letters (3 letters in USA spelling), and uneducated confusion due to use of a slang word "paedo" for "paedophile".Then there is the issue of killing for God in a society that has many different religions. Even if you adhere strictly to the ethics provided by the Christian Bible, you may be committing crimes in the opinions of the members of other religions. If one doesn't think that this is important then they are inviting RELIGIOUS WAR! And it is the attitude of vigilantism that propagates war around the world because any party that has a crime committed against them feels justified in committing crimes in retribution (Bush). The retribution is considered a crime by the party it is committed upon, worthy of retribution. I think it's easy to see that there can be only one end to such a cycle, do as Jesus suggested and "Turn the other cheek". It's an ancient concept that if one lowers themselves to the level of what they consider wrong in order to defeat that wrong, they will simply become part of that wrong.Then there is the small matter of a grey area. What about people that have only committed 51% of the crimes needed to fully deserve death?</fullReview>

Based on what he said, I thought it sounded pretty good. A movie about two brothers who become local heroes by defending their town against mobsters can't be all bad, right?WRONG. This is the WORST MOVIE EVER. I don't know why there are so many positive comments about it. Honestly, how could this many people watch it and not realize how stupid it is? I suspect some people have been paid to write this stuff.First of all, the director apparently has no idea what type of movie he's making. Is it an action flick? A drama? A comedy? Who knows!? You could turn this into a game of Guess the Genre: every time it feels like it's settling down into a certain mood, try to guess which completely different mood it will swing into next! Hint : you can tell a genre switch is coming up whenever the soundtrack switches from traditional Irish folk music to electric guitar.Add some incredibly bad acting, Willem DaFoe as an unrealistically gay FBI agent (or an "unorthodox" agent as the back cover puts it), blatant Quentin Tarantino rip-offs, and a stupid plot about a couple of dorks who kill in the name of God, and you have got yourself one seriously bad movie.

This is a film that is much adored by a certain type of unknowing film goer who expects little and gets little from a movie going experience. if you are a serious film goer skip this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You know something's wrong when the making-of documentary is more compelling than the film itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate this movie. Not just dislike, but hate. And trust me, this is an exclusive category. A blow-hard named Troy Duffy, who fancied himself to be much more clever than he actually is and whose knowledge of cinema stretched back only roughly ten years, decided to try his hand at a Tarantino-like action flick, except on a smaller scale. Even more pale in comparison than the budget however is the talent involved. Duffy has no skill as a screenwriter or director. For some inexplicable reason, this has gained a huge cult following among undiscriminating teenage boys who are unfamiliar with roughly sixty years of crime cinema. Hopefully the next generation sees this for the crap it is.Why do I hate this film? Mainly, its the most vapid attempt at aping Tarantino I've seen, and thats saying a lot. Duffy forgets that action isn't what made "Reservoir Dogs" great, but the characters and dialog. Duffy attempts to fashion quirky characters with witty dialog, but doesn't have either the intelligence or cleverness needed. So he loads the film with much violence, which becomes repetitive fast. Secondly, the gay detective character. Willem Dafoe can be amazing, but this is an alarmingly one-note portrayal (he does what he can with the horrible material). It wasn't daring for Duffy to include an non-stereotypical gay character in a mindless action flick, because the character's homosexuality is simply used to shock the audience who didn't see it coming. In my mind, its as offensive as "Boat Trip". Finally, the fan base. If this film didn't have the huge cult following, I'd just simply think this a bad film and nothing more. However, the films mindless fans seem to worship it because they're unfamiliar with the material Duffy blatantly rips off. The film was hyped up as one of the coolest action films ever made, but honestly I don't see much difference between it and the rest of the Steven Segal / Jean-Claude Van Damme direct to video crap. Instead, check out "Overnight", which is a compelling documentary that shows Duffy for the unappealing and moronic individual he is. Or better yet, just watch a Tarantino film instead. Whatever you do, avoid "The Boondock Saints". (1/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for "igiots"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure what an "igiot" is. Perhaps, some Irish idiom, but I'm guessing it's more likely an idiot who can't type (see below).I tend to only write about movies I love or I hate and I hated this one. Actually I feel sort of cheated. I rented this movie based on the IMDb rating, which more often than not is reliable. I'm not sure what happened here. I like Willem Dafoe and he doesn't do a bad job; but my God there are a litany of unbelievable events that make this thing pretty tedious to watch. It's not the acting that is bad - it's that the plot is chocked full of gaping holes in logic. And, movies don't have to be completely logical for me to like them, but at least they should make sense within the storyline.I am curious who these people are that liked this thing. Movies like Armageddon and Godzilla have more cogent stories. Are there that many victims of lobotomies running around? I suggest if your synapses are firing normally stay away from this piece of offal. But,if you like this check out "The Cube," "The Forgotten," "Changing Lanes" and "The Last Castle" - four other similarly inane movies. "Boondock Saints" is stupid beyond belief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can almost guarantee you that any movie featuring Ron Jeremy is going to be sub-par on a number of levels. This is no exception - this movie nails about every cliché that hack writers have been working hard to create in the last decade. After being around film students for the last decade, I can assure you that this movie has been written hundreds of times by kids who have seen Pulp Fiction a dozen times too many. How this specific version was made beats me, but I can only assume that the director had a trust fund or slept with a Coppola. (Well, maybe more like an Arquette) You'll see dream sequences with slow motion rain, a detective who listens to opera while solving crimes, an insane madman in a Hannibal Lecter cage, a multitude of racial stereotypes... all infused with religion and extreme violence. Worst of all, the film (almost offensively) attempts to answer serious social questions in the end - in the lamest way possible, of course. I won't spoil it, but I'll say that any movie that ends with interviewing people on the street has failed to make its point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Boondock Saints" possesses one of the most despicable and putrid hearts of any movie I have ever seen. The film exalts the MacManus brothers as a couple of death angels, exempt from the laws of God they so mercilessly impose on others. Far from the truth, the brothers are sadistic and frightening, less human than the criminals and drug dealers they kill with staggering enjoyment. I find it truly horrific that people could actually believe these boys are doing the right thing, as if fulfilling some holy edict. In their quest to rid the world of evil, they reveal their own relentless bloodthirst and show themselves to be true avatars of evil - those that kill under the guise of goodness (like the Nazis). A film condemning these two would be fine but this film seems to wholeheartedly believe in their deluded divine right. Worse yet, the film is very poorly made. Except for Willem Dafoe's oddly fascinating turn in drag, the acting is uniformly one-note, the plot deficient, the dialogue leaden, the action scenes preposterous, the climax ineffectual and the directing stilted. The coup de grace of this immoral mess comes at the very end, where, after what seems like hours of die-hard nihilistic conviction, the director throws in a few interview scenes to muddle the message. He probably thought this was the perfect coda to elevate the story into a realm of public thought. Instead, these final scenes betray his disguise, and the entire film, as amateurish moral posturing.</fullReview>

The whole thing is sophomoric in the extreme and not in a good fun way but in a retarded, arrested development way. It's so bland and badly directed that I couldn't differentiate the actors from the sets.

		<fullReview>Having seen the high rating on IMDb and read the comparisons to Tarantino's work, I questioned how it could have slid under my radar screen. Now I know. For probably only the third time in my life, I actually couldn't watch the entire film. It was that lame. Poor acting, bad writing and aimless script aside, the film's worst sin is how badly it wants to be cool/funny/stylish and how miserably short it falls of that goal. The tattooed, hard-drinking, wise-cracking anti-heroes. The gay FBI agent who gyrates to Italian opera as he combs crime scenes (nice disc player, by the way). The Ron Jeremy cameo. The only remotely entertaining bit was when Rocco copped a feel off the passed-out stripper. Everything else - yawn. Anyone who thinks this even remotely resembles Pulp Fiction must have had a lobotomy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realise a lot of people like this movie, but I have a really hard time understanding why. The script is clichéd and absurd, the fight scenes resemble a slapstick comedy, the acting is thoroughly amateurish and the direction is clumsy.However, the real problems with this movie are two things 1) The bizarre central theme that promotes vigilante justice without exploring any of the negative side effects and 2) The seeming intention of the film makers to insult every minority group they can think of with ridiculous stereotypes, overblown accents and awkward set pieces, the crowning glory of which is the final montage.This movie came highly recommended to me, but it played out like a seriously second rate knock off of the much better "Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels". Even the usually awesome Billy Connelly failed to raise this film, as his legendary comedic talents went completely unused.</fullReview>

So I eventually had some free time and headed out to my friends house to check it out.Big Mistake.Before the film even started they were telling me "Man you're gonna love it!" and "Dude this movie is soooooo badass!" and "Wait until you see this one scene, its so damn cool!" I'd to put part of the blame on my friends over-hyping as to why the movie was terrible, but thats just not the case. The acting was absolutely awful, the characters weren't even close to developed, and the plot was so trite that it hurt to watch. Even if I had been told that the film was absolutely terrible I would have still been shocked. The only reason people think they like the film is because of the violence, but I am 100% honest when I tell you that the best violence in the world could not help this awful movie.This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you hear from your friends about how great it is you need to do two things 1) punch your friend in the eye for supporting this garbage and 2) run away and hide to avoid watching this terrible piece of crap.</fullReview>

This movie was awful in every regard. I can see people calling it a cult film for the so bad it is good reason, but calling it classic and original is miles away from the truth.You name it this film did it terribly. It was terribly directed by newcomer Troy Duffy. Every seen almost came off as comic unintentionally and inserting the religious message made this film even more bad(not that I have anything against religion). This movie is an abomination to religion. The Pope would be vomiting. This might have been one of the worst editing jobs I have ever seen. It is so annoying. I can imagine the director going " ooh I want to be cool like Tarantino and make it time twisting." Give me a break. The acting had nothing to offer. I found the two leads to be not very good and miscast. The scene that tries to be poetic( trust me, you will know) had a very good idea go to complete waste. The action scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen in my life. It is too painful too describe. The film arrives at one of the dumbest conclusions ever. Please, let the sequel get caned.Never see this movie.</fullReview>

The cops are utter fools, the main guy on the case is some homosexual FBI agent who listens to opera on headphones while investigating crime scenes (he closes his eyes to "take in" the music), and our two heroes recite Bible verses before shooting someone execution style. If you think that last one is dramatic, don't. They sound more like two buffoons than any kind of divine force of justice. In fact, they are the most irritating duo of good-hearted criminals since Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. They also speak over four languages, because they "paid attention in school." If you're looking for a serious film dealing with villains turning to unwitting heroes, watch "Pulp Fiction," which this film amply "references" quite often. (In one scene a character "accidentally" shoots a cat -- cue exclamations of surprise by teenage audience.) Otherwise, skip this ridiculous film and ignore the praise given it. Only testosterone-charged fifteen-year-olds and grown men whose emotional development corresponds to one would ever be impressed by this tripe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been told this film's gained something close to cult status over the past 6 years and I fail to see why. The main problem lies in Dafoe's character, who descends into an outrageous cross-dressing cartoon once he begins to sympathize with the boys. Woefully thin stuff--- because this isn't a comedy and it's certainly not a murder mystery (making a "spoiler" virtually impossible). Plot-wise, it just plain sucks. Technically, there's some slightly redeeming aspects. The camera work is very good and there's a visually clever insertion of Dafoe placing himself in the midst of a crime scene. The casting of chubby porn star Ron Jeremy (Hyatt) as a Russian (?) mafioso is less than inspired--- he's more cartoony than Dafoe. And amid the script that goes nowhere, there's one or two well-written lines but ultimately, this is a complete waste of time. This goes up near the top of my list of all-time worst movies. Awful!</fullReview>

I have no idea how "Boondock Saints" ever got produced, but it makes me believe that getting a film made in this country isn't about talent, or a good script, or decent acting or directing, but rather, who you meet or know.

After you watch the first five minutes of this "movie," trust your instincts that tell you to stop what you're doing and go do anything else! You don't have to know much about movies or have much taste to realize that a five-year-old could do a better job with a home camera.

		<shortDescription>An exercise in Puerility</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel film deserves to be regarded as an art form on level with music and literature. If this is the case, Boondock Saints is the Nelly and Harry Potter of the film world in its intense popularity in the face of its undeniable lack of any redemptive depth of intellectual appeal. Pretence is the name of the game as far as this stinker is concerned and it fails in several regards: Plot, acting/writing, and direction. Basically everything that matters in a movie, this flick doesn't have. As far as the plot goes I have three big beefs (be forewarned, I will probably disclose elements of the paltry plotlines in this review):1) The two brothers are devout Catholics, but spend most of the movie cursing and killing which are decidedly nonChristian activities. I hate to nitpick, but the Christian element is such a big part of the story that you can't help but question the dubiousness of ending your prayers not with `Amen' but with shooting someone's face off. 2) The entire moral element, which forms the basis of appeal for this movie, is compromised by the fact that the retribution is effected through unrepentant mass murder. Practicing Christians like the characters in Boondock Saints ought to remember that `vengeance is the Lord's' and anyone with a brain ought to realize that there's no moral lesson in killing. 3) The whole storyline is a big can of creamed corn. From the pointlessly gay detective joining forces with the vigilantes, to the mafia's secret weapon (seeming pulled out of the Troy Duffy's butt halfway through the script), to the fact that he's their father, to the ending courtroom scene, this is unmitigatedly corny.When it comes to the writing Troy Duffy and basically every actor needs to learn the lesson that incessant screaming does not constitute dialogue. This seems perfectly obvious and yet it seems that when the boys aren't killing something they're screaming their lungs out about something else. And when neither of these is occurring, we are beholden to vapid attempts a witty dialogue, the punch lines to which can be sited from miles away. As for the direction, Duffy could stand to learn much regarding what I've already touched on, but I may as well mention the incessant awkwardness of so much of this movie. There's the pointless confessional booth scene, the cat scene (see `Pulp Fiction'), Willem Dafoe's dancing (and seduction of men), basically everything is awkward and mindless in this crapfest.Anyone, religious or not, ought to recognize the internal contradiction of the entire premise this movie based on. To make matters worse it isn't well acted, well written, or even edited well.Do yourself a favor and temper your cinematic taste with the tried and true: Casablanca for the fantastic dialogue, Annie Hall for the humor, Citizen Kane for the direction, Lawrence of Arabia for the visuals, The Sting for the flawless delivery, the world of film has so much more to offer. Watch any of these, then come back and see what you think about the latest flavor of the week movie.</fullReview>

And poor, poor Willem Dafoe. From Jesus Christ, Max Schreck, to a homophobic gay dectective who must wears drag in a ruse that Mr. Magoo would have trouble not figuring out.The pace of this film is leaden as molasses. The tone is of revelation; look how cool all this is! Look how smart and hip I am! scenes seem to proclaim. Come on, didn't someone tap this clown on the shoulder and tell him the post-Tarantino hip-gangster sthick was trite 6 years ago?QT gave us his words, Woo gave us his melodrama, Rodriguez gave us his exuberence, Scorsese his images, Besson his sense of cool.

Then there is Willem Dafoe, a gay FBI agent, who seems like a rejected character from "Twin Peaks." He is, of course, partnered with a crusty local cop who doesn't like him, yet in the end comes to respect him. Awwww! Gee, I've never seen that before in a bad cop movie! His role is to flounce around and re-enact the boys' shooting sprees while swooning to opera music. It's worse than it sounds. And of course, the local crime families can't stop them so they get together to hire some out-of-town heavy hitter with no name &amp; a mysterious past. Could his mysterious past connect with the orphaned brothers??? Gee, I wonder! Could the boys be caught at the end and the hard-working people of Boston rally around them? Ugh.

		<fullReview>The laughingly bad scene of how the two brothers help each other escape the Russian mafia lair after they're held captive is like a case of a bad director without a budget or creativity, so it just cuts to flashbacks all the time as a failed means to plug in the huge holes. (Then again, there are so many bad scenes like this its like a cross between Death Wish and Plan Nine from Outer Space.) Although one area that Plan Nine didn't have was shameless product placement. Did you see so many Pepsi cans being drunk at the breakfast table by these two Boondock "Sugar Saints?" How apparent was it that the director Troy Duffy (who does a horrible cameo appearance of himself at the Irish bar in the beginning of the movie, acting like an ugly midget from a gay porno movie) blew the money for the film on partying and ended up with half the time of the film just of guys getting drunk on camera and shouting the f-word louder and louder (like ornery obnoxious drunks, which is what Troy must have been while making this abomination of a stinker). If you're searching for a good movie in this much, watch "Overnight," the documentary on the making of the film which shows Troy Duffy's ego running havoc and he's reduced to yelling at himself while flat-down drunk on a street corner.Sure there's some of his paid people that come on here and now try to sell it as a cult film (more like Jonestown Cult). They've also been talking for years of a sequel, although the only appropriate actors for the directorial phlegm that Duffy dishes would be to have the "Saints" replayed by Tom Green in a "Freedie got Fingered" style role, whipping out his member and Troy trying to find some Gaelic-orchestral music with bad gun blanks to make it seem divine.</fullReview>

On St Patrick's day, a group of Russian mobsters start hassling their friend and they two intervene. After a series of events the fraternal twins set out to rid Boston of the scum and criminals. During their "cleansing" FBI detective Paul Smecker tries to track them down.I found the movie a fun, humorous movie with a original story, i also like how the story ended and i thought most of the acting was top notch. The problems i have with this movie is one: the accents of the "Irish brothers" aren't very well done, but being Irish i will notice the accents quicker than someone from anywhere else. Although its not that bad, the film uses weird fade outs when transitioning between scenes which can be very distracting.Otherwise i thought this movie was very enjoyable and would recommend.</fullReview>

Some films you initially dislike, yet they grow on you gradually until you see them in a new light. Some films you are crazy about right off the bat, yet over time the attraction dims and you realize you don't really care for them anymore. And then there's this one. While I can't say I've grown to dislike it, because that's just not the case, I will concede that as I've gotten older and new information on it has crossed my path, I've come to regard it in a new light. Also, the parts of my personality which went ape crazy for anything pulpy and crime ridden back then have receded a bit as my tastes matured. But try as I might, I can't bring myself to completely see it in a negative light, despite recognizing certain negative aspects of it which were once not so obvious to me. Saints is a tricky film because on the one hand you have the rabid fans who make up the cult following and have brought it the infamy it has today, as well as it's sequel, which is really not that great. On the other hand you have the lofty monarchy of high film criticism, bashing it six ways to Sunday, the bad taste of it's conception and production still on their tongues. Recently I watched the documentary Overnight (a biased film with its own glaring issues, but that's another story), which chronicles the meteoric rise and fall of director Troy Duffy, who foolishly squandered a gift horse with immature and selfish behaviour, or at least that's what the film shows. The film had the potential to be a big budget flick with huge stars involved and the backing of Weinstein. That never happened. Duffy's ego swiftly sent the script into oblivion, until it finally got made years later for less than half the original offered budget, and landed in film purgatory before being squeaked into a meager distribution. A tragedy, say some. But.. is it though? Fate is a strange beast, and if everything went according to plan, we'd have a slick studio monster that might have been good, and no choppy, unique cult favourite to gain unprecedented momentum decades after its chaotic birth. Some food for thought. Anywho, on to the film. It's low budget for sure and one can tell it's made by a guy who's never directed before, but it's got a silly, cartoonish charm and cinematic flair for style that will keep you watching. Two rowdy Irish brothers named Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) accidentally kill some scary Russian mob soldiers in one of the most inventive scenes ever staged, and they discover they have a spiritual affinity for knocking off evil men. So, with no tactical experience whatsoever, they set out on a mission from God to end the lives of the Boston criminal underworld. Dragging their hapless, lovable buddy Rocco (David Della Rocco) along, its only a matter of time before the law tags them, and soon they have loony FBI honcho Paul Smecker after them. Willem Dafoe has to be seen to be believed in what is a career weirdest for him. He plays it like the Joker crossed with Bugs Bunny, never allowing an ounce of restraint or subtlety into the performance. I'd be interested to see the actor/director relationship which led to getting something this zany in the can. Smecker struggles morally, part of him believing the Saints to be a necessary force. They are faced with Italian mafia bosses including a scuzzy Ron Jeremy and Carlo Rota as Giuseppe 'Pappa Joe' Yakavetta, a ham fisted Don who wants the Saints gone. Rota is the only one who comes close to matching Dafoe's maniacal energy, playing Yakavetta to unhinged, mustache twirling delight. Reedus and Flanery hold up their end with physicality and quite a lot of energy, making the McManus brothers two fun protagonists to hang around with. Billy Connolly shows up as Il Duce, an almost invincible assassin from hell who proves to be quite the obstacle for our boys. The concept for the film is relentlessly juvenile, and the action set pieces veer into silliness quite a bit and there's a slapdash, haphazard feel to the whole thing, an unfinished varnish, or lack thereof to the whole process. It's just such lurid, reckless fun though, filled with excessive profanity, comic book violence, laughable religious symbolism and deeply questionable morals that seem to have been penned by an eighth grader who's just completed a John Woo and Charles Bronson marathon back to back. This is a movie that loves the fact that it's a movie and acts accordingly, throwing everything it can get its hands on at you and yelling " Look! Look how cool I am". Is it cool? Up to you. It's certainly one you won't forget about. It almost ducks the 'good film' litmus test in the sense that you'd be wasting breath in claiming it's a bad movie. It couldn't care less about that, and the fans, of which I have to say I still am, seem not to either. It's not really good, bad, terrible or anything. It's just The Boondock Saints.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Movie of All time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows the action that we all wish we could take up against evil. Not to mention the concept behind good people doing nothing. I am a huge Willam DaFoe fan because of this movie. The inner struggle of Willam's character has you pulled throughout the entire movie. I also became fans of all the actors as well as reinforcing my love for Billy Connolly. My favorite part of the movie is the brothers relationship and watching it show itself piece by piece.I was blown away by this movie and the feeling is always there no matter how many times I watch it. Because of the complexity and beautifully developed story line as well as action, this movie is my #1 movie of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard that this was a good movie. The truth is that is a stupid movie and even employs a porn actor. The acting was very bad. The story line was stupid. I guess it was supposed to be a comedy but it failed at that. It was supposed to be an action movie but it failed at that. If you are really drunk you may like the movie but do not waste your time watching this. It has no redeeming value. Vigilante, not really. The music is the worst I have heard and the one who chose the songs in my opinion should be fired from his position. This movie is so lame that I had to turn it off after 30 minutes waiting for it to get interesting or even funny. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here starts the journey of the Mcmanus brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints stars Norman Reedus and Sean Flanery. I believe this movie started millions of girls obsession over Norman Reedus, while the rest of the girls started during The Walking Dead. But anyway...Connor and Sean Mcmanus are fraternal Irish brothers who have an epiphany happen to them which convinces them to go on a mission from God to stop criminals living in their town. They are joined by David Della Rocco who plays himself as Rocco. They are being chased by a FBI agent named Paul Smecker.Now while this movie won't win any big rewards, it does have many positive points. The cast is great with Sean and Norman having great chemistry with each other. Willem Dafoe plays Paul Smecker and is great in his role.I just couldn't get around David Della Rocco's character. It seems to be he didn't have to be in the movie in the first place as this was more focused on the brothers.I liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone. Of course, all the girls will love this movie, but I know a lot of guys loved this too. Troy Duffy has made a sequel since then and once I watch that, I will review it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the first time I saw this movie I was 17. Everyone all knows Norman Reedus now but seriously I think my only actor crush has never changed. The thrill, the emotion, the realness of all the actors made this an amazing work of art. And my fa part still to this day is when Rocco ask if the cat was dead loll Thank you guys for making this awesome movie and if by chance Mr. Reedus looks at this, you will always be my bad as guy of the year :) I can look back and think of all the times my friends and I sat around watching this movie, over and over again. Makes me at times wish I could be an important person so I could meet these colorful actors in person, but then again simplicity in my life works very well loll. Again great movie, a must see</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Questions?No explanation for why Duce was able to track The Saints.Duce shows up twice without explanation. Once when the Saints finish executing Rocco's personal grudge, and once near the end when they go to end Papa Joe. How did he know where they would be? Duce remains, in my opinion, a huge question mark. It left me wanting more. This could be a good thing, but if you're going to hang up the story for ten years before making a sequel, then perhaps it's a bad thing. Wiser men than me must make that distinction. Like you?.Killers versus Saints?That was the main push of the movie, and we lived it through Paul. We experienced his anguish and frustration to determine what was right and what was wrong. Strangely, if it hadn't have been for the priest, Paul might never have taken that corner, and possibly neither would we. Because of what that priest said, at gun point, we could all see that what they were doing? Must be right.Why do they know a ton of Languages?It didn't further the story, or contribute to it. It simply gave everyone the impression that they were intelligent. Further justifying their insane actions. It glorified them, and added more mystery. At some point during the movie, the Saints claim that their mother forced them to learn as many languages as possible.Mother, plus Duce, plus tattoos, plus meat packing jobs, plus a homosexual detective that doesn't like gay people. The film never stops throwing questions at us that it never answers.ConclusionI have mixed feelings. The first time I saw this flick, I was awestruck. Such style, such innocence. I could see myself becoming a crime fighter, anyone could. Food for a wonderful daydream.http://www.primarilycritical.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Connor and Murphy, two Irish brothers in Boston, accidentally kill a couple of mob thugs. They turn themselves in to the Boston PD, but are released and hailed as heroes.After healing up and getting more equipment from friendly sources, the brothers start killing mobsters deliberately. They take more than a bit of care in laying out the corpses, placing coins on their eyes, and policing the scene.Agent Smecker, a gay FBI agent specialising in organised crime, deconstructs the crime scenes and soon suspects the brothers. He's in a quandary for a while because the crime figures are the very people he would otherwise want to put behind bars.After a time, they run with Rocco, who is not quite so careful as the brothers. After a shootout with Il Duce, Smecker collects a finger, and the DNA points to Rocco.The confessional scene with Rocco, the father, Connor, and Smecker was hilarious. Afterward, Connor calls Smecker and tells him there will be big nasty meeting.Will the brothers survive this one, or will the mob finally triumph? Can Smecker get things under control? -----Scores-----Cinematography: 10/10 Just fine.Sound: 10/10 Also no problems.Acting: 8/10 Willem Dafoe was great. Flanery and Reedus were fine in their roles. Most of the other players were competent.Screenplay: 8/10 The story has some holes for believability, but it does move right along, and the quandary of the FBI agent is interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah I know I'm showing off but I met the two main leads in the flesh and even as Norman Reedus is famous for The Walking Dead nowadays still people are standing in cue to meet the famous Boondock Saint. Can anybody telling me what i am missing about this hyped flick. The only thing we see is that the two youngsters are only out for justice and are killing the bad ones. Sure, there are a few good things to say about the script. It's well done, seeing how the police thinks how the killings happened and then showing how it was done and after a while we actually see the deed with the copper looking how they are killing people but it surely isn't a Pulp Fiction (1994). It is brutal in some ways and I was looking out for the more bizarre Rocco (David Della Rocco) who sometimes really goes bonkers. Those are the most gory and funny parts and did remind me of Pulp Fiction, remember the car scene were the gun goes off without wanting it, here we do have it with a cat. Teenagers will adore this brutal flick but I'm not afraid to say that I didn't found it that great. The acting on the other hand was great especially Willem Dafoe (Paul Smecker) was wonderful, as always.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The question of vigilantism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about the vigilante that we as a society actually like, and it is interesting that there are many pieces of literature that are based around a central character who is actually a vigilante. I was going to suggest that most superhero comic books are like that, but while I am not big on comics, I do realise that a lot of them are part of some government organisation (such as the Avengers from Marvel Comics and the Justice League of America from DC comics). However, there are two superheroes that clearly are vigilantes and we are quite familiar with both of them ? Batman, and Spiderman.This film is about a couple of Irish boys who, after an altercation with the Russian Mafia, decide to become vigilantes and go about executing all evil men in Boston. They start off with the Russian Mafia, but after a good friend of their's gets set up by the mob, they decide to use his inside knowledge to track down and eliminate every member in Boston.One of the things that this film highlights is the restraints that the law enforcement officers have when it comes to dealing with crime. Even if they manage to locate and arrest the head of a crime family, their connections, and their wealth, is generally enough to keep them out of gaol. However, vigilantes have no such restrictions, and I guess that is why people appeal to them ? namely because they hunt down evil men and seek to make society a better place.The only problem is by what authority does the vigilante have to determine the guilt or innocence of another person. Certainly a lot of people they deal with have long sordid histories, but if they are simply going on the information of a single person, even if that single person is a friend, what is there to say that this information is actually correct, and that the friend is not using them to settle some old scores? The problem with vigilantism is that there is no method of judging guilt or innocent, no avenue for mercy, and much of the evidence is based upon either speculation, or tainted opinion. Further, if the only authority that is given to these vigilantes is the authority given by themselves (even if they claim that the authority has come from God) what is to stop others from also taking up the mantra, and once again, what gives them the ability to determine guilt and innocence. The problem with the idea that God gives a vigilante the authority to hunt evil doers is that the bible also says 'do not judge lest you also be judged'.As for a movie, I actually quite liked this movie. I liked it when I first saw it and I liked it when I saw it recently. What I especially liked about it is the way that the action sequences are actually pieced together after the fact by the police, who wonder around the murder scene and try to work out what happened. It is then only the correct deduction that is then displayed to us the audience to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my Top 10 Favorite movies For sure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to a Catholic all Male grade school in Cincinnati, Ohio. My first year of College (University of Dayton) I saw Boondock Saints alone in my Dorm. This was in 2005 almost 7 years after It had been released. I had heard the name mentioned a couple times in high school but never had the opportunity to watch it. Then finally a buddy of mine down the hall on the same floor of my dorm gave me the DVD and told me to watch it when I got bored. Its got everything I look for in a good movie, I'm typically into some kind of Action movie such as martial arts of shoot-em up genres. But at the same time don't mind a good drama, and Comic relief is a MUST. Boondock Saint covered almost everything I could want in a top 5 Film. I think that Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus did excellent as the main characters and Willem Dafoe's Character is brilliant. I instantly fell in love, Its got incredible acting, good character development, an amazing message, and the ending will have the hair on your arms standing up first time you watch it.I'm by no stretch of the imagination a film critic but I have been wanting to write Reviews for some of my Favorite movies, and I've been known to write a review or 2 for movies that I was Highly disappointed in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An attempted genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. I'll say it. This could be the worst movie I've ever seen. If there is a noise in the infinite universe that needs to be shushed, it is "The Boondock Saints." Who does Troy Duffy think he is? What made him think he could work in film? Duffy's obviously addicted to style-over-substance films like Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," but his is like stealing precious jewels without knowing what they're worth. Duffy went heavy on the style and light on the substance but didn't understand how or why style works.The film runs on non-linear flashbacks and for what purpose I'll never know. Does it enhance the movie? Do we learn anything more about the characters after the flashbacks? Do the characters change? This is like Duffy watched "Pulp Fiction" one Saturday night over a bowl of popcorn and jotted down everything cool he saw on a one-dollar notepad. After a while the flashbacks becomes so repetitive it's neither shocking nor refreshing when any blood is shed. It practically lulled me to sleep.The movie's slightest attempt at a plot follows two Irish brothers who become Boston serial killers and the homosexual, horny detective who pursues. The cops and the robbers are far from interesting, and although Willem Dafoe as FBI agent Paul Smecker has admirable energy, he'd have better luck using it running a triathlon or teaching drama kids how not to overact.Smecker is the almighty weirdo who might have just been played by Al Pacino but I don't think Pacino could afford to sink this low. Smecker is a homicidal genius which must be why he's working for the FBI but when he can't figure out the identities of the killers, it drives him mad with envy. What's his motivation to join them? Is it because killing people and getting away with it beats coffee and donuts? Smecker listens to classical music on the job to make the character look cool. Actually, Dafoe waltzing towards a brick wall looks sillier than the Green Goblin.The Irish brothers are poorly written, poorly mannered, poorly dressed and poorly manifested characters. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus obviously had fun in these roles, dropping the F-bomb every other word. They masquerade to rid the world of evil. Duffy tried hard looking for a symbol to represent the dynamics of vigilantism and he chose the crucifix. In the context of this bloody vendetta, it's not a symbol but an insult, although Duffy couldn't recognize an insult when he saw one.This film is stupid. The characters are stupid, their motivations are stupid and the director is stupid, stupid, stupid. It became a cult-classic over the years and reeked larger sales from video rentals probably because people were curious just how stupid it really was. This is one movie that would benefit from online piracy because, for anybody, it doesn't deserve a paid viewing.P.S. I'd rate it, but IMDb does not offer a 0/10 option.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually saw it for the first time last week. Always have been huge fan of Sean and of course he didn't fail me once more. First of all I'm in love with the "The Blood of Cuchulainn" and the opening scene. More than a decade from airing but still doesn't feel cheesy if though calls up some smiles for remembering my teen years. Putting aside the opulent bloodshed, there are a lot of things to see and feel watching the movie. For once the story goes your way and the heroes, though a bit crazy and out of the law, are really heroic and yet humble and down to earth. Strange things is, though you understand how unbelievable the story is, you actually believe every bit of it and it makes sense - both brothers coming down of the broken air shaft and still managing to kill every damn Russian mobster in the room, Willem Dafoe successfully portering a female prostitute and almost having sex with a mobster, yeah, right! But still - Connor dropping with a toilet bowl form the roof to save his brother and the unearthly connection between them - hell yeah, this kind of thing everyone wants to believe in. Briefly - the movie makes you feel free, yet humble, though filled up with pride to be on the right side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They're on a deadly mission from God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cult films are some of the worst films to review. Especially when they've been out for many years and people have already formed strong, incorruptible opinions on them. I sometimes feel almost obligated to award a cult film a very positive review because I don't want to face the backlash from fans and then be dismissed as someone who can't appreciate "cult art." I've seen my share of cult films that I wholly love, like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, some I found acceptable, The Big Lebowski, and some I didn't quite grasp, Wet Hot American Summer. The Boondock Saints is a cult film I just can't bring myself to say I truly enjoyed.To be fair, it has a lot going for it. The plot itself is very slim, focusing on two brothers, Connor (Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Reedus), who are strictly Catholic and enjoy cursing and shooting. Seems like a contradiction. One day, while celebrating St. Patrick's Day, they are approached by three Russian mobsters who want to close down the bar they are currently partying in. The next morning, they are brutally attacked by the same trio, and the brothers wind up killing the mobsters in an act of self-defense.The pair decide "we're pretty good at killing, let's become vigilantes," and thus the movie takes off. The merciless scenes of brutality are often interrupted by an effortlessly fantastic Willem Dafoe playing FBI Agent Paul Smecker, the man working the case of the two men.From there on out, it's shoot, run, jump, duck, reload, turn on the slow motion, and repeat. The cinematography is top-notch and well worth noticing. It's the thing that kept me interested the whole time. The first couple of scenes involving violence were nice and somewhat new because slow-motion technology wasn't a very ordinary thing (it didn't become fully noticed until a couple months later with The Matrix). Ultimately, these scenes wear out their welcome pretty quickly.Willem Dafoe plays a pretty convincing agent, and both of the brothers do a very fine job at acting, but the nail in the coffin is it is shamelessly inspired by the work of Tarantino. The attempts at witty dialog, the gratuitously violent set-pieces, and the overall look and feel all appear to be directly lifted from films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The Boondock Saints knows how to incorporate style and look to a film, but struggles to include anything unique or memorable in terms of storytelling. It also doesn't possess half the amount of with that made Pulp Fiction so stellar. Even the God-fearing duo reminds me of The Blues Brothers. It could be possible that these brothers are on a deadly mission from God.The film also woefully misses its chance at throwing in some commentary on vigilante justice and whether or not it should be welcomed or feared. It just feels like it is trying to cover up the actions of the two or justify them by saying "yeah, they kill a lot, but they're very religious and attend church often, so at least they sort of resemble good, wholesome people." The Boondock Saints isn't a bad film, but shamelessly overrated in terms of quality. It's the underdog of American cinema, becoming a runaway success on video, but was the success worthy for such a film that, truthfully, isn't as unique or as entertaining as the title and plot suggest? The performances are great, some scenes are worthwhile, but the depth is kiddie-pool deep and the film makes a lackluster attempt at justifying itself by adding no serious commentary on the issue of vigilante justice.Starring: Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flanery, and Norman Reedus. Directed by: Troy Duffy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Next to Johnny Depp, no one is known for the oddball roles better than Willem Dafoe, and this one is no exception. Smecker is a great detective, although his methods are a bit strange. When we first see him he is well-dressed in a 4 button suit and flowing hair. He examines the crime scene wearing latex gloves he retrieves from a pouch on his belt after inserting the earplugs to his Walkman CD so he can listen to opera while he carefully surveys the evidence. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are excellent as a couple of meat packers who play jokes on one another and their co-workers, are well liked and respected, and obviously frugal Catholic boys who work and play hard. They live in a loft in a commercial building in the Irish neighborhood where they live a Spartan life, mattresses on the floor and not a television in sight. The characters merge seamlessly to form a very basic and primitive plot, one that gets under your skin, but there are some moments when you have to wonder what exactly is going on. Not a film for the little ones, or anyone who has a weak stomach when it comes to blood, especially if you rent the Unrated Version. Unless you are into extreme violence for the sake of violence, not a collectible, but worth seeing if you are a fan of vigilante justice.</fullReview>

I really liked the storyline to it. Two vigilante brothers who believe they are on a mission from god to hunt down and execute people who are evil and corrupt. I especially liked Willem Dafoes performance as the FBI agent is sent to bring them in, but he does not know whether to arrest them or join them. This film had some really good humour, great acting, the storyline was easy to follow and it was very well paced. If you liked films like the punisher for example, you will definitely like this movie. Hands off to the guy who directed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accents and guns have never been so cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about combining dirty accents and guns that can make anyone cool. The ending and a couple scenes could of been a little more eventful, but other than that, it was a great movie. The brothers or "the Saints" were played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus. These two were just the meaning of cool. There were some side characters also who really knew how to to act. One in general is Willem Dafoe. He really took control of his character. Now Billy Connolly was in it shortly too and he was also pretty good even though he did get a big speaking part. The movie combines killing with the Lord. The only people the Saints are killing though are bad Mafia type guys. Once they are done, they say a prayer in their native language and put pennies on their eyes laying them to rest. Like a good guy, bad guy feel. The way the movie was filmed was fantastic. They would show the dead bodies killed by the Saints, then Willem Dafoe would say, "this is how it happened" leading into a flashback showing everything. The movie added some humor also because of the way people got killed. Nothing started right for the Saints, but in the end they did end up killing the guys they needed. The weak minded towards bad language would not enjoy the film because it has some pretty crude dialog, but it does fit well with the film if you know the culture. Overall, this film almost makes you want a gun for the Boondock Saints makes it look so easy to use one. But probably wouldn't be a good thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The MacManus brothers are forced to take up arms and protect their neighbourhood from the scum that thrives through fear and intimidation.The film is quirky, to say the least, it delves away from the traditional style of story telling, and succeeds in keeping the attention of the viewer. The film has some great moments, were you laugh out loud at the brother's incompetence, and their crazy schemes. William Dafo plays an intriguing character who likes to listen to classical music as he examines the crime scene..I thought that was a little bizarre but the whole film is weird.The film has some good strong elements, such as the comedy timing and the actors chosen to portray the characters, but at times the quirky element proves to be too much for the audience to handle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this movie was called 'Andrew Lloyd Webber's Roman Catholic Power Rangers', you might have a better idea of what you're in store for with Boondock Saints. But stay with me, O gentle reader, it shouldn't work but it does. The action scenes are bloody, slick and well choreographed - the kind you might embarrassingly catch a grown man acting out in front of a mirror in their shorts (shut up, we all do it)- yet the dialogue bizarrely has the real feel of heavy stage direction in it. Sometimes one character will shout something, then strike a pose or put his head in his hands while the other character gets to do his line, then become reanimated when its his turn again, like an amateur theatre production. I kept waiting for them to shout to The Virgin Mary "We Need Dinozord Power Now!" as a form of the "Ezekiel 25:17" speech in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is played out all through this movie. The strange (perhaps unintentional) disconnect the not-quite-for-screen-acting creates removed it enough from reality to allow me to smile and cheer when someone gets shot and feel good about it, but there was always the slight fear they'd finally break into a musical number, which is something truly too disturbing for the big screen. Thankfully - and I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler - they never actually start prancing around singing show tunes! All in all, it sounds terrible - and could well be to many other people - but I'm giving it a seven out of ten for being an entertaining one of a kind, although I suspect it to be a fluke. If it was any camper or any grittier it would have been unbearable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is no "Pulp Fiction"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a friend who is sort of a movie buff. Then I realized he likes action and language, and could hardly give a damn about things like cinema and film (which is a huge distinction, by the way). Well, he went on and on about this film, and the IMDb page gave it a 7.8 out of 10, so when I saw it in the bargain bin at KMart, I figured why not. Hey, it proudly boasts how fans of "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction" will love it on the back cover! But comparing this film to Quentin Tarantino is an audacious display of either stupidity or sheer slander.When the film opened with the Mass I smiled, but a few minutes later when they were brawling in a bar with some Russian mobsters, I just had enough, and it was barely ten minutes in. Well, I sat through the next one hundred minutes, and noticed at almost every instance how it replaced good writing with gratuitous amounts of language and violence. Willem Dafoe was the only slight redeeming factor as a closeted-homosexual FBI agent on the trail of the Saints, but even his appeal ran thin when he had to make a moral decision of whether to aid in the boys blood-bath or capture them, like it was his job to do. If the boys had died or been caught, the ending might have satisfied me, because after all that, at least they got punished like I, the viewer, had for one-hundred-ten minutes. But no, they get out free, and the ending is about as absurd and upsetting as the entire film was before it. Not because it's insulting, no, I can handle that, but because it was legitimately bad cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the great spirit of "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs" comes "Boondock Saints," a pale shadow of the first two films I just mentioned. There is plenty of violence and bad language to go around here, but it never really materializes past the point of being senseless.Willem Dafoe is good as Smecker, a cop investigating the "Saints," two brothers who feel they are doing the world good by personally ridding their city of all evil men.The main problem with the film is the amount of unintentional humor that it elicits, particularly with the Dafoe character. The movie wants to be serious and have a message, but it just never happens. There is also a huge credibility problem with placing porn legend Ron Jeremy in what is a non-porn role. It is unintentionally funny to see him try and act.The level of violence is so high that the viewer just becomes de-sensitized by about the middle of the film. There is supposedly a director's cut of the film which runs a half hour longer, sure to have even more bloodshed. The violence is done in such a tasteless and sloppy manner that sometimes you wonder if the actors are getting tired of it.There are many other films in the crime genre that I would recommend before "Boondock Saints." In an effort to be memorable, it really comes off as just being unnecessary.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The idiot saints or thanks Mr. Ebert!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No wonder the unknown Mr. Duffy made a big deal with a major Hollywood producer to shoot and direct "The Boondock Saints"; and no wonder Hoolywood is very fond of brainless stories, which drawn the attention of most of the public, that is not only Hollywood, but it is worldwide. I've just watched the movie this week, but I'd heard some good comments about it since its release. Except for, of course, Mr. Roger Ebert, who doesn't need any presentations here. I admit I've always been a fan of Ebert's work, apart from his preferences and mine, which are different, as it is with any other individual. But he was amazingly fair, sincere and clear in his opinion about this one. I can't even figure out what to say... well... let's try a little bit, to give just an idea of what the plot is: two Irish descendants, living in Boston, they have a "call of duty" from their catholic saints, and in his prayers, they ask for protection to do their jobs, in name of the Lord. Their job is to extinguish all the gangs of Boston (which has a bunch of criminals, by the way)using his techniques, like to speak fluently all the languages of the existing gangs and plus, to kill'em all with no mercy. Oh, there is also the smartest ass chief of investigations, who is aware and supports the two of them in this divine mission. It's a pity to see a good actor as Willem Dafoe, doing such a pathetic character as in this movie, maybe except for the scene in which he is disguised - perhaps the only interesting moment in the movie - but that's it, there's nothing more to say. No wonder Mr. Duffy only directed a sequel ten years after... his creativity is not his strongest point, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boondock Ain'ts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read many reviews of the Boondock Saints, I was expecting a well done rip-off of Pulp Fiction. Well, this movie is not fit to be a B-movie second feature to Pulp Fiction in a two-dollar fourth run single screen movie shack. It is really, really bad. Willem Dafoe's gay genius FBI man is so over the top as to be completely unbelievable and unacceptably silly.But the movie itself is also poorly done. The two non-descript and interchangeable Irish brothers are not the least bit compelling. But their first (technically second) hit made me give up. Guess what, folks. Elevator shafts do not have louvered vents that lead directly into the ventilation ductwork. Ventilation ductwork is never pristinely clean inside and is never without screw heads and loads of internal devices (sensors, dampers, etc.). It is also almost never huge enough to accommodate two grown men to crawl side by side.Having lost my attention with its resort to such TV movie baloney, I could watch no more. By the halfway point, at which I turned it off, there had not been a single female character shown who might provide some relief in this festival of mindless testosterone.I can hang with lots of suspension of belief. But here I was shaken out by the poor story, script, hammy acting, bad accents, unfunny funny bits, and mistakes, such as: Genius FBI guy illustrates how two bullet entry wounds were caused by two guns fired at sharp angles; when we actually see the execution, the two guns are held almost parallel - no sharp angle! Enough of this crap. One to really avoid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All those people died for this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While going to film school, writer/director Troy Duffy apparently missed the class where they discussed motivation. Of the four main characters in this film (the MacManus brothers, Smecker, and Rocco), only one (Rocco) has any discernible motivation for what he ends up doing in the movie. It could be argued that the brothers are motivated by the sermon at the very beginning of the movie, where the priest intones against good men who are indifferent to evil (and they only hear the beginning of it). If that's the case, however, the brothers would have killed the Russian mobsters during the bar fight, rather than just setting Ivan's pants on fire. And they didn't kill Ivan and his buddy in the alley because they were out to rid the world of evil, they killed them in self-defense. As for Smecker, god only knows why he ends up wanting to help the brothers and their vigilantism. Bad day at the hairdressers, maybe? Defoe's performance can only be described in one word: mannered. It is not easy to portray a character whose major personality trait is flamboyance, and Defoe just doesn't convince us that he's doing anything else but playing the role of an eccentric, self-loathing homosexual. At times, he verges on a parody of himself. Flanery and Reedus, for their parts, are about as two-dimensional as their characters.Duffy not only needs to learn about motivation, he needs help with plotting. For instance, the Russian mob leader tells someone who he thinks is Ivan about the big gangland meeting. The only problem is that Ivan's murder has been in every paper and news program in Boston -- it's the biggest story in town (that's why all those reporters are asking about the case when Smecker is interviewing the brothers). So, what's wrong with this guy? If he's such a great gang leader, why can't he pick up a newspaper? Who does he expect to show up after he invites a dead guy to his meeting? His stunt double? I suppose a couple of meat packers become expert assassins (that's never explained) because they picked up a few lessons from dad, but how do they go from killing nine guys with ten shots to exchanging hundreds of rounds with "il Duce" and missing him entirely? Furthermore, why exactly is "il Duce" such a feared hit-man when he can only wing three guys while unloading six handguns? It looks like he's only a danger to himself. And why is an Irishman (with a Scottish brogue) called "il Duce" anyway? In short, weak characterizations, hammy acting, unbelievable plot holes, a morally indefensible message -- there's a lot not to like about this film. One of the few redeeming features is that Ron Jeremy, for the most part, keeps his pants on throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Long Strange Trip Its Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I rented the Boondock Saints is because I saw a little documentary called "Overnight" about the madness of King Troy. A hilarious (although poorly put together) telling of how Troy Duffy, a local douche-bag, gets the chance of a life time when Hollywood Titan Harvey Weinstein comes down from on high to declare Troy's "The Boondock Saints" the bees knees of new scripts in Hollywood and the world. Sending Troy into a ego-frenzy and his, ponderously terrible, band (called, jeez Louise! The Boondock Saints!) into the seven circles of record label hell. Needless to say, the fate of all douche-bags, like Oedipus Rex, is foretold from the start. Troy falls from grace, Harvey passes on his movie, his crappy band breaks up after their laughable debut (I mean who needs more Metal dudes playing folk music?), and Troy is seen outside a dive bar talking to his imaginary friend. To complete the circle, I rented Boondock Saints last night. My brother said he liked it and ,"Its about Massholes." And it is! But I only thought the circle was complete. Then I saw how many people actually liked this skid mark of a movie in the comments section of IMDb. And the people who hated it, put the hate on it in a really lame way. So I decided to write my own.Here goes! This movie was made by that guy in your local bar whose just a little older than you, stole your bike, and beat up your younger brother. He gets ostentatiously drunk, because its the only thing he is good at. He is short and wears overalls, because that makes him hard! He's also wicked retarded! Just like this movie. But that is no reason to avoid this movie. I want everybody to see it! ITS FANSTASTIC!!! The plot reads like a crappy Vertigo comic, SO trying to break the norm. With main characters that are like Colin Farrell's drinking buddies. They actually aren't that bad, acting wise, and they do some crazy crap like killing mob bosses because they're, ya know, evil. SPOILER: They kill these Russians, the lead guy the Fat Man, who is probably the greatest actor you'll ever ever see. PRICELESS PERFORMANCE YURI WHOEVER YOU ARE! Then there's Troy's bearded dipstick Italian friend who the Brothers McDoodle just love. I have no idea why, though. He's supposed to be the "funny man", and the guys about as funny as anal cancer. He dies, I can't remember why, I was just happy when it happened. And the bros are like "We call upon the power of the Blarney Stone!!!" and they break from their bondage and slay the Italian stallions who have imprisoned them to avenge the dipstick. Oh God, that was funny. But not as funny as Willam Defoe. Nothing will ever be. Willam Defoe as a gay FBI agent who SPOILER: Dresses in drag (thanks for that one Troy) and makes out with an Italian thug to help save the boys when he's totally abandoned the badge to join their homo vigilante romp through out Baaaston. Love it. SPOILER: The definitive scene of the movie features a five minute long gay fantasia "FIRE FIGHT!!!" as Defoe would put it where he conducts in retrospect as the Bros and Dipstick shoot Billy Connoly...a lot.Billy Connoly, back from, well Ireland I guess, shows up as "Il Duce". LOL!!! Come on, that is fantastic!!! He's a crazy Con Air Assassin who don't know pain, son. Who else but Billy Connoly could bring this brilliant character to life? In the end the movie poses the question, "What is more important; God's Law or Man's Law?" Deep, very very deep. All I know is Boston sucks. Ha, just kidding. I'm just happy this movie came out. It like, defines a whole genre of independent movies so trying to be independent. I gotta give these guys credit, the money wasn't there, neither was the talent. But it still came out and people are still talking about it. People love it like their lives depended on it! Or they hate it with such passion, that it makes you uncomfortable to be around them. Like its so trying to be something its not. But its not. Truth is it is a piece of brilliant crap. Served on a platinum tray for your consumption. I don't know why Mr. Weinstein would give this movie his blessing at first. My friend and I think he lost a bet. But thank God it did get made. So please, see this movie and marvel at is grungy, late nineties, ham-bone, ruffing and blaring magic.</fullReview>

I wasn't into the whole religion and cleansing the world of evil crap, or maybe there's more to it then that? I pretty much assume the plot is two brothers suddenly deciding to kill all evil, so they get a bunch of guns and some rope. Throughout the movie they go on a bunch of missions to kill drug dealers, gangsters, mob bosses, etc. Overall I didn't see anything in this movie that should give it a 7.7.

Even "TBS" should have its audience, call it market niche, unfortunately bigger than I expected. Hell, even "Cobra" with Stallone was more entertaining.

		<fullReview>Being a big fan of the 'genre' (if you can call it that), I was expecting Boon Dock Saints to be a lot more entertaining. What I found was far from what I expected. Judging by IMDB.com's 7.7 rating, this couldn't be any less than a masterpiece, I thought. I'm not quite sure what gave this movie it's 'amateurish' feel, but I suppose it might have something to do with how poorly each actor seemed to grasp their role. The dialogue was bland, the directing uninspired, and the acting simply poor. The movie borrowed heavily from movies like Léon (The Professional) and Pulp Fiction, but in it's effort to be like the classics of the genre, turned out to be little less than a weak attempt at a 'cool crime movie'. Tarantino and Besson, to me, are still the only 2 directors capable of making movies like this work. Definitely not a masterpiece, but also not quite unbearable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a few isolated moments of brilliance (the toilet-dropping scene comes to mind) this is mainly just a confused, silly, poorly-written attempt at a quirky Guy Ritchie/Tarantino style action movie. It would perhaps work as parody of that genre, except that there's no sense of underlying wit or irony.Among the film's more outstanding flaws:- Characters are generally not believable as either the ethnic stereotypes they're supposed to embody, nor as human beings in general. Accents are for the most part very poorly done. One side-effect of this is that the "bad guys" don't really seem very bad or evil at all; the mafiosi in UHF were more believable as such. I would probably have assumed they were all out-of-work comedians if the movie didn't have all sorts of helpful captions explaining their mobster status.- Motivations are obscure or inconsistent. Supposedly, the two brothers believe they are on a divine quest to rid the world of organized crime, yet their best friend is a low-level mobster. They engage in solemn ritualistic murder, yet moments later act like slap-happy, carefree children, wrestling and playing practical jokes. They come off more like amiable psychopaths than as heroes, although we're apparently supposed to see them as the latter.- There are numerous plot inconsistencies and omissions. It's difficult to detail these without rampant spoilers, but suffice it to say that the police response time in Boston, even to a federal courthouse, must be something like three hours.- This movie tries very hard to be funny, but frequently misses the mark or degrades into camp. Ron Jeremy as a gangster Elvis impersonator would be an example, or Willem Dafoe's crossdressing.The film does have some things going for it, notably Willem Dafoe (despite some of the horrific things he's made to do), some cool action scenes, and the occasional bit of genuinely funny dialogue. Still, overall this one belongs where I found it: the discount DVD bin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is an entertaining and yet incredibly flawed movie. The two main characters are the McManus brothers. From the start we don't know much about them. We know that they're Irish, they like to drink, they like to fight and they work in a meat plant. Oh wait, they also speak five languages ...and yet they work in a meat plant. St. Patty's Day gets off to a rough start when the two of them get in a fight with a big, man-hating lesbian at their job. What do we know about this woman? Well, she's big, she hates men and she's a lesbian. But the trouble really starts for the brothers when three big, angry Russian gangsters walk into their bar. We don't know much about these guys either. We know that they're big, they're angry, they're Russian and they're gangsters. A fight ensues where one of the big Russians gets tied to a bar and his ass lit on fire. The next day, the McManus brothers seem quite surprised when the Russians break into their loft seeking revenge. After all, it was only a bar fight. To cut to the chase, the brothers receive a message from God and they determine that it is their divine mission to become vigilante gangster killers. They are delighted when they gain access to a small arsenal of guns. We don't know if they have a history of handling guns, but hey, they're Irish and they like to fight, so why wouldn't they like guns? As well as going after Russian gangsters, they go after Italian gangsters led by a powerful crime boss. What do we know about this guy? Well, we know that he's Italian, he likes salami sandwiches and he's a crime boss. We do have the pleasure of meeting at least one complex character in this movie. Willem Dafoe plays a closeted gay FBI agent who is a genius investigator. Unfortunately, he really can't save this movie. One of the biggest problems with Saints is not what we see, but what we DON'T see. The brothers talk about the lack of justice in the world and the victimization of innocent people. So naturally, they go after guys who have victimized innocent people, right? Well... actually we don't really know if they've hurt innocent people. I mean, the guys they kill are gangsters so we can assume they've hurt people, but we never see them do that. As a result, the act of killing these men feels like a hollow achievement. Perhaps we should despise these evil men, but we don't. How can we despise men who we know NOTHING about? We're introduced to a particular group of men about to be killed by our heroes. The men are sitting and talking in a hotel room. What have they done to deserve death? Umm... they're sitting and talking in a hotel room. Our heroes go to a porn show where a few gangsters watch a stripper. What have they done to deserve death? Umm... they're watching a stripper. But the really big problem I have with this movie is one that admittedly doesn't say anything about the quality of the film. This movie is set in Boston. So where is the Irish mob??? If these brothers are so righteous in their pursuit of justice, why only go after the Italians and Russians? A more interesting movie would have involved the brothers being recruited by Irish mobsters only for the two of them to turn on them, as well as kill the local Russians and Italians. Then as a result of their killing spree, three rival gangs share a common goal of catching and killing two vigilantes. Saints is not without its moments and writer/director Troy Duffy is capable of writing some good scenes. But creatively, he gets away with murder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated by the books action film, nothing new, nothing special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard allot about this movie over the last few years people all over have been praising it as a mild stone in film making. Calling it a cult classic and one of the best action dramas ever put to film, well I'm sorry to say they were wrong. This movie was nothing like people advertised and boasted about, it was at times very hard to discern what was going on and who was killing who and what was really going on in the film.The Boondock Saints boast a cool and hip visual style that resonates with the best action films of the 80's and early 90's and some of John Woo's japan work before he moved to America. But even that can't save this film from being highly overrated and contrived. TBS was great on the action and humor(what little it had if there wasn't a curse word in it.)It tires so very hard to be convincing, powerful, emotional and most of all smart but it can't under the dumb down dialogue and the poor execution of the film. The mediocre script and direction of Troy Duffy who I've never heard and for good reasons. You see Duffy tries to create a movie where two brothers who are devoted to each other and devoted to helping the little people think there doing God's work by killing all theses mob boss and criminals where in reality there actually psycho killers just mopping up the scum in south Boston. I like the style of the film and I liked the way it played out, but if Duffy had just thought it out more and put a more dramatic and emotional effect into the film, then maybe, just maybe, this film would have made my top ten list sadly it makes my top ten list of the worst films of the 90's. But none the less it had the heart, it had the spirit and it had the strength to be great and groundbreaking bu sadly it falls short due to bad plotting, on par acting, a terrible script and bad action sequences that don't really dazzle you or blow your mind.Sean Patrick Flanery(Who I never hear of besides this movie.) Plays one of the Mac Manus brothers, he does pretty good here and does try hard to be convincing. But he fails under Duffy's bad script and poor direction and thus is kind of an eye sore with his bad Irish accent. Norman Reedus(Another actor I've never heard of outside this film.) Is areal downside in this with his bad acting he really brings down his character and makes it nothing more than a brainless thug who say a pray for the men they are about to kill. Billy Connolly(Who is alright for the few minutes he's actually in the movie.) is pretty good in this and is one of the higher class acts in the film, he brings some ruthless style and cunning to a very simple character and does well with his time on screen. Willem Dafoe(the saving grace in this film.) Is fantastic in it and is the only reason to see this film besides the slick, but highly under done, action sequences. He brings up the quality of this film and elevates it to from bad to alright. But again even he can't save this film from crumbling under it's own failure. But none the less the cast does there best with the material there given and tries there hardest to make this a great film, but sadly they can't.The Boondock Saints is dark,violent and sacrilegious, that pretty much sums up the main focal point of this film plot and story and it tells you all you need to know about the film in general. It boast a hip, cool and vibrant style of film making and that can't save it from be a by the book action film with not so special action sequences. All in all The Boondock Saints is passing entertainment bu nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boondock Saints was lacking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie could have been so great if not for some poor script choices and poor casting choices. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the MacManus brothers were wonderful. I loved how their relationship with one another played out. They were never TOO serious and you really felt a camaraderie with them as they progressed through the film. The faith they had in God and each other was inspiring. Of course they chose a strange course of action to deal with the "baddies", but they still made you feel for them and want them to succeed. Williem DaFoe as Paul Smecker was simply disturbing. The character was played like a crazy man and did not seem to tie into the rest of the film. Smecker went from the hard ass "let's bring these assholes down" to a big ol' softy who just wanted the brother's to carry on their good deeds. The transition happened too quickly. One minute he is after them and crazy and the next minute he is letting them go and crazier. The rest of the cast was lacking as well. David Della Rocco as Rocco gave a decent performance but the character seemed over the top. I did not really feel the friendship between the brothers and Rocco. It just did not seem to be there like it should have been. As far as the plot goes, the ending with II Duce being the brother's father was extremely cheesy, for lack of a better word. They have not seen Their father in over 20 years and immediately they have a close bond with him. They "let him in the club" so to speak. Regardless of the life their father led before he was imprisoned it just seems far fetched for him to be immediately accepted. They may have missed their father, and they may have not cared whether he was in prison or not, but the guy was gone for most of their lives. This is usually not accepted so easily. And here it just does not work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story was very promising when I sat down to see this film. How ever, some how the failure of the director is total in this movie...I got almost angry when I realized that what could have been a perfectly good movie, was wasted because of some directors total lack of feeling when making a movie.The timing was terrible, the way the film was cut and put together was nothing but sloppy. The camera work was somewhat ok, but the director really seemed to trying to get som sort of recognition from the industry or something in every single scene!! rather then trying to make a good movie.He simply tried WAY TOO HARD...The FBI-agent was way too psycho, the heroes was way too cool, their friend was also way too psycho, the mob guys was soo bad(as in evil and vicous)that they turned ridiculous. Did you see that russian gangster, in that sceene where the heroes fell down through the roof? Oh my god, such a terrible fake belly he had in that scene. It's one of those small things, the whole movie is filled with'em.There is no excitement in the movie what so ever. I could predict almost every scene in the movie and when you can predict a film, it tend to get quite boring.The dialogue was also over the top, unmotivated talk, yells, screams, and unmotivated usage of the f-word in some scenes just made me yawn...I entirely blame the director for this one, he really turned a potential "A" movie into a crappy, booring "H" movie at the best. This could have been the big break for the guys who played the heroes, beleave it or not, but i think they did a good job them two. Too bad some one else ruined their oportunity.Man, what a whaste on good film...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's true that this film is probably a rare gem among straight-to-video action movies, but that doesn't mean it's good. In general, it feels cheap and sloppy; the soundtrack is mostly terrible electronic music, the dialogue seems to substitute excessive use of "the f-word" for wit, and the action scenes- which are also far less abundant than some reviews would have you believe- substitute endless slow-motion (some of which does actually look pretty good) for creative choreography. The structure that is used throughout the film- Willem Dafoe finds bodies, figures out what happened, and then we see it- basically robs the movie of any suspense or tension since all the "action" scenes happen in flashbacks. And naturally there are more fundamental problems, like the thinness of the story and characters and the fact that the film lacks a point and doesn't offer up enough entertainment to distract from this fact. Overall- not painful or a complete waste of time, but not deserving of its cult status.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When he's not giving Gwyneth Paltrow a pedicure, what is Harvey Weinstein doing when he reads genre scripts? It would seem that the corpulent supergenius behind Miramax Films cannot perceive that RESERVOIR DOGS, THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD, and this stinkapalooza are not the same exact movie. In a famous bit of lore, Weinstein bought the bar the writer-director Troy Duffy used to work in as part of the kiss-Duffy's-butt ploy. In a less famous bit of lore, Weinstein lost interest as Duffy's behavior became, shall we say, pugnacious, and sure enough, years after the bar-buying myth, THE BOONDOCK SAINTS opened in an ex-porn grindhouse in Hollywood. It premiered on Blockbuster shelves a few days later. There is a reason for this bad luck. THE BOONDOCK SAINTS may be the worst mainstream film of the nineties.Some are more noxious. KILLING ZOE and THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK are viler. But this one is ripe. Willem Dafoe is a gay Sherlock Holmes whom we, the presumably heterosexual audience, is supposed to root for when he thunks a lover's head and snorts, "What a fag!" Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are two Irish-American vigilantes rendered with much cuteness and fake humor. The movie seems unsure whether it's IN LIKE FLYNT campy or Bond-movie straight. There are also allusions to MEAN STREETS that just don't help anybody. There is not an honest moment in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie with a bunch of friends and I ended up being in the minority. I won't say the movie sucked but it wasn't good either. I felt that the movie lacked some much needed character development on the 2 brothers and the Willem Defoe character. While watching the movie I was secretly wishing for someone to kill off the 2 bland brothers so the movie could end. I'm all for violent, shoot'em up, curse filled movies but it should be done with orignality and with interesting characters. Yeah, there are some cool pretentious action sequences but thats basically all that this movie has to offer. The movie tried to be hip and cool with the brothers reciting scripture just before they blow someone's head off but the only person who could do that with any style and with coolness oozing out his ears is bad ass Samuel L. Jackson. This movie plays like a generic wannabe of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The only redeeming quality this movie has is the ending when the credits start rolling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film wanting to enjoy watching it because I have heard so many good reviews over the past few years. As I watched this film I was really disappointed with it as a whole. As someone who has been studying film for years I screen a film differently than the average home viewer, but even when a film isn't coming together I try to enjoy it! I like to watch films succeed! This movie didn't work out at all. The direction and script were probably the hugest failures. Without terrible direction the acting might not have come across so misguided. William Defoe was horrible in this and his character was unpredictable and lacked any depth. Wish I had time to write up a complete explanation of why this film falls flat on it's face, but it's safe to say this movie isn't worth watching. It is unoriginal, predictable, and not half as good as most made for TV movies. I think this film has such high reviews because it struck a chord with the 15 year old kids who are watching a rated R movie for the first time. They seem to worship it as something unique. However, for grownups I would say this movie doesn't amount to much of anything and you shouldn't waste your time.

Dreadful, insulting script begins badly and keeps getting worse, and the overscaled performances (which would be broad at fifty paces) are shoved right up to the camera. Writer-director Troy Duffy hasn't any talent working with actors, and this cast is strictly on their own (which may explain why Willem Dafoe turns in his very worst performance). Duffy is no De Palma, and "The Boondock Saints" is no "Scarface". It may well be the most misguided mobster-drama ever made. NO STARS from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a rule - any video which contains blurbs comparing it to either 'Reservoir Dogs' or 'Pulp Fiction' will a) be NOTHING like Tarantino, and b) will absolutely suck. 'The Boondock Saints' gets compared to BOTH movies on its sleeve, and doesn't break my rule. This movie is so unbelievably awful IN EVERY WAY that your jaw will drop on the floor. I can't think of ANY redeeming feature it has! The script is an absolute mess. The characters are totally unbelievable, the situations ridiculous, the "witty" dialogue stinks, there is no character development, suspense, laughs or anything worthwhile going on here. To add insult to injury, it is incoherently directed which makes an uninteresting story and characters even more difficult to care about. After half an hour I'd had enough. The two leads (Flanery and Reedus) have particularly poor Irish accents that they can't even sustain throughout, and how the usually great Willem Dafoe ended up in this abortion of a movie is anybody's guess! Steer clear of 'The Boondock Saints'. I can't even see undiscerning teenage action fans enjoying this. Frankly I can't see ANYBODY enjoying this!!

Connor and Murphy are two Irish brothers fed up with the filth and injustice that is taking over the world, so they decide to take it into there own hands. Perfectly cast, with Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery as the Macmanus brothers bring a real heart and conviction to the at sometimes shocking story. David Della Rocco is amazingly brilliant by basically playing himself, and another (as always) shining performance from Willem Defoe as Detective Smecker. Writer / Director Troy Duffy has managed to create a world where criminals are the ones in fear and the good men rise above. I recommend The Boondock Saints to everyone, only to make you own assumptions on not only the movie itself, but on whether or not you be on there side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has quite frequently been accused of being a Tarantino rip-off, while the film does quite obviously take quite a bit of inspiration from his films, it does it in a fresh way that acts more of an homage than a rip off.All of the characters this film are incredibly diverse but typical of a film this styled all of the characters a very over-the-top and manic. The craziest of this ensemble of characters is Paul Smecker (Played by Willem Dafoe), who's incredibly crime scene explorations and general antics make for an insane and quite brilliant character. The non linear crime scenes are made by his character, adding to this already incredibly interesting story mechanic.The script plays about with a non-linear story telling which works very well in this format, the crime scene investigations are done in a way which shows you the aftermath,the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc. After/as the police come up with theories to the crime, we see the actual scene, of the brothers going through with the crime. While some plot elements from the script are quite undeveloped and some parts feel forced and unrealistic (for example the Il Duce plot) causing the film to get a little lost at times.The cinematography is nothing too new but is quite interesting and highly stylised, which adds a new depth to the film which makes it much more interesting and so entertaining to watch.While the film is very stylised and sometimes may lose itself in this, but does provide a thoroughly entertaining experience and makes for quite an engaging film.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/</fullReview>

Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery play Paul and Connor MacManus, two Irish brothers in Boston who accidentally kill a mob member, and a regarded as heroes. They soon acquire the thought that it is Gods work to murder the evil mobsters ruining their town, so pull out the guns and start shooting em down. Willem Dafoe is the funny detective trying to take the brothers down, even though he is totally supportive of what they do. "The Boondock Saints" is the type of violent movie that is perfect for having beer and pizza with at 2:00 A.M. It's easy to follow, their isn't much besides the fun action, and it has its funny moments. It's a clever written story by Troy Duffy, who also directs this film with lots of energy and fun. He doesn't use graphic, brutal detail to show the story, but instead just uses guns and some blood to get the fun across. It isn't disturbing in the slightest. Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery have a ton of joy together. They have a blast playing their roles as brothers. They work great together! "The Boondock Saints" also raises the question if killing evil people is justified, but in the end it gives you a little to contemplate, and a lot to sit down, relax, and enjoy some fun action!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE BOONDOCK SAINTS opens with a speech about "the evil of indifference." This sets the stage and the tone for everything that follows. Our two meat packing plant heroes, brothers Conner (Flanery) and Murphy (Reedus) McManus, find themselves at odds with a pair of Russian mafia types, who end up dead. Locals call the killers "The Saints of South Boston." "Angels don't kill," argues Smecker (Willem Dafoe), the FBI agent sent to investigate the deaths. Throughout the movie, we see the aftermath first and then the action in flashback (more often than not pieced together by Dafoe). It's an effective way of presenting the "mystery." When the pair recruit Rocco (who accidentally kills his girlfriend's cat), he enthuses: "We could kill anyone!" Our "Mass" murderers step up the pace- but "Il Duce" ("The Duke," played by Billy Connolly), a killer so terrifying that he's trussed up like Hannibal Lechter, is on his way. Will our heroes survive...? THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a well-crafted comedy/drama, with great music and performances all around (Willem Dafoe as the gay FBI agent is particularly funny when he dresses up as a prostitute; fugly, but funny; he's also brilliant in a slow motion sequence as he imagines and "orchestrates" a shootout he's piecing together). (Note: not long after the release of this movie, there was an incident in the news- and I heard it only once, and it was never elaborated upon- wherein a masked man with a mask and a CAPE used a shotgun in a similar real life situation. At the time, I remarked that that mysterious masked man might well have been the first Masked Hero in Real Life.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, let me start with the bad and why there are so many haters to the film. *spoilers My biggest complaint is the campy use of eye prosthetics in the hotel scene, somewhat repetitive crime scene shots and.... well i'm having trouble thinking of more. Some film snob pucker butts will draw attention to the films morality and plausability as flaws. However, if (as the story alludes) divine forces are at play, surviving a 5 story fall and not being able to shoot your father in a point blank shootout become excusable if not necessary for the storyline. The snobs will also say the ethics of the brothers/Italian cohort are questionable, I excuse those flaws in the same way I excuse The Blues Brother's antics to save an orphanage. Imperfect people doing divine work in an imperfect way. Thats the storyline and if you cant get behind that, then skip the movie, but don't be a hypocrite and praise films like Clockwork for their social commentary while panning this one as slowmotion execution porn. Phew, that was a rant.Now the good. If I were ranking this film soley on "watchability" I would have given it a 10. The main cast play well off each other and although im just a lowely pion to a snob with a PHD in film studies, I found the acting between the main cast to be superb. I thought Dafoe was over the top marvelous with his semi-tribute semi-ripoff of the DEA agent in Leon the Professional. The Italian cohort was genuinely manic, funny, disgusting, and almost tragic in a charming way. While the brothers killed it with the love they show for one another (even if their accents were a bit too much lucky charms mascot inspired). The dialogue was witty and funny. The action sequences were better and more creative then most action movies wth twice the budget. Overall, this lowly pion thinks that Boondock Saints is original, well made, funny, entertaining and most importantly sparks a discussion on morality few films can claim to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uneven and derivative but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Troy Duffy was apparently trying to make the next "Pulp Fiction" when he put together "The Boondock Saints". A distinct Tarantino influence runs through the whole movie, from the subject matter, to the writing, to the visuals. While the resulting film is by no means a masterpiece, Duffy probably came closer than anyone (other than Guy Ritchie) to capturing the spirit of Tarantino's early films.Set in Boston, the story centres around Irish American twins Connor &amp; Murphy MacManus, who decide to become vigilantes after killing two Russian mobsters in self defence. FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) is close on their trail at all times but he becomes conflicted about bringing them to justice. To his credit, Duffy did give more depth to the story than is typical for movies of this type but many viewers will probably just focus on the rampant violence.Unfortunately for Duffy, the cast that he had to work with wasn't exactly star-studded. Case in point, the titular brothers are played by Sean Patrick Flanery &amp; Norman Reedus. Flanery managed to be a bit more convincing than Reedus but neither of them are particularly impressive from an acting standpoint. Much more memorable is the always reliable Willem Dafoe, who gleefully sunk his teeth into his caricature of a role. Also welcome in a small role was veteran Billy Connolly as the mysterious (and deadly) 'Il Duce'. The remainder of the cast runs the gamut from competent to downright embarrassing; however, Duffy should share some of the blame there for overextending in his attempts to mimic Tarantino's trademark dialogue.Duffy's first-time direction, on the other hand, is surprisingly ably handled even though his bag of tricks contains almost nothing that you haven't seen elsewhere. The soundtrack is fairly generic as well, though passable. The movie had a low budget, so I think that we got about as good a presentation as could reasonably be expected.Ultimately, "The Boondock Saints" definitely isn't a movie for everyone. It's known as a cult movie for a reason. While it's no "Pulp Fiction", I think that many people are over-critical of its failings. As I see it, the movie does some things right and it isn't as shallow as it's made out to be. And, when it comes to down it, I'd have to admit that it's entertaining, despite its flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing cult classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie! Besides the fact that Norman Reedus is awesome, and I knew that before The Walking Dead, the movie is just fantastic! It is so different than anything I've seen. I thought director Troy Duffy did a great job and loved the way the scenes were shot with the flamboyant Det. Paul Smecker as he is investigating, first seeing the evidence, then describing miraculously visualizing how it all went down in the crime scene. William Dafoe was hilarious. My favorite scene was when they dropped out of the ceiling to take down the Russian mob! Batman who? These two guys are the best vigilantes and they don't wear tights or need a cape! I also really liked Funny Guy Rocco even though he did shoot the poor cat! It was an accident!Veritas Aequitas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first minutes, to the last seconds, this movie captivates every single part of your being. You are not simply watching a movie you're watching a belief, an idea come into fruition. Nothing is more thrilling then to watch people bring justice to the bad guys. These lines reveal the entirety and the belief that the movie represents. (line could be considered as a spoiler)"now you will receive us!! we do not ask for your poor or your hungry! we do not want your tired and your sick! it is your corrupt we claim! it's your evil that will be sought by us! with every breath we will hunt them down! each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies! do not kill, do not rape, do not steal, these are principles that every man of every faith can embrace! these are not polite suggestions! these are codes of behavior and those of you that ignore them will pay the dearest cost! there are various degrees of evil! we urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over! into true corruption into our domain! but if you do! one day you will behind us and see we three, and on that day you will reap it! and we will send you to whatever god you wish!" These lines wrap the movie together beautifully. In the end its an amazing movie. Troy Duffy did an amazing job with the limited budget that was given to him to make it. So in the end this movie is worth watching, and don't forget to watch the "The Boondock Saints 2:All Saints Day" Also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the 90s... Well Close Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, an action movie that has action throughout with no boring dialogues or ridiculously long chase scenes just for filler. 14 years after the release "The Boondock Saints" can still hold its ground as an action movie, by still being found in college dorms across the US and also being known as one of the better indie films of the 90's. "The Boondock Saints" is a hipster, cult-classic that will keep you engaged throughout with its intriguing non-linear storyline and fitting soundtrack.The non-linear storyline is what truly makes "The Boondock Saints" a refreshingly different action movie. To begin the non-linear sequence of events, the audience is shown the aftermath of the MacManus brothers' (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) handiwork; bodies, blood, bullets, etc. Then arrives Agent Smecker (Willem Dafoe) who narrates and theorizes what he believes happened to the victims. While he is doing this you see, as an overlay type of cinematography, how the whole scenario indeed went down with the brothers punishing their victims. Not only are the non-linear scenes done craftily, but they actually work with the movie as a whole and are easy for the viewer to follow.The soundtrack is one of the most important things to get right when making a movie and the sound editor for "The Boondock Saints" got it right. The opening view of the city of Boston was the best example of a music score fitting perfectly into a scene. Starting off the movie by showing the scenery of where the movie takes place while being paired with an upbeat Irish gig brought the whole movie into being. Slower paced scenes had just the right amount of quieter and somber music for it to fit the scene and not distract the viewer from what is taking place on the screen. In the fast and upbeat scenes the music was just as rapid and buoyant as the characters, which enabled it to fit perfectly with each of their movements. And while Smecker is theorizing the investigation scenes there is classical music that is orchestrated perfectly with the actions of both Smecker and the brothers as the flashbacks arise. The music itself could stand alone as being superb, but when matched perfectly into a scene it makes for a better viewing experience.With so many action movies these days being filled with over the top action and too many special effects, going back to "The Boondock Saints" is a sigh of relief. The director, Troy Duffy, was able to show that movies can still be engaging and fulfilling to watch even if it is not what we find to be traditional in the action genre today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it interesting that so many parallels are drawn between this and Pulp Fiction, because beyond the genre staples and one or two racy taboo-challenging scenes, they don't have all that much in common. The Saints don't benefit from the comparison, either, considering Fiction is an ambitious, label-defying, scene chewing mega-monster, while they're just suitably entertaining bullet spitters with an accent. There's plenty of good action to be savored here, with a few wildly original payoffs and an upturned barrel full of blood'n'guts, but at heart it's an extremely simple vigilante justice story that's well-served by its hair trigger. The two leads, twin brothers who seem to have been waiting their entire lives for the excuse to go on this kind of a rampage, power through wave after wave of mafia underlings without even a whiff of danger until the closing moments. That makes for some giddy action sets early on, sure, but when the story is finally ready to slow down and say something, it's left without anything to lean on. Willem DaFoe is a potential show-stealer as the morally (and sexually) confused police detective on the Saints' case, but he falls victim to the same trappings as the plot. Loaded with character, bravado and personality, it lacks depth and meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh When the Saints Come Marching In</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is big divide of opinion between critics and audiences about The Boondock Saints: critics hated it when first released and The Boondock Saints has a 17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes but audiences loved it, having a 7.8/10 on IMDb and has become a cult hit. But I side with the critics about this film and there are some detractors even in audiences.Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) are two Irish Catholic brothers living in Boston and workers in a meat packing factory. After an altercation with some Russian gangsters which result in the brothers having to kill in self-defence. They soon discover their have a talent for killing and put it to good use to get rid of all the evil of the world, killing gangsters, perverts, rapists, murderers, etc? and believe they are doing God's work. But by doing this they upset the Russian and Italian mafias and an FBI agent, Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) is investigating their crimes.The Boondock Saints is basically a poor man's Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie film, failing to match on a plot, comedy, action and dialogue level. The acting throughout is horrendous, either lacking any conviction or very over the top, though Dafoe did at least looked like he was having fun. The action was filmed in a slightly stylised fashion and competently handled but Troy Duffy overused slow motion like he was Guy Ritchie or John Woo but did not have their experience. The actions are not even filmed as they were happening, they were filmed as flashbacks and Duffy just fares to black to show a show the passing of time which felt very lazy. The gunplay was strong.The jokes, comedy and the comic performances just fell flat. It was poorly written, not funny and the dialogue was a poor attempt at copying Tarantino and Ritchie. There is no real understanding how to make a action-comedy. There are tonal shifts from it trying to be a light hearted romp to being a very violence dark fest, an example being the brothers kill their targets gangland style, shooting them in the back of the head at point blank range. The MacManus use religion to justify there actions and there is a very right wing slant to this film. It would have worked better if the brothers were villains, using religion to justify their actions, manipulating religious text as a justification and the police have to investigate.The Boondock Saints is not the almighty classic that some people think it is. It is a poor comedy, over stylised though some of the action set pieces do save it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was encouraged by several people to see this film, telling me it was smart, action packed, funny, and well-written. I am not a film student but I like good movies. I like good acting. I like good story telling. This has none of this. I read the positive reviews of this film and I wonder if we watched the same movie. This is one of the most god awful, pretentious pieces of garbage ever put on film. I read one review that put Troy Duffy (the film's writer) in between Tarantino and Ritchie. If Guy Ritchie only made "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch" and then made a dozen other movies starring Madonna, Troy Duffy still makes him look like Martin Scorsese. The action sequences are well produced which is the ONLY reason I gave this a 2 instead of a one. I borrowed a VHS copy from a friend years ago. I watched the film three times to make sure I wasn't missing the good parts he kept telling me about. There are not enough synonyms for the word "bad" in the English language to describe this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cat killing ruined it ... and the Tarantino ripoffs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1999, the Tarantino ripoffs were in full swing. This is a movie by a filmmaker who knows a particular style and sticks to it without really bringing anything fresh to the party. If you don't know the premise, go read it on the IMDb page. Suffice to say, the performance by Willem Dafoe as a homosexual Federal investigator is one of the films saving graces. A rather shocking and brutal moment when a cat is accidentally killed (nay, splattered against a wall) was the point where I almost turned this film off. I wish I had. What started out as an interesting premise turned into a rather plodding hike to its somewhat clichéd conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boondock Saints" seems to be one of those films you either hate or love. I'm most definitely among the lovers out there and the reason for this is simple : out of all action films I've ever seen, "The Boondock Saints" seemed the most entertaining, the most visually appealing, the most original and the funniest to me.Sure, "The Boondock Saints" is no "Citizen Kane", but that's something I never expected in the first place. There are some major plot holes, most characters are caricatures and the acting isn't the best around, but if you manage to ignore this there is a lot to like about this film.Being raised in a Flemish labor class family, my cultural background is very much like that of the two main characters. As such, I found the motivations, the philosophy, the personalities and humor of the main characters very recognizable and very appealing. I suspect this may also be a major reason why there are so many haters. If you do not have any affinity with Irish labor class culture or mentality, then you may just not "get it". I'm not saying you must be a factory worker to like this film, though. My own job is programming web applications.Then there's the visuals. Duffy opted for a non-linear way of telling his story that with a unique combination of fast-paced action, some experimental editing and a matching music score. While "Pulp Fiction" undoubtedly inspired Duffy's style, it's still far too different from Tarantino's typical style or anything else I've ever seen to be considered a rip-off. Tarantino based his own style on the dozens of films from the '70s he saw as a teenager, but does that make "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction" any less original or unique?Most of all, though, "The Boondock Saints" is just fun. Invite some of your friends over, grab a few beers and just enjoy the fact-paced action, the sometimes very foul-mouthed or very dark humor and debate with your friends whether you'd think it would be a blessing or a curse if "The Boondock Saints" were actually real and not just a story made up by Duffy. For me, that's the perfect setting for a film like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, let's start with the obvious. As another reviewer aptly pointed out, this is NOT _Pulp Fiction_, although it desperately wants to be. With that out of the way, let's hack this piece of crap apart bit by bit:1. Willem Dafoe, who normally has my attention from Scene 1, overacts enough to embarrass Jim Carrey in his Ace Ventura days. I think it was direction rather than some weird intention of Dafoe to create a singularly uninteresting and unbelievable gay FBI agent, but be that as it may, it was awful.2. The plot. Booooooriing. Vigilantes killing bad people in interesting ways? Wow, that wasn't done in the 80s but every other movie.3. The self-aware cool factor. The brothers striding past the priest in Mass (oh, in slow motion, it's THAT cool), the inability of the screenwriter to avoid F-bombs in every scene, including the ridiculous self-control-losing "soliloquy" by Rocco, which contained nothing except the F-word, the "Funny Man" racist joke (helllooo, _True Romance_), the inane conversations about little things as Something Big Was About To Go Down.4. The Russians. I'm pretty sure the director called up the folks who did the voices of Boris and Natasha on _Bullwinkle_ and asked them how to do a realistic portrayal of some Reds, and then ignored their advice because it wasn't stereotypical enough.5. The "real feel" achieved by interviewing "real" folks through the closing credits. Well, that makes this piece of crap a relevant piece of crap, doesn't it? And now you know that it has REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS. Because real people are really talking on real TV (not really) about a real event that could, if it actually happened, be real.In closing, may I recommend you skip this _Pulp Fiction_ wannabe and go outside. Even if there's a tornado, you'll have a better time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Going over the top can work sometimes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignored upon its initial release The Boondock Saints went on to become a cult sensation. People loved it, they thought it was the most amazing thing ever. Well, except for those who hated it and thought it was the dumbest, most vile thing they'd ever seen. Few movies split opinions to such extremes like this one. Love it or despise it, no in between. It's brilliant. Or it's hideous. So where does the truth lie? Well, right in between of course.The movie centers around Irish twins Connor and Murphy MacManus who will become vigilantes, taking it upon themselves to clean up Boston. Crime lords, thugs and lowlifes will be ruthlessly dispatched in extraordinarily bloody fashion. When the killings start FBI agent Paul Smecker investigates. The introduction of the eccentric Smecker, played to wonderful effect by Willem Dafoe, kicks the movie into high gear. The actors playing the MacManus twins, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, are perfectly fine but there never seems to be much depth to their characters. They have very little to do except run around killing people, moving from one bloodbath to another. It's left to Paul Smecker to pick up the pieces. And actually take some time to think. Nobody else has much time to think in this movie, they're too busy blowing people's brains out. Dafoe occasionally goes a bit over the top in his portrayal of Smecker but honestly this whole movie is about going over the top. Everything is big and bombastic. And bloody. So very, very bloody.Critics will say that the the movie is full of contrivances necessary to make the story work. That's probably true. Some will be turned off by the extreme violence. Some will argue that the whole thing is just one big bloody mess, nothing but a bunch of killing and cursing. It is all rather over the top. But is it too much? Probably not. The movie stops just short of going overboard. We identify with our young Irish vigilantes and root for them. Even if we're not quite sure we should. And even if their characters are never fleshed out particularly well. You really wish there had been more here in terms of actual story. What story there is often gets lost under seemingly gallons of blood. It's easy to see why people would love this movie. It's also easy to see why people would hate this movie. The truth is it's not the greatest thing ever seen, nor is it the worst. It's a reasonably good, entertaining movie packed with plenty of action. OK, it's over the top action but better that than no action at all. It's a movie which certainly has its flaws but there's enough here to make it work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Liberating, isn't it?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a whopping back-story to "The Boondock Saints," one which finds its writer/director, Troy Duffy, becoming an outcast in Hollywood, blowing his potential and alienating just about anyone and everyone who cares about him. Knowing this can be a bit distracting when you watch the film, as you can't help but wonder how differently the film could have turned out had it not been met with so much friction and abuse. Case in point: when Miramax dropped the film in the late 90's, Duffy was forced to make the film with another studio with half of the originally poposed budget. Ouch.Like any director worth his salt, though, Duffy pressed on and in the face of his own self-imposed adversity, crafted a film that has been widely regarded as a cult classic. Starring Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, "The Boondock Saints" tells the wild tale of two Irish brothers who, after a message from a higher power, go on a killing spree, gunning down the criminals who pollute their home-town of Boston. They are met with a mixed reaction of glee and outrage from their fellow citizens as well as a flamboyant FBI special agent hot on their trail, played by the great Willem Dafoe, who steals damn near each and every scene he is in.While the film certainly has a few flaws (mostly dealing with bad pacing issues) the end result is quite a visceral and cathartic experience. The film has a unique take on vigilante justice (Duffy came up with the idea for the film after witnessing a drug-dealer steal money from a corpse) and much like the closing credits which depict the various reactions the Saints are met with by the public, will likely polarize its audience. There's a wealth of ultra-violence and cool shootout scenes are sprinkled throughout, but merely taking its surface appeal away is to do the film a great injustice. In a way, "The Boondock Saints" allows you to live vicariously through its characters, who are only acting in a way that many of us have only dreamed about on our worst day. In the end, it might not accomplish its lofty goals with the greatest of ease, but at the very least, takes entertainment to a whole new level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were to cross Martin Scorcese and Quentin Tarantino, you'd get something like "The Boondock Saints." True, the quality and skill are nowhere near the level of Scorcese's or Tarantino's best films, but that's okay. "The Boondock Saints" has no lofty goals. The only thing that the film is trying to do is create a violent, bloody adrenaline cocktail. And to that end, the film succeeds spectacularly.Boston, modern day. Criminals, mobsters and low-lifes are running amok. Two brothers, Connor (Sean Patrick Flannery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) McManus are the brunt of the latest attack. But when they kill their attackers in self-defense, they're hailed as heroes. But after a number of other criminals start dropping dead by the truckload, agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) begins to realize the truth: the McManus brothers are actually vigilantes.This movie is fun, in an extremely violent sort of way. The appeal of a revenge flick is to experience the thrill of giving the bad guys their just desserts. Stylistically, this is a triumph. The action scenes are beautifully done, and the slow-motion increases the adrenaline. I especially loved the effect where Smecker is inserted into the action when he's explaining how the latest kill went down.The acting is solid. Flannery and Reedus are very credible as brothers. They have a good camaraderie, and they also have a penchant for playing jokes on their friend, "Funny Man" Rocco (David Della Rocco). Rocco is good as their mob flunky friend who joins them. Willem Dafoe is clearly enjoying himself in an off-the-wall performance as the gay Smecker, and he's always fun to watch. The real surprise is Billy Connolly, however. Connolly is known as an adept comedian, but he's actually creepy as the notorious mob killer, Il Duce."The Boondock Saints" had a troubled production history, and most of that had to do with writer/director Troy Duffy. Miramax loved the script so much that they assigned Duffy to direct it, and they signed a record deal with Duffy's band. But Duffy's ego got in the way, and production halted. By the time filming got underway, the budget was cut in half, and the release was heavily restricted due to the Columbine tragedy. However, based on word of mouth, the film became a cult classic.Whatever faults Duffy may have personally, the film looks great, and is a lot of fun to watch. Influences from Tarantino (non-linear storytelling) and Scorcese (Boston setting, Catholicism) are evident, but this film appeals more to our basic instincts than our minds.Call it the ultimate guilty pleasure if you must, but I have no guilt about loving this movie.My rating: Rated R for Strong Bloody Violence and Pervasive Language</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Execution prayer doesn't make it Pulp Fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boondock Saints seems to be mixing styles of Guy Ritchie's twisted British crime stories with funny characters, some of Quentin Tarantino style dialogue and violence (although only the Unrated version is bloody) and loooots of strong language.As the language goes, I have to say that I've seen lots of movies with much higher F-word count, but there seems to be a huge difference between an F-word and an F-word. As long as "Fu*k! Sh*t!" bartender scenes are super funny some of Funny Man's language is just hard to listen to. But enough with that.As the movie goes, it is often compared to Pulp Fiction but the only major similarity I can find is a prayer before killing someone. Boondock Saints don't have the intelligence of Tarantino's writing at all, some dialogues are funny but non of them are that brilliantly written as Pulp Fiction's screenplay.The showing of the story reminds me of Ritchie's "Snatch" - I have to say it is funny to watch both what happened and how the detective thinks it did. There is some hilarious scenes on the way, like the rope one, and some that are really well directed and filmed!Willem Dafoe's acting is really good although I did not like that role that much (espiecially the ending costume part), while the rest of the cast is just good. Nothing stunning for sure.Overall, Boondock Saints is a fun movie, for adults, that seems to be a mix of various styles and a parody of some and that has some good parts but also some pretty big flaws or parts that just could have been than so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been awesome, sadly it just isn't</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being once again dismayed by the ridiculous polarisation of reviewers' opinions on the IMDb I think this movie at least deserves a fair review, so...Personally, I was disappointed by this film. It has a pretty high rating on this website and the story could have been absolute gold in the hands of Tarantino, Ritchie or even Scorcese, but to be honest I found the execution to be fairly mediocre- which I attribute to poor directing. The dialogue is quite uninspired, but I suppose all in all it's solid (the odd good line), however the narrative struggles quite a lot. In fact I, someone who watches this type of movie an awful lot, didn't really know where it was going for the first 25 minutes (but then I don't think the director did either)! 'The Boondock Saints' borrows heavily from the styles of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, and this alone isn't a bad thing. What is a shame is that it often feels borrowed, a bit like it was thought up by a 16 year old A-level student who just saw Pulp Fiction and Lock Stock for the first time. I chuckled two or three times during the movie but on the whole the stuff that was meant to induce laughter was just stupid (i.e. Willem Dafoe's character's oddities).I guess 7/10 is fairly generous, but the idea of this film is fundamentally good- it brings up lots of interesting ideas and the potential for some good scenes. Sadly, the director's attempts at unique style aren't successful. The good cinematography often feels like a copy, and the unique stuff is generally stilted and doesn't add to the movie. But as I opened by saying, in the right hands this movie could have been 9/10 and awesome. Really, I guess I'm just hoping that I'll appreciate it more with a second watch, but I won't find out for a while!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Themes of Justice in Saints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints, a movie about Irish Catholic brothers who transform overnight from low wage workers to vigilantes after a series of unfortunate events turn them into local folk heroes and reveal to them what they believe is a divine mission to rid the world of evil men, brings into question traditional notions of justice and morality and ultimately poses the question of whether it is right to do evil in the name of good.After the brothers manage to kill two mobsters purely out of self-defense, they get elevated to a kind of hero status within the community and are dubbed "saints" and "angels" by the local paper.It is after they turn themselves in but are let go because the killings were clearly in self-defense that the brothers suddenly realize that it is their new mission to rid the world of evil men like the mobsters they killed. They conclude that it is their divine mission to fight against the indifference of good men by being proactive and killing the bad men. The movie calls into question traditional notions of justice by depicting faults in the two most commonly looked-to sources of justice: law and religion. Religion, one commonly recognized source of morality and for understanding what justice is becomes the vehicle that pushes them forward even though it's unlikely that any member of the church would support their actions as just. But, for the brothers themselves, every man they kill is killed in the name of the lord for the sake of justice. And perhaps there is some sort of divine intervention on their side because the brothers are allowed to magically escape unforeseen obstacle after unforeseen obstacle. Meanwhile their Italian friend, a low level mob member named Rocco, who joins with them for a time deciding that their plan and reasoning make sense to him, does not follow the same moral code and also does not receive the same kind of magical protection as the brothers.The justice of law is also critiqued in the film. The police and the courts are both depicted at different points as ineffective. The local police typically have no idea of what's going on. Detective Smecker is not nearly as inept as the local police. But, also is depicted as ineffective to a certain extent because for most of the movie, he is a step behind "the saints" and he is driven to the point of madness by his inability to catch them. However, once he does unravel the mystery, he then faces another crisis after concluding that "the saints" might be filling an important void by destroying the men that law enforcement has been unable to touch.There are also depictions of ineffectiveness with the courts. At one point, the movie shows a parole officer being bribed to allow a dangerous hit-man out on to the streets in order to eliminate the threat to the mob posed by "the saints." Later, in the last scene, "the saints" burst into a courtroom where a mobster is, according to onlookers, about to be found not guilty in order to kill him and make a public example of him.Ultimately, the movie gives no complete answer as to whether the actions of the brothers are just or unjust. Detective Smecker ultimately decides to help "the saints" with their mission but partially because he begins to help them and then feels that he has "gone too far" to stop. "The Saints" themselves even recognize their evil, giving a long public speech in the courtroom that all who "cross over to true corruption" have crossed "into their domain." In this sense, it seems that "the saints" do see their actions as evil but as a necessary evil. Wrong that must be done to combat other wrong. The credits roll while a news station shows average people debating the rightness or wrongness of "the saints'" actions. One person compares the saints to superheroes, stating that if the media continues to portray them as just, kids will soon have pictures of "the saints" on their walls next to Batman and Superman. In a way, this comment also suggests the truth of "the saints," that though the violence is amplified and perhaps less glorified in their case, they are just like Batman and Superman. They are vigilantes who have taken the law into their own hand. And while superheroes are widely celebrated, the more macabre reality of vigilantism portrayed in The Boondock Saints helps the audience to realize that the reality of vigilantism isn't so black and white and the concept of justice is far more complicated than superhero movies would have you believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did a high school or middle school kid write this??!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I'm "one of those" that was told about this movie again and again and again and let the anticipation and expectations build. I could tell within the first 5 minutes that there was something wrong with this movie. When Dafoe's character (not even gonna spend time researching this homosexual acting detective's name..honestly this was the first Dafoe character I COULD NOT WATCH- I was surprised to see him stoop to this level) hands his coat off to the other detective the shot jumps awkwardly (amateur editing). When the Russian mobsters hits the drinks from the 2 main character's hands, they don't even actually show it....like WTF??Why didn't they find the remnants of a broken toilet in the alleyway btw? Why couldn't they shoot the old assassin with 6 guns when he was standing right in the middle of the road if they're so good at what they do??! Didn't they just expertly execute 9 mobsters while hanging upside from a tangled rope (that was very neatly wound and coiled just 2 secs before btw)? I found the dialogue loud and obnoxious. I'm sure it was meant to be that way and some people that it was "awesome" but I just kept turning the volume down, waiting for a reason to continue spending my time watching this. What's with the stupid detective dialogue?? Is it all supposed to make Dafoe look like a genius? How stupid can u be and still become a detective? Again, probably funny to some people...completely obnoxious to me. I have enough respect for great crime movies to know that the detectives and police shouldn't be made to look like total fools unless its slapstick.The prayer they say in unision before they execute the head Russian guy, I'm sure, made tons of people cheer and holler with glee! I laughed at the ridiculousness and cheesiness of it. The music/soundtrack sucked MOST of the time. I wanted to like this movie...but I just felt like I would have to dumb myself down to being a middle school kid giggling and cheering at the "over-the-top-ness" to do so. I couldn't even finish the movie.</fullReview>

A far, far better option would be to watch the documentary 'Overnight' about Troy Duffy, the writer and director of this movie - one of the most obnoxious and delusional slackers ever (I've never seen someone's opinion of their own talent so vastly inflated!).Unless you are Irish, unimaginative, unoriginal, and want a senseless and nonsensical low-budget action movie - in other words, unless you ARE Troy Duffy - you'd be wise to skip this completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too bad, this could have been good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In fact the movie should have been good. It had a good soul. It had a good idea in two underdogs against the Mafia. We even had a semi super star in Dafoe, certainly one with great charisma. In fact, the leading actors all had great charisma. This would have been an epic film in the hands of someone who would just emulate de Mille a little.But Troy Duffy did absolutely everything horrible. Talk about the opposite of de Mille, and that's why it flounders.We begin with the worst music score since "A View to a Kill". The music is one horrible cliché after another, and makes you wonder if it is a comedy. If so, it fails. Duffy never commits to either comedy or action, and that's okay, as long as you know how to inter-splice comic relief. You don't have to follow the Shakespeare formula as closely as the old great directors and writers, but you have to at least be coherent.This movie lacks any coherence, in every way.It is a botched job of directing. We could blame the editing, but the editing is so consistently pathetic, we have to admit it is the director's hand in this. When you have to have a scorecard telling you what is going on, when you have to have a TV set at the stadium to see the ball game, when you have to sneak in your own refreshments, when the fans are mumbling and making unintelligible sounds that give you absolutely no clue as to what is going on, there is no reason to go to the stadium.The movie drags at a horribly modern pace, too. Again, these incompetent directors need to learn from the masters like de Mille and Ford, directors who knew how to keep your interest, who could keep the flow going.There is no way a person can watch this without fast forwarding. It can't be done by someone not on serious drugs. If I was a narcotics officer, I would immediately arrest any one who I witnessed watching this all the way through, because drugs would be GUARANTEED to be found in their system. Of course I couldn't sit and watch a drug crazed zombie watch it all the way through.And it really is too bad. This should have been a good movie. It had all the promise. If only Duffy didn't believe in modern clichés so much, if only a real director and writer could have done this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unknown-named Irish guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why does the killer Irishman just suddenly go from being employed by the mafia to siding with the McManus brothers? Just because he heard them saying an Irish prayer and it made him realize he should change his ways? The movie started well, but its ending was ludicrous. I have the feeling this was one of those movies where the screenwriter thought he had a cool idea at the beginning and just didn't know how to end it. What are viewers supposed to be left thinking with those news interviews at the end? Are we supposed to side with the Saints? Because there's nothing in the movie other than the people at the end that would indicate that their way of thinking is flawed, which it is.I like the moment where one of the brothers (and yes, they are indistinguishable, which makes them crappy characters) tells everyone in the courtroom not to kill, steal, or rape. Then he proceeds to kill a man. Good work not contradicting yourself, buddy. If he read the bible as faithfully as he acts like he does, he'd know that Jesus did not go around blowing people away. Not just because guns didn't exist 2000 years ago, but because that's not what He is about.And like some other people said... Who would look at Willem Dafoe girl-style and believe that is a woman? The same percentage of a population that would believe that white kid in Black Face was really black: zero. Plus what's with making him gay? I have nothing against homosexuals, but his scene with the Asian guy that he calls a faggot adds nothing to the movie other than humor. It does prove that Willem Dafoe is a walking contradiction. . . A cop who supports vigilantism, a homosexual who calls his boyfriend a faggot.And if his character is a contradiction on purpose, then what's the point of the movie? The point would be that people who go on crusades like that are idiots, and I'm pretty sure that's not the point of the movie, judging by how that point of view is not held by any character.</fullReview>

A couple of Christian fundamentalists, so called saints, kill in the name of god to make the world a better place. They continue doing this for the entire movie, terminating to a poor end which opens up for the sequel. The movie without Dafoe is hardly a 2/10. Dafoe does a really excellent job in this movie, proving the immense character capability he has, providing both action and emotion. He carries the story alone as the chief detective from FBI. His lines are excellent and so is his acting. I have never seen him perform better than in this movie. Without him, it would be a b-class movie not worthy of being produced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously, watching this movie once or twice isn't enough to fully understand the contents and the whole meaning of this movie. The moral dilemma in this movie is: Do you have the right to kill to rid the world of evil. The director showed excessive gore only to make us see both sides of the coin. The saints are killing for good, but by killing they become killers them selves. So the director showed gore only to horrify the viewer as to what the saints are doing, which permits us to wonder if what they are doing is right or wrong. (think about it)In the peep show, yes Rocco looks like hes having a little too much fun killing those people, but again lets you choose between right and wrong. And to answer the question of who all the other men in the booths were and why they got killed, well Rocco points out that they are all street walking scum. (there is the explanation)Personally, I loved this movie because it made me think, the camera shots and the filming style was great, the use of flash backs is usually not a very good idea, but they were well used gave more depth to the movie. Senseless gore is usually just funny or disgusting, but in this movie was neither.</fullReview>

Their predisposition towards killing bad guys, probably gleaned from their father, takes off from there and they go after the mob and start killing them off by the truck load.They bring their buddy into the mix who has a scene so funny I was laughing out loud.

		<fullReview>I absolutely love this movie. Lost count of how many times I've watched it over the years. Yeah, there's not much 'plot', I'll agree with that. But it's not meant to be a thoughtful, well-planned commentary. It's meant to be an action movie, with the occasional humor thrown in.It's not really a 'vigilante' movie. It doesn't discuss the 'right' or 'wrong' within the movie itself. Again, if you're looking for a meaningful, or poignant moral ending, this isn't the movie for you. It's a face-paced action movie.I'll admit, I do have a thing for Norman Reedus. I've really enjoyed most of his movies, which probably colored this a little bit for me, as this was one of his first starring roles (or at least, one that took him anywhere). But the idea of the Irish twin brothers who basically stumble into this job of cleaning up the streets of Boston is an interesting twist on things.I guess at the end of the day, I don't know WHY exactly this is my favorite movie...

		<fullReview>I was introduced to this movie many years ago, and while it was fun the first time, it's only gotten better with repeated viewing. The cinematography stands out as superb, the direction and pacing of the story excellent, the characters just great. It isn't perfect, and I can see how some people would think it was trying too hard, but it's not like Pulp Fiction wasn't trying just as hard, and it pulled off the coolness necessary to make it work. By and large, this succeeds as well.There are some hilarious one-liners in here, so long as you don't get uptight about political correctness. Half the words spoken by Rocco seem to have a tendency to make people shoot beer out of their noses when I'm watching this with friends. It was made for seven million bucks, and no other action film comes close to its value. Amazing introduction to Troy Duffy. The moral tone of the movie, well, obviously justice is a bit more complex than that, but it's a MOVIE, and the perspective of it is engrossing.Speaking of which, I'll betray some bias of the best kind: While stationed in Africa, Troy Duffy, Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick Flannery, and Brian Mahoney paid us a visit as an MWR function. MWR stuff can be lame, but servicemen LOVE this movie and someone figured that out. The troops were besides themselves, myself included. The four spent several days with us, and I had the unusual experience of watching Boondock 1 and 2 with the cast hanging around, drinking, BS-ing with everyone as if they lived there. I talked to all of them, with Troy and Brian quite a bit. Flannery does combatives, and rolled with the combatives club on base. Troy sent a friend of mine, an aspiring writer, screenplays and script software after they left. They're a fantastic group of guys. If this colors my perspective too much for the review to be taken seriously, all I can offer is that I'd seen the film probably more than twenty times before that deployment and my opinion was just as high before. But, man, it doesn't hurt that I like these people.</fullReview>

Willem Dafoe plays the detective trying to figure out the killings, but the closer he was to catching the Irish brothers, the more he thinks the brothers are doing the right thing I was bored senseless by this "supposed" cult classic. It's flamboyant, raucous style was not too my liking. Dafoe in my opinion delivers an an annoying, OTT performance that only made me annoyed by the film even more.Performances Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors but I hated him here. He was way too OTT in my opinion, over acting his role to epic proportions. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are both annoying leads, who I didn't get all the hoo-ha about.Bottom line. I've avoided the sequel for good reason. I'll see it sooner or later but after this disappointment I don't have high hopes for it. Loud leads, dull pace and overacting ruined this one for me. Due to the reputation that proceeds it, you'll probably want to see this though.3/10</fullReview>

After the movie characters - two Irish brothers - met with the same thugs at home in his apartment, and very pathetic kill them. For this they get into a prison cell and there, quote, "One day they was enlightened: God himself had sent them to the ground on a special mission by giving the holy power to cleanse the world from evil." So in other words, based on two adult man Hard beds in a cool jail cell and then sleep through them becomes the Almighty with the message "soak in all the scum in the city." There. Such a description ... Stop! I find the idea of a plot of this movie stupid? You know, after you read the description for this film, I think you should not watch the whole thing to see that the very stupid idea of this cold,rustic and too sluggish thriller from director Troy Duffy, the way other producer and founder of Miramax, "Harvey Weinstein, which was the sole cause of the birth of this film.After the failure of the "saints" in movie theaters and a release on DVD in the circles of the audience this movie was mistakenly recognized as a "cult" and even replete with reviews in the style of the same in the spirit of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie! ". Stupid and I'll explain why. The film, for all his, as I wrote, it's silly and delusional story devoid of at least some self-irony, witty black humor (which is so characteristic of Guy Ritchie), interesting quotes to classic movies past (it just did could bring together the tape with the style of Quentin Tarantino ) and in the end at least some charm. Apparently the words "in the style of Tarantino's" man in the street understands only the criminal theme of the plot, and a dozen flat "black" jokes.More on the story ...At some point, the brothers are taking to his team a third, more "manic" Saint, Rocco (aka actor David Della Rocco), who gives the film a sour, sexist charge from which he would never be able to get out.Now a team of FBI interest in the saints, in particular Detective Paul Smeker (Defoe), which differs from many other detectives strange behavior. Every time he appears on the scene, where our heroes are visited by the Irish, it comes with a "psychic" connection and repeats all the movements performed by them on the spot. All this takes place under nice-awful "Slow-mo, the sounds of moaning chorus of mourning and pouring the detective later.Of course, all that pathos of the shootings, and in particular the final credits may cause an ordinary viewer reflex reaction to the perception of the entire movie as a brilliant criminal fighters, and even socially important (!!!) movie that anyone over thirty will cause confusion.Troy Duffy, a properly noticed by a film critic, this man whom Tarantino would not want to become. During his career he managed to remove only two films, and even despite good sales of DVD and the status of "cult" producers do not want to have anything to do with him, including his friend, one of the founders of Miramax. For this film, at best, be treated as a pitiful parody of "Hard Boiled" in John Woo's "deceptive" wrapped the independent film era of the 90 Sundance Film Festival.</fullReview>

After the shootout scene where The Funny Man gets his finger shot off and Bill Connelly manages not to get hit with one bullet, I couldn't watch it anymore.

		<fullReview>"When the sadistic Russian mob starts muscling in on their South Boston Irish neighborhood, Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) know what must be done. Feeling that the vengeance of God is flowing through their veins, they set out to rid the streets of gangsters, criminals, and lowlifes. As the body count rises, the brothers became local heroes. Now, one unorthodox FBI agent must be cunning enough to bring them down," according to the film's distributor.Trouble is, detective Willem Dafoe (as Paul Smecker) agrees with the vigilantes! ?and so would you, as evidenced in the film's coda.Troy Duffy's "The Boomtown Saints" challenges the Catholic Church's observance of the "Thou shalt not kill" commandment. It's an effectively stated thesis, but not new. The violent style is reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's groundbreaking "Reservoir Dogs" (1992). Indeed, you're advised you will "thrill to the action, intensity and intelligence of this modern day morality tale written in blood" if you took pleasure in lying with "Dogs". One of the gory highlights involves a hot iron, but with no sizzle.The nicely-cast brothers could have stood a little more characterization. Coming on like a masculine David Bowie, Mr. Dafoe telegraphs his character's big secret (if it is one, hard to tell) too early; he keeps his ties clean, too. With an uncanny ability to make hair-conscious henchman Ron Jeremy and hungry mob boss Carlo Rota laugh at bad jokes, "funnyman" David Della Rocco and the crew have enough fun to make it occasionally contagious - if you like catching this sort of sickness.***** The Boondock Saints (8/4/99) Troy Duffy ~ Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus, Billy Connolly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading so much about this cult classic, I was rather underwhelmed after watching the pic for the first time. I bought the Unrated Special Ed and viewed it last night. During my screening, I quickly thought of Gary Fleder's "Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead" which starred Andy Garcia, Chris Walken and Steve Buscemi. Both films are quirky, tongue-in-cheek gangster flicks and yet the former did not gain the cult following like Troy Duffy's violent, profane thriller did. I even found Guy Ritchie's "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" to be a more enjoyable and accomplished film.Yes, "Saints" does have style and a pulpy premise (twin brothers who want to rid the world of evil), but I was expecting a lot more in terms of execution. One of the disappointments for me came from the lack of watching the brothers go to work. Their murders are shown as flashbacks and I believe a wiser choice would've been to depict them in "real time". More suspense and visceral thrills would've been the result, at least I think.In the end, I believe it lacks freshness. Not bad for a first time director, but Duffy is an ego-maniac that seriously killed his own career. So sadly, we won't see a second film from him that probably would've been even better. ** 1/2 stars out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a terrible film, but it's certainly no masterwork. It is abundantly obvious that it was put together by a first time writer/director struggling to find a voice and a style. He tries out some John Woo, some Scorsese, a lot of Tarantino, and innumerable other imitations, and the result is a confused mish mash. Individual scenes are not badly done, but they don't gel when taken as a whole. Often we are left with little sense of where we are or how we got there. There are huge leaps of narrative logic that are very difficult to accept. The dialogue is sometimes clever, and at other times tries too hard to be.That being said, some of the acting is excellent, especially from Sean Patrick Flannery whose Irish accent seems flawless and whose performance is intense and likeable. Willem Dafoe is very good, though sometimes over the top. And some scenes are genuinely funny, others genuinely exciting.But it's hard to overlook the film's unabashed glorification of vigilante violence. It makes a feeble, half-hearted attempt to show the other side of the argument during the ending credits, but it feels tacked on and, like many other parts of the film, doesn't mesh with the rest very well. Mostly the film revels in behaviour that is morally questionable and made me more than a little uncomfortable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is simply the best bad film ever. i show it to my friends and they all wet themselves laughing at it. It is one of the stupidest, most derivative, badly acted, badly written and badly directed films ever. And therein lies its brilliance. It simply has to be seen. And being Irish myself, the accents are a joy to behold. particularly Norman Reedus' speech in the courtroom, where he goes from bad Irish, to welsh, to Pakistani, to Australian, and best of all, ends with Jamaican Rastafarian. one of the worst films ever made, go see it. It really does give plan 9 from outer space a run for it's money. PS. Having read some of the other comments by people who have both taken this film seriously, and enjoyed it, I'm very afraid for the future of the human race</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Boondock Saints" tells of twin brother Irish-Catholics in Boston who turn vigilante and begin offing bad guys all over town while FBI agent Dafoe follows in their wake. A B-flick with good production value, a mediocre cast, a stupid story, and awful comedy, this flick has one man indie written all over it. A sort of simple-minded "Pulp Fiction" wanabee, "The Boondock Saints" is just a whole bunch of uninspired gratuitous violence which should play well in trailer parks all over the US. (C)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the best action movie with the worst title, in history, The Boondock Saints kicks ass. Conor and Murphy McManus, the brilliant Sean Patrick Flanery(later, so good in Powder), and Norman Reedus, are two good Irish Catholic boys, who, after attending mass, stop at a bar to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. While tossing back a few, they witness three Russian mobsters threatening the owner with plans to close the place for land development. A brawl ensues, and the Soviet bad men attack the brothers at their apartment. The Celts kill them and are then targeted by the associates of the dead men.Willem Dafoe appears as Paul Smecker, a gay FBI agent who gets the case and he finds that the pair of vigilantes have become public heroes. His first interview with them reveals the fact that they have been taught several languages, so that they can communicate with the Russian criminals easily. A low level mobster errand boy, Rocco joins the boys after they receive a message from God to kill the wicked, so that the innocent will flourish. They obtain automatic weapons and kill nine of the Russians, including the boss, Petrov. They shoot him from the back of the head at an angle, so that the bullets come out of his eyes. They then place coins over the eyes to pay the toll for the River Styx; very poetic. The killings escalate to the point where a big boss, Papa Joe, hires an infamous hit man,Il Duce, to execute the two heroes. The assassin is played by Billy Connolly, who is brilliant, and a big secret is revealed, which is a stroke of genius by the writer-director, Troy Duffy. A definite Pulp Fiction influence can be seen in Boondock Saints, and it is equally entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well......I wasn't crazy about Rocco....he was just too hyper/crazy for me. Why would the brothers want to let him in on their shoot the bad guys deal? He wasn't reliable...too crazy. Plus, the Rocco character was willing to shoot "good" men, not just bad ones and that was against the brother's plan or ideals. For those who aren't crazy about different things in the movie...remember, the actors are only what the director will show or to a point, allow and of course the writers...which in this case is the same person I believe. As far as the brothers, they were interesting. And, Sean Patrick Flanery should be in WAY MORE MOVIES...PERIOD.....he is such a good actor. Not bad to look at either. Don't know why he hasn't been in bigger movies, unless it is by choice. Need to watch the Saints II movie now...haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keep repeating to yourself. It's a black comedy. It's a black comedy. If you look at the "Boondock Saints" from any other angle than darkly humorous, it will not hold up. If you consider how over the top the characters are, starting with William Dafoe, then it all makes sense. For pure entertainment, if you can live with the violence, there is a lot to enjoy here. There is nothing subtle about this film, but it just keeps digging up surprises as it goes along. I mean, the flying toilet and splat cat are true classics. So quit chirping about this isn't realistic, and that could never happen, and start repeating. It's a black comedy. It's a black comedy. - MERK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, a little hard to follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it was just me, but the other three people I watched this with also found it a little hard to follow. That aside it was a rather good film. Two Irish brothers decide to rid Boston of the evil men - the mafia, hit men etc. (I'm not sure if the woman who is mentioned at the very start, who was murdered while others did nothing, is the mother of the brothers and therefore their motivation - it wasn't clear). Anyway, the guys go around killing the bad guys and manage to get away with it. Willem Dafoe plays the FBI agent who is trying to solve the case. He appears in one scene in drag, looking a bizarre mix of attractive and ugly. Billy Connelly also turns up as an assassin. There is another man too, "Funny Man", who helps the brothers in their quest only he's not very good at shooting, nor very discreet. There is a great scene where Smecker (Dafoe) explains what he thinks happened at a crime scene, where he enacts it along with the actual shooters. There is also a rather cringe-inducing scene where the men use an iron to cauterize their cuts and bullet wounds. The opinion of the people of Boston is split between them being saints (Boondock saints y'see) or being just as bad as the people they are trying to get rid of. I will add a point on for Willem Dafoe in drag, but I have to deduct a few for being a little hard to follow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the top, Over this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything about this movie screams excess, from the excessive cursing to the excessive overacting (Willem Dafoe), to the excessive use of black and white frames and slow motion sequences. This movie never settles down into a groove. Each scene remains experimental, as Duffy is constantly fiddling with his camera to make a more dramatic and artsy feature. The acting by Norman Reedus was not the best. If I had a dollar for everytime he broke his Irish accent, I'd have like 20 bucks. Easy Money. After the first half of this movie, I found myself in a similar situation as when I saw the movie Swordfish: What else are they going to try to fit in this film? While it does have its moments, this movie can rank up there with Scarface as movies overflowing with excess, but can still find its way into the heart of its viewers. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth Seeing...I Guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time last night after it had been recommended by a lot of people. I don't generally like movies like this where you have a couple of guys who try to be super-cool and shoot whoever they want but still appeal to the audience by their wit and snide remarks. This film was much like Pulp Fiction in this way, but it didn't even come close to what Tarantino did. First, for all you people who said it had great religions overtones, just because the movie's two main characters are Catholic and wear Rosaries around their necks (which is sacreligious anyways), and cross themselves before going into action, and say some prayer ending with "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit" in Latin doesn't mean the movie gives some strong religious message. Yeah, they were ridding the world of evil and some would say they are doing God's work by getting rid of all the evil men in a city. But, I didn't see anywhere where they were granted permissioin to be God and decide who lives and dies. Most people call that blasphemy. So, if there was a deep religious message that I'm missing please tell me, but for now 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight, entertaining "pulp movie." A little overrrated by its fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't be a bit suprised if "The Boondock Saints" had been based on a comic strip. It's made with the same tongue-in-cheek / morality tale method that befits "Spiderman" and "X-Men." The result is something similar to these movies; an exciting, technically proficient popcorn movie. It's a pulp movie, the kind you throw away a few bucks on when you want to watch a movie without having to think too much, but you don't want your intelligence to be insulted either. What's interesting about this film is that so many people insist that it's something more. I admit that it is starkly original in it's characters. The closest relatives to the brothers i can think of are ben affleck and matt damon in dogma, which is a stretch. But this is still essentially a super hero movie. The acting is over the top, the direction is frenetic, violence is common, and the inherently mysterious qualities of the characters allow for any kind of plot twists the director wants. This is a good film by a young, excited filmmaker, but is far from a thoughtful and important reflection on vigilantism and religious fervor. It's little more than a cool action movie, but it's still a very cool action movie. Enjoy, but enjoy for what it is, and then go watch "Taxi Driver" or Godard's "Breathless" if you want to take a film seriously.By the way, I haven't read all of the reviews of this film on imdb.com, since there are over 200, but none of the one's i've read mentioned this film being withheld after the Columbine massacre. I normally don't spport anything resembling censorship, but not releasing this film was an extremely tactful move by the studio. Releasing it would have been more tasteless than Charlton Heston's NRA rally in Denver. It was as untimely as a film could possibly be and the studio made a good decision. It also was probably best the best thing for the film, since it probably would've been dismissed a lot more quickly with a traditional release and not have developed the cult following it enjoys. All the same, I'm looking forward to seeing what the Saints will be up to in the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boondock Saints is something I'd heard a lot of good things about. As with most films you hear that about, you have to check for the reviewer's taste in movies beforehand. Most people liked Pulp Fiction and said this was up there with that. I figured it would be a drop-off and upon viewing the film, still think so. The plot is good, direction good at times (music is used way past the point of necessity or style, but ok), but the script.... the script was just too hammy for me. You've got several scenes with a room full of characters and every single one of them is a wise ass. There is nothing wrong with being a wise ass of having a room full of wiseasses in their own way, but it was almost like a room full of cliches. You've got the smart-mouth FBI agent without a serious bone in his body, the Boston PD he harasses who take it no matter what like they are missing a pair, two wise-ass brothers, a pop-off sidekick who's not all there, and so on and so on. I know it is unfair to compare this to Pulp Fiction because they are about different plots but this film mimics PF in style (again, sometimes to the point of nausea), but PF has some serious overtones in it. When Jules is giving his bible speech before killing a guy in PF, you know he means it. In BS, when the brothers give a similar speech, it is almost comedic. But the film does not seem to be a real farce stylistically (except for the funny obligatory shoulder-spread-out shot when DaFoe is talking about the "big shoot-out"). I don't know if it was trying to be funny or serious. And that's the big flaw the script has in my opinion.If you're tired of watching PF for the 1,000th time, watch this. If you have not seen PF or Resovoir Dogs, catch those first. And catch them a few more times, as repeated viewing of those is still better than BS. But if when you have seen them a few times, then read the beginning of this paragraph. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I ain't one of those people that worship this movie, but that still isn't to say it's a fun ride. Okay so the premise of the film is about 2 Irish-American brothers Conner MacManus(Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus(Norman Reedus) who are blessed by God or they are portrayed to be, going around killing evil men. The movie also has some similarities with some comic books especially the characters, which isn't a bad thing since the direction they go with it, isn't very realistic and far fetched like some comic books. The main complaints for me is the character Rocco, the guy is one obnoxious and annoying weasel. And to top it off he is on the good guys team or anti-heroes to a degree, plus you just end up disliking him compared to every bad guys in the film. And it seems the director rushed the ending when wrapping it all up. To sum it up your either going to worship it, like it or hate it.7.9/10</fullReview>

In a display of good vs evil, the cry for angels/heroes to come save us, we are brought into the lives of two brothers brought to life through the heart and soul of gifted actors. We are wrapped up in a storyline that begs the question, "Do we become vigilant, or do we do nothing?" This movie goes above and beyond words and images of what lies within heroes and why this world needs them, and as we close our eyes, fold our hands, hope and faith touch our lips. And we silently call for the Boondock Saints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film and I really enjoyed it. The premise is simple - vigilante brothers clean up the town. Boondock Saints differentiates itself with its hilarious script. Keep your expectations reasonable though. The writing is funny, but it's not deep and the character development is light. The villains are one dimensional and idiotic.I liked William Dafoe's character a lot with the exception of the weird dance sequences. The script is so funny. It's just hilarious how Troy lampoons action movie clichés.There's a lot of over the top action in the movie that requires you to suspend your belief, which shouldn't be too hard. We've all been trained to believe that James Bond can dodge thousands of bullets by jogging for over five decades.In a nutshell: it's like an action movie with a funny bone.ps - for those who watch anime - you'll find plenty of 'borrowing' in the OVA Mezzo Forte</fullReview>

I see why it's compared to Tarantino, even though they're different styles.With flashbacks, high energy violence, and Irish accents that slip in and out of gear, it reminds me of Guy Ritchie movies, but better. I was rooting for the brothers and so is Willem Dafoe, really far out as a gay FBI agent. Too bad I don't see him in the credits for the sequel. He really takes the film over the top into another territory. And if you watch the deleted scenes on the DVD you see that everyone on the set has a great sense of humor.

		<fullReview>"The Boondock Saints" is a cult classic that went straight to DVD. The movie takes place in Boston and follows twin Irish boys Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy McManus (Norman Reedus). After a conflict with a Russian gang that ends with three of the members dead, the brothers decide to turn themselves in to the cops. Rather than being treated as criminals they were proclaimed heroes for cleaning up the streets of its garbage. The brothers decide to continue to kill off other criminals with the help of their buddy Rocco (David Della Rocco), but in the process grabbing the attention of detective Paul Smecker (William Dafoe). The main theme director (Troy Duffy) is using throughout the movie is the indifference in good men; it is even mentioned in the beginning of the movie in a sermon. I believe that Duffy is trying to let this thought linger in the minds of his audience. What if all of society was to just go and kill people that they believe are evil? Who can really decide who is good and evil, or if their actions are justified? This is a very controversial topic that has people choosing sides, but there is no real answer, so this argument will never end. At the end of the movie, they interview people and ask them how they feel about the Saints. This is a good example of how people have different opinions on the subject. The way they show the gun fight scenes is different than most movies. They don't just show them shooting people; rather they show it from the detective's point as he is putting the scene together in his head hours later. This brilliant movie wasn't shown in theaters because the tragic event of Columbine that took place in 1999. Just because this movie didn't make it to the big screen doesn't mean you should miss out on one of the best movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember when I first heard about this movie. I was in high school and my friend was super-excited about some unknown movie he had seen at some random party in some other town. He was quick to show me the movie, and I gotta say, it was awesome.The movie follows Connor and Murphy MacManus, Irish brothers living out in Boston. After a run-in with a couple of thugs from the Russian mob, the brothers come to the realization that they've been given some kind of divine role as bringers of justice. From then on, they begin hunting down the mob scum of south Boston piece by piece with FBI agent Paul Smecker on their trail.You can't watch this movie without noticing the fantastic casting choices. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus have perfect chemistry as brothers, and Willem Dafoe is the highlight of this flick. Even unknowns like David Della Rocco have great charisma and keep you cheering for the Saints. The fantastic actors in this movie are enough to make you overlook Ron Jeremy's appearance (though his acting was perfectly natural in the Sin Bin scene, hah). On top of a fantastic cast, I thought the story was well written and I loved Troy Duffy's method of revealing the events in nonlinear fashion. The investigations made for some of the best parts.This movie has a great cast, cool action scenes, and humor. Honestly, I'm not surprised that this film became some kind of cult classic. I noticed when I moved out and went to college in 2004 that everyone owned a copy of this movie, as if it was standard issue. I'm not going to argue whether or not the movie is over-rated, because I feel it is. I wouldn't go so far as to say this movie is one of the best ever, but it's definitely entertaining and worth watching at least once. It definitely lives up to its hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I call this a 'mood' film: you have to be in a certain mood before you can watch it. It is a bit out of the ordinary, a 'different' kind of film. There's nothing wrong with that - far from it. But it is a risk for any film-maker, and in this case I'm not sure it quite comes off.The story centres around two young Irish brothers who embark on a vigilante shooting spree to kill all the crime lords of the city. In doing so they display huge creativity and a strict moral code which wins support in the community and even in the police force which is always hot on their tails.The film's low budget status is signposted by the casting of unknown actors Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the main protagonists, but they acquit themselves well - even looking plausibly related and giving a good portrayal of the quixotic relationship that exists between two close brothers. Willem Defoe, however, steals the film as the off-beat detective in hot pursuit, while Billy Connolly provides the curiosity factor by appearing as the crime lord of all crime lords - complete with cod Irish accent.Now, I am a huge fan of Conolly's stage performances. I have followed his career since I was a boy, and I genuinely think he is one of the funniest people on the planet. But I have never really bought his film and TV roles, and his role here is a classic example of that. He is not on screen for long but his character is pivotal to the plot - especially towards the end - and his deficiencies as an actor become increasingly obvious and undoubtedly harm the whole enterprise, undoing a lot of the good work that has been done in building up the first half of the film.Because there is good stuff here. It is funny, original, unpredictable and thought-provoking. It is also very violent - but not in the gratuitous, unpleasant sense. It's an intelligent film, meant for an intelligent audience. The smart, stylish direction doesn't give you much time to ponder - it's not a film you can nip out in the middle of and make a cup of tea - but the furious pace keeps you glued to the screen and wondering just what will happen next. At half way through, I already knew it wasn't going to be a classic, but I definitely wanted to keep watching until the end.What ultimately lets the film down, apart from Connolly's bizarre performance as 'Il Duce,' is the script. Tight and funny in parts, it seems at times to lose focus and in a film which is not the easiest to follow at the best of times, that is not an endearing characteristic.I wonder if I'm being a bit harsh in giving 'The Boondock Saints' a score of 5. It is probably a bit better than that. But I return to my original point: if you are in the mood to see something a bit different, then you will definitely get something out of this one. If not, and if you're looking for a nice relaxing movie to unwind in front of after a long day, you're likely to find it a bit irritating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that people worship this movie. However, it is quite formulaic with some social dialogue that makes people happy. Everyone likes seeeing the guys who can kick arse in any situation and justify their killings. Everyone likes a cause behind what they are doing, especially, as i said, if it is social. But COME ON...this was no Fight Club or Taxi Driver, just a fun actionmovie with a little more thought put into it and some good lines. Feelfree to disagree and tell me why this movie is considered so great.That goes for the fanatics as well, I am dissing it to be obnoxious, I just feel that maybe I missed something. ~Benjy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 cents more to the bank of piggies.adjective quick list: unoriginal. overrated. inconsistent. sometimes sharp and well done, sometimes completely silly and shoddy, hi-testosterone without equal intelligence or craft, engaging, interesting, fun. first thoughts on this film.. unoriginal, not particularly intelligent, as i expected it would be from it's holy status. and the music for the most part made some scenes so stupidly macho, and was so mismatched to the scene and the feel it was ridiculous. generic stock metal and buttrock?!? what the hell are you thinking? William Dafoe's character didn't work for me at all.. until maybe the middle of the movie when his role shifted from cool know-it-all fbi agent to individual. prior to that i thought his character was far-fetched, unbelievable, and silly. as far as the idea of this movie's high moral content and provocative religious theme; while it was handled smoothly, none of this is new or thought provoking, raise questions? did the movie really get inside you, where you are thinking about the issues for days after?? no. the quality of the film-making was average, writing average, and it was really inconsistent. but it has classic quotable lines, and some great comedic moments, and the chemistry of the actors and the overall flow of the film was excellent. also loved seeing an atypical gay character on screen, very refreshing. great performance by rocco. also enjoyed some of the the murphy brothers characters emotion and sensitivity, gave the characters more dimension.a fun romp, but not very memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The tight line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the wake of Tarantinos huge success in the "violence-with-humor" genre there has been tons of these movies. Boondock saints i would rate as one of the more entertaining.Two Irish twins in Boston have a run-in with Russian mobsters. This cause them to have a revelation. They are the ones to rid the city of it's criminal elements. Soon afterward they set out on a vigilante-spree to kill the mobsters having a hold of Boston.Boondock saints is stylishly made with a dark sense of humor that occasionally hits the spot and occasionally comes off as "too much". The violence is gritty and dirty, the language is filled with "f"-words left and right. Standard post-Pulp Fiction fare in other words. What makes this stand out is not only it's well-made action scenes but also it's very ambiguous view on morality. The opinion that you are allowed to kill anyone you want to as long as you only kill bad people. A simplified view shared no doubt by many people sitting too much in front of their TV:s. I won't elaborate on this, but it is something that could (and should) disturb a lot of people. And it's also an interesting question to think about, whether the goals justify the means so to speak.In the end this is a movie that runs a tight line between stylish and tasteless. And i'm not sure which side it ends up on. I found it to be entertaining though and recommend it to viewers who are not too squeamish. I rate it 6/10.</fullReview>

In simple terms it was a GOOD film, not bad, not great just GOOD. I realise it has a cult following but it really was pretty ordinary. The cheesyness of some of the dialouge makes it interesting, as does the ridiculously over the top action scenes. However the fact that it never takes its self too seriously is its saviour in the end. It funny, stupid, and over the top - a good night in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its, well, different, think Frailty meets lock stock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Parts of this movie I liked and found very humorous. Other parts I thought were awful. I did not like the acting, others said they thought it was great, I disagree. The plot is horrendous. Its not believable at all because it is full of as many bullet holes as are found at the crime scenes.I feel this movie is trying so hard to be like lock stock, and tarantino and trying to impart some originality as well. It succeeds at this, but it tries WAY too hard at it. You can feel it the whole movie as they try to capture the vibe of those movies, but never quite nail it. Pulp fiction and lock stock and other crime movies have this cool feeling to them. I don't get that from this movie, its too silly to take seriously and that's my main problem with it. The gun fights are not believable. Look at the scene with "The Duke" where they all basically stand there and blast away and with ~100 of shots fired, only about 3 ever find their mark. This is not real life. Someone comes after me I'm going to find some cover, not stand in the open and if I'm this great shot, as they are depicted and the duke is depicted previously, I'm going to hit a little more than 3/100.Also the brothers consistently escaping from handcuffing is unbelieavable as well.The religious aspects are poorly done. The concept in Frailty is very similar to this movie, and it handles the religious aspect MUCH better.This could have been a much better movie, I like the idea, but the plot has too many holes and the religious aspect is handled poorly, I like the style of it, but it can't capture the vibe of the movies it emulates, I like the way the violence is handled, but its not believable, I like the humor, but it is too off the wall and prevents me from taking the movie seriously, I like the characters but they are overacted. I also grew really tired of hearing the F word every 2 seconds. They could have said fluffy bunnies for all I care, it doesn't matter, but hearing the same word every 2 seconds gets REALLY annoying after 1.5 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is a fun movie. I just finished watching it again, and I have seen it several times since I purchased it six months ago. One thing I noticed this time was that it is fairly detail-oriented, and the way that the plot unfolds differently from the way that the events proceeded can be confusing. Many things important to the plot are more or less mumbled. So my suggestion: don't watch this one when there are people walking in and out of the room, because I found myself explaining what happened many times.That said, the movie is not so difficult once you get used to it, and it's a wild ride from start to finish. With strong violence, this movie conveys a message that is slightly more elevated than other action flicks, in that it recognizes the gratuity of its own brutality. The frequent references to movie and television heroes soften the holiness of the protagonists by showing that they have learned not truly from religion, but from pop culture. Despite this, the religion in the film adds an interesting angle.The acting is sometimes rough, but both Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus look and sound perfect for their characters. Willem Dafoe goes overboard sometimes but also does his character convincingly. Rocco provides some comic relief that actually fits quite well into the film. The rest of the characters are pretty insignificant but play the parts of scum in an effective (if satirical) way.The score is great, very energetic and fun, much like the film itself. The cinematography is as cool as can be expected from the budget, of which I know nothing but the film as a whole gives the impression that it was not large.Despite its religious overtones, don't expect a movie about morals or philosophy, which is brushed over as good is pitted against evil in a somewhat typical way. One difference is that this time the good guys are hunting down the bad guys to kill them, whereas in most films the bad guys do the hunting, or the good guys hunt but don't kill, or the good guys end up kiling without hunting. While the plot of the film is interesting, it is not revolutionary, and even its good ideas are somewhat mitigated by its overall roughness. To summarize, don't expect a brilliantly intelligent film, but if you're in the mood for a serious action movie with likeable heroes and a knack for humor, this one is a good choice.

		<shortDescription>Too over the top and silly to be taken seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day in the last few years, I rented "Reservoir Dogs." Great movie. Well, it so happens that blockbuster recommended seeing "The Boondock Saints" if you enjoyed Reservoir Dogs. So, unwittingly, I decided to rent it as well.I can't put any blame on the actors, as they all did their job very well. The problem is the script. This movie had great potential to be taken seriously, but so many scenes just kill the whole thing. The two main characters, Irish twins, are given a message from god that they are to clean up the city. It would be interesting pyschologically if one brother had the vision, but they both had it at the same moment, sitting up in bed at the same time. It's a fantasy element, any way you look at it.Willem Dafoe, the only actor who I knew in this movie, probably had the only interesting role in the film. He plays a crime scene investigator with a nearly psychic talent for putting together what happened in the said crime scenes. There's a depth to his character, and though it's very silly, is also very dramatic (as opposed to the main characters, who aren't deep or dramatic.)I hate to ruin the movie for anybody (even though the writers did that already, ha ha ha... ahem,) so I won't give away any scenes. It goes to say though that the feats performed by the characters are absolutely ridiculous at times. Scenes involving physically impossible stunts and luck that no noir character has ever had before give "The Boondock Saints" a horrible feeling of implausibility that neither Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs suffered from.All in all, "The Boondock Saints" has to be taken as a fantasy movie, which is something I wasn't prepared for in the first place. If you liked "From Dusk 'till Dawn" (which I didn't... I mean, I love cheech marin, but three roles in one movie?,) then you'll like Boondock Saints. Don't pay money for it expecting to see a true noir film.</fullReview>

But really, the self-righteous crap people are posting like they're the experts has got to stop. Empirically, were one to judge this movie on its own, without comparing it to Woo, Tarantino, Ritchie, etc. etc. etc. then you know what?

		<shortDescription>Cult Classic With Good Reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The streets of Boston... who knew they were such a violent place? Besides the Irish hooligans, there seems to be an influx of the Russian mafia. Well, the police don't seem to be doing much about it, so enter the McManus brothers: they are about to become homegrown heroes as the Boondock Saints, and they don't give a damn about following the rules.This film, after bombing in theaters, become a cult classic in the world of rentals. My friend Nate got a tattoo based off this film, and there's at least one band that has sampled the memorable line "There was a firefight!" For years, many had recommended this one to me, and I never got around to it. But then when my friend Melissa suggested it, I was quick to give it a try, as I respect her opinion for some reason. It was a good idea, as the film is very enjoyable.Critically, the film is not very well-regarded, in contrast to the fan base. I'm not really clear why. The primary complaint seems to be that it's nothing more than one violent scene after another with little plot. I think that's a valid concern, but exaggerated, and it ignores the fact that the violence is really the central theme of the film. The Saints can do what the police cannot. And like "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", this film appeals to those who like mob and crime films, not someone who wants a complex drama.There's plenty to enjoy besides the glorious violence, such as Willem Dafoe's unusual FBI agent character that is almost psychic and has a love of cross-dressing. And there's some moral and ethical questions here. We generally accept that murder is wrong, but what about here? If the Russian mafia can be brought to trial and released by corrupt judges, traditional justice cannot keep them from returning to a life of crime. Does this open the possibility for vigilante justice and murder of the guilty? I think this film is worth watching. I did not get around to it until ten years after its initial release, and it lost nothing in the process. This is not a 1990s movie, or a movie that would appeal to me only ten years ago. It is as strong now as it ever was, and will likely continue to be strong. If you don't like blood and potty language, avoid this one... but beyond that it's pretty intense in its awesomeness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints was a film a couple of times while watching it (not early on, but midway through and around the last twenty minutes) I wanted to turn off, but I didn't as I wanted to see what might happen next. Perhaps that's from the crime/action film fan I am, but the set-up to the film is a hook: the MacManus brothers (Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus) are regular Catholic church-goers who also frequent the local pub. One day, after contemplating that God does not rid the world of the ones who are really the wrongdoers, they go out and do it themselves- quasi-vigilantes with a kind of spiritual morality at their sides. The mobsters that they're wiping out are connected, and it leads to an investigation being started by the eccentric/gay Detective played by Willem Dafoe, and also an all-out-war escalating with the hiring of a crazy killer (Billy Connolly) on their trails. So, for the first fifteen to twenty minutes of watching the film, the hook had me in, and while I didn't think of it as particularly dynamite film-making, it did attempt at a realistic beginning of the lead's lives and conflicts. This, unfortunately, did not hold. The problem with how The Boondock Saints unfolds is that at many points in the film it doesn't know how to balance the elements of comedy and tragedy, and gets morality mixed up in it all. One reviewer said its like Natural Born Killers with a moral. But un-like NBK, the film doesn't have any particular 'point' to make, up until the end which becomes very muddled. For example, the Willem Dafoe character- he plays this role wildly, sometimes smoothly, and in some scenes he basically held the framework together. But the script doesn't give him much else to go; is he funny, operatic, for real? Writer/Director Troy Duffy has him chasing his tail every which way. Unlike in a smarter, more experimental film like NBK, Duffy in an ironic sense plays it safe with the story. The script has also been compared to Tarantino, and that is a relevant comparison to make. The film-making style itself is not necessarily a QT knockoff (too many big-style camera moves, and a poor soundtrack sorry to say, there isn't much patience or true daring), but the script does have that sort of realm of it. The F-word is tossed around like candy; the bad-asses in the film are made out to look like 'real' bad-asses (see Connelly, one of his oddest roles); and there is plenty of action to go around (although I'd say, at least in comparison to Pulp Fiction, that had less action, with better results than this film). I wouldn't mean to make comparisons, but it would give people a better idea the near naivety of the filmmaker towards the audience. What's the moral in the end anyway, that justified killing is OK if its connected with Catholic revenge and justice? Whatever points are being made in the film are made early on and then lost in most of the second and third acts. It's not that there isn't some talent in Duffy's writing or direction, or that the actors don't do what they can. Yet there is such a kind of formula to it as well, even in the more unexpected scenes. The Boondock Saints does have its cult audience out there to be sure (some consider it one of the best films ever made), but it is too 'cool' and 'smart' for its own good. It's like the horse that you're friend wanted you to bet in on, and then after its impressive first stretch it folds, and then trips over. I almost wished at times I could like it more while watching it, but I also know that there are better, and less exploitive, original genre films out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By the numbers vigilante movie with religious element SOME SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boondock Saints has become a cult phenomenon, gathering a surprisingly large and ardent following despite being maligned by multiple problems with the studio system and being filmed on a reduced budget and released independently. While this is an impressive accomplishment, it remains mysterious as to why the film became so popular. It's a by the numbers B movie vigilante flick with a pretentious and underdeveloped religious aspect tacked on.The movie begins by introducing Conor and Murphy MacManus, a pair of fraternal Irish twins living in Boston who work in a meat packing plant and are marginally religious, meaning they go to church because they feel obligated to go, not because they want to. Following a confrontation with some goons working for the Russian mob, the brothers have what appears to be a religious moment, an apparent message from God that they should dole out vigilante justice on whatever criminals they see fit to do away with. The brothers set out on a killing spree, suddenly blessed with skills in handling firearms fit for military sharpshooters. They are aided by their friend Rocco, who conveniently enough happens to be a low level employee of the Italian mob. Rocco is the most likable character in the movie, overshadowing the brothers in all the scenes they're in with his charisma, which is surprising because he isn't a professional actor and got the role because he's friends with Troy Duffy. The brothers and Rocco are pursued FBI Agent Paul Smecker, a hard edged homosexual, portrayed in a gleeful, over the top fashion by Willem Dafoe, whose performance is the highlight of the whole movie.Troy Duffy's script is full of so many holes, his lack of experience of a writer is obvious. Unexplained and illogical elements of the story are introduced on a whim simply because they're convenient for advancing the plot, and then these elements are immediately forgotten and never mentioned again. One example is the brothers ability to speak fluently five languages; this is introduced right before Conor has to speak in Russian on the phone while posing as a mobster to find out the location of a meeting between the Russian crime bosses. It's never explained why these two guys know the languages, except that "their mother insisted on it", or why two people who were that well educated are working in a meat packing plant and living in a filthy one room apartment. Instead, this unique ability to speak 5 languages is never even mentioned again and after Conor gets off the phone with the Russians. There are coincidences that are so forced and unbelievable that they can't be taken seriously. Unfortunately, this movie isn't a parody. It wants to be taken seriously, despite moments of comic relief.The religious aspect appears to be little more than an excuse to condone the brothers' actions. What they're doing is God's will, so it's okay. Duffy wants this to be a compelling study of a controversial issue, but instead he is biased and one sided. The men that the brothers kill are sleazy, disgusting human beings with no positive traits, while the brothers are agents on a mission handed down from God. It's such a black and white portrayal of the subject that it fails to be provocative. What if the brothers killed a mobster who'd been developed as a character who loves his kids and his wife, rather than a caricature who kills mercilessly and has no regard for anyone else? Boondock Saints is a watchable movie because there are some well done action scenes and a couple of good laughs along the way, but by the end it's still a pretentious movie that wants to be thought provoking but isn't. It has the makings of a good movie that could have gone either way, in that it could have been a satire/parody, or it could have been an action movie combined with a social commentary, but it fails to be either. Instead it takes itself too seriously to be a parody or satire, and it isn't smart enough to provide any social commentary, and ends up being nothing more than a predictable vigilante movie that doesn't really stand out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friends have been urging me to see the Boondock Saints for a while now. I finally decided to rent it this past Saturday. I must say, I enjoyed it and will definitely be adding it to my DVD collection. The action sequences are very well done and entertaining and really keep the film going.However, there are a lot of things in this movie that really did not make much sense to me. First of all, I don't understand why these two Irish brothers suddenly decide to become vigilantes. They kill two Russian mobsters in self defense then make a desicion to wage an all out war on crime. It just seemed kind of out-of-the-blue to me. Another thing is that how could two meat factory workers become cold-blooded, sharpshooting, professional killers in a matter of a few days? And also, Wilem Defoe is the most unconvincing woman I have ever seen.Other than those story flaws, I thought it was an immensely entertaining movie with good performances all around. Most notably Wilem Defoe as an unorthodox FBI investigator. Overall, it's a fun movie and great to watch with a group of friends.</fullReview>

It's smart, funny, non-stop action. A bit too much, and it goes one step too far as soon as we see the FBI agent's private life (especially if you did not figure it out in the beginning what he 'prefers'). Pay close attention, otherwise don't bother. A good movie with a different edge.</fullReview>

I showed it to my sister and mom and they fell in love with it as well.The reason I loved this movie so much, I think is because it brings up so many good issues. And Sean Patrick Flannery is so hot.

		<fullReview>A guy movie made by guys about guys for guys. Naturally I dislike such a genre, but this film was enjoyable. It's nothing like the hordes of no-brainer sausage party pictures that we have flooding video store shelves in recent years (just visit Van Diesel's filmography page). This is more in the new wave gangster tradition Tarantino started in the 90s. It isn't as well-crafted as a Tarantino picture, but it's far superior to Guy Ritchie's crap - no hideously annoying dialogue/attitudes here.Despite the distinct "maleness" to the film, it has quite an unusual 'queerness' to it as well. The two brother protagonists are, quite frankly, rough-trade pretty boys with their cute short haircuts and matching tattoos.Furthermore, just look at Willem Dafoe's character and how indigenous he is in the film's environment. It seems unusual that such a masculine film praises a gay character so well. However, queer theorists might argue that he was not feminized (being that the character's personality was quite masculine) and therefore cannot truly be classified as a positive gay image.Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and thought his character was a brilliant prodigy for the genre.Furthermore, I personally feel this is Dafoe's best performance to date. Not as outrageous as Bobby Peru in David Lynch's WILD AT HEART (1990), but far more enjoyable. Despite being quite comical in the film, Dafoe does pull-off an exceptional moment where his performance perfectly matches the director's visual lead. The scene pits Dafoe investigating a crime scene and trying to understand what happened. He grows so emotionally engrossed into the investigation that he is soon visually transported back into the midst of the carnage. The idea is fine in all, but the director and Dafoe pull off an incredible moment of surreal beauty. Definitely the film's highlight.Quite the distinction also here is that the filmmakers seem at times unsure of what kind of picture they are making. There's really an eclectic mix of comedy, violence, drama, religiosity, and even attempts at social/cultural commentary. Ultimately, it's of little consequence whether this film works or doesn't because it seems as though they all had great fun making it and that enthusiasm bleeds over for the viewer. Really fun movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Violent, absurd and morally twisted, but with a great sense of black humor, The Boondock Saints is a little too good to be dismissed as junk. If you liked Guy Ritchies's stuff, then you are gonna love this. I imagine the church would be angry with this film, using religion as excuse for our characters to cause bloody violence. Whether or not it makes the film bad will be up to the viewers.In the streets of Boston, detective Paul Smecker is on the trail of the McManus brothers, two eager young Irish catholics who are on a killing spree to wipe out all the mobs and criminals in the city.First time director Troy Duffy uses a Tarantino approach. He is smart enough to know that his story is not only violent but too dumb to work, so he integrates black comedy, which is the films saving grace, getting so far over the top that you realize Boondock Saints is not meant to be taken seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boondock Saints 75% Thumbs up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock saints, initially are a couple of Irish brothers out for fun camaraderie and normal bar fights in Boston Except when a bar fight with the Russian mafia syndicate leads to some 'self defense' killing the brothers decide to kill every scum of the world as they feel its important to fear indifference and save the world. The media soon christens them saints and the brothers feel they have been baptized (a cheesy leaking roof jail sequence)The brothers are supported by an Italian hirsute fellow called Rocco who knows the whereabouts of all the Italian Mafiosi scum in the world as he used to be one of them -- why he should not be killed is another matter.Thrown in is a gay and melodramatic FBI inspector Willem Defoe (the highlight of the movie) who generally retells each of their crime scene through his Poirot like deductions and Gary Old man like dancing on western classical opera music.High on style, gore and bizarre characters and very thick on blood and accents boondock saints is fun to watch while it lasts but actually is just an idea movie which could have been easily been spawned while watching Samuel L Jackson spewing Ezekiel 25:17 in Pulp Fiction. As a matter of fact in one surprising scene done with as much taste as the one in pulp fiction an accident triggering splotches a cat on the wall just for the heck of it, in another one a bad dude just happens to be in a toilet when the saints decide to clear a poker room full of bad blood only to enter later to cause problems. Not to mention the prayer said in chorus by the saints before bad guys get their share of violent retribution.No exceptional stuff this but a surefire cult hit types which young movie freaks would swear by. Recommended for a boring sat / sun afternoon when u really don't want to go to a multiplex to see CGI created super heroes fighting 'science gone wrong' supervillians. This is good versus evil the old fashioned way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely entertaining, violent, with a great sense of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this ultra violent take on a sort of Tarantinoesque satirical plot and style about two fraternal twin Irish brothers, who due to there own circumstances, become vigilantes with a mission of ridding the Boston streets of all nasty evil, mostly mob, criminals. And trying to catch them, is a very gay FBI agent played brilliantly by Willem Defoe, who is hilarious. Yes, there are some very funny moments in this movie, but as a whole it is definitely not a comedy. Kind of like "Natural Born Killers", except it's the good guys killing the bad guys. The film definitely is conveying a message about society in general, and how the general public would be quite positive on what the brothers are pursuing. Even the cops after a point, are pretty much agreeing with them. The movie is very very graphically violent, which is always good, and some of the kill scenes are memorable. I understand director Troy Duffy had a hell of a time bringing the movie to the masses, but it is here, unrated with all the violence intact, and I had a lot of fun with it. Check it out, I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange and fascinating film about two evil brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is an extremely violent film about two brothers who decide to go on a murder spree in which they kill people who, in their eyes, are bad people. A detective(Willem Dafoe) is in pursuit of these two killers who have become media sensations. This film is fascinating in it's way of glamorizing these killings that these two men go on. However, instead of it being entertaining, it has strange details littered throughout that push the film into a strange field. Sure, people could try to justify the actions of the main characters, but people could also try to justify the rampage that the teenage gang went on in Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE by pointing out how gross and nasty the attitudes are of all the victims, or the torturing and starving of the young woman in Johnathan Demme's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS judging by her careless stupidity, her over use of bad language, and selfish nature toward the climax of the film. All the people who get killed in THE BOONDOCK SAINTS are shown to be sleazy, corrupt, and mean. However, they could all have loving families who still love them. What about those people? Do they deserve to have members of their families murdered? So can a person really succeed in justify these brothers' murders? These questions and more are things that I thought about as watched this film. This is more than just an action film. In a way, it's about morality and about how hatred and low opinions are damaging factors in many people's downfalls. Sure, two people can go on a murder spree and kill bad people, but is it really okay for them to do this, even if they claim to be doing it for God? Anyway, I'm recommending this film because it challenged me more than a usual action film and because of it's excellent performances from Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick Flannery, and Willem Dafoe.Pros: -Good action scenes -Inventive camera work -it doesn't take itself too seriously -very good performances from Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick Flannery, and Willem Dafoe Cons: -Too violent at times -Takes too much time getting started -The film isn't exactly gripping</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the summer of 2000 a friend of mine and i participated in a musical in our hometown in Sweden, and was assigned to guard duty since we were playing in a circus-tent. We had made a sport out of bringing movies neither one of us had heard about. One night one of us, i don't remember who, brought "The Boondock Saints". I think i speak for the both of us when i say that neither one of us has been so surprised, nor before - nor after, by a movie. Superb tempo, beautiful photo, great acting, excellent casting and a "happy go lucky" kind of violence that just puts a smile on my face.My favorite scene is when Agent Smecker, played by Willem Dafoe, is telling his partners how the gunfight between "The Saints" and "Il Duce" went down. The "Memento" style of shooting that scene is just plain awesome.Some other "pearls" is when Rocco brings closure to his cat and when Smecker cuddles with his boyfriend.If you haven't seen this movie, i envy you because your in for a joyride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Examining bad and good by an interesting way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been long time watching it but I forgot the story and I had a chance to watch it lastly, fortunately I had. Two meat packaging worker has the strong faiths and goes to the church regularly. But their lifes change in a bar-fight with Russian mafia. Dilemma is here and the heroes have to kill bad men but this idea conflicts with their faith. However, they start the adventure in spite of the smart detective of FBI who has the same dilemma with them. So in one way he allows the operations that they made although he looks for the shape of murders. They kill almost the whole bad men in the city with their crazy friend Rocco. Rocco helps them to update "bad men list" and they make the numbers of murders increase but Rocco is killed by the men who priorly hire him for courier. They start to work for Duce although he is hired for the Rocco's murderers. They and Duce kill boss of the Rocco's murderers with an amazing prayer in the court. and citizens in press: They answer the question "should bad men be killed somehow without guarding laws?".This amazing story let us examine crime and fine concepts sometimes with an interesting question? "Are the saints necessary for every city in USA?". I think this can be serious argument subject but as some of the people said everybody can kill everybody with a reason of hostility. While there are too many crime type like rape, murder, theft etc. in the world and if theses can't be prevented with legal ways, these heroes may be useful sometimes.As a summary, the film says that it can be regarded as normal good people can do bad actions to prevent badness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that I've seen the title of popping up a lot lately. I caught it mentioned on a few message boards, noticed wallpapers for it on deviantart and I saw some guy at a tattoo shop wearing a t-shirt. So I finally gave in and decided to give it a viewing. While waiting for it to show up in the mail I read over the reviews for it, both on IMDb and RT, basically what I saw: either people really liked it or didn't.Last night, after having the movie sit next to my DVD player for the last 4 weeks I finally decided to give it a viewing.eh... I'm about Luke warm with the movie, it was alright but nothing that didn't make me go WHOA! Or have me wonder when the movie would end. It was mildly entertaining and to a small degree I was able to overlook how choppy the storyline got but at the same time I was a little annoyed with the feeling that some things were over explained meanwhile other things were excessively glossed over.The situations the twins got themselves into were entertaining, a bit over the top but it worked well for the movie, especially their second successfully blundered hit on the Russian mob bosses So many things were just sort of tossed into the movie... the big angry lesbian at the start of the movie or the bartenders turrets syndrome that sort of came &amp; went, the twins spoken languages, the hokey non-explanation of Il Duce or the extremely skimmed over capture of the twins by the Italian Mafia.The movie seems heavily inspired by Quentin Tarantino, specifically Pulp Fiction but sadly the writer didn't understand that story is a key element in a good movie, not just the basis of the idea.Like I said, the movie was alright, I didn't come out hating it but at the same time I can only give the movie a 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>are we missing something here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see why this movie got crappy reviews. It's obviously low budget. It's a b movie. Much of the acting is mediocre. A movie will usually use a certain amount of artistic license, but it at least has to be believable. The plot has some goofy stuff, like the cops going over crime scenes. How often do you cops assume a criminal is using two guns or using a 50 caliber pistol? Like there's crooks running around with desert eagles all over the place.That said, there are some redeeming qualities. The Boondock Saints does bring you to question our ideas about religion, morality and justice. The religious slant- some people seem to believe the words the preacher says in the beginning, "we should all fear evil men." Anyone familiar with Christianity would understand a Christian is not to fear men. The only thing to fear is God's judgement. And I'm not sure where I've seen it but the Bible says, "Vengeance is mine saith the Lord." So it's not for you or me or anyone to go out there and cast judgement, it's for God to do. Unless, of course, God wants you to do send the villain up there to face judgement. There's the moral dilemma.Anyone notice that the word "veritas" (truth) on the brother's hand is shown upside down when the Willem Defoe's characters crosses the line and starts working with them? Not sure if it was intentional, but if so it may be a comment on the what we view as truth, good guys vs. bad guys, being turned upside down.That may be reaching a little. But a majority of posters on this board seem to either love this for being a typical shoot-em-up movie or condemning it for the same reason. I think the script was written with some social commentary in mind, and I have to wonder if some are missing this when they watch the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good movie. The plot has a few holes in it because of what I'm assuming to be forced editing, but I'm able to suspend belief for other parts. A few times one of the brothers slips in his Irish accent, which takes the audience out of the movie for a moment, but the action forces us back in it. And I would have liked focusing more on the brothers and not having them share the spotlight with Della Rocco for a huge chunk of the movie. Della Rocco's part was a good one a very well played, but his part in the overall story was too large. I also liked how there were no women love interests. I just think that the movie would have been bogged down if there was a love interest. It was a lot funnier than I had expected it to be. Especially in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. I find the underlying theme of morality and ethics to be a big part of it, however I didn't pay attention to it. I didn't watch this movie because of its themes and I don't think other people did either. Its a good action movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saints should have saved DUFFY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Troy Duffy's 1999 Debut, Boondock Saints is nothing short of amazing. In an attempt to re-invigorate the styles of Leon:The Professional or Pulp Fiction but with a more dramatic style Boondock Saints never risks disappointing. Circled around two Irish brothers living in the south of Boston, and being messengers of the Lord, this blood-fest never underwhelms or becomes too cheesy. First time screenwriter/director Troy Duffy, masters the art form of cinematography and never becomes repetitive or amateur. In the style of reservoir dogs or snatch, the story is told out of order, but in a new exhilarating manner. Not only does this keep us wanting more, but allows us to view things for multiple angles. The brothers, played by Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery, do a great job as the main characters, and never seem to be overacting even with the sometimes over-dramatic dialog. Willem Dafoe plays a homosexual FBI agent with an affinity to classical music, and a psychotic manner of uncovering crime scenes. His character is somewhat reminiscent of the great Gary Oldman in The Professional, only with a side of homosexuality to boot. The soundtrack, performed by The Brood (a band including Troy Duffy his brother and two other friends) adds intensity to the beautiful violence that encounters scene after scene. Too bad Duffy destroyed his career with his bitter pretentiousness, and did not continue to grace the screen with such magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's All About The Characters...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a movie with some great characters and one big plot problem.The film's premise is interesting and gives a new take on an old movie theme: vigilantism. Charles Bronson of the DEATH WISH series rules the roost for such films, but all of these are seriously dated now. DEFIANCE (1980), starring Jan-Michael Vincent, was another great flick that focused on a citizen taking the proverbial bite out of crime in an otherwise corrupt neighborhood. So I was pleased to see something a bit fresher appear on celluloid with this oft-thought-of overused message.In The Boondock Saints we find twin brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus taking on the vigilante mantle by any bloody means necessary. And I do mean bloody. They also view themselves as instruments of God (as seen in the opening sequence in which they are in church listening to the funerary services for an innocent victim). Once on the streets, they tuck their crosses beneath their shirts and pull out their chosen weapons ...usually ones infused with gunpowder. They also say a special prayer before shooting their final bad-guy of the day, a prayer their father taught them. Oh. And their Irish, in case you didn't catch their last names. So we have to have the typical Irish pub in the area. And this is where much of the movie's success comes from. The absolutely amazing characters are what drives it.The pub owner is an old Irish coot who is being forced to sell his bar by the local Russian mob. But when the vigilante brothers show up and learn of it, they quickly make sure one of their favorite hangouts isn't manhandled by any outsiders. The Irish pub owner is thankful to the brothers, and it's amazingly funny how he thanks them because the old guy has Tourettes Syndrome (a tic disorder that often results in uncontrollable cursing outbursts).The Irish brothers also have a close friend named "Funny Man" Rocco (played by coked-out looking David Della Rocco) who has mob issues of his own. His "boss" is trying to rub him out and when Funny Man learns of it, he takes matters into his own hands as well as becoming a third party to the MaManus brothers' cause.Hot on their tails is flamboyantly gay FBI agent Paul Smecker, played by Willem Dafoe. It is Dafoe's character that really elevates The Boondock Saints to a higher level. His witty comments and astonishing detective abilities mixed with his social/sexual preferences are pulled off effortlessly. Watching him go over a crime scene while listening to opera is something to be marveled at.The downside is that this is a pretty bloody flick, spilling as much crimson as any slasher film. But the biggest issue some may have is that there's no background for the MacManus brothers. The audience never learns what trigger set them onto this path, so the viewers are just supposed to take what they're doing at face value. That's a pretty big pill to swallow. Set-up is important in the movies. But here's the thing. The Boondock Saints has such great characters, most watchers probably won't even notice this glitch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, so it's not Jane Austen, but it's good.But some of the reviewers here - one in particular - who's problems with the movie includes inappropriate crime scene behaviour and the morally indefensible vigilante actions have sorely, SORELY, missed the point of this. Or any action movie at all.One should not start seeing an action movie about two vigilantes and be surprised to find it does not play like a cross between the Discovery Channel's true crime shows and an introduction to Kant. I mean, honestly.Some things should be set straight. Yes, it is violent. Yes, it is bloody. Yes, it takes liberties with everything from police work to the passage of time. But it does all this in a smooth, cool and thoroughly funny way.It does not insult one's intelligence (if you think it does, chances are you have not understood the way this movie communicates) by either hiding the brutality of vigilantism, the frustration felt by all good parties when the bad guys get away, or the hunger for people to "set things straight" in many of us.Accusing the director of fascism because of this movie is either a sign of the inability to separate describing something and condoning it, or more likely, simply not seeing beyond the upper layer.This is an action movie. And as such, one enters into a realm where depth and reflection are foreign elements. So you don't get a load of it. But it shines through sometimes. In some disturbing scenes "bad guys" who have been wounded are executed by the vigilantes with a sort of absurd gentleness. Even small-time crooks are killed. And the film does not condone this. The "interviews" after the movie clearly presents many views of their actions.Sprinkled with humor, smooth and slick action and a broadly varied gallery of characters, nobody will be disappointed over this as an action movie, but at the same time it manages to inject a broader view of vigilantism, the frustrations of law-enforcement over not being able to take down people everyone knows is a crook and the drive for easy solutions that present as many problems.As an added bonus, it has twists, turns, distinct and well-acted characters, a constant stream of funny lines and very solid action, as well as gripping story telling.Like contemporary action? See this. And the violence is not gratuitous. It drives the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Troy Duffy's first attempt as a director, The Boondock Saints, not only brought this promising young man experience, but success. Arranged in a plot style akin to that of Tarantino's works, i.e. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, this dark comedy does indeed do this film genre justice. Following a brutal encounter with mob related activity, fraternal twins, the MacManus brothers are 'charged' with a holy crusade to serve as active emissaries of god's will on evil members of society. The MacManus brothers (played by Flanery and Reedus) are resolute in their mission. While this film is brutal, it is quite entertaining and brings to light the following question: Is it intrinsically evil to slaughter those who are evil, for the purposes of good?</fullReview>

I'm a big fan of any movie set in Boston anyway, but this movie is just great on so many levels. The characters are interesting and quirky, while the main theme behind the movie, the boundaries of right and wrong, is intriguing and original. I had to watch it a second time to really catch a lot of the dialog due to the heavy Irish accents, and once I did, it just made this movie that much better.

		<fullReview>You may not agree with it, but you might find yourself approving some of the McManus brothers' massacres. And behind this ethical question, there is a great movie, which power - I believe - comes from its characters: the McManus, two naive, immature brothers, who believe they have a mission from God, which is killing all the "mafiosos" in town ("Evil men, dead men".); Detective Paul Smecker, the hilarious gay detective, who has a particular talent to understand what happened in a crime scene; Yakavetta, the cynic, cold-blooded godfather; Il Dulce, the heartless cleaner (is he the McManus' father?); and, last, but not least, Rocco, the funniest and most confused killer candidate. In addition, it has excellent dialogues - not to mention the prayer they make before every execution - and very good action/shooting scenes. (After watching it, I recommend a look at "Memorable Quotes".) And remember: "Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.""Never shall innocent blood be shed, yet the blood of the wicked shall flow like a river."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellence!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most under-rated actor in Hollywood, Sean Patrick Flanery, rises to the occasion in this very entertaining action film. A story of brothers, or twins I believe, that are hardcore Irish Catholics in Boston, as all of them would be. Basically they take on crime in the streets, get the love of people and get recognized by the media. Excellent storyline, great camera work and directing. William Dafoe, once again, put out an exceptional performance as a cop who is uncertain of his duties as a police officer and uncertain of his own sexuality which adds a tremendous amount of humor to the film. I recommend this film to anyone who is open to seeing one of the most under-rated films in the past 5 years with an up-and-coming actor soon to be recognized for his brilliant performances, Sean Patrick Flanery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is brilliant, and yet hardly anyone has seen it. I don't know if it ever came out in theaters, but I never heard about it until someone recommended it to me. This is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen, and I just can't believe how low-key it is. Actually, that's what makes it so cool. Its one of those little gems which is far more entertaining than nearly any one of those Hollywood block-busters. The plot, the casting, and the acting are all amazing. This movie is pure quality entertainment and it's hilarious. The style of the movie is kinda similar to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. If you haven't seen that either, you have to see both of them. This is how quality movies should be made. I give Boondock Saints 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why it took me so long to rent this incredible film I'll never know. Enough has been said about the story line, so I'll just add that I loved the action flashbacks, and the interesting fades to white that moved the story along. Flannery, Reedas, and Rocco were wonderful, but Willem Dafoe stole this show hands down! When is this guy going to get the recognition he so richly deserves??? He was so funny in this film that I found myself LOL in just about every one of his scenes. His delivery of lines were hilarious. "That James Bond stuff doesn't happen in real life!!!" "What we have here is the first international mob war (pause, mug) . . .unless I missed something." "The day I want the Boston police to do my thinking I will have a f------ tag on my toe!!!"The confessional scene was priceless! Dafoe trying to make the sign of the cross. . .sheepish grin. . "Whatever!" And of course one more scene which you will have to see to believe.Dafoe has a quality that I can't quite describe except as BRILLIANT. He showed the same quality in Light Sleeper, which if you you haven't seen, run to the nearest video store and rent it! The scenes with Sarandon are unbelievable.Did anyone catch Dafoe's mock Platoon pose? On his knees with his arms in the air. What a ham! Love the guy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the recommendations of many friends, I picked this up the other night. The movie starts out great and keeps accelerating to what should have been a great climax. Instead we get a rather weak ending. If not for the predictable, anticlimactic ending this film would have ranked up there with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Nevertheless, the film is still very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie! With an awesome opening sequence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The gist is that two brothers become vigilantes after some Russian Mafia types cause problems in their Irish neighborhood. The opening sequence is one of the best I have ever seen. It sets the tone for the movie, and in a way describes everything the movie is about.The two brothers (played by Flannery and Reedus) give superb performances. The story hinges on them, and how they seem totally in sync with each other, and the world around them. It is hard to believe they aren't really brothers, as they perform as if they were twins.The only real problem I had with the movie was Defoe's character. Defoe plays an FBI investigator who is assigned to the murders committed by the brothers. The problem, at least as I see it, is that the character has potential that is never realized. For instance the character is supposed to be gay (well basically), but it doesn't add to the plot in any way. And he seems to show up at times just to patch up the plot a little bit. If that character was used better I would give Boondock Saints 10, but instead only a 9, but an don't miss this movie 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just stumbled across this film on Satellite TV in England, and I have to say that it ranks among the better crime dramas of recent years, even if it does sometimes seem to prefer to fill the screens with shocking images rather than saying anything especially new.Great acting from Willem Dafoe, in a role which allows him to play a remarkably unlikeable FBI agent, and from Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus, as the titular Saints. It's perhaps a shame, though, that there are no real, strong villains to root against - The bad guys in the film are basic cyphers and exist solely to be shot up in a bunch of creative, Woo-homaging ways.A warning: If you consider yourself a cat lover, don't even THINK about catching this flick - You'll be outraged for days afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many of the other reviewers of this movie, I'd been waiting to see it for some time. And since I don't usually rent and watch movies alone, the whole group had to agree to get it (that was no easy task). But we finally picked it up and I guess it was about what I expected. Cool action sequences, lot's of tough guy humor, and bad guys that you can cheer for. The character development was weak. Some of the more dry scenes should have been replaced with some background info on the vigilante brothers, and maybe on Dafoe's character as well. The end could have used a little more detail too. But hey, it's a straight to video action flick, what do you expect?? If you don't mind "cool" action movies where the plot budget isn't quite as high as the violence quota, give this one a shot. If you're more into understanding why the characters do what they do and what motivates them, this one's not for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to watching this film when I rented it. I had read the synopsis on the back and the plot seemed very solid and interesting, and I really felt that this would be an enjoyable film. And it started out pretty well I thought. But by the time it reached it conclusion, I found myself agitated, not paying attention, not caring.I see the major problem as being not enough character development; I didn't feel anything toward the title Irish vigilante brothers whose parts in the film flipped between merciless killer to God-serving Angel of Death with little to no transition (and little and mainly ambigious background on them). And the manner in which Willem Defoe's character "converts" from FBI detective to vigilante is ludicrous and stupid. All in all, I was very disappointed in what could have been a very excellent film that fell apart due to a lousy script and mediocre acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can´t believe that this movie only has about 500 votes (pro tem.) And I also can't believe that it did not get to any theaters i Denmark. Because this is great movie. One of the things I like is that before you see the "Saints" killing the "bad guys" you see the investigation of the crime scene, and then afterwards you see what really happened. I also enjoyed the interviews that ran during the end credits. There you can really see the different attitudes that people have towards the actions of Murphy and Conner. Some people think it's wonderful that someone does the dirty work and takes on the criminals, and some people think that the two brothers just want to be famous. And then there is the last group of people that are smart enough to say "No comment" quietly turning a blind eye to the actions of the Boondock Saints, thus accepting them... 8/10</fullReview>

It reminded me a bit of Pulp Fiction in a way, but is still an entire movie in it's own right, not a rip-off of other, already proven films like many of todays hits are. From what I hear, the movie went straight to video. This is a shame, the movie deserved a much larger viewer base. The acting alone is brilliant, but when you add the great story and all the action, you have a film that could very well have been a blockbuster on your hands. A must see movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, I loved Pulp Fiction. Yes, I loved Reservoir Dogs. AND YES, I LOVED BOONDOCK SAINTS. But most of these people compare the films and miss the whole message of the movie. In the beginning, where the two brothers come into the church, the message the priest is conveying that something somebody is doing may be wrong, but sometimes you should just look away and say nothing. The reason for the crazy end credits where people continue to say "No Comment" is because it has become an tightly knit community and they know they shouldn't say anything. Then there are always the blowhard idiots that don't understand the reason of the Saints, and they argue that they are wrong or support them and state how they want to become them. This is a reflection of true life, and sadly we have become a nation that actually NEEDS some Boondock Saints going around killing the scum drug dealers and corruptors. As for the idiot below, that gave the "D-rating" because the script was "AWEFUL", hey pal, so is your spelling. Rerent the movie and watch it again with the above in mind.

And you don´t need to be on drugs (or at least have the same mood) to understand this movie. Everything is plain but clever, easy but smart.The "heroes" do the things they do, because they believe in justice and use therefore self-justice.At the end of the movie (after some "bloody" scenes) you remember yourself that you are in your favorite cinema and you ask yourself: "Yes, this is great movie. Great action. Let the evil burn. But, is self-justice right? Can it be?".A great movie - definitely not to miss!7 out of 10 points (alternative: 3,5 out of 5 because it misses some original ideas)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie - Possible Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints (1999) opens up with Irish twin brothers Connor and Murphy praying in a church during a service on Saint Patrick's Day. The priest is talking about Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death in broad daylight, with plenty of witnesses, but no one did anything, not even call the cops. The priest's message is almost the same as the message throughout the entire movie. This is the idea that the indifference of good people is just as bad what the criminals are doing. The brothers take this to the extreme after they receive a message from God. This message tells them that they should kill the bad people in their city of Boston. By bad they mean the murderers, rapists, drug dealers, etc. that get out of jail on bail and continue back to their old ways. They start out with members of the Russian mob, and take out nine higher members of the mob. Their friend David Del Rocco, a.k.a. Rocco, a member of the Italian Mafia who has been ignored for years, decides that he wants to help them take out the mafia after he was set up and supposed to die. He is their informant of who people are, where they go, their habits, and any other information that may be useful. The brothers and Rocco, dubbed "The Saints" by the media, continue to kill all of the evil in the mafia. Meanwhile, FBI agent Paul Smecker, and three detectives from the Boston Police department are at the scenes of all of these murders. They are trying to figure out how they are all connected to one another since they are all mafia members that were murdered. When Smecker finally figures out who is killing these mafia members and their reasons for doing so, he believes in their cause, and even helps them find the safe house of the top leaders of the mafia. However when they get to the safe house to kill the mafia leaders, things go horribly wrong. There are different aspects of film in The Boondock Saints. First, are the literary aspects of the movie. In the beginning of the movie there is a narrator talking while the brothers pray. Also, throughout the movie, there are scenes in which Smecker narrates what happened earlier at the crime scene. Second, there are dramatic aspects when Connor is first taken by the Russian mob, when Rocco gets shot, and when Rocco goes crazy at his girlfriend over her cat. There are also aspects of the movie that are unique to a movie. These are cinematic aspects of a film. An example of cinematic aspects are the gunshot wounds that the Saints get when they are performing their deeds, as well as the few special effects that occur during the movie. Some of the special effects are when a character is shot, the blood splatter. Such as when Rocco shoots his girlfriend's cat, the blood is splattered all over the wall. The music picked for The Boondock Saints gives it an Irish feel. The opening scene is led with an Irish instrumental song as the main characters credits are on screen. The other music picked for during the fight scenes blends well with the battles. There is also a lot of music that sounds like it may come from church, since the brothers are supposed to be working from a message from God. There are a lot of Gothic style hymns and songs of lament after they just killed people. Since The Boondock Saints is a low budget film, there are not many special effects, but director Troy Duffy displays the gunfights well, as well as the many injuries that the characters gain throughout the movie. Duffy depicts how a few people do as much as they can for something that they believe in. The acting is also pretty good, as the character show many emotions throughout the movie. I would rate this movie an 8.5 out of 10 and would recommend this movie to anyone because of the great plot and action in The Boondock Saints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so "The Boondock Saints" is a "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" wannabe, like so many other films but in this case it's a good wannabe that definitely entertains.It's definitely not a movie to take serious, even though it still picks a gritty and realistic approach. This is typical for recent British film-making and something they master. This production is American though and also made by an American director but it still uses this same typical distinctive British style with also British actors and characters in it. The end result in this case is a light-hearted, entertaining movie, that is professionally made.Not sure if I really like the main story of the movie, which glorifies violence and killing but it provides it with some nice and original sequences. It picks an original approach by sometimes using action flashbacks of what happened when the police investigates the crime scene, while still focusing on the linear storyline. This is a spectacular and original approach which often works out surprising as well as awesome. I think its approach is the foremost reason why "The Boondock Saints" works out so well and gives it its own identity and style.The movie is also really made great and interesting by the fact that it has Willem Dafoe in it in a great role. Seriously, I feel like it's one of the better roles out of his career. Couldn't care more or less about Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus really, who play the main leads of the movie. Billy Connolly also plays a fun role, although his role is much smaller than you perhaps would expect.A perfectly entertaining movie to watch.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I really enjoy Willem Dafoe in most of his movies, but he just comes off as irritating here. Don't want to bring up "Pulp Fiction", I just feel that this movie tries to take a lot from it. In the end I will not say this sucks, as I am a big fan of crime and mob movies, but I will probably never revisit it.

		<fullReview>I understand this movie has quite a cult following from what I've been told, but the general movie going public didn't take too well to it. That's a damn shame. I thought the acting was top notch, the directing was seamless and kept the pace of the movie intense, and the dark, yet hilarious humor was perfectly scattered throughout the film.I'm not typically a big fan of Willem Dafoe, but he did very well in this one. Seems to me he's almost TOO good at playing a gay guy, if you know what I mean. But he did great right along with pretty much every other character in this movie. It's pretty violent and relatively graphic, but aren't we pretty much numb to that these days anyways? It's obviously not a family film, so just don't show it to the kids.Overall I cannot come up with anything about this movie I did not like. Simply put this film is just fantastic.

I focus on two things, acting...(and by acting I mean, did they do a good enough job that they brought me in?), and whether I was entertained.In this particular case, yeah, I was entertained. In fact, I couldn't take my eyes off of it, and I didn't want it to end. I kept wanting to see the crime scenes, see Smecker give his interpretation, and then find out exactly what happened.I hated when the kitty was killed, but I couldn't help but laugh when Rocco asked if they thought it was dead...or more so in the next scene when they eloquently hung up a picture over the 'mess' on the wall. The humor was extremely subtle and well used.I was shocked at the fact that DeFoe was gay, but couldn't help but laugh when he called his partner a fag, and accused the bartender of being a femme. That's funny stuff.It was good, it was entertaining, and I thought it was smart.That is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies are sometimes misunderstood. Violent movies are often misunderstood. Not just any violent movies, but violent movies that are trying to say something about the violence that they contain. This film, I have a strong feeling, is one of them. I decided to watch it after hearing how "kick ass" it is. I am sure everyone, especially guys, enjoys "kick ass movies." I know I do. However, "The Boondock Saints" is much to thoughtful of a film to be labels just "kick ass." There is plenty of ass kicking, but that is not the point, to say the least.The driving of Connor and Murphy McManus to vigilantism is the point. The considerations of Agent Smecker on the ethics of what the McManus brothers do and why they do it is the point. The violence is incidental but nonetheless a necessary part of the film since the McManus brothers believe that their only option is to "fight fire with fire" - put down violent criminals the same way these criminals put other people. The religious themes throughout the film show that the brothers aren't just out for a violently fun time or "kicking ass" as they believe there is greater force driving them. One scene has the brothers cauterizing each others' wounds after a shootout which is a reference to mortification of the flesh - God permits them to use violence on the violent, but they must never forget: they are human. Also to be noted is the violence isn't portrayed gloriously or in a "kick ass" way though there are moments of deliciously dark humor. However, that again refers to the fact that the brothers are human. They smoke, they drink, they curse (like sailors!), they bleed, they like beer, etc... Not all humans are like that, but that's again beside the point.Another thing is Troy Duffy's script and direction. As of now this is his first and only movie, but it is directed with serious professional grace. The music, the slow motion scenes, flashbacks and whole film are just plain old well made and composed together. Naturally, there are many ways of philosophizing about violence and a violent movie is surely not in everyone's taste, but this is, above all, a well made and thoughtful movie. --- 9/10Rated R for strong violence and profanity.

		<shortDescription>Evil is the indifference of good men ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did Troy Duffy need to open his mouth and burn every bridge he had in Hollywood? After making an amazing movie like The Boondock Saints, more so for being his first feature film script and direction, fans are told a sequel, All Saints Day, is planned. Unfortunately no one will probably ever see that film because of Duffy's arrogance and pride. After being given money and trust to create the movie, he repaid his backers with public insults during his drunken stupors. It is a real shame as his talent is apparent and could have molded into something very good.Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are the MacManus brothers, two Irish boys that are highly spiritual and modestly intelligent. They live in virtual squalor, work at a meat factory, and drink with their buddies. After a self-defense killing, which triggered a shot of adrenaline against heavy odds to be victorious, they begin to believe they have a purpose on this earth. While spending the night in jail after the incident, to avoid the mob of reporters outside, the brothers both wake from a dream which gives them their duty, (from God?), to dispatch of the evils of the world. They become vigilantes, killing those dangerous criminals who once captured would eventually be let go by the system. Both are very good in their roles, using what they know of Charles Bronson and James Bond to get the job done. Each hit is done with folly and "that only happens in the movies" moments, but in the end they are completed professionally and effectively. The knowledge by the characters about their own blind luck is a nice touch and helps the audience go along for the ride as they never take themselves too seriously, except of course for the reasoning behind their murderous deeds.Although the two boys are the stars and drive of the movie, the outstanding performance belongs to the great Willem Dafoe. He plays a homosexual FBI agent named Paul Smecker and is always able to orchestrate in his head, along with the help of classical music through his headphones, every nuance of the past days' atrocities. Smecker follows closely behind the brothers trying to crack the case, slowly leading him down the path of reevaluating what it is his job truly accomplishes, and if these killers are actually doing more good than he. Duffy shows great visual flair showing Smecker as he reconstructs each crime. We always see the incidents through his eyes and not the MacManuses themselves. This style eventually gives us the best scene?a fight at a poker game of criminals. Here instead of quick cuts between the orator and past events, we see Dafoe in frame, calmly narrating as the vigilantes do their work alongside. The scream of "There was a FIREFIGHT!" has amazing bravado and theatricality that would be laughable anywhere else, but ultimately poignant and fitting in context here.Along with one of Dafoe's career turns come some very nice supporting players. The non- actor David Della Rocco does an amazing job as the brothers' Italian low-level mobster friend, actually based on himself by friend Duffy. He is the "Funnyman" as he is called in the film, adding the best instances of comic relief besides the scathing retorts of Dafoe. His heart and na?veté help us understand our antiheroes' intents. They both protect him like a brother and try to show him that what they do is for good; they only kill evil men, those that laws can't seem to rid society of. We also get nice turns from Billy Connolly and Gerard Parkes. Seeing Connolly in a non-comedic role is a nice change for me; his remorseless assassin Il Duce is a brilliantly constructed character. I give full credit to the director for getting a performance against type from him. As for Parkes, from "Fraggle Rock" fame, we get nice comic relief with his stuttering, Tourettes afflicted bartender.The Boondock Saints is a high action, intelligently told story filled with violence, comedy, and drama. Duffy's style is uncommonly polished for being his first outing and it's a real shame that it will probably be his last. Hopefully, one day, he will become man enough to take the bullet and apologize for what he did, so that we can see what else is in him artistically. I haven't seen it yet, but the documentary Overnight tells the story of development and filming activities during which his descent into hell happened. A burgeoning cult classic, Saints will hopefully be remembered for the energetic ride it is and not the off-camera mistakes of its' creator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More cool than good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>College students love Boondock Saints (speaking in generalities, of course). And college students often have a good eye for what's cool (on the other hand, if facebook is any authority, The Notebook tops the list of popular movies in many colleges, so perhaps I need to revisit my "college students know cool" theory). And, I suppose, Bookdock saints was cool, but it was NOT a great movie, in my opinion.The thing I liked best about Boondock Saints was its portrait of three central characters (the twins and Rocco) who really made no distinction in their own minds between real life and movies. I loved the bit with the brothers using the ventilation shaft to enter a hotel room, and of Rocco thinking he's Wyatt Earp, wielding two handguns to blast his victims. The whole idea of vigilante justice, of course, is intertwined with media representations of crime, justice, and violence in our culture. The movie was at its best when it immersed itself in this weird postmodern hyper-reality.I think the movie falls short of greatness because the filmmakers are just not that good. In a funny, ironic way, I think the filmmakers are almost exactly like the MacManus brothers. Like the Saints, the filmmakers scrabble together a lot of really cool things they've seen in movies like The Usual Suspects, True Romance, and Tarantino's films, and because they're imitating and remixing "cool" source material, they sometimes succeed in creating some cool cinema. Like the Saints, the filmmakers here are well-intentioned and lovable, but maybe not all that competent, when it comes down to it. After watching the whole movie, I don't get the sense that there's a strong central vision or real coherence to the movie. Although the idea is solid, the dialogue is less-than-stellar, and the cinematography sometimes makes the film look like a made-for-TV movie. Still, to the extent that Troy Duffy is the "auteur" here, it's not at all bad for a directorial debut. I'd probably see a follow-up, if there ever is one (not a sequel--God forbid; that would be a really misguided venture--what I mean is that I'd see a sophomore directorial effort by Duffy).I enjoyed Boondock Saints, but boy am I ever glad I rented it from Netflix instead of impulse buying the DVD! Did I use the word "cool" a lot in this review? I think that's significant, actually. I just get the sense that Duffy is far more interested in making a cool movie than in making good cinema. A great movie, in my opinion, might be able to do both at once!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Veritas &amp; Aequitas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case any of you out there were wondering what the tattoo's on the Brothers' hands meant, here you go. Both words are in Latin, a language that is virtually dead to all but science and the church.Veritas: Truth.Aequitas: Justice (at least in the sense it was used, there are alternates).Many confuse the latter of the two (Aequitas) for Requitas, but this is not the case. Requitas IS another Latin word, but if you look carefully, the first letter is not an "R", but rather an "A".I feel that the symbolism behind the choices for the tattoos are rather obvious. Veritas, or truth, and Aequitas, or justice, is meant to indicate how the brothers see themselves: the disciples of truth and justice, more being tools through which God works, rather than acting solely of their own accord.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard all the stories about Troy getting paid $300,000 for the screenplay and saw Overnight and heard all about what was in the out takes of that documentary. I also read this script before I saw the movie and was looking forward to it.I was ready to see something a bit amateurish, however, as it's a first-time director's movie and was pleasantly surprised to find something as good. The photography's cool, the direction is sure and generally the production values are very good. I wasn't too convinced by Dafoe's character though; I think he played it a bit too tongue in cheek (no pun intended).My only disappointment is the way Troy Duffy, who wrote and directed it, has managed to ruin his chances in the movie biz by behaving like such an ASS!! Why would someone who can produce such good work behave the way he has??Oh well, maybe Boondock 2 will save him.</fullReview>

We would make this our number one movie to watch at Movie Night on campus followed by Fight Club and Reservoir Dogs. It's not a girl's movie, but the brothers are so adorable together that you can't help but love it! Major props to Willem DaFoe for his role...you'd never expect him to surprise you like he does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a replay value of 9. I wish i could tell you what exactly makes this movie so great, but i would be going on forever, so i'll just stick to generalization. The atmosphere of the movie is set in Boston, a vastly cultural city with a large crime syndicate. Two Irish brothers become the victim of crime and decide to take justice into their own hands as vigilantes. The Boondock Saints isn't a rip-off of Deathwish, there is allot of back-story and social commentary with in the script to set it apart from other films of its genre. It is very unfortunate that this movie's thunder was taken away by the tragic events at Columbine, because it would have otherwise gained more recongniton then it had. Upon films end, the movie allows for the audience to review there ideals on justice and how the criminal system works. All actors contribute to their roles in supreme fashion including David Del Rocco who adds humor to this already dark comedy-thriller. this movie truly is original and should gain more publicity when its much anticipated sequel is released within the next year.</fullReview>

The brothers MacManus make me proud to be Irish(like I needed any help). They take it upon themselves to fix a problem that they can see needs to be solved. They don't wait for someone else to address the situation. Rocco was right, they should be in every major city. The director, Troy Duffy, is an amazing, very generous guy. He is actually allowing me and a friend to use one of his phrases in the movie for the name of our own film productions group. Anyone who is a fan of shoot 'em ups will love this movie, but it also give those who love plot lines something to hold on too. Way to go, Duffy.</fullReview>

Sean Patrick Flanery is breathtaking. Norman Reedus is charming, and the chemistry between the two brothers in the story is great. Billy Connolly is scary. The violence is necessary (in my opinion.) Every character is memorable. The language is excessive for some viewers, but fine with me. The outtakes are hilarious. The deleted scenes are beautiful.

But after every major act.Great actors, and support actors. It deserves more that what It earned. Would've been a sure hit, if it had come to the theaters's. But with small movie productions you cannot expect much these days.With the filming of its sequel The Boondock Saints:All Saints Day it will be a major movie, sure to hit the theaters from its popularity on TV and DVD/Tape. Losing some key actors in the sequel will be harmful but still keeping most of the core together, in the end, it all comes out. You will leave the theaters and say to yourself. "Man, that was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile". While others will think it was one of their worst.In my opinion. I'll be there at the midnight showing of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film combines awe inspiring visuals with a unique philosophy to keep you entertained all of the way through. It was obviously masterfully directed, scored, and edited. The acting is also very good throughout - especially impressive considering that besides Dafoe, the cast is generally unheard of. One possible criticism is that it lacks a well-defined story and instead builds characters and a goal and consists of "action sequences" with simultaneous "explanation sequences" as interpreted by the intense, yet flamboyant, Agent Smecker who is played by William Dafoe. While each of these sequences is breathtaking to say the least, at points the lack of a "big picture" becomes all too apparent. The distribution troubles involving this film, as well as complications with the sub-par documentary "Overnight" have been highly publicized, yet not enough has been said about how GOOD this film really is. Watch it and support it because they need support, it seems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plot: Through a strange event, two young/religious Irishmen (twins) in Boston under take the weighty (to say the least) responsibility of executing as many evil men in the world as possible: WITHOUT getting caught.The second challenge would prove to be the greater however, as an expert FBI (Willem Defoe) agent hunts them down relentlessly. The viewer follows the plight of the brothers, they are faced with the question (among others) "Is it one's right (or duty) to destroy evil people?". Meanwhile, The FBI investigator is facing plenty of trying question of his own "Should I stop good men from doing good things in the world despite laws when it is my SWORN duty to uphold the Law?" Are they killing for kicks? Or are they truly utilized by God (as they begin to feel they are)? Will they be killed while carrying out their duties? Will they be caught first? If so, what will happen to them? Since its quiet release in 1999, the Boondock Saints has exploded in cult popularity. The reasons for this are hardly elusive. The plot is compelling, well paced, and keeps it in the DVD player. In addition to executing humor drama and action expertly, it also posses strong and pressing questions regarding religion, justice, capitol punishment, and an array of other heavy topics.The Characters are lush and vibrant; bringing the film to life. And these wonderful characters are spawned souly from the incredibly talented (and mostly under-rated), and well casted actors. Particularly film-legend Willem Defoe illuminates the screen in this title.The profanity soaked dialog is not for the faint of heart however, but laced with brilliance non the less.The action is fresh, less than predictable, and expertly carried out (though obscenely violent).Short comings: The plot is some what typical or unoriginal, but highly entertaining still, thanks to a few creative spins they threw into the runofthemill story - The violence, language and mild nudity may offend some - Some events of the film feel rather far fetched at times, and less than believable - VERY male dominated (they even punch a violent feminist at one point) If you loved this film, the sequel 'All Saints Day' has been announced.</fullReview>

All mixed with cool action scenes, nice music and a really good angle of the whole event.Then the two brothers gets a "vision from god" that they have to kill all evil people. So, they start to do just that. And they do it very well.

The film has a lot of fading, and uses flashbacks to tell the story, while still being completely understandable. Many reputable and bloody executions make this a movie to watch again and again.

		<fullReview>In the Irish side of Boston, two brothers, Connor and Murphey (played by Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus), start off as employees in a meat packaging plant and soon into the film begin killing off all the scum of Boston, beginning with the Russian mafia. Willem Dafoe plays the detective in this story who eventually comes to help the Irish brothers in their mission. The way Director Troy Duffy tells the story, its set up so we know what their next move will be, but we don't see what actually happened until Detective Smecker (Dafoe) pieces everything together. This movie has a lot of gore in it and a lot of "the F word", but all-in-all I really liked this movie. The soundtrack is awesome, the acting is right-on (accents are beautiful, fake or not), it really brings the viewer into the story and you begin rooting for these Irishmen because you understand WHY they kill who they kill. If you've ever seen "Seven" (Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman), its moralistically along the same lines; the "bad guys" only target those who deserve it.</fullReview>

Do you know what is different with "Saints"?First of all, young director of the film (Troy Duffy) is more clever than Tarrantino, I think. At the time his mind power and talent get together, this GREAT film occurred. Film is enough to satisfy anyone whose thoughts are whatever. I mean, you maybe a religious man or an atheist; maybe you're whole life is standing on the philosophy of "Carpe Diem" or you are interested on the "art of living"; THIS film will actually satisfy you.According to me the most attractive part of the movie is that: It does NOT force you to believe in ONE WAY which you are supposed to think it's the RIGHT one. Film leaves you free to give your OWN idea on the topic "discussed" at the screen.To me, chosen question to be discussed at the film -about judgment is perfect and the way of director's representing language of this question is genius.If you haven't seen it yet, don't spend time and see it. If you have already seen it, see it again and THINK TWICE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The definition of a "cult classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is a brilliantly written, well shot, well edited, beautifully acted story of vigilante brothers who believe they were chosen to cleanse the world of who they judge to be evil. The audience is not forced to call them heroes but is put in an position where they must decide if the MacManus brothers actions are justified. Unfortunately the film was released at a time of paranoia about youth and media violence. Despite this, the Boondock Saints remains popular and has a die-hard fan base of zealous young people from various demographics. Continued advertising is by word of mouth alone, proof that most who watch it are affected by it. Debates, intelligent or heated, spark at a mention of the film or it's central theme. The main subject of the film is that though we all "fear evil men" we must fear the "indifference of good men" most. Unlike "Pulp Fiction" and previous attempts at a good "gun movie" with snappy jokes, this movie actually succeeds without alienating the common man, and includes the bonus of a poignant message. The movie stars the relatively fresh faces of Flanery and Reedus as the twin Irish-Catholic MacManus brothers; and is topped off by the veteran Dafoe as the pursuing FBI agent. All the characters are unique, and any clichés are parodied to insane hilarity. The original soundtrack is a eclectic mix of celtic music, techno beats, rock, and a classical score by Jeff Danna. If you are looking for an underground movie that is entertaining and not intellectually insulting (as some independent films can be), then try the Boondock Saints. It made my top 5 movie list of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since the very first time I saw The Boondock Saints, I fell in love with it. The plot is fast paced, the characters are exciting, and the ideas produced by the characters just like anyone elses "secret life of crime" dreams.I love how casual the characters all are. Sure, some people could say that that makes them unrealistic, but I think it makes them more intriguing. I can absolutely not wait for the sequel, I will definitely be first in line!Right now I am doing a project on it for school. But, I haven't been able to find any personal information about David Della Rocco. If anyone can help me with this, please e-mail me at 02doyleg@bunburyshs.wa.edu.au</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies of all time! In my top 5 fave movies, one of the few that I could sit and watch all day long and never get sick or bored of it! The poeticness of what the vigilantes are doing, riding the cities of the corruptness that has overtaken many cities. Getting rid of the reason why we are scared to allow our children into public schools, why we are frightened to walk down the street to go to the store, so instead we drive our cars. Why we can't let our children play outside without constantly watching them. I'm in fear of our society today, and this movie spoke to my heart of the justice that many of us long for. The irish brothers is the heart of what we as America felt when we were attacked 9-11. We all felt the vigilante in us rise up, and connect with our God, asking for the Great Spirits blessing while seeking revenge, as well as trying to rid the world of the corruptness it has been made to endure. Yes, this movie is about spiritual poetic justice, as was said in the movie, I'll say it now, as I believe this line full heartedly. "The Law of God is much higher then the Law of Men"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening credits of this movie sorta show what the whole movies all about. It's violent, funny, and you get the sense of the bond between the brothers. This movie has been compared to some QT films to death on the net. This movie is much more fun than Quentin Tarantino's movies. Willem Dafoe plays his best role yet; a homosexual FBI agent that is obviously dedicated to his job and good at it, too. Some of the best scenes have him explaining what happened at a crime scene that the brothers created. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus give great performances with an irish accent and humor. Troy Duffy has definitely has made a masterpiece, and this is only his first movie! Must watch for every one! 10 out fo 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly a movie that was in desperate need of more repute. The bombacity of this movie was a breath of fresh air to the intellectually starved, and the wit of the movie was naught a perfect compliment to the action.Willem Dafoe, while not the prominent protagonist, did an excellent job of propelling this movie forward in the midst of transition. The actual dialogue between Dafoe and those around him, along with the Dialogue of "The Saints," if you will, is naught but exemplary of how a script should be written. A perfect performance by all actors, and a benchmark of witticism, with an ending that is most fitting, even in it's stark juxtaposition to demeanor of the rest of the the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night, already pumped up by Notre Dame's win over Michigan. After reading through these reviews though, I stared in disbelief as there was an occasional negative review of the movie - I think that too many people watch movies with a critical eye - reviewing it for technical specifics rather than allowing themselves to be ensared in the transcendant beauty of the film.Anyways, back to the point, this movie was absolutely fantastic. Regardless of what some people say, the plot was well thought of and carried out even better. The photography was excellent, and the way the scenes were shot combined with well selected music made for an overly outstanding film. I had walked into my friends room to grab a drink, and I ended staying for the entire movie. This is a must see for anyone looking for either action or a simply beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Contains Spoilers***This has probably been one of the most underestimated movies i've seen as of yet. Shadowing itself by being in the cheap priced movie rack, this movie just has something about it that makes me get chills when I see certain parts. Mostly the firefight between Il Duce and the Saints just stood out as far as making it seem so epic and holy. This movie, along with a pretty smooth soundtrack delivers the complete package: no bad ending that makes no sense, but one that leaves it wide open for All Saints Day that hopefully at least will make it to some sort of viewing. Not much else to add except, get this movie a higher score. I'd expect at least an 8.0...This is an original masterpiece people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched Boondock Saints at the suggestion of a co-worker, it was late at night, I wanted to send it back the next day, and I was like "Okay, whatever." I watched it about 2 am. Then I watched it again. Maybe even a third time, I'm not sure. I was that stunned and captivated by it. The plot story, characters, and action scenes blew me away. The tag lines compare it to Tarrantino films, and it is very much in the style of his work. If you're looking for a no-brainer action movie, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a movie with good characters and plot, check it out sometime. It's an action movie you can watch with your girlfriend, and both can walk away satisfied. Even if that is a terribly stereotypical statement, it's true. Great movie, highly suggested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first found this title after a night on the beers, Having never heard of the title before, I thought 'What the hell, it looks like it could be fun.'The blazing, dramatic action and hard paced story is backed up by a surprisingly talented cast for such a budgeted movie. Obviouly the approach was to find the right actor for the part rather than the biggest affordable name. Not that the names are small mind you. Sean Patrick Flannery and Willem Defoe are two actors I find woefully underused in main stream cinema.The subject matter poses some interesting questions. While the actions of the brothers are, in essence, illegal. are they in fact 'wrong'? Do the ends justify the extreme means?All this aside, action fans will find it's seans well constructed and paced and fans of deeper cinema will not be disappointed by story stringing the movie along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My thoughts on The Boondock Saints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across this film when my friend recommend The Boondock Saints to me and I had never heard of it before so I took the risk of buy the DVD. Let me say this, I do think it's pretty good film but I think it's pretty difficult to put this film in the rank of, let's say, Tarantino's league. Some may prefer The Boondock Saints over Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. That's fine by me and I have no problem with that. However, the structure in The Boondock Saints is bit problem for me because the story doesn't really flow very even. It's like the director is trying learn how to control the film but have some problems with the pace. For example, Rocco's character enter in the restaurant and shot 3 guys with reverse sequences. I have a problem with this sequence because the dialogues aren't very structured and doesn't come out sound right.Sometimes, it's very obviously to see which films that The Boondock Saints had copied off, i.e. The Professional, Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir Dogs but I won't say anything about that one. I feel that this film tried bit too hard to accomplish what it is try to go for. It tried to create memorable dialogues but it fell short off that goal. The profanity seem to be very excessive here and f words are being spray like paint can all over on the wall. I sometimes do not really feel that the characters are strongly connected by their dialogues. But I do not deny that Connor and Murphy have very strong bond between each other and that is very positive aspect of the whole film. Am I slag this film? No. I do think this film is very fun and pure entertainment and I think it has accomplish that goal. But I do find some sequences very laughable but I think most of the excellent sequences outweigh bad one. I think it's really cool to see how Willem DaFoe's character restructure what happen when the shooting committed by the Connor and Murphy took place.Would I recommend this film to any of my friends? Probably. I think this is just fun independent film and I got it at good price so I'm pretty cool about that one. I rather enjoy this film a lot. ***/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warped, hilarious, surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen some truly woeful films featuring Willem Dafoe, but his work here is enough for me to forgive him for any past mistakes, as well as any he may make in the future. Throughout this film he is at times subtle (though not often), wired, tragic, tortured, enraged, offensive, hilarious and poetic! And he plays the pursuing cop to the pair of titular brother vigilantes!!That the rest of the film around him is just as good was a complete surprise to me when I first watched it on video after a friend's recommendation. It has been compared to the work of Tarantino but really, aside from skirting a common genre and a bit of messing with the narrative structure it bares little similarity. Certainly it has a completely different look and feel. For a start Boondock Saints is consistently funnier (particularly Rocko, who is so pathetic you can't help but feel for the guy despite his attitude and intentions). And secondly Saints is much more straight forward (unashamedly so) than either Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown or Reservoir Dogs.The film is simple enough, but its style and characters add a layer of complexity that such a plot would not ordinarily deserve, yet here the film makers run with it enthusiastically. On the surface it is a low budget action/thriller I suppose, but the end result is infused with a clever script, incredible characters, some terrific set pieces and a really twisted sense of humour. I would imagine that it looks more expensive than it actually is. Towards the end it really starts to look at vigilantism as a political issue, and I feel that the social commentary it offers after the finale might be the movie's only real weakness. Yet this does not really detract from the entertainment value of this film.Give it a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints is a great film in it's own right. It has been compared to other great movies such as Pulp Fiction. The only thing these films have in common are they involve guns. I watched the DVD 3 times now since I've bought it. The cinematography was excellent along with the story and script. The direction was outstanding as well. The brothers were not made out to be superhuman or have any special abilities. They showed that they can be hurt and had to "work" to escape any predicament. What made them strong was their connection to each other as brothers and their faith. I felt these qualities made them believable. Although some parts did get ridiculous, but that's why it is a movie. We want it to be realistic but if a movie is too realistic then we complain. If it's not realistic enough, we complain. I felt this movie gave a perfect balance of the two. Those who overanalyze a movie are missing the point of a movie. It is supposed to be like a 2hour or so vacation from real life.Boondock Saints provided perfect entertainment for anyone who likes this genre. Now to sound a bit cliché, if you liked Pulp Fiction, Desperado or Once Upon a time in Mexico, you will love Boondock Saints. In nomine et filii et spiritus sancti...Can't wait for the sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original Irish-based Action Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a buddy sit me down to watch the whole film, and I ended up loving it. Its not something high dollar with fancy smancy CGI stuntmen, a high profile director or producer, or a big A-list star, but it is entertaining. Defoe's role is great, except he get's a little too deep undercover a a certain point (which is hilarious). The whole Vigilante theme is really expanded on, and there's no "love interest" B.S. crammed down out throat as well. The "FIREFIGHTS!!!" are great, very old school action, lots of non-bullet-time, squib happy original action.BTW- If your Irish, you'll get a kick out of it. The brothers really have that Irish Flair, especially considering that everyone looks at them being a Left-Hand of God avenging Archangels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone that I have had over to watch The Boondock Saints has gone out and bought it. I am not exaggerating, this movie is incredible. The action sequences are phenomenal, the camera work is freely artistic, and the story is nothing short of original. If you know anything about how challenging an independent film can be, you will appreciate how well Troy Duffy (writer/director) did with in this film. It has become a cult classic, I am yet to meet someone who dislikes this movie.Part of what makes this movie so amazing is that it wasn't released in the U.S. (due to the political climate) yet it is very popular. This movie has made nearly all it's sales from the word of mouth of people just like you and me. So here I am telling you what a great movie this is, so go check it out. I won't lie, this movie is on the edge, it does cross lines for some people, but every great artistic masterpiece does. To me The Boondock Saints is about brotherhood and the undying love Connor &amp; Murph McManus have for each other. Check this film out, you won't be disappointed.One last thing, I am really looking forward to the sequel, "The Boondock Saints 2: All Saints Day" Good work Troy, make the sequel happen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints is a really sweet movie. The moral or theme has been done before- and done better- but the story and characters are compelling enough to make it interesting. Not a first-rate movie, but Boondock Saints is certainly one of the best assassin films in recent years as evidenced by the movie's cult following. Worth seeing and worth owning ($10 on DVD almost everywhere). Connor and Murphy McManus are brothers who begin a crusade against drug dealers, hitmen, and the mafia. They receive assistance from a blundering friend, Rocco, and together the unlikely group begin to deconstruct Boston's Russian mob. An interestingly-made low-budget film backed by an interesting story.</fullReview>

Those movies cash in on the CGI because so much money was spent on it nobody cares about the actors anymore.Boondock Saints has good acting, nice special effects, and an above-average storyline.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, Ultra-violent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus, and David Della Rocco star in this Tarantino influenced, ultra-violent opus about two slaughterhouse workers and, what appears to be, a blood thirsty nut. They inadvertently come across a cache of guns and money, and are soon on a crusade to end the corruption and crime around the fair city of Boston. While pursuing their righteous aims, they, themselves, are pursued by a gay FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe. Along the way, they meet up with and dispense with a huge assortment of Boston's criminal element. While killing their targeted victims, they recite a prayer, adding to the bizarre picture we have in front of us. The Tarantino influences are here: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Director Troy Duffy's choice to use lesser known actors is a great decision, even though the budget probably dictated it. The violence is staged well and is comically operatic at times. The film is very entertaining and action-packed, but the reason for their sudden engagement in a life of retribution is never really clear. We never learn much about the characters either. The film does pose an interesting to the Dafoe character, that being the crusaders he's pursuing are doing the very thing he might be wishing he could do. The film raises very interesting points like this along the way, but never develops them beyond suggestion. Perhaps the sequel will, which is in production right now. Perhaps it will be just another kill-fest, which teases us with philosophical questions. Either way it's sure to be entertaining, although not fully realized. This is a surefire cult film with an interesting director to watch. **1/2 of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read ooodles and ooodles or reviews about this film, claiming it to be unoriginal trash. But it's really not. Note to all: It is possible to make a great movie, without "copying" somebody else. Would you call Spielberg "Unoriginal"?? Sure, why not? The idea of aliens DID exist before he came around, right?? Are you getting my point?? It's possible to build on things that already exist, and making it original all at the same time. That's exactly what Troy Duffy has done here. Just because Boondock Saints has scenes that go backwards (crime scene investigation followed by the crime itself), that does not mean he got the effect from Tarantino. It's inspiration, not copyright infringement.Many may ask: How the hell does this movie has such a big cult following?? Well, I ask you: Why does Rocky Horror Picture Show, or Star Wars, or Star Trek, or X-Files have such HUGE cult followings? Both have the same answer; Because all these things awakened something on the inside of people, which in turn caused them to love it. It sounds cheesy, but the truth isn't anything but some big ball of cheese, right? Think about it. Think of something you truly love....and then think about someone's review of it---tearing it to pieces. That's mostly what I see going on around here. People LOVE this movie. And why not, it's amazing. But when they read something some loser with no imagination wrote about it, they are going to defend it at all costs.*Spoilers Ahead* When watching this movie for the first time, you gotta have an open-mind. It's a rule. You're not gonna get through a movie about two-highly-religious-Irish-brothers-that-go-around-murdering- criminals-while,-at-the-same-time,-outwitting-the-Boston-police,- among-them-a-cross-dressing-homosexual, without having some kind of imagination to enjoy it. Open your mind up, and have some fun. Also, to truly enjoy this film, ya gotta have a sense of humor. If you don't laugh during the scene when Rocco accidently shoots the cat and you see the poor kitty's blood and guts splattered against the wall---you don't have the right sense of humor to enjoy it properly.This film is extremely well-acted, well-directed, and just amazing. Highly recommended to all with open-minds and flexible senses of humor. :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand how other reviewers can say that they disliked this film, which film were they watching? I also don't understand the comparison with pulp fiction, in my opinion, it just does not work.This is the story of two Irish brothers and their mission: kill all of the evil men in the world. The depth of this story is incredible, and it can be taken so many ways. They can be looked at as hypocrites; because the Italian man they befriend is low on the chain of mafia men. They can be seen as heroes, cleaning up the streets, making the world a safer place. Or they can be seen as devils, who are they to decide who is evil and thereby who gets to live and die? Who made them judge, jury, and executioner?The greatest element of this movie is, as in all his other performances, Willem Dafoe. When asked who the best character of all time is, I always say Agent Paul Smecker of the boondock saints (yes, even after the emergence of Captain Jack Sparrow). Dafoe, as usual, plays his part the best, his character is great and he just nailed it.The witty comedy in this film also makes it worth seeing. Try to catch the jokes that every character makes, the Irish brothers especially are incredibly witty.The movie never stops moving, great action, with a good part told in flashback by Dafoe's investigation. Dafoe even reenacts many of the scenes himself; incredibly funny moments.Whoever said this movie is bad, I would assume that person is not too smart. In order to really appreciate this movie, one needs to come into it with a certain level of intelligence; the plot does in fact get very complex. Perhaps a second watch would allow some to appreciate this film more. I give it a high rating, a 9/10. Great job all around, can't wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Straightforward, honest, blunt, in your face and tough, this movie pulls no punches in looking at vigilante justice. Released shortly after Columbine, the movie has a very limited theatrical release. In spite of that, the movie has done well on video based on the amazing script and filming.There is no useless romantic subplot. There are no superfluous characters. It is not unbelievable like so many other action films. There is not a pretty boy hero with a six shooter who takes out *miraculously* 25 men while said 25 men use automatic weapons, yet never wound the hero. The MacManus brothers receive a vision from God to rid the world of greater forms of evil. With a witty and unusual script and filming that is refreshing and not full of overblown pyrotechnics and special effects, this is a wonderful honest film that will leave you thinking, they would, but would I?</fullReview>

Willem is gay, and he uses his disguise to infiltrate the place where he knows the brothers are held. This is a plot device too, because The Duke doesn't kill women. He thinks Willem is a woman after he gets out of the bathroom and only knocks him out, leaving him alive to participate in the final scene. The way he turned toward their cause is explained in the confession scene earlier in the movie.Thank you. Shane</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints was one of those movies that if you blinked, you missed it. Luckily I had enough people buzzing in my ear about it that I made sure I went out and found it. It's not Tarantino (even though it thinks it might be), but it's a whole lot of fun anyway. If it wasn't for Sean Patrick Flanery's Lucky Charm's accent I would have enjoyed the film even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies ever made. The script is just amazing as is the directing, both done by the new great-to-be filmmaker Troy Duffy. Duffy's use of time is almost like those of Chris Nolan's in Memento and Following but in a different style. Every part is picked perfectly and played to perfection itself. Willem Dafoe, an unbelievable actor regardless of this movie, plays the perfect role as the homosexual FBI agent; Flannery and Reedus work perfectly together as the McMannus brothers, as well as whoever plays the bad Boston detective, whose bit part is perfect for the Boston set film. One of the scenes towards the end with Il Duce is one of the greatest scenes in a movie i've ever seen, outside of Jesus' bowling scene in the Big Lebowski. This is probably the best movie nobody knows about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Why doesn't someone just go in and kill them if they are such a problem?"--This movie is what happens when someone takes care of the problem and every problem in their city. The movie takes takes place in Boston and tells the story of the Mac Manus brothers, and how they become fed up the the "bad" people in their city and they decide to "clean" up their town, by killing these low-lifes and mob bosses, with the approval of God.This is such a great movie and it is a shame that it was made for TV and not for the big screen, but it is a jewel none-the-less. the movie entertains you and also makes you think. It has a kind of religious feel to it but it is the vengence and wrath part of religion, and these two brothers are both.The filming is in the style of Quentin Tarantino and Guy Richie, but truly original. This film has passion and you feel for the two brothers on their quest. The action scenes are very fast like Snatch. The lines are very memorable and so are many of the scenes. I promise you that this movie will not let you down and once you finish watching it you will want to buy it, good luck though. 10 out of 10 NO LESS!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...the opening scene where the Irish MacManus brothers come out from the catholic church, is one of the best opening scenes ever made, with the great theme music! This is not just a violent story with two psychopaths. These are angels, sent from heaven to make the world a better place for everybody, by killing all evil....that is atleast what they believe! The story of the friendship between the brothers Conner and Murphy are also an important issue of this movie. Willem Dafoe plays a great role as FBI agent Paul Smecker head investigator of this case. Paum Smecker is a weird man, whom is gay, but finds out that he really want to help these angels instead of getting them into prison. The end is not suprisingly, but the film has some great acting performances, great music and some really great and bloody action scenes, in Pulp Fiction style, this film is even beter than PF at some points!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints may just be the most brilliant satire ever filmed. While parody usually takes an over-the-top approach--think Naked Gun, nearly anything with Charlie Sheen--that eliminates any question of purpose, this movie was produced with a much more subtle touch. Watching it, you might be lulled into thinking it's a serious take on the vigilante movie. When the closing credits start to roll, it finally hits you--you just sat through 100 minutes of perfectly scripted commentary on the ridiculous nature of such movies. While some directors would have been more direct--you could almost picture those two-of-the-same MacManus twins picking lice off each other like a couple of monkeys--this guy kept the story below the surface.</fullReview>

The strip club scene did not depict the slaying of "innocent" men like the reviewer above thinks; they were Mafia associates and their deaths tied right in with the plot. Agreeing with some other critics, the movie does resemble some of the work of Quentin Tarantino, but not so much that I would call it a "wanna-be" at all. The plot could be a little tighter, but otherwise this movie was outstanding. Plenty of action, good story line, they set it up nicely for the sequel to be released this year.

		<shortDescription>The best sleeper movie since The Matrix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that I've calmed down I can write the review. I tried straight after watching the film and used the word awesome about 6 times. You may have appreciated my passion but the review would have hardly been illuminating.OK, the film is awesome but I think its fair to also say it is excellent: its highly entertaining and it makes us, the audience, think (and argue about ad nauseum on IMDb). I wasn't bored for a second, more like I was paralysingly concerned for what was going to happen next. What more do you want? Like another reviewer expressed, this film gets a massive 10/10. It would have only got a seven or an eight except that there are at least two or three scenes that would be in the top 1000 scenes of all time. I tried to mark it down but found I couldn't. Nothing wrong with the script, cinematography, music score, &amp; acting (great chemistry between the two Irish brothers). But that would still have only garnered a nine.The extra mark goes to the director for his inventive story-telling - while The Boondock Saints is linear from start to finish, throughout the film we get the information a little differently. It doesn't give anything away to say a large part of the film concerns various crime scenes. In one of them, you get the crime scene first and then you get to see what happened. Willem Dafoe plays the clever FBI agent. First we see him try to guess how the crime scene came to be and then we get to see how it happened and thus see if the FBI agent was right. Good idea and well done.But the director doesn't just leave it at that. For one of the crime scenes we get to see Dafoe's explanation as the action occurs. Really thrilling. And I haven't even mentioned the Firefight scene. Look at some other reviews for very passionate explanations of how we get to see the full acting range of the astounding Willem Dafoe.I haven't seen a film this good - that wasn't an immediate smash hit but deserved to be - since The Matrix and The Usual Suspects. It is my humble opinion that the quality of The Boondock Saints is in that sort of company.Finally the question of the moral dilemma. Can there be any justification for vigilantism? Firstly the film obviously turns around this question and then we get the excellent footage through the credits of vox pops of people on the street about what they thought of 'The Saints'. The full range seems to be included (lots of 'no comment', 'its wrong' and 'where can I sign up') and it is excellently edited with a reasonably clear narrative achieved from the hundred or so people we see in the few minutes of the credits.But I can add a quote from someone who you could more or less say was a real life example of The Saints and whose image is probably the most recognised image in the world today - Che Guevara. He is accused by some as being a murderer (he did kill quite a few people) and is also thought of by lots of Cubans as a hero. The religious of those might even say he was some sort of saint so maybe the quote might be relevant. You decide."If you tremble with indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine."If the system and all its laws strays too far from an easily discernible moral compass - its easy to understand the sympathy people have for 'The Saints' as witnessed in the closing credits. But we ALL have to become saints or it ain't going to work.Where can I sign up, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kickin' Crime Comedy-Drama, Contrite Commentary Make DVD Well Worth Watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the riveting documentary OVERNIGHT, I just had to rent THE BOONDOCK SAINTS to see what all the fuss was about. Troy Duffy's writing and directing style sports enough freshness, snappy dialogue, and inventive violence that it's easy to see why an impressed Harvey Weinstein called the script "PULP FICTION with soul." I was entertained enough by this stylized black comedy-thriller to bear with its nigh-comical overuse of the F-word (intentionally so in one funny scene which, as one of our heroes puts it, "certainly illustrates the diversity of the word") and somewhat heavy-handed stereotypes, like Willem Dafoe as openly gay FBI agent Paul Smecker, swaying to Italian opera music on his portable CD while checking out a crime scene. To be fair, that bit and a humorous scene with Smecker in bed with a cuddle-happy partner are the only blatant references to his sexual orientation; the rest of the film focuses on Smecker's skill as an FBI agent, not his sex life. Dafoe is clearly having a blast as the title characters' tough, clever nemesis and reluctant admirer. Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery (Young Indiana Jones himself, all grown up!) are engaging as Connor and Murphy McManus, the "Boondock Saints" themselves. When these Irish Catholic brothers (aye, from Ye Olde Sod with brogues and all, though Reedus' Irish accent occasionally slips) clobber Russian mobsters who try to strong-arm the owner of the boys' favorite bar, their violent victory turns them into vigilantes and folk heroes in their South Boston neighborhood. The brothers truly care about each other and enjoy each other's company, which goes a long way towards making you root for them. Their knowledge of languages ("We paid attention in school...Our mother insisted on it." There's a couple of nice Irish boys for you, obeying their mom! I should know, my mom's side of the family is Irish! :-) allows them to devise all kinds of ambushes for crime families from every corner of the globe. I liked Duffy's CSI-like approach of showing our heroes about to get the drop on their targets, then cutting to the crime scene as Smecker makes his deductions, then flashing back to the McManus brothers' actual attack showing whether or not Smecker's theory was correct. I especially liked the hit where the boys and their loose-cannon friend Rocco (David Della Rocco chews the scenery, but it's fun to watch him do it) confront Il Duce (our household's favorite Scotsman Billy Connolly as the Hannibal Lector of assassins...and maybe more...) in a middle-class residential neighborhood, where Smecker literally walks us through the crime scene right alongside our heroes; he's like Rod Serling, Detective. Despite the movie's turbulent history, these ...SAINTS provide high-flying, straight-shooting, tush-kicking entertainment for action fans. Duffy's commentary track on the DVD is interesting and entertaining, too, though part of its appeal for me was listening to Duffy's tone of voice: it's the tone of a man who knows he's been a jerk and is trying to atone for his sins. Duffy might as well be saying nothing but "I'm sorry I was such a sh**head" over and over. The arrogant, insulting Duffy of OVERNIGHT is nowhere to be heard (though he can be seen in a brief cameo in the bar as our heroes kick Russian ass) as he showers heartfelt praise on his cast and crew and talks ruefully (and without mentioning certain names :-) about the near-impossibility of getting this violent indie a theatrical release in the wake of Columbine, battles with the ratings board because of said violence, and making the film on a low budget (Miramax was going to provide Duffy with a $15 million budget, but he ended up with Franchise Pictures and a super-tight $6 million budget. One of the thorns in Duffy's side was wanting to use classic rock songs in the film and finding out he couldn't because the rights to each one cost millions of dollars). A while back, Duffy announced plans for a ...SAINTS sequel with Reedus, Flanery, and Connolly reprising their roles; it'll be interesting to see if he can get that off the ground. If he does, I'd be glad to check out the further adventures of South Boston's favorite working-class vigilantes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!small spoiler, but doesn't give anything away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As by my name, you can tell i liked the film. To say it is a great movie would be an understatement. I would say it is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. If you are Irish, you WILL get a big kick out of The Boondock Saints. If you like action movies, this movie is the one to see. If you like comedies, this is a must. It is an action comedy much like that of the first and third Die Hard movies, ironically enough where the lead character is also Irish. But this film definitely ranks right up there with the Die Hard series. Since I am Irish (apparently people say i resemble Murphy McManus) and love action movies, The Boondock Saints is perfect. If you haven't seen it, DO! You will not be disappointed. The only thing I recommend is not watching it once and discarding it, but watching it once through, then watching it a second time which will help with flashback scenes and put the captions on. Sometimes the McManus brothers can sometimes be hard to understand, even though i should be used to the Irish accent. But theirs can often be reminiscent of Michael J. Fox's accent in Back To the Future part 3. But that passes due to the superior plot. The only hole in the plot that I can see, and people mention all the time, really isn't a hole at all. Let me give a SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! warning just in case it might give anything away (it doesn't but read at your own risk) .................................................... There has been a disagreement about the rope. If you pay attention, Murphy's rope begins to come untangled when they are above the elevator, and does get wrapped around them when they are fighting in the vent shaft. Watch it carefully.......................END SPOILER. Some of the acting may not be that good, such as David Della Rocco for most of the movie, but he does have some very funny parts. As for people saying they don't like the film because it is unrealistic, if you feel that way, then i would not recommend you see Ghostbusters or any superhero movies like Superman or Batman. Overall, The Boondock Saints is a great movie, and is like a mix of Goodfellas, the original Matrix, and Die Hard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems like a lot of people simply don't get this film, and start to complain about pretty much every line and object in every scene about how much it sucked. While I agree it has some small flaws every now and then, the flaws that I'm thinking about are not the same that everyone that rated it 1/10 thinks of. Before you start watching this film (and you don't get it while watching it), you need to know that this is a movie that on purpose made to be over the top. The Irish are Irish, the stupid cops are often retarded, the homosexual is flaming etc, and to top it off they've got a message from god to go out and kill people. To explain further, this movie has the same kind of over-the-top, sometimes just bizarre, dark humor that you can see in for example Tarantinos Inglorious Basterds (a movie in which the name is even misspelled to further point out this phenomenon).While this movie is still kick ass action, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Its humoristic and brings up an, at the time of its release, very fresh angle on vigilantism. Its a real 'guy-movie', which I think is great being male myself and all that, but it probably wouldn't be the first nor second movie I would put on, should I be in female company.Cult status well earned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A trip down Memory Lane - Boondock Saints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that Boondock Saints (1999) is one of the best movies ever. I give it a 9.9 out of 10 stars (no one is perfect). The movie begins in a church, during Christian mass, where a priest is telling a true story about a young girl who was killed in front of 16 people who did nothing to help her. During the priest's story you see two men, who you later learn are Irish fraternal twins Connor &amp; Murphy McManus, get up from their seats during the priest's speech, kneel, and pray in front of a wooden statue of Jesus and leave. This scene sets the tone of the movie much like a great speaker opens with impact that captivates the attention of the audience. The movie centers around these two "Saints" who kill evil men, the wrong doers in their city. They begin by eliminating two "soldiers" of the Russian mob who want McGinty's bar to close down where the Saints enjoy spending their free time drinking and socializing with friends. The Saints wouldn't have these men from the mob close down the bar so a fight ensued with the Saints coming out victorious. The Russian mob soldiers followed the Saints home and attempted to kill both of them but once again were beaten by the Saints but this time ending in their deaths. The plot continues when Rocky (David Rocco), an errand boy for the Italian mob, aids the Saints by using his knowledge of the mob to find and eliminate the rapists, murders, and other forms of scum that he previously worked for. After realizing that the Saints and Rocky are exterminating his people, Papa Joe the leader of the Italian mob brings in "The Duke" to take care of his "problem". After many more deaths and a heck of a lot of action, the Saints and Rocky get captured by the very man they are trying to kill, Papa Joe, who ends up killing one of them. After the murder, no one was expecting what happens next... Overall, the movie was extremely good with its plot, acting, special effects and various ways to use the F-word. The movie is set in an urban environment in modern times in the city of Boston. The costumes were very realistic and believable for the time of shooting and set the heroes of this movie (The Saints) to be average everyday people, with amazing killing skills set aside. There was little to no lighting needed because most of the time the scenes were shot in rooms that were well illuminated or outside in the daytime. The sound effects of this movie were very good and believable, such as gun shots sounded realistic and breaking glass sounded like glass shattering. The quality of the sound was also excellent meaning you can hear their footsteps, voices, etc. very clearly. This movie is so good you can watch it over and over again and learn something new each time. I believe the actors chosen to play Connor &amp; Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery &amp; Norman Reedus) could not have possibly been any better. Even Rocky (David Rocco) was a great choice. David Rocco (Rocky) lived up to the "Funny man" with his enthusiasm and believability. This movie is full of action, great acting, a extremely well written plot, and jam packed full of good actors to enhance your viewing pleasure. If you have never seen this movie before I suggest you go out now and watch it, and even if you have to go out and see it a second time you will agree with me, it is just THAT good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best 1999 movie apart from »The Matrix»</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intense, insane, unstoppable action-movie, with good performances and a delicious rhythm. Crazy, lazy, seriously by the way they see what they do, selected killer brothers (Connor and Murphy), and a goofy assistant (Rocco). If it were more bloody I should say: It's a Quentin Tarantino/ Robert Rodriguez movie. Quite a surprise when I watched it in 2009. Didn't know what I was missing up to then. A brilliant performance by Willem Dafoe (detective Smecker)was a great added value for the final result. Comparable perhaps to «Crank», for the speed, the insanity, and the frequent turn overs, I suggest everyone to dedicate less than 2 hours an rejoice this piece. Also Sean Flanery and Norman Reedus were OK for the job. Preety good directing it, Troy Duffy will be back with a sequel on this very 2009 year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Disagree. The Movie is Awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike the other posts here, I found this movie very good. I love small time mafia movies like Snatch, Pulp Fiction and Departed. This movie falls into these categories, I believe.These two main actors are likable because they are out to do good by f'in murdering criminals that deserve it. There are scenes that remind me of video game scenes where the Boss is with his fellas and the movie sets up the atmosphere well. Next, the guys are on to destroy another Boss.There's something rewarding about watching this movie. 2 guys fed up with criminals going free because of red tape and working the system. This movie reminds me a lot of different people in my life. My friends and I love these type of movies. Bravo.This will be a sleeper hit for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"...the indifference of good men..." O.k., let's get right into it...I'll admit up front that movies dealing with vigilantism are usually made in poor taste, serving only to appeal to the visceral. I'll also admit that films which use religion as a counterpart to the vigilantism are also made in bad taste. I am fully aware of the negative comments that THE BOONDOCK SAINTS have received from a number of 'esteemed' folks who denigrate this movie as tasteless, stereotypical, childish, etc. I urge these 'critics' to take a closer look at the movie; beyond the stylised violence and the Hollywood lines lies a film that delves deeply into the heart of vigilantism and justice in a manner that has not been seen before.Indeed, very few films deal with this clichéd subject matter as effectively, and with as little pretentiousness, as THE BOONDOCK SAINTS. Where the religion aspect is incorporated does not degrade the film but actually uplifts it (no pun intended) as this is the one of the few films of its kind to be so awesomely effective. Yes, this film is overly stylish. Yes, it contains Hollywood-styled dialogue. Yes, it contains a killer score (again, no pun intended). And yes, there are obvious visible flaws. But the end result is much more than the sum of its parts, and the mock interviews at the end of the film serve to drive the point home: that when it comes to vigilantism, people, regardless of religion or race or social status, have always been highly divided.The acting is nothing to marvel at, as Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are effective without being too flashy. Their interaction is quite good, and serves as a driving point for this vehicle. Willem Dafoe shines in one of his strangest roles of all time, as the somewhat effeminate yet masculine homosexual FBI detective who continually questions whether the actions of the brothers are right or wrong. Bill Connolly has a good cameo here, and is reliable as ever, and David Della Rocco is also quite good. None of the cast is superb, but in a film such as this, they don't really need to be.Suffice it to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Not only was I viscerally excited and entertained as the body count rose in increasingly stylish fashion, but no movie has made me think so seriously about the very nature of vigilantism and the inadequacies of the justice system (except maybe Christopher Nolan's BATMAN BEGINS and THE DARK KNIGHT, where the character already had the monetary means to carry out his plans, and Showtime's DEXTER, where the character already had the know-how and information to carry out his plans).THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is an excellent and exceptional movie. For this reason I am prepared to rate it as a 9/10 and give it 3.5 stars. This movie should enter my Top 100 at #77. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Could killing people and getting away with it really be possible in today's world? What if someone could actually pull this off? Would the world really be that much better off than what it was previously? These were some of the question I was asking myself after I saw this movie for the first time. It was a captivating movie that made me really wonder if what I saw was possible. The movie is Boondock Saints (1999), one of the greatest action thrillers I have every seen. Troy Duffy, the movies producer and writer, combined a cast and crew that formulated a perfect story of two Irish Boston brothers who find themselves at the center of Boston's crime scene. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus play Irish brothers, Connor and Murphy MacManus and David Della Rocco plays the brother's best friend, "the funny man." The movie is rated "R" for strong violence, language and sexual content. This movie was even banned from some theaters due to the graphic nature of the film. The movie begins in Boston on Saint Patrick's Day and for most Irish men, St. Patty's Day is a big event. However, for these two Irish brothers, this holiday will be one they will never forget. It starts when they get in a bar fight with two members of the Russian Mob. The MacManus brothers make it back to their apartment safely that night, but in the morning the Russian Mobsters track the brothers down and break into their apartment. They're looking to kill. The brothers however, turn the tables on the mobsters and violently slay them with what seems to be a little help from a higher being. They turn themselves into the police but are let go, since, in most people's eyes, what they have done has been a good thing for the society. The brothers see this as a sign from God and begin roaming the city and killing all criminals that are causing harm to the citizens of Boston. They massacre several groups of criminals in a violent and bloody fashion that captivates the audience. With a twist at the end that no one sees coming, this movie gets a rating of four stars out of five. The only thing I would have liked to see was more plot detail and better Irish ascents. However, the good outweighs the bad just like the bullets fly just as easy as people breathe.The main characters are identified early, being the MacManus brothers, "The Funny Man", the FBI agent, and all the criminals the brothers intend to slaughter. The plot is simple and straightforward. It has one twist but not until the end, however, it is a twist that leaves the viewer a little stunned. The setting, Boston, Massachusetts, is an appropriate city for the shooting of this movie. With ties to the Russian Mob, Boston was the right pick. This gives the movie a little more authenticity and realism. Authenticity also comes through in the form of symbols, including the pennies, which are symbols of currency so the dead have something to offer to get into the afterlife and the rope, which symbolizes irony and struggle between the brothers. The costumes of the mob members are perfect to what the common person thinks a Russian Mobster should wear, including flashy white suits with gold chains and chest hair sticking out the top of the collar. And the color black, which the brother's wear, is perfect for the dark and suspicious roles that they play. Makeup also plays a major role in this movie. With all the blood shed, someone has to make it look real. Mario G. Cacioppo did just that as the films makeup artist. Especially, when the brothers and "The Funny Man" had to iron their wounds shut since they could not go to the hospital due to the fear of getting caught. The music used gives the viewer a sense that they are watching something so dramatic that anything could happen at anytime and gives it a true dramatic movie feel. The music has almost a religious tone to it that make it seem like they are performing Gods work. Along with the music, the camera angles also show that the brothers are empowered. They are often shown with close up shots and shots with the camera down below as if they have a lot of power. They also use aspects like slow motion to make the scenes more dramatic and commanding. Boondock Saints obviously displays many literary, theatric, and cinematic elements within the movie that make it a stellar film. However, one of the most powerful parts of the movie is a simple prayer the brother's say every time they execute one of their victims. "Sheppard's we shall be, For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands. So we shall flow a river forth to Thee, And teeming with souls shall it ever be. In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti." I found this prayer very powerful and, oddly, I got goose bumps every time I heard it. Overall, this movie is a "must see" and a great fictional film that leaves us with one question, "Would this really be possible?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading some of the comments left about this movie, and I just want to know one thing...What? First off, how did this movie fail? sure the critics hated it, it didn't get a proper theatrical release, but it still managed to some how reach cult status among fans, AND there is a Sequel on the way (The Boondock Saints II: All Saints Day), I have heard it from Duffy on you tube. Second, how does this movie not show motive? The brothers believe they had a message from god "destroy all which is evil " "so that which is good may flourish". This movie has a heavy religious overtone, which makes sense because the brothers are Irish Catholics. What else? Oh, yeah, Smecker's reason for joining the brothers is because, LIKE HE SAID, he believes what these guys are doing is necessary and correct because he "...puts evil men behind bars...but there are miles of red tape and loopholes". So, there are some examples that puts holes in some of your arguments to why this movie sucks. Maybe you should watch it a few more times and PAY ATTENTION, turn on the subtitles so you can know, without a doubt, what they are saying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For years (literally) I have been hearing what a great movie "The Boondock Saints" is. Unfortunately, I didn't watch it until recently. This movie is outstanding. Unlike a lot of crime movies, this one tells its tale in a novel, well thought out... and sometimes bizarre way. There is gratuitous violence and profanity which makes it unsuitable for children but it is great Friday night film for adults. Troy Duffy did a great job writing and directing this picture and the acting in it is outstanding. I did feel however, that some of the errors hindered the film from perfection. It is sad that this movie didn't garner more attention than it did, but it nonetheless is a genuine piece of cinematic treasure worthy of any film collection. It is not a new flick, but anyone interested in crime movies (it even has humor in it too) who has not seen it should not wait any longer, go rent or buy it, (certainly worth the money) you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

And I'm truly grateful i didn't let it go me by.The film is all about justice and punishment. But not in any courtroom. This is about street justice where the blood of the evil shall rain down from the sky. The MacManus brothers sees themselves as send by god to punish the evil and corrupted. The punishment is death. But as they go about their business an FBI agent draws closer and closer. Will he be able to stop them, or are the MacManus brothers truly gods saints? Don't let this flick pass you by. Its a great action movie with superb music and sound."When i raise my flashing sword, and my hand takes hold in judgement, i will take vengeance upon mine enemies and i shall repay those who hates me.

		<fullReview>After hearing so much about it, i finally picked up a copy of The Boondock Saints and watched it. Now i know why everyone talks about it so much, what an amazing movie.Though some of the action and jokes were a bit corny, the overall intent of the movie was spot on. The character of Rocco was a bit far fetched, and he brought the overall seriousness of the movie down a little bit. However, i think he is a key character in the sense that, he, a senseless hoodlum, can end up becoming a reckless vigilante. I'm not sure if the filmmakers intent was to lead you to think that what they did was wrong, but Rocco was definitely evidence supporting that. I, like many others, would be scared to know that guys like Rocco are walking the streets killing "bad" people.The McManus brothers were more thoughtful and sincere in their plotting to kill evil-doers. The are on the opposite side of Rocco on that same coin. They lead us to believe that there are people out there with their heads on straight, and that they are capable of doing good the dirty way.The filmmakers were neutral, however. They leave it up to the viewer to decide. This is made known in the background scenes of the credits which show the citizens being interviewed. Some may think they are doing good; others think they are complete whack jobs with guns. It's up to you to decide...Thats why i particularly enjoyed this one.One criticism i do have of the movie, however, is the whole subplot of The Duke. Who is this guy? What did he do? And why the hell does he randomly side with the McManus brothers?!? Other than that i thought the story was great. Others may think that the corny religious music and Christian undertones was poor. I, however, am a sucker for the melodramatic music and religious plugs. This movie is awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember going to college freshman year and finding that nearly everyone I met had a Boondock Saints poster, or the soundtrack pirated on their laptops, or the DVD laying in a place of honor amongst their movie stash. The special edition of the DVD became a treasured prize. After a while, I actually got sick of the hype and craziness (it became the "it" movie of my circle of friends for a while much like how Family Guy quotes suddenly became a second language), but my love for the movie remains.The cast is incredible. The brothers have intense chemistry, and Willem Dafoe is a viewing addiction. The structure is disjointed, owing much to Tarantino films and other films with slick style, adding to the entertainment value. The "morality" of the main characters is simplistic and character development is shallow, but takes little away from the wonderful action scenes and the intrigue of watching the police and the mob try to keep up with them. This is the kind of movie that bleeds badass.When the movie came out, it was anything but a success. It had a limited theatrical release of only five theaters for one week, and was met with poor critical reviews. It performed well on DVD, but most critics panned it. It's all about flash, and only the ambivalent ending asks the hard questions of whether or not such vigilante justice is merited. It may be hard for some people to understand WHY this movie became a cult hit, when many critics still believe it's entirely undeserving of such status. The story behind the making of the movie certainly doesn't help anything (see the documentary "Overnight"), considering that Troy Duffy, the director, sabotaged himself with his own ego.At least for the people I have known who have loved it, Boondock Saints taps into a feeling, much how Fight Club does. With a cynical viewpoint on the world, the desire to see someone fight against it comes out. Basically, the movie is a venting of frustrations in an entertaining and violent way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vigilantism through God "And shepherds we shall be for thee, my Lord, for the Power hath descended forth from Thy hand our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands so we shall flow a river forth to Thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti.""The Boondock Saints is about two Irish brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus who accidentally kill two mafia gang members"(IMDb). They turn themselves in and are arrested and while in prison they "hear" a call from God. They believe that God wants them to rid the world of all human evil. They are released from prison and they set out on a mission. Their mission is to follow God's call by killing members of the Russian mob and the Italian mafia. Detective Smecker tries to figure out why they are killing mafia members even though he somehow believes that they are doing it for the good of mankind. Deep down he wishes he could do what they are doing.The central idea of this film is vigilantism. Vigilantism is when a person takes the law into his or her own hands to avenge a crime. The MacManus brothers are considered vigilantes but they are not just targeting one specific person. They are not avenging a crime which is usually what vigilantes do. They are following God's call and targeting mafia men. Hence the central idea of the movie would be to redefine vigilantism. This film does a good job of achieving what it is supposed to accomplish.I really enjoyed this film. The dialogue was a little hard to understand at first. But when they speak in different languages there are subtitles at the bottom of the screen which helps us to understand. The characters were very dramatic in this movie which made it even better. They were very passionate about what they were doing. The only somewhat difficult thing about this movie is that we have to pay close attention to what is going on. If we do not, we end up missing something important, and we will be confused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many of us have daydreamed about doing what the McManus Brothers do in this movie. Enjoy the neural fantasy they provide you. Reality is nothing like this, no matter how much someone may wish otherwise.I saw this movie for the first time when my son showed it to me less than a month ago. I went out and bought it and have watched it over a dozen times since then. Every time I pick up something I missed prior.This is definitely the kind of movie that can become a cult flick. Either you'll love it or you'll hate it.If I focused on all the things technically incorrect about guns, shootings, crimes scenes, mafia, etc etc I'd miss the point of this movie.It's flat wacky entertainment at its best.The only reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 is to tell the writer to write it over and make the McManus Brothers act like the pros they really can be. What he'd end up with is a 10. Dafoe as a Drama Queen, Rocco as someone any pro would get near, the 2 bit ex porn star as Italian Mafia, etc give the movie color, character, and comedy. But not pros.For the anti-gun crowd, none of the guns used in this movie were real and none of the animals were truly harmed in any manner. Unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would be the first to tell anyone that I despise so called "shoot 'em up movies." This movie certainly fits that description, but there is so much behind the violence and the obscenities. Firstly, Willem Dafoe is an amazing actor. He portrays a brilliant gay FBI agent who listens to classical music to aid him in his crime-stopping endeavors and ends up with a moral dilemma: he believes the Macmanus brothers are doing the right thing by killing off the scum of society, but he feels obligated to do his job and bring the killers to justice. He ultimately decides to not only not turn them in, but to assist them in their efforts. Dafoe delivers what is in my opinion the best line in the movie when he throws up his arms and yells "There was a Firefight!" Secondly, it was absolutely brilliant to have Dafoe explaining the crime the Macmanus brothers committed as the audience is seeing it for the first time. This is a marvelous technique which is also used in Ghost Ship to great effect, but that is another review. Lastly, this movie grapples with very interesting issues prevalent in our society today. If someone in Boston or New York was killing off pimps and mobsters, would you have a problem with that? I know I wouldn't. Overall, The Boondock Saints is an extremely thought provoking and well done movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an amazing movie. You either love it or hate it, but that's what makes it even more controversial. I think that a majority of the people who rate the movie low don't understand the movie. One other person that commented said that they didn't understand why the "unidentified old man" decided to join the brothers because of the prayer. That guy is their father. Since he's been in jail for 25 years, when they see each other, they don't realize that they are family. But when they speak the prayer, and the older man joins in, they realize that that's their father. Also, I don't think that the mafia guys that they killed in the alley were their first kill. I believe that they have been doing this for awhile, hence, the prayer, etc.I'm really hoping to see a sequel to Boondock Saints, although I'm not sure that there will be. I think that Duffy did an excellent job, and I don't think that many people fully appreciate this movie. Although I agree with others that Boondock Saints isn't exactly Tarantino, I believe that Duffy has great potential.</fullReview>

My friends finally convinced me to watch the theatrical version, and after the last piece of footage rolled, I was at a loss of words.This film has a plot that is simply perfect, and I have found no flaws in it. It grasps you from the moment the first scene rolls, and you will be left staring at the screen during the credits. Sean Patrick Flanery's and Norman Reedus's powerful acting, along with the other characters, literally sucks you into the TBS experience. Action and adventure awaits you as you press the play button on your DVD player for this movie, and you will not be disappointed. A hint of comedy, reality, and the obvious diverse use of the "f-word" is something that TBS presents whole heartedly to the screen.I strongly urge all who have not scene this piece of cinematic history to pick up a copy today.</fullReview>

It was also amazing and quite funny to see Defoe play a gay FBI agent with a low tolerance for fellow yet idiotic policemen.I watched this first at a friend's and loved it so much I bought it. I was disappointed to learn that a lot of the action scenes were chopped up, all but the language of course.

It ranges from a gay detective to to a bartender with turrets. It blends very nicely a combination of seriousness with humor. Also there is a great showing in the movie of how family can stick up for each other and over come obstacles. A cool things that they do that confused me and i really think made it a better movie was they first went ahead in time and then show you what really happened. This leaves you to guess what really happened before you see for sure. I like how this movie ends and i am not happy that they never built off of the ending.

So enjoyable seeing a gay character that does not fall into the handiest cliché.It also does a good job as blurring the line between hero and villain, as two brothers set out to do what a detective wishes would be done.There are surprises, but I didn't click the "Contains spoiler" check box, so I'm keeping mum.</fullReview>

Consuming as the many plots may have been, I watched them and enjoyed quite a few.The I was at my friends house. We had watched A Few Good Men, and Donnie Darko and other such movies that I had watched before but always were good for a few laughs or surprises. He put in Boondock Saints.Now keep in mind I have always been someone that will fight the system in any way I know how. I do not back down. The movie came on. I was mesmerized. I have never been as locked into the lives of characters outside of reading a great novel. If ever there was a movie that as a movie could be considered that well written this is it.The two brothers are your average Irish Catholic blue collar workers, just trying to make ends meet in the ghetto of Boston. They care deeply for family and friends, and end up protecting the bar to which they are regulars at. In that they angered off the Russians they had fought. Through out the movie they take on the responsibility the cops of South Boston are afraid to do. They try to take out every evil person they can find, or at least whatever they consider evil.If you have not watched this yet. Watch it. If your Catholic, Blue Collar, Intelligent, or just plain sick of people doing evil you will connect with them. You will feel just that much better about the world around you. You'll also probably be ranting about how you wish their were more people like them in this world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch The Boondock Saints you have to have an open mind about it. It is one of my most favorite movies ever. I probably memorized most of the words. I was on the edge of my seat watching every second of it. It only has been becoming more popular recently and I'm glad to see that because it should have more recognition. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus did a phenomenal job as two fraternal Irish brothers out to kill evil. William Dafoe also did an awesome job as an FBI agent. Everything about the movie was great to me from the beginning to the end. This movie is definitely worth a rent. You'll laugh, you'll get amped by the scenes, and love every minute of it like I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints, written and directed by Troy Duffy, is one of the best movies I have ever seen. First off, it one of the most original movies I have ever seen. The plot is fast-paced, and the characters are unlike any I've ever seen. Each character has a life, but the movie does not go too deep into it because it does not add to the plot. Duffy seems to keep the story moving while keeping the characters in personality for every shot. Willem Dafoe's character, detective Smecker, is unlike anything I've ever seen. He is creepy yet amusing and I don't think I will ever forget his performance. Another thing that makes this movie so great is it's humor. While it is a serious subject matter, the movie has many funny scenes and lines that made me laugh out loud. The last thing that I want to put into this review to explain why this movie is great is its unique storytelling. The viewer sees the crime scene, then the crime, and then the aftermath. It keeps you interested more than other movies because it is so original. The actions scenes are amazing, well choreographed, and the viewers relates well with the characters. All in all, The Boondock Saints is an absolutely brilliant movie that should not be missed by anyone if they enjoy movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I have said in my several other comments that I have been looking for movies that did not try to make a suspense action thriller with a twisted ending and fail horribly at the ending. All I wanted was an action movie that had almost no plot but the acting and the dialogs would keep me sitting tight in position. This movie was it. Even though I admit it is a fairly old movie it still has its explosive charms and witty comeback lines which makes this movie one of my Friday night favorites. I have permanently added the word "insignificunt" into my repertoire as a result. Good fun movie and for that reason alone it gets a 6. however it only gets a 6 because it is nothing but a fun flick that should not be mistaken for a thrilling and meaningful masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boondock Saints, a great ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints seems to be just your average action cult movie none the less. It has a pretty average/weak plot and over the top action sequences. Been there, done that.At least thats what i thought 30 minutes into the movie. Just give it some time and it will unfold some crazy eye candy and some very great acting from William Defoe. The best parts of the movie come when William D. is trying to uncover the mystery behind these strange murders in Boston. You see him jumping around the room explaining explaining whats happening, doing his job, but the cool thing is, you see "the Saints" actually committing the crime at the same time.As an example, you'll see The Saints on one side of the street shooting at some guy thats on the other side of the street, with William Defoe in the middle in-visioning the whole thing, it's good stuff.A very great idea, very well executed. The movie pulls off that overall "cool" feel, with good performances from the other actors as well.I'd say, if your a Tarantino/Rodriguez fan this movie is just right for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealism, yet brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing that I enjoyed the most about Boondock Saints is the fact that there is no boundaries for right or wrong in this movie. Moral vs. immoral and legal vs. illegal. Yes, the first two "killing" scenes were very very unrealistic, yet, possible. Even so, the movie has the best plot I have ever seen and it had the best ending I have ever seen a movie have. No thoughts even came close to my mind about the movie ending the way it did. But what I truly love about Boondock Saints, is that in order for any of it to make sense, you have to see three key parts. The very opening scene in the church, as they leave the Sin Bin, and the ending. The movie is about killing, yes, but unlike other murder and action films, this one requires you to listen to the words spoken as well as those unspoken, which in my mind, are some of the most brilliant things I have heard. Also I would have to say that Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery are two of the best actors I have seen, and I am so upset that Boondock 2 All Saints Day cannot be made. It's a shame.</fullReview>

All the actors in the film are so good in their parts and it is so well written. It is by far one of my all time favorite movies. I don't know how to explain the movie with out giving anything away. I just know that when I have company and we are just hang out we watch that movie and everyone has the same reaction, I have to get that movie. So as you can tell by my review I can not say enough about it and you really should check it out. I don't see how you will be disappointed.Pleaes! Would you who are the makers of the movies please get over yourself and make "All Saints Day" speaking for all the fans of this movie we are dying to see #2. And to Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus I hope you both will be in it, if it ever gets made and you are not in it there will be no reason to see it. From one of so many fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day, my cousin said to me, "bro, have you seen The Boondock Saints?", my reply was "huh, The Boondock Saints". He was dumbfounded that I had not seen it, and he was a religious supporter of the movie for years. So naturally after hearing how HIGHLY he rated it, I had to buy the movie before seeing it. Best $24.95 (AUS) I've ever spent.This movie is a perfect example of how GREAT a low budget movie can be if you have great directing, cast selection and execution of the script.You've heard the name, The Boondock Saints. You've heard the cast, Willem Dafoe, Billy Connolly, Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus.

		<shortDescription>Two Irish brother kill for God after a near death experience with Russian mob</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is a one-of-a-kind movie. It is an action movie but without all of the fancy stuff you see now a days. It is about two Irish brothers who on Saint Patricks Day, get into a bar fight with Irish mob Syndicates who are buying out land in Boston. The Russians then come to their loft and try to kill one of the brothers. The other brother in turn kills them, saving his brother. They don't get arrested but they stay a night in the jail-house and have a "message from God" while sleeping. They then turn to vigilantism to kill sinners. This movie is a recommendation for those who like killing but without over doing it, and for those who like to watch just plain good movies. Other recommendations if you like this are Pulp Fiction and Resevior Dogs</fullReview>

A wonderful deep movie with just enough comedy added. It's violent but the gore is not the center of the movie. The acting in the movie is also phenomenal. Willam Defoe is at him prime here. The dark humor mixed with the serious message of indifference makes for a one of a kind movie experience. I also recommend watching the cut scenes. Just one more thing to love. If you enjoy movies such as "Way of the Gun" or "Fight Club" then this is most definitely the movie for you. not to mention that this is THE BEST MOVIE EVER!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is one of the oddest film phenomena I know of. It has been reviewed by no major critic, was barely in theatres at all, and now has this hugely massive cult following that seems virtually unexplainable. Is this following justified? Does Boondock Saints actually live up to all the hype about it. Well, yes and no.The movie tells of two Irish brothers who get caught up in some sort of mob action. From there, they give themselves up to the police, and are subsequently released. Then they decide that it is their mission to kill all the bad guys. From the get go, the plot is slightly confusing. This does not detract too much from it, though. In fact, it actually enhances the story, setting it apart from most "is killing bad if you kill bad guys" movies. The violent scenes are told in a very creative fashion, and one in particular is stunningly memorable.Willem Dafoe plays the cop who is after these guys. Though his acting is nothing mind-blowing, it is very well played, just over the top enough to fit his character, and just subtle enough to make the character believable. The actors who play the Irish brothers are well cast, as well - and they gel quite nicely as brothers.The score of the film is another thing that sets it apart - it is distinct, memorable, and unique. Ominous when it needs to be, joyful at other points, and overall a very nice fit.The Boondock Saints poses some very intriguing questions, and not in a pathetic and obvious way. Though sometimes the excessive violence and seemingly gratuitous sex detract from it, overall it is a well-thought out action flick and completely worth a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few movies can move anyone as deeply as this one; it's truly inspiring in its own right. Killing in the name of righteousness: Good or evil? You decide, but the choice is clear to most viewers. If swears aren't your thing, of course, neither is this movie, but then again why would you be watching an 'R' rated movie? This movie is filled with humor, action, questions, justice and the lack thereof. Granted, I can't write very well now as it's 2:00 in the morning, but I can't say enough good things about this movie. It is, without a doubt, my second favorite movie I have ever seen, second to Good Will Hunting. Two brothers making their city safer from pimps, drug dealers, murderers rapists and more, taking them out one by one (or, as it were, by the bunch). "The first few just fell into our lap," they say; but the question is, do they have what it takes to go as far as is needed?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is a lesser known movie than most, but I have absolutely no idea why. This movie is incredible and one of my top five favorite movies of all time. It's a bit Tarantino-esquire. It has really no big stars except for Willem Dafoe (Norman Ozbourne/ Green Goblin - Spider-Man). He isn't the main character though. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus star as two highly religious Irish men who believe they're on a mission from God. They decide to track down all the low life's and mafia members and criminals in South Boston and shoot the crap outta them. An FBI agent (Dafoe) is on their trail. But he believes what they do is right. He has to make a decision on weather he wants kill them...or join them. David Della Rocco co-stars. You haven't heard of him because this is the only movie he has ever been in. Not sure why. He doesn't act like a rookie. He acts like a pro. It also co-stars Billy Connolly (Series of Unfortunate Events), and Ron Jeremy (yeah that's right, the porn star). This movie is unforgettable, and one of my favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has turned into a cult classic. I could watch this one over and over again. The cinematography is spectacular. It was interesting that a movie revolved around violence did not have bloody depictions of the acts. The message was more positive despite the violent undertones. I can't wait for the sequel. This movie gave the Irish another reason to feel cool. Bad thing or not? Because on every St. Patricks Day, everyone is Irish. I wonder what plot the directors have The Duke and the brothers have moving towards. It will be interesting to see if Agent Smecker (Dafoe) becomes an integral part of the Saints. There are so many story lines that could be tackled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Strange ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bizarre, graphic tale of two Irish lads from a Boston neighborhood who get embroiled in a clash with the Russian mafia that lead them waging a holy war on the hoods of the city. Wildly entertaining with some outlandish performances by Willem Dafoe, Billy Connelly and newcomer David Della Rocco. Unfettered swearing, gore galore and some genuine funny moments make this a movie for the macho masses.Willem Dafoe plays a gay FBI agent tracking the executions of the young hit men squad and ends up admiring the boys and their mission. He is over the top and hilarious as the brilliant G-man who regularly puts the inept Boston Police Homicide Squad to shame. Billy Connolly is almost unrecognizable as the fearsome "Il Duce", a furry hit-man released from prison by the mob to track down the boys. David Della Rocco as the wild "Funny Man" is a riot to watch on the screen. The two boys, played by Flannery and Reedus have an on screen chemistry with so much charisma, it has us rooting for them at every turn. Even porn star Ron Jeremy shows up as a sleazy Russian underboss and as you guessed it: nails the role.For those negative reviews you read on this movie, it's from those who never got swept away in the zaniness of it all and took it too serious. Please gentlemen, just enjoy the ride and take it for what it is. It's not Casablanca or Citizen Kane, nor does it try to be.One-liners zing, animals are splattered against walls, James Bond style hits, torture scenes, cartridge flying gunfights, bar fights and even court room drama make this a manic adventure in the style of Tarantino. My one problem with the film is it aims to convey a disturbing message near the end instead of letting us revel in the wild ride. Still, this almost cartoonish adventure is to be indulged by action fans who want style and uniqueness in their viewing. Chances are, you will either love this movie or hate it, but either way, it will affect you. One of the best of the genre.</fullReview>

The way this movie is played is great, the camera-use isn't very special, but the actors makes this movie a perfect 10! Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery are printed in my mind as the Macmanus brothers. I've seen them in other movies, but i can't picture them as anyone else than Connor MacManus and Murphy Macmanus. Willem Dafoe and Billy Connely are the "Olive in the Martini" when it comes to making this movie more than great. I've been waiting for second one, but the release-date keeps changing.

		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie, and since that time, I've been obsessed with it. Even though it doesn't really have the biggest budget, it is still amazing in all aspects. From the very beginning I was enthralled with the plot line and the characters. I couldn't help rooting for them, even though what they were doing was incredibly violent.Some people might be blinded by all the violence, but I don't believe that violence is the central focus of the movie. It is only used to show the struggle between good and evil, and how to beat evil, good has to sink down to evil's level. Never once in the movie do the McManus brothers show any hint of being evil, though there are a few instances or teasing. They are almost always light-hearted, and they don't dwell deeply on their task. They see it as necessary, and because it is necessary, it can't be evil.Maybe it's just the workings of a 17 year old girl's brain, but I feel that this movie is just so much more than grisly violence. It's about family and brotherhood, friendship and loyalty, and most of all righting the wrongs that can occur in this world.Anyway, after all my rambling is done, all I basically have to say is that this movie is awesome and completely amazing. It's a must see for anyone that enjoys action movies with excellent plots. Actually, it's a must see for everyone</fullReview>

Inspite of the serious subject matter, it contained little gems of humor - very well done. As usual, William Dafoe is diabolically talented - I loved him. The manner in which the producers ended the movie was interesting - rolling the credits against a backdrop of people's opinions about vigilantes enticed me and my companions to get into a thought-provoking discussion about the ethical dilemmas the movie suggested. I thought the best scene was the opening mass scene: I uncomfortably felt threatened by these 2 young men; on the other hand, they certainly knew their religious lines well.

		<fullReview>I thought it was a great movie. I loved it. Yes, a lot of college students love it... but what college student doesn't like some violence? I think the reason most people don't like the movie is because they don't get it. OK, it didn't have the best acting in the world. But that's what a cult movie is all about anyways, right? I think you actually have to WATCH this movie to like it. Get into the story line... get into the characters. I think that's the only time a movie is good... when you can get into it. For me it was easy to get into this movie. It was rather comedic, the main characters were down-to-earth and not some kind of super human killing machines, they had a reason to kill (doing gods work), and the scenes of killing shown through the detective's point of view was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend of mine told me over and over again to rent this and I procrastinated because every time I looked at the box or the title, it seemed like garbage (especially since he has really bad taste in movies). So I finally rented it and it blew me away. It's a clever film with excellent acting and great direction. I'm a fan of unusual movies and Boondock Saints is one of my new favorites. It was really a funny movie - but inappropriately funny. Kind of a dark comedy, with some really great "action" scenes. They are things that really shouldn't be funny, like the gay FBI agent or the cat incident (watch and you'll understand), are somehow incredibly amusing. The film is shot in a really interesting way, with no regard to time. It goes back and forth from present to past, a bit Tarantino-ish in that aspect. Willem Dafoe's character draws you in - the way he can stand at a crime scene and just know what happened. The addition of the classical music at these times really makes for a beautiful scene.I feel it's an all-around good movie that I highly recommend.</fullReview>

I wasn't even going to watch this movie until I saw the recent film *four brothers*, afterwhich, my friend suggested the boondock saints. I have also heard it suggested by other friends and unlike one of the shmucks before me, i didn't watch it with a bunch of friends that ruined it. Don't watch this movie if you are afraid of questioning your morality, because you will feel that it is better to up hold your beliefs than to preach them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints is an essential piece of work that any budding independent film director or producer must have in his library. This film shows how to make an independent film and make it for the budget you have available. Amazing acting all the way around, great effects, great locations and a solid story. This is how your first independent film should look and feel when you are truly ready to start shopping it to distributors. Boondock Saints, Donnie Darko, In the Company of Men, all these films are essential, all them them made careers! Take whatever the published "budget" was and cut it by 30% to 50% and that is what they really made the movie for. Now can YOU make a movie with Dafoe in it for that price? Of course you can you just have to do your homework, and that homework starts right here with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An acting gem from Willem Dafoe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The brothers are pretty good in this but they are overshadowed by Dafoe who shines like a brand new penny. At first the viewer thinks he's gonna pull a Gary Oldman on your ass but surprisingly not his character is good in his motives (although certainly not normal). There is a lot of shooting in this film which I enjoyed and it was nothing if not entertaining. There is a trace of humor to be found here and there (mostly supplied by Willem Dafoe) and again his acting is the centerpiece of the film. Some fourth rate guy pretending to be a film critic once called Dafoe a "scenery chewer". Many words come to mind when I think of Dafoe (legend, great actor, multi-millionaire, Jesus) but that phrase doesn't. He is brilliant. Also features a fun cameo by Ron Jeremy as the Mob's Underboss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie Ever of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love movies. I know a lot about movies. I am a woman and in no way find this movie offensive. Too bad it got such a bad break because of some idiots who wanted to kill people in their school around Hitler's birthday. I watch the DVD once a week. This movie has it all, it's funny, suspenseful, original... I could go on and on... there are so many twists and turns, you might need to watch it more than once to understand it. I think the main reason that I love Boondocks is that I can watch it over and over again. It's too bad that it didn't get the recognition that it deserves and that I never knew about it until someone else owned the DVD and made me watch it. Highly recommended for people who have a dark sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly one of the best movies of all time. Troy Duffy is a genius, this has quickly become my favorite movie. Two Irish brothers from Boston purging the city of evil-doers, excellent. I can not wait for the much anticipated sequel: All Saints Day. Troy Duffy created a movie that is sure to one day be a cult classic and there is no way he can go wrong with the sequel. Honestly I have never met a person who said they did not like Boondock Saints. If this keeps up, there is no way that it won't become a classic. If you haven't seen it go buy it, it's worth the $10 you'll pay at Walmart. Best movie of all time. I hope that it will be a favorite for generations to come.</fullReview>

I made a drunken pact with a friend of mine to get the requitas tattoo and intend to make good on it. It would be great to know what to tell people when they ask what it means. I heard somewhere that they meant truth and justice, but that seems to be too cliché. Obviously, he is getting veritas, which is a the better of the two in my opinion, but what are you going to do.

		<fullReview>this movie is great! its action is well founded and serves to further character development as well as just plain be freak'n sweet. the style of crime scene investigation is a very cool pre- CSI way of working through the action sequences. i was not a quick fan of the show. it was recommend to me by some friends but i decided to ignore them and not see the film. however once i borrowed the DVD from my older sister i found that this movie is well worth my time and money. i now have an auto-graphed copy, signed by troy Duffy, as well as the brothers p-coat, rosary, air soft barrettes with silencers and several t-shirts form the site. but this film gives more than just superficial fanaticism it fulfills your thirst for some action and suspense in a true tail of honor and what is right. now i said the film is flawed and by that i mean that there is a slight amateur feel to it at times. the camera movement seems inconsistent. please keep in mind that i gave this movie a 9 and totally suggest you bye it right now but if i had to say something bad it would be the movement. at times its poetic and equal to the epicness of braveheart or LOTR, but then other times it seems uninspired and plan. i feel the film should pick if it will be sweeping and dramatic like bad boys or if it should be more about the story like earlier films of the 50's and 60's. thank you and buy it.</fullReview>

I mean, the idea of the movie is great. Two saints Killin all drug dealers and what not. Sean Patrick Flannery Norman Reedus, and William Defoe did a incredible job in this film, I was NOT disappointed. I don't think there was anything I disliked about the movie. I honestly think I have watched this movie about 15 times, I never get board of it, And for 10 dollars, you can't go wrong. I Liked at how the end They united with there father after being in a shootout with him, and then bust into court room and put three bullets in the back of the Italians head. Lovely. William Daffoe did an incredible job of playing the gay mans part! lol lover-"But I just wanted to cuddle"William- " cuddle?..... What a fag" ! lol And he was sleeping in the bed with him! too funny. I also Liked the fact that his Character knew like everything and could pretty much figure out anything, he is like Gil Grissum , or whatever his name is off csi. It was really interesting at the end how at the end of the movie, they interviewed people off the street, asking what they thought about the saints. Very nice, almost gave it that real effect, awesome job I thought. Awesome MOVIE, No need to rent this one, go buy it right away, cause you wont be disappointed and it never gets boring !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can the love of brothers stop evil?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two brothers(Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) decide to go on a vigilante rampage, killing every evil doer while being tracked down by a homosexual, genius detective(Willem Dafoe).The idea is absolutely original and controls the audience's mind to engross the idea entirely. The writing is clever and witty and goes hand and hand with the rest of the movie. The brilliance is demonstrated from the comedic scenes which leads to blood baths, reminding me strongly of Quentin Tarantino's work.The movie showed four different points of view(The vigilantes, the police, the criminals, and the public) throughout the movie and was the first one I've seen to actually do this with success since Pulp Fiction. The movie did not make you take sides, but it showed you the reactions to every event. As the movie progresses, the audience sees what happens chronologically up to a certain point, then what the detective thought happened after the crime, and back to what actually happened where it left off. It makes the movie very exciting and keeps you entertained throughout the movie because you see the brilliance of the detective and wonder about the saints' fate as the movie moves closer to the climax.Dafoe's performance as Detective Paul Smecker is not only perfectly portrayed but also extremely whimsical. It sets forth a character that most would not expect from the type of action-drama as The Boondock Saints. His character is not only original, it is very obscure and complex. It brings forth questions about not only his personality but also his beliefs and ethics.In Conclusion, the movie is incredible and should be watched by anyone with intentions to be entertained or be enlightened. The movie is mind-blowing.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best movie I've seen so far in my film class. It was one of those where they show a scene, then skip a scene, then show what happened in the middle, over &amp; over again. It was really easy to understand, tho. The only thing I didn't pick up on is the fact that the psycho character was the Irish brother's father, &amp; that's why they went on a killing spree as a family. The realized it when they all said the secret prayer. The weirdness of the movie was all Willem Defoe. He plays the FBI agent. I knew something was amiss when he listened to classical music &amp; did his best Hannibal Lector impression with waving his hands around. A few scenes later he is shown answering the phone in bed, naked from the waist up, with his boyfriend cuddling up next to him. At the end of the movie, he dresses in drag, makes out with a gangster, then shoots him. He makes the world's ugliest woman. Some funny things that happened were: Ron Jeremy's cameo (he dies in a peep show booth), the actor Bob Marley (not the legendary singer, some skinny white guy), &amp; the cat accidentally getting shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It deserves its cult status</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boondock Saints" is one of those movies that - despite its small budget - has made it to the status of cult movie. Many viewers liked this movie and I'm one of them. I'm not going to compare this movie with it, because I believe that every movie has the right to be judged on its own, but in my opinion it had some similarities with "Falling Down" and Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction", two of my all time favorites.When they accidentally kill some Russian mafia members, the two Irish brothers Connor and Murphy McManus are suddenly seen as the 'saints' of their neighborhood in Boston. Inspired by the will of God to get rid of all evil, they decide to go on a mission of their own. They will make the world a better place by killing bad guys. And everybody is convinced that these two man are doing a great job. Even the FBI agent Paul Smecker, who follows their trace of bloodshed, admits that the boys are doing exactly what he secretly always has wished to happen...If you are looking for a very realistic movie, especially when it comes to justice and doing the right thing, then this is definitely not the movie you are looking for. This isn't exactly some kind of court room drama in which the bad guys hear that they will have to spend their lives behind bars for many years to come. No, in this movie violence is the answer to their evil deeds. Personally I didn't have any problem with that, I'm already used to see it in other movies (like for instance the two that I mentioned above), but I guess that not everybody will be this tolerant.Although I don't know any of the actors, except for Willem Dafoe of course, I must say that the acting in this movie is more than OK. I really appreciated all the performances and especially Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the MacManus brothers were interesting to watch. Overall this is a good movie, especially when you consider that this movie was shot with little money and unknown actors. It certainly deserves its cult status and it offers enough fun to make you forget about the fact that this is only a small production. I give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but one of my favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the few I can watch over and over again, sometimes twice in a day if I have time. Part of that, of course, is owed to the extremely attractive actors portraying the MacManus brothers, but if that were the sum of the movie's parts, I would only watch the movie once a month, if that.The storyline is not 100% original, and I will admit that Duffy did seem to just point the camera in the general direction of the actors and hope that they did things right. For the most part he got lucky. Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick Flanery, Billy Connolly, and most especially Willem Dafoe are such talented actors that they are able to interpret their characters and carry their scenes, even if most of the supporting actors aren't quite up to par.Reedus and Flanery are endearing as Murphy and Conner; their scenes together - and they're only once apart - are at once hilarious and adorable. Connolly is granted minimal screen time, with only a few lines, but he manages to pull even that off. The shining star, of course, is Willem Dafoe as Paul Smecker, the conflicted FBI agent hot on the trail of the twins, unsure of whether he should help them out or bring them in. The fragmented scenes in which Smecker describes the crimes are interesting, a little like watching Sherlock Holmes in action.The bad points: 1) David Della Rocco as Rocco (how original), package boy for the Yakavetta branch of the Mafia. Rocco has the MacManus brothers' quick tempers without their intelligence or their style. Smecker describes him as "kind of an idiot," and I have to say that I agree. Della Rocco seems to just take the script and run with it without giving any kind of thought to his character. 2) Doc the bartender (Gerard Parkes) seems to have Turrett's as he randomly shouts curse words, and he disappears fifteen minutes into the movie, never to be seen or heard from again. The storyline about his bar being closed down completely fizzles out. 3) Again, the hit-and-miss directing. Duffy got lucky. Very, very lucky. Actors with just a little less talent would have made mincemeat of this movie. 4) The interviews during the credits. The movie does a commendable job of setting up an ethical dilemma. There was no need to belabor it; that ploy served the double purpose of infantilizing the audience and making the movie take itself too seriously. Yes, Duffy, we heard you. The horse is dead.Still, one of my favorite movies. I offer it 8 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I borrowed The Boondock Saints from a friend after hearing tons of people and even my friend saying it was an amazing movie. So when I got home, I popped the DVD in and started watching until it ended. I thought the movie was a pretty good and the action scenes were kick ass. The music was pretty good and the performances were really well but Willem Dafoe's performance just crept the hell out of me. He was definitely weird but you got to watch the film to know. The movie was pretty good but it wasn't amazing as people said it was and for a film to be slightly below 2 hours, it went way to fast with all the silly little action going on and it kept me away from really falling for the characters. The action was awesome but all the violence hid away most of the storyline for me to really like the movie. As I said before, it was pretty good, but I thought the film was a little overrated actually.Hedeen's Outlook: 6/10 ** C-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Troy Duffy has delivered an amazing experience with his film The Boondock Saints.This story about two Irish brothers who deliver a message from God to their victims...your time is up! These modern day vigilantes use their "calling" as an excuse to murder mobsters, every day criminals, and any other scum that crosses their path.Set in Boston, these two men begin their path to righteousness with the Russian Mob. From there they encounter pimps, scum, and Itialian Mafiosos. The FBI led by William Dafoe, Boston police, and the notorious hit-man known only as "Il Duce" get involved, the two brothers are forced to keep a low profile while making these high profile kills.Their friend Rocco gives them all the information they need to take down the scum of Boston. Rocco is a messenger for the Yakaveta crime family. He believes in what these men are doing and wants to join in on the action. Like normal people, they feel pain, anger, and fear. But what they don't care about are the people in front of the gun that they are aiming at. To them they are just obstacles to ridding the area of crime.With clever writing, an enticing plot, and a movie that just delivers the goods, The Boondock Saints is a great "shoot em' up" movie that goes deeper than any of its kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This amiable cross between DEATH WISH and PULP FICTION follows two working-class, Irish-Catholic brothers living in Boston who take on the mob, both Russian and Italian, and assorted other bad guys until the body count gets too high for the press to ignore and which quickly turns them into Batman-like heroes. Of the two, older brother Sean Flanery makes a lasting impression as a man on a mission. Norman Reedus plays the younger, more hot-headed brother. Low-budget effort has plenty of shooting and killing, often just off-screen, but the body count and the voluminous fake blood are pretty impressive. Not to be taken seriously, of course. This may also remind some of SNATCH. Scottish comic Billy Connolly has a small but pivotal role as an assassin, affectionately known as The Monster, hot on the boys' trail. William Dafoe is an oddball (what else?) FBI agent also hot on their trail. The ending leaves things wide open for a sequel, and in fact a sequel was in the works as of this writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've known "The Boondock Saints" for almost four years now. This movie usually is on our "to do list" of movie underdogs when me and some friends are having a relaxed DVD evening.Now since I've actually read 50 to 60 percent of all the reviews here at IMDb.com, I feel the need for sharing my thoughts on this movie with you.First of all, it's definitely NOT "the best movie I've ever seen" or "the greatest film in history". But it's also not "total crap" or "OMG, I crapped my pants because this flick sucks THAT much"."The Boondock Saints" is a rather enjoyable movie, with some bright moments- as well as some setbacks. But hey, give me ONE single perfect movie. I would not go so far as to compare it to any Tarantino productions. Tarantino's got a unique style nobody can ever dream of achieving. But other directors, e.g. Tim Burton also have unique style, and still people try to imitate theirs.So please, no more "Tarantino rip-off" comments from self- proclaimed "movie fans". If you think that e.g. every bible-reciting or praying gunman is a ripoff of S.L.Jackson's Jules, go and bash "Saving Private Ryan". Jackson (Barry Pepper) is constantly praying when he's sniping German soldiers. BEWARE! Tarantino RIP-OFF! BAAAD MOVIE! *lol* The main issue behind "The Boondock Saints" is basically the transition between good and evil. When does a good man begin to become evil, what does it need for an evil man to become good again? That's the thing. If this movie gets people to think about that, it's worth its salt. And "The Boondock Saints" delivers this message, in a really eye-coaxing way.</fullReview>

If you are looking for a fine piece of artistic cinema then I am afraid you will be disappointed. However, should you be a fan of the shooting/action genre, I believe the movie will well be worth the investment. I thought that several of the lines and scenarios were humorous, the action was decent, but above all it left you questioning your personal beliefs, something that I haven't experienced from many movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A proper "grown-up" movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am getting pretty stalled of late watching "adult" movies rated at 15 (UK), when along comes this well scripted, well written, excellently directed and produced and phenomenally acted fantastically violent adult movie. This to me ranks up there with other movies like True Romance for the quirky script and the "we've known each other forever" interaction between the three Saints. The script is well written with black comedy undertones that give you a chuckle. The cast band it about like its really happening and no acting is going on at all. In fact you get completely lost in it.What starts out as a chance happening turns into a solid action movie that at times had me wondering "is this real". I like the one thing leads to another feel from this movie. Don't get me wrong most of the time you don't see whats coming but on occasion you do but it doesn't spoil the enjoyment, you get the "oh no, they aren't gonna do that" factor and are exhilarated when they do. Willem Dafoe is great in his part - something really different for him. For us girls Conor and Murphy are just to die for - their sense of right and wrong lends to a show of a male feminine side, tied up with all that machismo, has me swooning. This film should get the vote for the ugliest "woman" on film. All I can say is bring on number 2! I cant believe I only just found this film. My regret is that I didn't know about it sooner. If you love violence then this is the one to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not what i expected, but got something just as good. I was expecting a serious, dark, and gritty revenge movie, i got a hilarious, dark, and gritty moral vigilante movie. The performances were good, but Dafoe was great, and he made me laugh more then any other comedy I've ever seen, some of his lines are "what the f%*# are you doing?, i just wanted to cuddle, cuddle? your such a fag" and "it makes we want to riverdance", he then proceeds to riverdance in the middle of a room full of bloody bodies, thats comedy. The others are funny too, like when they shoot all the Russian bosses and their Italian buddy knocks on the door dressed like a servant, and they act like they're going to kill him, the whole movie is filled with intelligent and brutal humor. The action is not all its cracked up to be, all they do is shoot some guys, then shoot some more, its pretty much just there to let us know they shoot bad people. There's some pretty sad scenes, and the whole thing makes you think. I would be one of the people at the end cheering them on, during the credits, all those idiots didn't appreciate what they were doing, OK then lets send all the mafia and criminals to their houses and see what they say then. 7 out of a 10, maybe with some better action, and some more focus on some more story it would be closer to a 9, its entertaining, its fun, its worth seeing, so see it.</fullReview>

I'd have to say that writer and director dared to be different in the sense that they didn't want just an everyday ordinary crime movie. The vigilantes in the film had such "pure motives" that they compelled others to join in and battle evil along side of them.

My local Circuit City had it for $4.99 over Christmas, so I bought all they had (12 of them) and gave them as gifts! I think we should all own this bad boy! :-) Finally, in respect of the saints... "Shepards we shall be, for thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from thy hand, so feet may swiftly carry out thy commands. We will flow a river forth to thee. and teeming with souls shall it ever be. In Nomeni Patri, Et Fili, Et Spiritus Sancti.See the movie....then you'll get it.

		<shortDescription>Angels of Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie surprised me. The angel of revenge theme has been used in several films but this was not like most of them. New ideas and fine story. Very Nice! Somehow "Tarantinoish" way of telling the story.Before I saw this I was doubting the actors of the brothers couldn't look real Irish when they're both Americans but the accents, spirit and feeling were great. They looked really cool. The introduction period to the brothers was quite short and first it took time to get in the story but when it started rolling it was perfect. Dafoe maybe wasn't the best choice for the FBI guy though he did look credible as a bit disturbed man. He's character could have been made a bit deeper. Anyways Magnificent Movie! Waithing for the sequel. Hopefully it will not be a disappointment like normal sequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was so angry when I read the comment from austrailia I made an account and made this comment: This movie is awesome. Willem Dafoe does a great job of going over the top and our "bad guy" killing Irish catholics are just as great. The story is there if watch more than a half hour like the Austrailian dummy who said it sucked hopefully he is dead for making such a dumb-ass comment. Also, the simple fact that I have seen this movie more than once and remain interested is a good indicator of the stellar casting and the excellent story. Note: look for the minor changes as the movie rolls and be observant to the dialogue. Enjoy!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen plenty movies in my day, but this one has sparked my attention. Within the first ten minutes, I was captured. The relationship between Murph and Conner is the kind that every brother wants with his brother. They get a vision from God, and decide to kill all of which is evil. How bad ass is that?! Then, later on in the movie, their Dad had the same vision, and has been killing bad guys too! It's exciting, it's funny, it's entertaining. It would make a great movie for a family get together, or guys night out. Everyone who has any mind at all would appreciate this movie. and so you should go out and see it RIGHT NOW. Don't waste you time or money renting it, just get it over with and buy it right away. I highly recommend this movie, and everyone who opposes it is just a douche. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing: Beautifully Violent Parable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is, in every regard, an unmitigated joy to watch. Practically glowing like some combination of fairy-tale and Bible story the entire film sings like a modern reading of a medieval miracle play. That it overflows with what may, on surface, appear as gratuitous violence only serves to heighten its aspects of religiosity and sense of wonder. That it is deliciously darkly comic ensures that its fun too. As the MacManus brothers, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus each bring a winning "angels with dirty faces" quality at once immediately endearing and disturbing in its zealousness. I could not help myself from rooting for them early on, wondering about what really led them to this mission of destruction and mayhem. Willem Dafoe gives one of his finest performances as Smecker, the brilliant, over-the-top, opera-obsessed, gay FBI agent constantly showing off his criminal knowledge as he belittles the local police trying to solve the story's problematic crimes. The slow motion scene of him "conducting" through a violent maelstrom of bullets as he dreamily revisits a crime scene explains is both breathtakingly beautiful and thigh slappingly hilarious. Some have dismissed this character (and Dafoe's performance) as obvious, when it is in all actuality, nothing less than remarkable: a complete tour-de-force by one of the best actors of this ages. Mixing hyperbole both criminal and religious with its unique brand of literalism, The Boondock Saints seems to confound and confuse as many as it delights. Obviously this is not a film for everyone, but those who look past its pseudo tough veneer and embrace its gentle core violence and vision will be richly rewarded. Hallelujah. Amen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watched this movie years ago, absolutely loved it and rented it many times since. Righteous vengeful god sending out hit men to deal with evil doers and speak with hot Irish accents, what more could you want?The timeline is fractured, jumping forward to a point beyond major events and then going back over them with FBI agent Smecker (played vaguely creepily by Willem DaFoe); which makes for interesting viewing as you sit wondering how the outcome of each event came about.The actors do a fairly decent job, there aren't any of the stilted moments you often get with smaller budget films and the dialogue is engaging and amusing.This movie is completely rewatchable, and since it's recently been released on DVD here I really need to buy. Its totally worth the rental, even if only for the scene with the firearm mishap.</fullReview>

Seeing that I am Irish, it was fun to see a little of my heritage thrown in. I don't think they could have cast a better caste. The scene with Willem Dafoe...well let's just say, things that make you go, bhhh... I was impressed with the performance of Sean Patrick Flannery.

		<fullReview>I've seen a lot worse than this for a first-timer. It's stylish with tongue-in-cheek &amp; self-deprecating humor that goes WHOOSH right by movie snobs (c'mon; Ron Jeremy as a Mafia Underboss?). If its attempts at being a morality tale seem pretentious and simplistic to some, it's because all of the Shiny Happy People (sorry, Mike) overcomplicate what should be a fairly simple matter for human society to deal with: if we can discount the bourgeois sentiment that every life is precious and valuable, we realize that SOME PEOPLE DESERVE TO DIE!Boondock Saints asks simply, "Who Will Be My Brother's Keeper?" Who will stand up and be counted? It also answers the same question by showing the arrogance of the morally righteous in their quest to dispense justice and "cleanse their city" of the morally repugnant and unacceptable.Sure, there are a lot better movies than Boondock Saints.There are also even more "worse" movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Boondock Saints" must be one of the greatest movies I have seen in years. The organization of the movie (with setup/result/flashback) is fabulous and effective..keeping viewers in stitches about how the scene played out. Well written and beautifully acted (by beautiful actors..still single Sean Patrick Flanery??) this movie makes my all time top five. It was different to see Dafoe in the role he played but he pulls it off....fantastic job! The movie was perfectly casted. The on screen chemistry between the actors made a good, well written movie into a great one. I've recommended this movie to everyone I know..and thanks to IMDb..everyone I don't. :)I'm excited there will be a sequel! Can't wait!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engrossing vigilante movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints has a nice refreshing story with some real excellent acting even though at times Willem Dafoe at times goes too much over the top and the direction was quite clever. It's all about these two Irish guys who work in a meat packing factory who get sick and tired of the Russian mafia bullying the people in the Irish neighbourhood they live in so what starts out as a bar fight ends up with them killing two of the Russian mafia guys even though they were kind of pressured into it. So they decide to become vigilante's and kill evil doers and rope in the help of one of their crazed Italian American friends. Also in this is the gay FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe who is in charge of the investigation. He is really smart and is quite good (but not perfect) at deducing what had happened at each crime scene. He ends up having a moral dilemma though which ended up being good for the story. The Italian mafia end up hiring an insane bounty hunter played by Billy Connolly to track down and kill the Irish lads. It has a nice little twist near the end and is thoroughly entertaining. If you liked Snatch and Lock Stock then you should like this. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Several years ago this movie was released in the US and failed miserably at the box office.&gt;&gt;&gt;My question?&lt;&lt;&lt; Why did it not make a dime? Its a movie that combines good action, humor, and acting and the amazing part...it was helmed by a first timer. Troy Duffy created this sometimes sombre but funny tale about two brothers with a calling to step up and kill criminals. But thats not it, the police and the mob are after them and aided by their friend Rocco they set out to clean the streets of Boston Boondock style. The magic of Duffy's script is amazing and the characters is truly human. The characters. The gay Fbi agent who was acted brilliantly The two religious brothers being hard smokers drinkersThe dumb cop who has almost everything by the balls andThe crazy friend who has a big mouth but good heart All and all with the characters and all this is a A grade movie.&lt;&lt;&lt;the answer to my Question&gt;&gt;&gt; This film did not make a dime, simply because Hollywood is fake and without any taste. And we are left with 2nd 5th and 7th best with other crap in the cinema complexes while movies such as these are merely released on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is an amazing movie. Troy Duffy does an incredibly good job in his directorial debut. From the very beginning he knows where he wants to go and goes there. Many of the action sequences are done in flashback and some are done in black and white. Many are done in slow motion as well. The music is also original and complements the film.The religious vigilante twist is very unique and is pulled off extremely well by Sean Patrick Flannery. If you've ever met an Irish Catholic from Boston you would know this is a great performance.Willem Dafoe gives a great acting performance as well, too bad he probably won't be in the sequel.</fullReview>

The film has a GREAT amount of laughs to give out, and plenty of little jokes you may catch after you watch it a few times. There is also a strong sense of brotherhood, between the two main characters. I personally began to cry as I watched one part of the movie that displayed such love, selflessness, and character. The movie is also jam packed with action... I never found myself bored with it at all. Even though the characters are not built from the ground up, I found it quite easy to feel their emotions, and the acting was good. I'd have to say I really enjoyed it due to all of the different languages and cultures incorporated. All in all, I felt the Boondock Saints was a classic!

		<fullReview>i watched this tonight with one of my good friends that had just discovered this kick ass movie. i would consider myself a movie-buff and i recommend this film to anyone who isn't bothered by language. there is a whole lot of it but they're Irish so it's expected. It wouldn't be realistic without it.The plot is much like the typecast thrill/adventure film, but the theme of a mob/violent/shoot-em-up film. At the end you feel kind of strange because it is such a different kind of movie but you feel all good inside and protected. It leaves you wanting to do good and act in a moral manner. Note to parents- tell your kids that they shouldn't kill people. This is an incredible film and will be a classic. Go rent it, or buy it, you will want to watch it again, RIGHT NOW!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a near perfect example of how to make a smart action movie without spending hundreds of millions of dollars. What many movies are missing these days is originality. While the story itself is nothing new, the way the story is told (especially the cinematography) certainly is. This film is full of action, comedy, and solid acting. The only mark against Boondock Saints is that Willam Defoe is a bit cheesy at times, but it is not often enough to really take away from the overall realism of the dialog. Many compare and contrast this movie with Pulp Fiction. One thing the two certainly have in common is that they make characters who are unimaginable in real life seem completely natural and real. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should do themselves a favor and buy it. It will be the best $10 you have ever spent.</fullReview>

I dont know how many times I have seen it, and I never seem to get tired of is.(Some of you guys know what i mean)Its that kind of movie you can see over and over again.Now i will try to explain the plot or so to speaks, which is a really hard thing to do,because I dont whant to give to much away for you pore people who havent see it...yet.I will explain in the easiest way I can.Its really about two irish borhters MacManus,and the "belivie" that they are on a mission from GOD to clear the land of all scums.That`s the plot more or less but the movie it self is much much more, more then is can but in words for you to understand if you havent seen it. Sean Patrick Flanery plays Connor MacManus and Norman Reedus Murphy MacManus.They both give and very even and reallt Good preformance.William Dafoe is really good as Angent Paul Smecker,the gay detective.The impression I got from seeing the movie is,that Connor is the older of the two brother,if my instincts are correct.He is more calm and "wiser" for a lack of a better word.Murpy is more impulsive, and whats resutls quicker.I give this movie ***** out of *****.Anyone should be happy to se this movie,so check it out.(Sorry for my English,not the best i know but i am working on is.I hope you understand what I mean)</fullReview>

He was incredible and anyone who says otherwise is crazy. This is a movie that can be seen over and over again. The subject matter is original and the characters are well developed. No matter who the character is you have a well-made connection with them. Whoever tried to compare this with Pulp Fiction is just an idiot. They are two very different movies and both are great in their own regaurds. I love Boondock Saints and I give the director kudos for his cast choice. Reedus and Flanery are wonderful and Connelly is the greatest choice for the father. This is a cult classic cause it has substance. And I must admit my favorite scene is at the poker game where Dafoe and Della Rocco are going through the same movements. Wonderful!!!</fullReview>

The dialog is smart, rude and downright hilarious (POSSIBLE SPOILER***** Rocco asking if the cat's dead could quite possibly be the funniest line in a movie, ever). I hate violence in a movie, yet the violence in this movie seemed oh so in context. Sometimes a sentence calls for the 'F' word and sometimes a movie just calls for graphic, over the top violence.If you've already seen this movie, see it again. If you haven't already seen this movie, see it and if you don't like it, see it over and over until you do. A massive 10/10.p.s.

		<shortDescription>Bad Mouth Film Hits The Score Ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, `The Boondock Saints' isn't the ideal film for sensible people, because the language and violence content of the film, is way out of hand, it even looks as if the director didn't know how to control it. So one piece of advice, only people with nerves of steel can see this one. `The Boondock Saints', a film by Troy Duffy, tells the story of two young men, who, convinced that they were ordered by a higher being, decide to do justice by their own hands. It shows how a cop ends up by doing something against his ideals.SpoilersThe story begins as Connor MacManus (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus), two Scottish lads, are attacked by a group of the Russian mafia. They beat them up, but, as all normal mafia groups do, decide to return the message. In the fight, they end up killing the Russian guys, and, consequently, are considered heroes by the press, as, according to the facts, killed them in self?defense. The problem is, that these guys, are very fanatic in terms of religion, so, when in one night they receive some kind of message by a higher being, saying that they must kill all evil people, they embark on a violent journey, doing justice by their own hands, helped by a washed up robber Roc "Funny Man" (David Della Rocco), who is only in the business for, mainly money and personal revenge. The detective in charge is FBI Agent Smecker (Willem Dafoe), who, trough the entire story, tries to know who are the faces behind the crimes, and also tries to know what's their cause. When he discovers their true cause, he does something that he never thought about doing.End of SpoilersTroy Duffy has made a film full of bad mouth and curses mixed up with a lot of heavy and bloody violence. A particular technique I liked very much on Duffy's direction, was putting the process of investigation before witnessing the crimes, making the viewer `investigate' alongside Dafoe, equally ignoring what really had happened. The acting in this film is pretty good, I was surprised by the performance of Sean Patrick Flanery (as I didn't liked him very much his in `Suicide Kings`). His teammate, Norman Reedus, had a steady performance, the same goes to Willem Dafoe's interpretation of the gay detective, but the one who impressed and surprised me the most was David Della Rocco. He made me laugh and open my mouth of admiration, I wasn't expecting his performance to be so good. Best of the lot, in my opinion. The plot is very straight-forward, simple, good for the average viewer. Not very complex.Concluding, `The Boondock Saints' is a good action flick, with bits of comedy along the way and very strong language and violence. I heard there's going to be a sequel called `The Boondock Saints: All Saints Day', I just hope it's as good as its predecessor. God bless Portugal!PsIKiLL's Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>from some standpoints, the boondock saints sounds pretty predictable, but it really isn't. it's very, very well done. too profane, some might say, but remember it takes place in south boston, and they are supposed to be irish. the excessive cursing only adds to the character's authenticity, anybody that cannot see past a few occurences of the f word isn't a very good critic of film. the point of it was not for shock value! i'll admit that the movie was not perfect, and i really don't advise everyone to see it. if you're not smart and have a short attention span, all you're going to pay attention to are measurable things like violence and profanity that get your attention. if its a little confusing, watch it twice and it will all come together. if you want an original, well done movie that might actually require a little thought and comprehension on the viewer's end, then the boondock saints is for you.</fullReview>

As well his very direct message about the legal system and the ethics of the masses today is a large step in bringing out a useful commentary of our society. Sean Patrick Flannery delivers a flawless performance, drawing you into the life of he and his brother, Norman Reedus. David Della Rocco adds a relief to the strong and serious nature of the film with his antics and surprises, he gives a truely high energy performance that will let you know that the part was truely written for him.</fullReview>

People are talking here like "this movie is not real", "these guys are f****** heroes, they make me sick"... maybe it's good. Anyway, I see this movie like "wake up movie". We're living in the very corrupted and very criminal world... but also in very religious world. MacManus brothers are regular guys to me. Well, they was till the night in the police station, where they got the "vision from God". After that, they was not regular anymore, they was like saints, fingers of God if you like. They didn't want to do this, they even didn't knew, how to do this. In the beginning of the movie, father Macklepenny said: "...Now, we must all fear evil men. But there is another kind of evil, which we must fear most, and that is the indifference of good men!". Well brothers cared and they did something but not before this "vision of God". They get "permission of God" if you like. No, it's not good to kill humans (is it good to kill animals, just because they're more primitive?". Anyway, I can't take them like regular people also, they had a vision and will to do something. All the other people (like us), are just watching. "Murphy MacManus: Do not kill, do not rape, to not steal. These are principles, which every man of every faith can embrace.", but can WE? And we will send you to whatever god you wish...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great movie and here's why</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of THE BEST movies i have ever seen in my life. i dont know how you cannot LOVE this movie. yes it does have alot of killing and yes alot of unrealism but this movies teaches you to be a good person and not to be a "bad" person. this movie is centered around the cores of behavior and how we should all act to our fellow man. as in the movie they seek the corrupt, not the poor, hungry, or sick. The Mc Manus brothers state why they are going around killing all evil men. an example is pimps, drug dealers, and mafiosos killing, getting caught with drugs and other unlawful things that aren't right to be doing yet they can get out on bail same F***ing day. they are doing what everyone's thinking. someone should just go out and kill those mother F***ers right? so i dont know how this movie can be bad. it has great music, great acting, a great plot, and who else can execute a man ripping a toilet seat out of the ground, throwing it off a roof, hitting the mobster thats about to kill his brother with the entire toilet, and jump off a four story building to land on the other mobster and make you want to watch this nearly impossible scene over and over. they execute every single scene in this wonderful movie perfectly. Bottom Line: if u dont love this movie, YOU ARE F***ING CRAZY!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I, and every one I know who has seen this movie, absolutely LOVED it. The premise is awesome, two regular guys who get pushed two far, then their beliefs and upbringing combine to have them take an iron stand against the corrupt and Evils in the world. the line by the old priest at the start sums up up their gripe with society "the indifference of good men". Dear god, i hate armchair critics like the ones who blast this movie, If you don't like this film, you are missing the point entirely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The man from Delmonte, He say 'Yes!'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to begin by pointing out that I am not some acne riddled teenager. After perusing the mass of reviews I found myself wondering 'Is there two versions of this film?' More realistically, I fear the film being judged on the questions of morality it poses to the viewer? Are you a person that believes in tough justice or are you one of those people that let their children do what ever they want because it 'helps their creativity' type cretins? I advocate the 'spank the little sod and send them to bed' approach myself but that's for another forum. If you are not of this ilk and you can't set aside your view point then you are not going to like this film.Firstly, the plot for the Saint's is both clever and provoking. The 'anti-heroes' bungle their way through each encounter with a combination of luck and coincidence, or is it? Perhaps there is some divine intervention at hand here after all. This is something as a viewer you will need to decide.Secondly, I have seen from the other posts that there has been some rather savage criticism of the acting and characters, complete nonsense. To my mind Special Agent Smeker is one of William Dafoe's greatest acting achievements. The character is complicated and Dafoe manages to portray Smecker's intelligence and isolation with an Oscar worthy performance. Add to this the complicated social life of Smecker and the clever way it is portrayed without the need for acting like a lisping, limp wristed jesse and it is plain to see why Dafoe is rated as such a high calibre actor. I can see why Rocco has been described as annoying but surely that is the idea of the character? Just look to the way his peers treat him to see that he is despised and seen as weak and idiotic. The man has spent 18 years in the mob and he still gets the boss's lunch. Therefore, every criticism that calls Rocco 'over the top or 'Irritating' is an accolade to David Della Rocco's acting skills. Without going into further detail it is sufficient to say that all other performances rate highly in my estimation.Finally with regards to the film be littered with expletives and gratuitous violence I can only question what films you have seen prior to The Saints? Was it Bambi or perhaps Legally Blonde 2? If you look at those scenes labelled as violent you will see that they are actually very tame in comparison to films of a similar genre. The brilliance of Troy Duffy's direction is most apparent in the way he delivers hard hitting scenes like the attack by Rocco in the dinner with a minimal use of blood and gore. Admittedly the overall effect is pretty harsh but when you compare it to Hannibal making someone eat there own brain it really is not that bad. As for the swearing, I suggest you do not listen in to the vast majority of conversations I have on a daily basis with me colleagues. We truly do make the Saints sound like the Angels they just might be.The Haunted made me do it!</fullReview>

Its a fun movie to watch when you're bored. Its got alot of funny moments and some cool action. I read all of these comments and seeing people accuse it of being crap are quite wrong. I think it deserves all the hype it gets. I've watched it many times and have yet to find a friend who didn't like it. If you've got a night where you're bored and aren't looking for like the most intelligent movie but don't want a crappy action movie. Give this a try.

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. It has a great plot, and awesome action. No one ever said movies had to be believable, and this movie definately isn't, but the characters are intriguing, as are their motives. Willem Dafoe stood out as the tortured, homosexual FBI agent, whose duty is to find two brothers who are causing chaos, but at the same time feels like what they are going is "correct". The MacManus brothers are also fun, and though their Irish accents are a bit inconsistent, they make up for it in their perfection for the role. Fun cast, great script, I give it two thumbs up.

		<shortDescription>I'd Say Thought-Provoking To Some Extent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the quite stupid unrealistic image that: yes again a couple of passionate, street smart, multi-talented, religious, super hero saints will save and bring happiness and joy to a community, The Boondock Saints is an enjoyable flick to watch. Although it was quite disturbing to see fellow students at school (I'd like to call em rage against the machine listening, f*** the system renegade-wannabe retards) take this movie seriously and yak away on how we need such characters in real life to "put an end to this messed-up corporate and corrupt world we live in " (Then continue to spend mom and dad's system-made money) this movie had me thinking for a while. Not that I actually for a second imagined that such bologna will happen in our boring reality lives, but the thought that if such a thing really happened, people would actually be cheering for these guys blew my mind. That's what had me messed-up for a while.Yes, Yes, Yes... Hero-worship. We can't seem to get enough of it can we? What is this obsession we have and have had for the longest time? As if there's only 13 people involved in crime and three caring rebels will bring an end to it and make all of us happy forever. It's that simple. We wouldn't have any problems if there weren't any mobsters in the streets. They're the bad guys. We're the good ones who go to church and make babies and buy houses and mini-vans and have family barbeques with kids running around, laughing and dancing. So nice, so beautiful.Call me a cynic, but I'll just call you plane old STUPID. From Greek mythology, to Jesus and Islamic mumbo jumbo, then batman, Spiderman and what have you, one indication I tell ya : we are morons. Hero-worshipers.. If there is a god he's probably laughing his head off up there. Or maybe her head off. OOOOOOH???!!! Oh please.. Three guys are gonna save us all. I mean people are making some good money off this ****. Jesus, Batman 1,2,3,4,5 - Spiderman, dare devil.. The list goes on forever baby. We are so helplessly retarded.When are they gonna make a movie that tells people to stop being so... Where's my thesaurus? Somebody make a movie where there's three passionate guys who kill people who don't use contraception and condoms, religious retards and Jehovah witnesses, britney spears and the backstreet boys, old people, fake people.... That'll be my super-hero movie. And then there'll be beautiful scenes of people not killing, actually eating, a good ozone layer, animals alive, people dancing, no fake people.. That movie I will not criticize. I'll get on my knees and say thank you... thank you thank you thank you...okay enoughAs for the movie I say I enjoyed it at parts. A couple of laughs, some good acting. Messed up on some scenes. Especially when that funny-man dude died. nooooooo, mother-F***ers, noooooo, passion, heat, love, Bad acting, bad acting, specially from the two brother characters. Brother Willem Dafoe had some good stuff going on there and the humour I enjoyed. Pretty good, disturbing and twisted end that gave me a good one.Overall, I say watch it. It's worth watching and might get your brain working. If you ever used it of course. You are aware of that organ? correct? Or you might like some friends, just close the head and go.. "f'ing yeah man, these guys they kill these gangsters, and dude you gotta see this man..it's so good." which I do think is still necessary cause without I wouldn't have anything to criticize and make fun of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints is a very enjoyable movie. The acting of most of the lead characters was done very well, and the action sequences were done very good as well. I like the scene when William Dafoe character explains one of the crime scenes and while he was explaining it, the actual crime scene happened at the same time (I hope that made sense). This movie is very funny, and nearly every scene has a little bit of humor.I only had one slight problem with the movie: The Actor who played Rocco seemed to be pretty annoying at time, and it seems he over acts in some of the scenes.This movie is very fun, and it is very unique. Should it be compared to Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction? No, because this movie seems to be more lightheaded, but I'm not saying its a bad movie at all. I love this movie, and I think fans of the action genre must watch this movie. </fullReview>

I personally loved this film and ranked it in my top three of all time. The vigilante story just draws you in especially on second viewing, the characters I found to be easily relatable which left me with a warm feeling inside. These two Irish guys from southie (one of the roughest neighborhoods in America) accidentally get caught up in a small turf dispute between their local bar by the name of Miginti's and the Russian mob. Throughout the course of the movie these two brothers who acted incredibly well despite it was the very first time for one of them portrayed what happens when the little guy is forced to deal with evil men one too many times.

The reality of it is beleivable because i have a twin and we have a union some what like them just not as strong. In that aspect and others it is one of the best films i have seen. Also whats very unique about this film is the relegous aspect. The twins are very relegous and they go through great struggles throughout the movie but keep an upbeat attitude on life because of there relegin. And whoever thinks this movies sucks, Man take a look again cause if you'd sit down and watch this movie you'd know its one of the better movies that one's seen. I also like it alot cause it doesn't involve the devil. Most people would agree to this to cause we need to do something about the world cause every day it changes and we need to forget about the notion that our emotions are at bay cause there not and we need to take care of it.

		<fullReview>I'm amazed by just how negative some of these negative reviews are. I thought this was a BRILLIANT film. I find it interesting that people keep saying that this was an attempt at a Tarantino-like movie too. I thought this film was QUITE unique.

Pretty ironic that the film ends (not really a spoiler - don't give away any surprises here) w/ people who seem to be doing a review of their own (w/VERY similar results as well). Count me among the fans, I'm not ashamed to say. I LOVED this movie. (By the way: as for the person who said the accents were horrible... know a group of people from Ireland who love this film too.

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing for several reasons, the least of which is that Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery are gorgeous (and who doesn't love an Irish accent?). I think the best part about this movie is the religious symbolism. I don't know if I have ever seen a movie so based around the extent to which faith and religion can rule our lives. Also, along with being completely original (and very funny), the way the story unfolds is really interesting as well. There are a few scenes where it shows what actually happened vs. what the police believe happened, and it's really cool to be able to compare them. All in all, I would have to say that this movie is phenomenal, and definitely one of my all time favorites. If you are interested in religion and/or you like to view things from various perspectives, this movie is definitely for you!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone looking for a quality film (outside of the mainstream perspective) that is truly well done, this movie could not be a better pick. The plot reaches a perfect equilibrium which will leave no one scratching their heads, yet keeps the viewer wide-eyed throughout the entire film. The actors do a magnificent job (and yes, that included Willam Dafoe), and the Boston setting adds a distinct Irish feel to the movie. It may, however, seem a little rash to some. Anyone with touchy feelings toward killing should certainly not see this movie. But everyone else, this is an extraordinary film that you can't miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, something for the other reviewers.How can anyone balk at a movie for being "unrealistic". It's a movie. A story. Unless it's a documentary or a film on a historical person or event, there has to be a certian amount of leeway as to where the movie goes.Also, it would be better for everyone if people who do not like blood and violence and the "F" word to NOT watch movies that are OBVIOUSLY going to be filled with them. Why go into something knowing you're going to hate it?Onto the movie. The Boondock Saints is the story of two Irish brothers who take on the calling of eliminating the murders and mobsters from the streets of Boston. Despite there deep religious affiliation, the brothers take the role of modern day Angels of Death, dispensing the evil and sparing the innocent.No movie is perfect, and while the Boondock Saints is an awe inspiring film, some of the acting is over-the-top, and there are some plot holes, but overall the movie was simply amazing.Do yourself a favor. Watch it. Make up your own mind. I'm sure you'll be blown away.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absolutley brilliant! I read the message boards of IMDB and I am shocked at the people who say that the movie is "unrealistic" and "silly". I wonder if they forgot that it's a movie! Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus were excellent. Their accents were great! Norman's did need a little work, but Mr. Flanery's Irish accent was very believable! I was amazed when I learned that he was from Texas. Willem Dafoe reeked of awesomeness! I think that his character being gay was a good touch, because not only did it create more tension between him and the Boston detectives, but it didn't portray him as a stereotypical, limp wristed fairy. The dialogue was great. The F-word, in my opinion, was not over used. That is the way that people talk. Not everyone curses that much, but I know lots of people who do. As far as Troy Duffy goes, he is just, for lack of a better word, awesome! With his weak salary he pulled off a magnificent film. This is NOT a Tarantino/Guy Ritchie rip-off. Frankly, if my name were used in the same sentence as Tarantino's, I would be flattered. But it's an insult to compare Duffy to the likes of John Woo. The movie was, again, excellent! I can not wait for the sequel to come out! I will be in line the second they start selling tickets!Aequitas Veritas!</fullReview>

The acting was superb, and the movie skillfully straddled the fine line between absurd comedy and Godfather-esque vengeance.The gratuitous violence (along with the heavy-handed religious references) may turn some people off. Basically, the movie isn't for everyone. But for anyone who enjoys the Godfather, Monty Python--or an odd combination of the two--Boondock Saints is a sure bet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So my friend has had quotes from this movie in his profile for as long as I can remember, has always talked about it, and has told me to see it. I went to visit him recently and we sat down for a night of movies and mayhem. So of course we watched this movie. And all I can really say to summarize how I feel about this movie is 'wow'. And I've also noticed that you either love the movie with a passion or you despise it and (as we've seen on this board) feel it's not worth the budget that was given. Such is the way with cult movies. The acting was wonderful, the script was stimulating and there are so many quote-able lines and paragraphs that I could fill up pages and pages with them. And hey, the deleted scenes just make the movie SO much better. Are there copious amounts of violence? Yup. Do they drop the f-bomb more times in one scene than in any other action flick you've ever seen? Yeah. But that really only adds to the mood of the film. Is this movie a prepubescent/teenage boy's violent dream come true? Yeah, but I'm a girl and I loved it to and I swear I'm not insane, so there you go. The movie isn't about the violence, it's about the plot line; about pushing limits, about making people think; is what the MacManus brothers are doing the right thing? And the interviews with 'people' during the credits just drive the point home. The actors are great. The Irish accents are nearly spot on in most of the movie (and for those of you who say they aren't, I'd really like to know how many Irish people you know because the ones I know sound pretty similar to the accents displayed here!) I enjoyed Willem's character in this movie so much more than in Spiderman. His character had depth. His character, as well as most of the other situations in the movie, is ridden with cliches that were necessary to lighten up the 'shoot shoot shoot kill kill blood' theme that you really can't deny is there. I got a kick out of them anyway. To stop my babbling before it's too late, I will end by saying this much: Although a violent movie, the plot and scripting definitely carries this movie to the top of my cult films list, even to the top of my 'best movie ever' list. So it gets a 10/10 in every aspect. And I can't wait till All Saints Day comes out - I'll be the first to see it in this town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEST MOVIE EVER!!! MUST SEE DVD DELETED SCENE ON PHONE WITH MOM- a life long question with a hysterical answer!!! Willem Defoe's superb performance grants him the unique ability to deliver controversial lines no one else could ever get away with. One of several roles played devilishly cool by Norman Reedus (Deuces Wild, Blade 2). Tousled hair, dreamy eyes, body of Adonis beneath that sexy outfit- Sean Patrick Flanery, you are too hot for words. BEWARE WHO YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE WITH, IT MAY GIVE THEM IDEAS. CANT WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL.</fullReview>

I watched the movie at my boyfriend's house for the first time last weekend, and I absolutely LOVED it.. the way it was filmed is excellent along wtih the shooting sequences, the soundtrack and the acting, my god,the acting was incredible. I think the NC-17 version is a lot better than the R version but both are equally commendable. I give this a 10 out of 10 for becoming my new favorite movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is a great movie that makes an amazing B movie. While being a straight-to-video, b budget movie, The Boondock Saints doesn't show it. The script and directing is slick, funny and fast-paced. The acting is top-notch and Willem Dafoe is amazing as usual. Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus, David Della Rocco and Billy Connolly all give first rate performances. With a great script and an equally great director I can't see why a major company didn't pick this movie up, but that's no problem. The action scenes are slick and well-produced, and the soundtrack is also very good. All in all The Boondock Saints is probably the best straight-to-video movie i've ever watched with great visuals, lots of humor and an awesome cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this movie (friends, online, people's AIM profiles quoting it), but had never rented it or anything. It didn't seem my type.Then, one day, I go to a friends house to watch it and I am BLOWN AWAY by this masterpiece. Masterpiece - I only use that word sparingly (Pulp Fiction, Braveheart, American Beauty...). This movie deserves it. I immediately bought the movie (for $9.99 at Best Buy) and watched it again the next day.The plot is simple - two brothers, Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery, go on a killing spree with their friend, David DellaRocco. They vow to take out all the scum in their city (I believe a suburb of Boston or thereabouts, I could be wrong, haven't seen it since I bought it in August 2003). Willem Dafoe plays the homosexual, opera-loving, certifiably-insane, God-loving detective who is trying to track the case.The movie is intense. The "confessional booth" scene is amazing. When Dafoe "enters" the crime scene, I got chills. The action-sequences are fantastic (don't listen to those who hate the movie, they have nothing better to do). The dialogue isn't brilliant, but it's not fake-brilliance like some movies who want nothing more than to be Tarantino.The ending of the movie is amazing. One of the 5 best endings I've ever seen in a movie (you liked the ending of The Usual Suspects? that had nothing on Boondock Saints). BUT the very last scene is of a reporter interviewing people to see what they think of "vigilante killings" and it had nothing to do with the movie and it was horrible. I pretend the movie ends in the courtroom scene.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vengeance is mine saith the Lord, or so I thought. Apparently fraternal twin brothers, Connor and Murphy, missed that one during their pious Catholic upbringing. The weirdest thing about this film is that it makes sense on the one hand and totally blows the `turn the other cheek', `forgive your enemies', and `do unto others as you would have them do unto you' adages all to hell, literally. The brothers are Irish South Boston butchers, living in squalor, but happy to be together in America. By a simple twist of fate and a furious amount of luck, they become enmeshed in a manhunt for killers who take out only `the bad element' of Boston. It's not exactly Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men, it's more like `we saw these cheesy movies with Charles Bronson and it looked like we could do that, too'. If you don't like violence, references to male body parts, are homophobic, swearing, or sick humor, you probably won't like Boondock Saints. But, if you like fast action, intelligent dialogue, ironic humor, and want to see Willem DaFoe in drag, here's the picture for you. There are so many great one liners in this film, it's virtually impossible to pick the best. My recommendation is to buy or rent this film and watch it on an empty stomach with plenty of beer and Irish whiskey and several of your best buds. Amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film about 4 years ago, right after it came directly to video, and since then I've made everyone I know watch it. Now it's everywhere, on sale in Target and Best Buy instead of buried at Blockbuster. I love Tarantino, but that doesn't mean I can't also love this film, which is funny, gory, and features great performances by Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flannery and a host of supporting actors. True, Tarantino makes funny violent films, but why does he get control of the market? Troy Duffy, who both wrote and directed, is an inspiration to all those aspiring film-makers who don't think they'll ever get their chance. While not perfect due to a tiny budget and short shooting schedule, the film delivers a great story, tempering violence with humor, and leaves one with a moral dilemma: is vigilantism good or bad? And if all that doesn't convince you to see it tune in just to watch Ron Jeremy, porn star extraordinaire, keep his clothes on as a mafia capo. Oh, and watch out for the sequel, due in the next year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film on sky and loved it immediately, the way it was acted, the script and action sequences brilliant, and filmed in a different chronological order that i do not believe was ripped off from other films. I thought it was ingenious how you would get the climax to and action sequence and then cut straight to after the event, and how it was revealed only through Willem Dafoe. I also thought this film was hilarious as well as intense, the way Dafoe plays against his stereotype as being gay is pure class. I know there are people who don't like this film, but to them i either say open your mind, or go back to your Van Damme. Don't get me wrong, i like the occasional lets go kill some people shwarznegger type films, but it's films like these that really grab me. I feel that the contrasting of the two different views at the end was a great way to end it. I rate this film right up there with American History X and Shawshank Redemption. To finish off, i am a film student, but i loved this film even before i became one. Unfortunately, none of my friends have ever heard of this film, so i am gradually forcing them to watch it, and most of them like it as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked movies like Dark City, Stigmata, or The Crow, then Boondock Saints is for you. While most reviewers are unable to see past the violence in the movie to the deeper sentiments, this movie is MORE than worth taking the time to see. The tale of a three men (two brothers and their father) who set out to rid Boston of the mafiosos and other scum that thrive there at the "will of God," Boondock is a film that brings religion into a light few people are willing to consider it in. Ignore the negative reviews here, and SEE the movie. It'll be well worth the time.Great dialogue, prime acting, and a storyline that'll capture and HOLD your attention!</fullReview>

I just saw one of the best movies of all time. Where the hell did this movie come from! Out of the blue comes this great film about two irish brother who decide to kill the wicked! How great is that? The acting is great. Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery's chemistry is fantastic as the two "saints" of Boston. William is also great as the "gay" detective agent who doesn't like gays(just great). Billy Connely plays the perfect role as Il Duce, the jailed madman who's released from prison to take out the saints. Oh yeah, and special applause goes to David Della Rocco. Funny-ass guy! I'm surprised him and the saints aren't in more movies because these actors are just great. I can't wait for Boondock II!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is a very provocative film, that raises questions of good and evil. The movie is filled with exciting killings that have a comic twist to them. Willem Dafoe is excellent and struggules with the twists and turns of the killing scheme. The camera angles used in the Boondock Saints, add to the overall production of the film by acurately capturing even the most miniscule details that later become important.The screenplay and language is abnormally good considering the most commonly used work is f*^k. However, it is not overly used, or used at inappropriate times.I would recommend Boondock Saints to anyone who enjoys exciting killings and Violence. It has the whole police chase aspect but is not the sole plot of the film.I applaude Mr. Troy Duffy on an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints isn't really a wannabe Tarantino film like some people say. There are some similarities between Tarantino's films and this movie. Clever dialogue, lots of gunplay, and a tale of people outside the law. Willem Dafoe does stellar work in this film. The part when he makes out with the mob heavy is above and beyond the call of duty. A gay FBI agent is not a character that you see often. Personally I think that the brothers could have been played with more menace and less of an Irish good old boy style. The film lays on the avenging angel thing a little thick. The style of the film wears a little thin after repeated viewings, but it's a pleasant experience to see a quality B-movie like this. Billy Connolly is great as the ultimate assassin by the way. Bottom Line: This movie is better than it deserves to be, you should check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't listen to what others say...this movie was fantastic. Coming from a woman who watches at least 1 movie a day, and one of few who can claim true passion for cinema...this movie is comparable to the style and themes of a Tarantino film. The ultimate plot of the movie was fantastically artistic and elegant. The characters danced in a tango with the plot, supporting characters, and the cinematic allusions. The 2 brothers brought forth realism and naturalism, and an intellectual sense of humor that makes you think before you laugh. Not like the fart, fat, and reality jokes the American public seems to think is so brilliantly funny these days. While some parts may be predictable, there are few movies that aren't so. Even Quintin movies have predictable themes and moments...Overall this brought a fresh sense to violence in the media, and is a strong force in society's interpretation of too much violence is producing too much negativity. I love the inclusion of religious beliefs and violent methods to bring forth the realism of today's world, and also symbolize how "sinners" were dealt with according to the old testament....death.In a nutshell...best film I have seen since Reservoir Dogs...Any true cinema lover can't disagree...well, they could, but they'd be wrong.</fullReview>

I absolutely loved the way that it was filmed: the style is wonderful. I adore the cast--I don't care what other people say, I think Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery performed their parts as the MacManus brothers to perfection. Willem Dafoe is always cool, no more explanation needed there... And then Billy Connolly. Superb in the courtroom scene. What a presence.This movie goes much deeper than many believe, and the ethical question behind the film is one that I have pondered often since seeing this movie for the first time. How far should one be able to go to procure peace and safety for the multitudes? Should one be able to kill to achieve such a goal? This is why BDS is such a great film--it makes one think and prompts the audience to examine themselves, to see if they can come up with their own answers. I *highly* recommend it. Heck, just go and buy it, don't waste time and money renting it. ;) I know you'll want to keep it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Get ready to be blown away...The Boondock Saints satisfies from beginning to end. Troy Duffy has taken the action genre and perfected it. No Patronising, insipid, Hollywood B.S...This movie breaks all the rules, no busty blonde thrown in for a bit of T and A..No car crashes, just great plot,great directing,great music, great action, and great acting. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus as the brothers Mc Mannus are both pleasing to the eye as they are connvincing as the Vengeful Hand of God.The Mc Mannus brothers complete with Irish accents charm us from the first screen moment. Loyal to each other and thier faith. They find themselves having an epithany after a traumatic run in with The Russian Mafia. Called upon by God, to Smite the wicked, with great gusto I add. The characters are well rounded and charismatic. Willem Dafoe as the suave FBI agent is an intelligent and endearing performance.I challenge you to watch this movie and not want to go out and spread the word of the Boondock Saints. WARNING..This movie is addictive, will cause you to watch it at least once a day and rave obsessivley about it to anybody who will listen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely LOVED Boondock Saints. Yes, it's violent, but in a very clever and satisfying way. To see two sexy Irish men take down the trash that infects our streets, while being tracked by the amusingly flamboyant Willem DaFoe... It's hilarious, captivating, emotional, and the cinematography is amazing. And even though I have 1000 words to describe how great it is, I'll just end with: I bought it both on VHS and DVD, it's that good!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action flick that poses a moral question</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend told me that this movie was about some Irish guys killing a bunch of mob guys, so I thought this film would just be another action flick. However, as I watched it, I found it to be much more than that. The movie has plenty of action, yes. But it is also very funny and sometimes forces you to think things that you should not.The acting is very decent, but not great. It's very good until the actors do a scene where they really have to express a good amount of emotion.The plot seems kind of ridiculous and trivial at first, but it struck me as well-scripted, with some extremely funny jokes.Upon closer inspection of the plot, I came to realize a crucial point. This movie makes you take sides with either the victims or the saints, which is why the "interview" ending, which many people didn't like, was so fitting. Taking the side of the mobsters being killed means you are on the side of the more traditional bad guys. However, If you take the side of the 'Saints,' then you are condoning vigilante justice and ultimately saying that murder is OK. The point of the movie, really, is to explore who the REAL bad guys are. It asks the viewer whether it is better to stand by and let bad things happen, or to stand up to them, in the process becoming a "bad guy" yourself. A very good question.Overall, a good plot, very decent acting, extremely funny, with a twist at the end. Excellent. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best I´ve ever seen. That´s my opinion. I really like it because Troy Duffy found a very fascinating way to show a movie. There are those scenes where you see Dafoe explaining the crime and after that you see that happen what Dafoe just said before. I think this is a very creative way to tell a story. Then there are the action scenes. They are fantastic. The McManus Brothers or Rocco don´t jump around and make this kung fu thing like in Matrix but that isn´t important. The action scenes look great. There are many people who say that the action scenes look like a John Woo movie. Why? Because there is slow motion? There are so many movies where slow motion is used but why does everybody say that Boondock Saints is like a John Woo film. I know Woo made the slow motion thing popular but I think Boondock Saints has its own style so don´t compare it with John Woo films and don´t say that Troy Duffy stole this slow motion thing because he has not his own ideas. If you want to do this look at Matrix. Everything in this movie was stolen from other movies.And you can clearly see that you don´t need hundred millions of dollars to make a good movie. I think Troy had about 5 to 6 Million Dollars to make this movie. And he did a very very good job.And please don´t think that I don´t like John Woo. He is one of the best action movie directors of the world. And don´t think I don´t like matrix. I just don´t like the first Matrix movie. But Matrix Reloaded will be very good.It is also my opinion. Everyone who doesn´t like Boondock Saints is ok and everyone who likes it is also ok. This is just MY OPINION. and so I LIKE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well it's time that I commented on BDS, seeing as its my favorite film of all time. I definitely don't think that it's the highest quality film of all time, but to me, it was definitely the most entertaining. I've probably seen this movie about 20 times, and I love watching it with people who have never seen it, simply for the expressions on their faces. Rocco's lines in this movie just slay me.... he's such a great character... too bad he's not even an actor... just a friend that Duffy put into his movie. Anyways, I also love the action. It's over the top, sure, but it's just badass. I think I like this movie so much because its got a big "F*ck off" attitude to it. I only had a couple of problems with it, both of which occurred at the end.*Spoilers*I hated the fact that Smecker dressed like a woman to gain access to the mansion at the end. It seemed really out of place to me and awkward. I thought that a different means of covert infiltration would have been more enjoyable. Secondly, it seems to me that the most is rushed when he boys are about to break into the mansion and in the next screen they're tied up int the chairs. I would have liked to have seen what exactly happened.Overall, the film has a great mood, great setting, entertaining characters, etc. Some of the criticisms i read bother me. Like when people have said that Il Duce was like Hannibal Lecter? give me a break. Just because a man is detained with ultra-high security doesn't mean you can compare him to a totally different type of character, Lecter, who's characterization was the fact that he was brilliant, not the fact that he was a criminal. This guy isnt brilliant, he's just a killer. Big difference.Buy the DVD; its only $10 at best buy. Hopefully the sequel will be close to as good as the original.</fullReview>

A similar movie doesn't spring to mind when I'm trying to describe the plot or the style of the film like so many other movies I've seen. It's not that easy.Sean Patrick Flannery, Norman Reedus, and Billy Connolly (no need to mention Willem Dafoe since you'll obviously love his character)shine. The Soundtrack, the dialogue, everthing clicks and makes it truly much more than the sum of it's parts.This movie might not be on your top 100, but that's just because you haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let the Saints go marchin' in... guns blazing (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it me, or has it been some kind of trend now that Bible-thumping, gun-toting maniacs grace the screen? Apart from Samuel L. Jackson and his slick role as Julius ("Are you familiar with Ezekiel 25:17?") from PULP FICTION, I couldn't help but think of Conner and Murphy McManus from THE BOONDOCK SAINTS. How anyone can get away with making a movie about two brothers who kill in cold blood all for the sake of religious righteousness is beyond me. But the premise held a key point: the boys are murdering criminal elements, "scum of the earth", if you may. So is what they're doing that big of a deal? That's what the wise-cracking and ethically-conflicted FBI agent Smecker (Willem Dafoe) is debating with himself. Sure, the McManuses are shedding blood, but it just so happens that mobsters are the ones bleeding.I got to give credit for this movie for being such a rich character study. Sean P. Flanery and Norman Reedus play the McManus boys with almost pious conviction, as they quote Bible verses before blowing off heads of the Mafiosi. And Dafoe never ceases to amaze how much of a great and diverse actor he is. Considering he played Jesus in THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, who would have thought he would have appeared in a movie like this, where religion is depicted as something that can co-exist with gratuitous bloodshed? Only in Hollywood.</fullReview>

Troy Duffy is a great director, and how he came up with the movie and the script and the characters makes you see how it works, why it makes sense. "I'll have a coke then". That is a great line!

		<fullReview>I'll start with this-- I'm a fan. I have seem the movie enough times to be able to quote the whole thing, with friends and strangers alike. It seems like once you finally accept the fact that you are obsessed you become a part of something really special. The fan base of this movie is so incredible. Writing this review is my obligation to Troy Duffy, the cast of the movie, the crew and the other fans.Reading some of the negative reviews made me laugh. So, you didn't like the movie. It's really no big deal. But people honestly get bent out of shape about how bad they thought the movie was. At the very end of TBS you see a news clip thing where "people on the streets" give their opinion on the Saints. It's just funny to see how some of the reviews mirror the peoples feelings in the movie: "Oh, they just run around killing people, it's glorified violence!" I'd bet that these are the same people who complained about the cursing. (Which honestly isn't that big of a deal. It's hard for me to write this review following the guidelines! In real life, people cuss.)On the flip side: there are the people who GET IT. This movie is about people sick of sitting around, living in fear. The boys are done being victims, or seeing innocent people become victims. So they take action. Watching this movie is a way to put yourself in the shoes of someone who doesn't just take what life dishes out and who isn't bound by the rules of society. (Though maybe by the rules of some higher power.) This movie is for every time you are watching the news, wishing that you could just put a bullet in the head of the child molesting freak that got out on bail.Then again, I'm partial to movies where you are forced to think and take things at more than face value. I don't care who makes them, or what in-sig-nif-i-cant little element was used by someone else, in some over-rated / obscure / really bad movie. (Take your pick)TBS will always be my favorite movie, unless Troy pulls some kind of miracle and the sequel comes out better than the first. I'm done ranting, sign me up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boondock Saints is an interesting film that's worth seeing. It's the story of two devoutly religious American Irish men who decide (are chosen?) to kill a lot of the underworld lowlife in their neighbourhood.The main questions raised in the film concern the legitimacy of killing criminals and the failure of the justice system, all mixed up with some religious symbolism.If you think this all sounds really heavy and deep, think again. As one previous reviewer pointed out, this movie steals from lots of other action/gangster films such as 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Pulp Fiction.' There's a lot of stylised violence, slow motion and flashbacks. The whole thing is self consciously hip in a Tarrantino kind of way which can be a good thing, and in this case it mostly works.The plotline and acting are quite good. One minute your eyes are assaulted by violence, and the next you're laughing as something funny happens - it's quite unusual in that it mixes the two fairly successfully. At times some of what happens verges on the ridiculous (when they fall out of the ventilation shaft) but it all fits in with the tongue in cheek nature of the picture.One thing worth mentioning is the terrible accents and Irish cliches. It's up there with 'Shaft' as an example of taking the traits of a particular grouping and amplifying them tenfold. Take it from me - not every Irish person is a cheeky chirpy chappy who is always happy to buy you a pint of Guinness, a drunk salt of the Earth type or a Westlife style pretty boy! And the barman who mixes up his proverbs and swears a lot is straight from 'Father Ted'!Still, this didn't detract from the proceedings too much and I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It's nowhere near the greatest film ever as some reviewers have said here (what planet are such people on? I suspect they're impressed with fancy editing and guns) but it's good entertainment and a nice first time effort from Troy Duffy (although I'd like to see something a little more original next time.)Rent it or buy it cheap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indie gem gets shafted...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is a little independent gem, the first attempt from producer/director Troy Duffy. Some people may not like the film because there are comparisons with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Perhaps they don't know that Duffy's film, which was coming out in the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy, was annihilated by the ratings board and was panned by critics for its gratuitous violence. The film you watch is very different from the one Duffy had in mind, and is missing many key elements in the shootouts, for instance, that allow those comparisons to be made. Even still, you shouldn't expect this to be a Tarantino movie, because Quentin didn't make it. What you should expect is a very fun and highly entertaining movie that challenges your personal moral debates on the lesser of two evils and vigilante justice. Get over the fact that Duffy isn't the kind of writer Tarantino is, and that he made the film on a low budget, and that the ratings board drastically altered the film's final cut, and you can really appreciate the movie. This movie is quickly gaining a sort of "cult classic", at least among college students, and is certainly one of my favorite movies to watch. I'm just trying to be civil, so I suggest you take my offer and sit down and have a beer with us. After all, everyone's Irish on St. Patty's Day.</fullReview>

I can say that it just caught me off guard and drew me into the energy of the movie. I agree that it has become an off beat cult film and was never a box office success. As stated previously the reasons being the unfortunate timing of its release. I loved the acting and editing. The flow of the movie was intense. I know others have complained about the flashback narration but I thought that it was brilliant ! It provokes a reaction from its viewer. The story is entertaining and will make you laugh and feel at the same time. It keeps you riveted to your seat. The action and dialogue are not to be missed !! After viewing it , I found myself telling others. I kept thinking about the questions it raised which I think is evidence of a movie that needs to be seen by others. I chose to add it to my favorite movie collection. It is a movie that can be viewed many times and enjoyed. I especially love the DVD out takes and deleted scenes.</fullReview>

It kept me on the edge of my seat and was one of the few films I can think of that gave me chills... especially in the final scene. A must see for all fans of action and rather dark comedy at times.

		<fullReview>Troy Duffy has created a masterpiece! He has made cinema reality of what most people fantasize about, the destruction of everyday evil by unlikely heroes. Flanery and Reedus have perfect chemistry and nailed the parts of the brothers McManus. David Della Rocco rounds out the trio and serves as the main comic relief. Willem Dafoe gives an excellent performance, as is to be expected, and had certainly met the challenge of his part. Jeff Danna has composed an incredible soundtrack that complements the flow of the film and when combined with the brilliance of the director eliminates the lulls you find in most movies. No sneaking out for a cigarette during this flick! A few tracks in the movie are also from Troy Duffy's band which is also called "The Boondock Saints" and is also brilliant in it's own rite. This is the best cult film since Clockwork Orange and Rocky Horror. I can't wait for the Sequel! Believe and trust all the good reviews posted here. As for all the bad one, well maybe they should stick to what they know best, Judy Garland musicals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>little tidbits spoiled, so be aware, but nothing too bigWhen i first heard of this movie, i thought it would be interesting, and i was blown out of my socks.boondock saints had a lot of unique traits that I've never seen in a movie: Irish bartenders with Turret's and men jumping off of buildings with toilets, to name a few. the characters weren't the most well-developed in the world, but they played off of each other very well, and made the movie believable. Flanery and Reedus reflected themselves as brothers before people: looking out for each other, but still inclined to brawl every once in a while. David Della Rocco had his part down-pat, as if he'd been in the movie several years before it was shot.But we must bow to Willem Dafoe. Any time i see him i gain more respect for him as an actor. this time, however, i was surprised to see him in certain situations which i won't divulge simply because they must be seen to be believed. Willem Dafoe makes the movie what it is, and what it is is goodi had no idea as to the plot of this movie when i first saw it, and that's why it blew me away. i highly suggest that you learn as little as possible before seeing it. it'll do the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept is great. The action is great. The casting was great. What more could you ask for? Willem Dafoe, like in most of his movies, did a wonderful job of transforming himself into the character he portrayed. Although his character may have been a little over-dramatic at parts, his performance is not to be blamed. If you are a fan of action movies, you will understand that most of the events which occur are mostly unrealistic. Nevertheless, they are quite entertaining.

		<fullReview>Great story. This screenplay was a little under-written. There were certain details which I feel need some clarification. However, I have watched the movie like five times now, because I love the action and the humour. So I now know what everything means in it.Really, it's a dark comedy that plays at the structure of people's morals, and is bound to make some people angry. Watch Willem DaFoe's investigator character in this movie. A truly well written and well acted part (with the exception of one clip at a crime scene, directed more for affect, which was actually kind of cool).Some dialogue can be drawn out, but is fun anyway. I meant to give this movie 7.6/10, but I slipped and gave it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie! Everything about this movie rocks. The characters aren't too complex that they get in the way of the plot, and they aren't too simple that we don't care about them. Speaking of plot, what could be better than a couple of guys who just decide to kill all the evil people in the world? I've thought about it before, haven't you? The only thing that I find to be a little odd is that if you look at the credits, the actor who plays David Della "Funny Man/Roc" Rocco isn't playing anyone else at all. Apparently that is his real name. Anyway, throughout all the extensive (but well played) violence, I was able to suspend my disbelief and really enjoy the movie. Some people have compared this movie to a tarantino film, but Tarantino doesn't have nothin' on this movie. This film is quality through and through, not like that half-wit garbage Tarantino pumps out. So if you want to watch a Tarantino type movie, I suggest you go rent "Switchblade Sisters" and leave Boondock Saints for someone who can appreciate a good flick when he/she sees it."Destroy all that which is evil, so that which is good may flourish - Boondock Saints"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My best friend calls me up one day and says, "You have to watch this movie called Boondock Saints". I felt I had nothing to lose and said Ok. I get to his house, watch it, and remain speechless at the end. Never has an action movie accomplished the comedy aspect as well as Boondock did. It mixes a terrific story, well developed characters, and comedy to entertain the viewer and keep them on the edge of their seats.Willem Dafoe gives the performance of a lifetime, playing the homosexual FBI detective, who seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to investigation. If it hadn't been for Columbine, and the limited release of this film, he would have received a lot of praise for his role.Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus give great performances as well. Their dialect is a little hard to understand in the beginning of the film, but you learn to listen and understand their accents. With those two and Billy Connolly returning for the sequel, I can't wait. I'll definitely be there for opening night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I bet you're wondering why no one has heard of this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was wondering the same thing when I first heard the title. I like to consider my self a fairly knowledgeable movie goer and was shocked when i saw The Boondock Saints because I had never heard of it and it was so good. I thought of possible reasons of why the film had never been heard of and the first thing that came to mind was that it was a box office flop. I had trouble believing this because i enjoyed it so much, but I checked on it anyway. It turns out that The Boon Dock Saints was released only a few months after the Columbine school shooting. Unfortuneatly for the people behind it's making, it did end up flopping becasue no one wanted to watch a movie about people judging evil and taking action against it in their own hands.Although the movie title sounds religious and the brothers to get their orders from God, most of the religious references are very subtle. For example: toward the end Rocco looses a finger in a gun fight. After he is captured, the matching finger on his opposite hand his shot off as a form of torture. He is swetty and terrified at the time and he has long, brown, unkempt hair. His appearence and the fact that he has matching wounds on both his hands make him seem a lot like Jesus. Shortly after he looses his second finger, he is shot and killed. The two borthers feel guilty for this becasue they are the reason he was killed...almost like he was dying for their sins. The movie is filled with other small biblical references like this one. I recommend seeing this and I hope you all enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies Ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, there are classic movies out in the world. But classics have a tendency to be classics for more reasons than the average viewer cares about. "The Boondock Saints" is one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen.This movie has the potential to offend many large groups of people. If you lack a sense of humor, it may. But for those of you who are willing to take a more cynical look at the world, then you must see this movie."The Boondock Saints" has some terrific bits of writing. Things happen that shouldn't happen in a movie. The camera work done is superb, and the timing of the scenes is intriguing. Troy Duffy incorporates flashbacks into the movie, but nothing prior to the start of the movie; no history, really. The timeline he set up is a really interesting twist. In addition, is overlap of timelines, later in the movie, is also a neat spin.The cast selected for this movie do their job superbly, with the exception, I think, of Papa Joe (dearly though I love Rota, he's not a Don). DaFoe is fabulous as Smecker, and the McManus brothers are... so wonderfully Irish.This movie may be an action flick, but I would definitely categorize it as action/comedy. It doesn't FEEL like an action flick, because it is so simply enjoyable. I know that's a very naive approach to a movie... but it is possibly the one movie I never tire of watching repeatedly. Rent it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of independently made films, so naturally I had to check this movie out. To my surprise, this was not only one of the best indie films I have seen, it was one of the best movies I have seen. I have talked to many people about this movie, and most people say they loved it too. However, there are the few who did not like it. These people claim that it is a rip off of Tarantino's style. I strongly disagree for two important reasons. First of all, Tarantino movies tend to have a lot of pointless babbling in them. Some of it is funny, but most of it is annoying. Boondock Saints gets to the point and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats; the viewer has no idea where the movie is going to go next. Because this movie has guns, is independent, has action, and has some comedy in it critics call it a Tarantino movie. This makes absolutely no sense to me; it is like no one can make a movie with these ingredients without it be called a Tarantino rip off. This movie is a true indie movie which is much more fun then any movie Tarantino has made.</fullReview>

The beginning may seem a little odd and you'll question where is this going . . . but stick it out and you'll rewind this film to see what you missed while laughing out loud, gasping with amazement or just being enthralled by the wicked portrayal of each character. Willem DeFoe is the stand out . . . and the brother's (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) classic misunderstood good guys with hearts of gold . . . and guns flying.</fullReview>

Right from the beginning, you're entrenched in this gritty, religious, good vs. evil story. The two brothers get into a bar fight with these Russian mafia guys, over their local Irish Pub losing it's right to run. You can tell these guys want to make sure what's right, what's good, what is pure in this world, is kept sacred, and kept from being taken down with all that is evil. The acting is tremendous. Sean Patrick Flanery, Willem Dafoe, and the great supporting cast, make for pure enjoyment for the viewer. The dialogue is tremendous as well. From their speech before they kill someone, to the little digs that they have on each other, it's very refreshing, very original. I liked this movie.

		<shortDescription>Incredible film with a lot of depth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, the first time I saw this film, I spent the night thinking about its implications. To the casual viewer this seems like just another action flick with decent actors. To someone who looks a little deeper, its a great movie with a unique, entertaining way of telling its story. At its deepest, and at the level that struck me, it's a movie with religious overtones that raises questions about morality and corruption in society . Most of the critics here seem to miss this point. Contrary to some people's belief, this movie in no way condones the type of violence perpetuated by the protagonists. Their vigilantism starts off fairly harmless - completely in self-defense of themselves and their friends. However, once they realize the possible good they feel they can do by killing evil men, they start seeking the wrong-doers out and executing them. With each killing, they take things a little farther and with a little less stealth and subtlety. Without giving too much away (possible SPOILER at this point), the end leaves the Saints having just committed their most violent, public execution while intimidating (but not hurting) many people. On one hand, you are disgusted with how far they've come, but on the other, you can see the effectiveness by which they purify the evil that society cannot shrug off on its own. The credits are perfect - running with a television reporter in the background interviewing the "average" New Yorker about how they feel about the Saints. Some are supporters, some are critics, others want to join in. All in all, it makes you wonder if it is moral for people to take matters into their own hands when the laws of government fail the people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints in certainly included to my top ten films for it´s sense of style and humor. The cover indeed declared it to match up with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but it seems that in last ten years, if anybody made anything violent, it suddenly becomes "Pulp Fiction´s little sister". I´ve learned to ignore that sort of declarations.I´m a big Tarantino fan myself, but I honestly didn´t see much of him in this film. Yes, it is violent, but Tarantino didn´t invent violence in movies. Ok, it has that hopping forwards and backwards in time -story telling, but Tarantino doesn´t have exclusive for that either. The Boondock Saints is an enjoyable parody of modern society for anyone with a sense of humor, style and irony.</fullReview>

Now I realize that the basic plot of the movie is not original. Pulp Fiction started this whole trend, and I can't pretend that this is better than Pulp Fiction, at least in originality. I do have to say that this is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. Maybe it's because I enjoy movies that make me think afterwards. I really don't want to say much about it except that it is incredible, and if you are into movies that will cause your head to spin after you have finished it, rent this. Oh yeah, and you ought not to mind swearing and violence, 'cause this movie is replete with them. Without a doubt one of best movies I've seen in quite some time. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Troy Duffy,the director of this film, rocks! The Boondock Saints is his first film and man, is it a great film! A hip adventure of two devoted Irish brothers set out to rid the world of evil people. They are the vengeful striking hammer of God, and you bet they're gonna make sure the bad guys are dead dead dead...Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus is a duo that works very well together. They make you believe they really are brothers, willing to do absolutely anything for each other. And for you devoted William Dafoe fans out there; this must be one of his very best films..Please.. don't miss out on this film!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints, is a film that I just recently had the pleasure of viewing. I had never heard of the movie until I saw it in the seven day rental section at the video store. I picked it up not expecting much, but to my delight and surprise it turned out to be an incredible film. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus did an amazing job of demonstrating brotherly love and even though they were killers, for some reason as a viewer I felt no sympathy for the victims, which probably was Troy Duffy's intention, and I simply enjoyed just hearing the MacManus brothers speak (I love the Irish accents). I have the DVD and even though there are no special features I thought it would make a great addition to my movie collection. I know that not everyone feels the same way as I do, but it all depends on taste. If you get a chance to see the film I strongly recommend it, and I hope no one is disappointed. I look forward to the Boondock II: The Second Coming. I'll Catch You On The Flip Side!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is a truly great film. Every aspect of this film is absolutely perfect. The acting is tremendous if you consider that Troy Duffy used relatively new actors, except for Willem Dafoe. The dialogue in the movie just appears to be so natural, which is why it is awesome. When the characters appear to be comfortable saying their lines then you know the dialogue works well. The action sequences in the film are by far the best I have seen in a movie in the past decade. The action works on all levels, even though at some times in the movie it is a bit unrealistic.(The scene where Conner jumps from 5 stories up and the scene where they fight Il Duce for the first time)The music in the film fits perfectly with every scene. The directing is impressive for the fact that it is Duffy's debut. I only had one problem with this movie and that was when Murphy would lose his accent from time to time. Besides that minor detail the movie is awesome. I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this one a 10 in hopes of pushing it closer to the imdb top 250. The scenes are put together in a way that isn't normally done. Not backwards from last to first, but each event is done in a backwards fashion, which gives it a nice feel to it. There are a few unexpected twists throughout that aren't a big deal, but not forseeable. The last 10 minutes though is a mind boggler. I also loved that it is a movie truly meant for the sequel (due in 2003) which I am going to see in the theater on opening day, post haste. Keep in mind how many movies are REALLY meant for sequels(i.e. Godfather, Silence of the Lambs...how many can you name?)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Three Words: The Saints Rule!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love "The Boondock Saints" for three simple reasons: the hacked up plot, the memorable characters, and the excellent writing. Where else can you see a couple of Irish guys get a call from God to go vigilante on the corrupt and evil and have a closet homosexual FBI agent try and track them down? The story is told in a style that is reminiscent of "Reservoir Dogs" and inspirational to "Memento". The visuals are stunning and the gunfights are choreographed extremely well. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus were magnificent as the MacManus twins. What was even more surprising was the casting of Willem Dafoe as FBI Agent Paul Smecker and he probably had the best performance in the movie (It is really an eye-opener to see the man who played Savior of the World in a certain film from 1988 and come back eleven years later as a homosexual FBI agent!). The dialogue and action of the film are well done because of the sharp, edgy, and comedic writing of Troy Duffy. His direction of the film was awesome as well. In short, THE SAINTS RULE!!! I give it a 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films I've seen to date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked this up as a rental back in June 2000, purely by chance. I'm from Boston, I like action flicks and the premise sounded like it could be promising -- so I figured I'd risk the rental.It is absolutely one of the best films I've seen -- ever.It takes a fair amount of sophistication to develop characters, no matter what kind of director you are: even with big-budget films, there's no such guarantee. It also takes a lot to keep the audience guessing as what is going to happen next -- so many films of guilty of telegraphing what's going to happen next. This film commits neither faux pas, and also manages to inject novel plot twists and utter hysteria into the mix, as well.Willem Dafoe is an outrageously over-the-top investigator; Sean Patrick Flanery is totally believable as a principled Irish gangster, and Norman Reedus as his younger, gentler brother. The opening scene is great; the action is pretty fast, although you'd be surprised at how little actual gore is shown. I'll be the first to admit, it's not for everyone -- but I'd say it's worth a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly one of the greatest crime movies of all time..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember when I first saw this movie. A friend brought it over on VHS and after seeing it, my first action was ordering it online on DVD. When the DVD came I watched it again and again and again and started my own personal campaign to make sure everyoen got to watch this true jem of a movie. Very few action movies come witha moral story behind it, but this one delivers a very powerful one and that is the indifference of good men in the face of crime and how two brothers refused to be sheeps to criminals. Watch it, buy it, pass it around because trust me you will not find a better original movie anywhere else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Question of Right and Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my friends popped this movie into the good old DVD player, I didn't really expect very much from it. It turned out that i was about to be very pleased. Boondock Saints was by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. This movie isn't one that you say, "Yeah that was a good one" to and then forget about it, this movie will stay in your mind. The main point of the film itself is whether or not it is right to just kill those who have most definitely committed numerous crimes, or to let the law take care of them. The McManus brothers feel that the law of man is not dealing with criminals appropriately, so they decide that they will begin, as they see it, a mission of God. I believe that many people have probably wished at one time or another that someone could just do away with the scum of our world, instead of leaving to the lengthy processes of law that do not always work out. Is this right or is this wrong? That is for the viewer to decide because what is legally right is not always morally right to many. By the time the movie has ended, your position on this issue may change, or maybe it will stay the same. Either way, this film is filled with top-notch acting and directing, plus it has a dynamite story line. All I can ask is, when is Boondock Saints 2 going to arrive?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints is a bizarre film in that it's hard to find exactly what makes it an incredible film. It has great comic moments, including several featuring an Irish bartender with tourettes syndrome (. . .F***. . ..ASS!!). Some of the cinematography is absolutely striking, such as a particular scene where the Brothers MacManus fall through a ceiling into a Russian Mafia meeting and a blood bath ensues. The depictions of the bond between the brothers is also both powerful and quite moving. The plot twists and the plot itself are impeccably woven. Although banned in the United States, in England it has become a sort of cult hit. A film with a message, some great action, comedy and dialogue. Anyone who fails to see this film is doing themselves an injustice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BOONDOCK SAINTS... THE BEST MOVIE NO ONE'S SEEN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had it not been for the tragedy at Columbine, this movie would have hit the country with a fury and Connor, Murphy, Rocco, and Il Duce would be household names. Yes, it is a tragedy in itself that this movie did not receive the theatrical release it so well deserved. After Columbine, anything involving guns and black overcoats was frowned upon, and so beings the story of the BOONDOCK SAINTS. I bought this movie on advice from a friend who told me it was good. GOOD, my friends, is an understatement.This movie follows the story of two Irish brothers living in an Irish neighborhood. They are very religious and church-faring. When they attend a sermon one day, about how a good man's indifference is just as bad as an evil man, it plants a seed in them. Pretty soon the Russian mafia starts strong-arming their way into their neighborhood, our two brothers are left with only one choice, action, over indifference. So the movie unfolds and we follow our brothers through a movie which is told in outstanding fashion. We get to see them many times getting ready for a huge action sequence, and then the movie cuts away and we see the crime scene afterwards being ran through by FBI agent Paul Smecker (Dafoe of Spiderman fame). He examines each bloody scene and then tells the local police, and the audience just what transpired... and this is a real treat for us. You have to just see these scenes unfold to truly appreciate them. I have not quite seen another movie that unfolds quite like BDS and does it with such outstanding results!The other great thing about this movie is its dialog and acting. There are some fantastic lines in this movie. You will find yourself repeating them over and over again... "where you going... NOWHERE!!!" You will soon be chanting the family prayer and writing Aequitas and Veritas all over yourself or scratch paper whenever you get the chance... and this movie is sure to inspire a few tattoos. See it once and you'll know what I'm talking about. Once, however, is simply not enough. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus give outstanding performances and make us truly believe that they care for each other as brothers (toilet scene), and that they have a divine mandate to kill the killers. The movie raises a good point... that we've all wished at one time or another that someone would "take out the trash" so to speak. That's what Connor and Murphy excel at. Without giving much more away, I want to just leave you with one final note...Upon purchasing this DVD about 3 weeks ago... my friends and I have watched BDS about 8 times! This movie is truly one you will want to see over and over again... and when you factor in that the DVD from Fox can be purchased for around $12 it should be in everyone's collection. It is one of the best action movies around, with the most style (rivaling pulp fiction) and best action around. That tied in with its spiritual overtones, makes for one heck of a rollercoaster ride that you will want to see again and again. I urge you to give Boondock Saints a chance. It has risen to within my top 5 of all time, and I know you will not be disappointed. Finally... a sequel is in the making, so for all of you who have or plan on seeing BDS and haven't had enough... the whole clan should be back for another awesome flick in, Boondock II: The Second Coming! I know I'm excited!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Plain Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I work in a store that sells videos and DVDs. So one day we got a quite few copies of The Boondock Saints. Another employee and I wondered what the big fuss was about since we couldn't keep the silly thing on the shelves. He went home and rented it. The next day, he bought it and raved about how great it was. Since we both tended to like the same movies, I went to the nearest video rental place and picked up a copy.Like my co-worker, I bought it the next day.In my opinion, it's just a good movie. It combines all the right elements of action, comedy and drama to make something that's not going to be like every other movie on the rack at your local Blockbuster. Not for everyone, but then what is? The director's influences are pretty obvious and maybe it has some elements that aren't all that original but what he borrowed was, at least, decent stuff.Controversy might have gotten it noticed, but the "Boondock Saints" stands on its own legs just fine.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong, the movie is great; however, I remember my first time seeing, and I would have probably given it a "9.5"...These days, for whatever reason, I give it a deserved "8", and that's that. William Dafoe is pretty much always a winner in my book (though he sometimes goes a bit over-the-top), and you can always get a laugh from Ron Jeremy. Hey, I know how I can sum up the Boondock Saints without trying to hunt around for things to say about it. The movie is just a really solid flick (as solid as week old oatmeal left to dry in the sun): pretty solid, yet slightly permeable. "8"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing that I had been able to actually miss this movie. I am a complete freak in seeing almost anything that comes out, really. And this I apparently had missed until a few days ago.What a freaky story, it is Reservoir Dogs meets Pulp Fiction. It so read Quentin Tarantino all over it, even though it is not.I like the way your see the result of an event, and then later on get to see the actual thing that took place. It sounds like it could be confusing not seeing it in chronological order, but it actually isn't.I must really rate this as one of my favorite movies of all times, not because it had great performances or a hefty budget or anything, but because the movie just gives you a good feel. How absurd that might sound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more do you want from a movie! It's funny, it's violent and it has Willem Dafoe! I was sceptical when I saw this movie sitting on the pre-viewed shelf at my local video store. But, when it dropped to $1.99 I took a chance. And, may I say...it was the best $2 I ever spent.Troy Duffy hits the humor on the head in what could have just been a blood and guts movie. The acting is by far well above average. I have found myself watching many movies based on the fact that the actor (mostly Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery) were in this movie. Also, one of my all time favorite...people...appears toward the end of the movie. If you have never seen any of Billy Connolly's work this is a good place to start....but make sure you branch out from here. (Beautiful Joe is an excellent choice).Like many fans of this movie I am eagerly waiting for Troy Duffy's follow up movie.</fullReview>

I recommend getting the new DVD with deleted scenes, just for the scene where "Mom calls from Ireland." It was not included in the movie because the rating would have been NC-17, but it is definitely one of the better scenes!

		<fullReview>In a day and age where CGI (special effects) enables film to go places that it has never gone before, but as a side effect to this has become the make or breaking point of many a film it is beautiful to see a film like "The Boondock Saints". In a society and time like the one we live in where the movie star is catapulted, ready or not, into what we, the common man, have made "celebrity" status to be; sickening heights of worthlessness on which horrid films are able to make billions of dollars just because "A-List" celebrities are in them, it is beautiful to see a film like "The Boondock Saints". This film shows that indeed there are still truly original film-makers out there. The cookie cutter, how to make money, corporate americanized film industry has not touched this film, oh no. "The Boondock Saints" is fresh, a deep breath of air in the polluted, self destructive, indunstry that is hollywood. Thank God and Troy Duffy true film fans! Along with the likes of Christopher Nolan, M. Night Shyamalan, and most importantly the Coen brothers, Troy Duffy might just provide the kick in the butt that the common brain dead american needs to start appreciating great film.

The acting was fantastic, Wilhem Dafoe shone, and no, i am not referring to the cross dressing scene, which was a bit over the top, but to the opera enhanced fight scene, where he conducted the invisible orchestra.That moment truly showed what a good actor he is.Though i think Billy Conelly should stick to comedy rather than acting, his performance in this movie was certainly an improvement to his usual performance, again the fight scene showed this well.Sorry to go on about the fight scene, but boy, it brought me back to the Clockwork Orange days of classical music and violence, the two contrasting so well, i am suprised it has only been done in a few films, though when it has, the film has been brilliant (face-off being another)What else can i say?

		<fullReview>A good friend of mine recommended this to me. The movie was released on dvd at a cost of ten bucks. Not a good way to start as far as expectations were concerned but what the hey, I bought it anyway. I watched it that night with my girlfriend. About twenty minutes into the movie, she asks me what other movies my friend recommends so she can avoid them. She retired early and left me to watch it alone. When the movie was done, I pulled the dvd out of the player in disgust, cursing my friend's name. I called him, asking him if he'd taken a sharp blow to the skull in recent months, recommending me a crock like that. He said he hadn't suffered any traumas and calmly told me to watch it again. I spent ten bucks on it, right? I figured I might as well, so a couple of days later, I watched it again. To my surprise, I began to enjoy it. Yeah, it's not completely original. Yeah, the director has an obvious affection for Tarantino movies as well as the movies that knocked Tarantino's style off, which this could easily be categorized with. Yeah, the Irish accents are unintelligible most of the time. Yeah, watching Willem Dafoe roll around on a bathroom floor dressed up as a broad was upsetting, possibly even traumatizing. Yeah, there's some really bad overacting. Yeah, it's hard to take a movie seriously that has Ron Jeremy in it, no matter the size of his part. But, there's stuff in this movie that just stays with you. The prayer the brothers recite before executing their victims is classic dialogue. Il Duce is one of the coolest characters to come on screen in a while. The courtroom scene and the speeches within. The cauterizing of bullet wounds with an iron. Willem Dafoe's over the top performance, obviously inspired by Gary Oldman's character in the Professional. This is a movie that you need to see more than once. You might not like it the first time but I think that the second viewing is where you see where they're going with all this. Check it out, especially if you like violence and bad Irish accents. And if you want my personal favorite scene in this, it's gotta be Sean Patrick Flannery's delayed reaction to what David Della Rocco's doing to the unconscious stripper. You'll know it when it comes.

		<shortDescription>I finally found this movie.... and WOW!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been hearing a lot about this flick over and over from the 3-D gaming community that my brother is involved in. Finally I have been able to view it. The Boondock Saints quickly held place in my top 10 favorite movies. It has it's quirks, such as many indy flicks do, but the good greatly outweighes the bad. Everyone whom I have shown this film to (practically everyone that I watch movies with) has absolutely loved this movie. Even the guy who watches any generic Hollywood mindless dime-a-dozen action movie will LOVE this movie.There are those movies that either you love or hate. This isn't one of those though.... EVERYONE loves this movie. Well maybe not the people who don't like to realize how much the word f**k is used in life, they wouldn't like it. But everyone else will. I cannot recommend another film any higher to the general masses of "R" rated film viewers. The Boondock Saints is deffinately not for children though obviously.I haven't been entertained so well in a 2 hour time period for a long while. The movie contains down right goofyness for humor as well as witty dialog for it's charm. It respectfully plays out it's action scenes better than any independant film I have seen in years. Separating this movie visually from a high budget Hollywood action film is the use of only a few cameras in each scene as opposed to the glossy multi-camera editing of it's high dollar counterparts. The only thing missing from this movie is the sappy love story that a big budget movie would try to cram into any movie.In 1999 The Boondock Saints was scheduled to be released in the USA the Friday following the massacre at Columbine High School. The film was never released domestically, but was released to an international audience with much acclaim. I am not sure when it was released on VHS in the US, but the DVD has been sold out week after week in stores after it's release in may of 2002. As I wrote earlier, I knew of this movie shortly after it's international release and never really sought it out. Now that's it's greatly available.... don't waste your time renting the DVD, b/c you WILL want to buy it after you view the rental. So save yourself the rental fee unless you only have a vcr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend showed me this movie thinking I would not like it, instead i watched it twice before i gave it back to him. It is simply a good movie about guys who get fed up with those who are corrupt. it is not a shoot-em up movie, it is not a well known movie because it was supposed to be released during the Columbine incident but for obvious reasons it was not. but believe me it is worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a masterpiece in the hands of Abel Ferrara</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Troy Duffy directed and wrote this debut of his which stars Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as two brothers, who literally think they're on a mission from God and act like saints that commit His will. That means they get rid of (=kill) all they consider bad, evil and rotten. This includes, of course pimps, rapists mafiosos and other more or less dangerous criminals. They get an FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe on their tail, but Dafoe is not necessarily their enemy in the crime infested world the film is set it. This sounds pretty promising story and probably the film could've been a masterpiece in the hands of Ferrara and his screenwriter Nicholas St. John. But still, The Boondock Saints is viewable and has its moments and merits.The subject matter of evil and someone's right to get rid of it and kill others has rarely been this underlined presented as it is in here. The theme of course makes me think that why not; they kill only people that probably could kill innocent people and never stop their criminal activities, unless our Saints don't stop it. But I still think, no one has right to kill or be the judge in these kinds of things, and the film doesn't really explain the motivations of our Saints as they are highly religious and by believing in God they know that Bible says Don't kill. The thought about God having sent his Saints on Earth is of course fascinating, but I would have liked the film even more philosophical and deep. Now it is pretty much a skeleton waiting for some flesh to cover its bones.The brothers are not evil as the people they kill, and they don't harm any innocent people. But then, I don't recall any explanations why they had to kill some non criminals in the peep show scene..? The film has couple of this kind of holes and unexplained acts, and they tone the film down. It seems like killing becomes a way for having good time for Rocco, who joins the "angels" as he is their friend. I think the director is pretty religious and has thought much about these things, because otherwise he wouldn't have included these religious elements in his film and he probably would've done totally pointless gun fight filled actioner!The photography in the film is very smooth and as great as the editing. The director knows many inventive camera styles and uses also flashbacks. I don't want to blame this film too much of copying Tarantino, but it is obvious Duffy has seen Tarantino's films and has had influence from them, I think. But still the stylish elements of the film seem fresh and inventive, and I really liked to see them in this film. The action scenes are very balletic (perhaps he has seen some Hong Kong movies, too!) and slow motion is used all the time there is action going on. This film looks great and proves the talent of the director.The dialogue, however, tries to be little too "cool" and it is easy to say it is Tarantino like, and I didn't like it all the time. The characters are sometimes too shallow and all they do is swear and scream and kill. Also, there are couple of usual cliches and bits that really annoyed me as they are so unoriginal and stupid, but fortunately they are not too plenty in this film.The shootouts which are very plenty are incredibly violent and bloody and come honestly close to the most violent actioners of the Orient. Well, not as nihilistic as A Day Without Policeman (hardly any film beats that!) but I mean films like John Woo and Ringo Lam. The bullet hits and wounds are so over the top and gratuitously gory and detailed it is not a wonder that the film had to be cut to get the R rating. I have the uncut unrated version and this was the second time I viewed the film. All the violent gun fight scenes are slow motion and the gory mayhem is pretty amazing, and couple of those scenes of "detailed bullet hits" (mostly those that were cut from the R version) are, in my opinion, too strong for this kind of film that is supposed to be fully serious and have some kind of moral. Perhaps the director became too enthusiastic when he started to play with fake blood with the effects crew! The director most likely wanted to do a film that reminds of these Hong Kong films and occasionally he succeeds. But still, it is hard to believe the Saints are committing only good things because the carnage they create is so vile and brutal.After all, I found some positive points in this film and due to them, I give this 7 out of 10, but this would have been a definite masterpiece if they had wanted to do it more serious and believable piece of work. If you like action films and films that have even little message and content, then watch this, but don't watch it with people that don't like violent movies because this is too much for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't laughed so hard since Raising Arizona. Plenty of bullets, plenty of laughs and plenty of fun. The MacManus brothers are hard drinking, fun loving lads that kill some Russian mafia toughs to save their favorite pub. They decide to take out the big boss himself and eventually become vigilantes who kill for God.Although there are a few too many coincidences to take the movie seriously, it doesn't detract from the story and does help the pacing. There are memorable scenes, notably Defoe, Young and Rocco in the confessional and of course, the cat scene (I say no more). I loved this movie and rate it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poetry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can you say about a movie that strikes you speechless? Not enough being restricted to 1000 words. From the story of how Troy Duffy came to write and direct the movie, haggling with all the "big times" and finally deciding to do it HIS way. To the movie itself which is 2 hours of magic, with the intricate and unique plot, the phenomenal acting by every individual on screen, the score, and the absolutely beautiful cinematography. To the unfortunate events that ultimately caused this movie to be kept out of American theaters. This movie, and the story behind it, is pure poetry.That being said, I suppose I could go on about the exceptionally quotable dialogue, and the uncanny ability Flanery &amp; Reedus have to drag you into the Irish accents for days afterward. (There's really nothing more uncomfortable than your boss asking you why you sound something like Lucky the cereal guy. You must just smile and nod, and mutter, 'd@mned indie films,' and move on.) And the fact that it has the action, blood and profanity that will appeal to some, and the relationships and friendships that will appeal to others, and the moments that will make you laugh so hard you have to push pause to make sure you don't miss the next bit. And even parts that could make you cry. (thanks to Reedus and Flanery again, for their dramatic capabilities, and their willingness to share them with the world)If there are any aspiring filmmakers out there, buy the new DVD, it has exceptionally informative commentary by Troy Duffy as well as many humorous anecdotes. ;)</fullReview>

It was my fifth and it was his first time. He watched the whole thing and loved it. The USA could only hope that a pair of unkown men would help clean up the mess in their cities. The brothers represent how most of the population feels in reality and wish they could just those same things in real life. Congrats to the writer for great twists and the director for some awesome backflashes. Nothing was left out and nothing was dragged out. Couldn't say the same for Star Wars (the neverending story?) and other resent suck films. Nobody seems to care if the never was Lion King Part 2.

		<fullReview>Just like Elwood and Jake who were on a mission from God in the Blues Brothers, the 2 main characters in The Boondock Saints are doing their thing for the lord; only instead of signing and dancing, theire killing and breaking hell.Many have already compared The Boondock Saints to films like Lock, Stock and Two smoking barrels, Pulp fiction and even Kubrick's The Killing, and they arent entirely wrong; this movie has got plenty of blood, bounty hunters working for bad guys, guns, more guns, snappy dialogue and unpredictable twists... only this time we see it from a different angle. The wonderful thing about this movie is that it actually found a fresh plot and a new way to tell a story involving cops, bad guys and god bad guys (the 2 main characters).William Defoe's acting is top of the line. He plays an FBI cop looking for the meaning of the murders happening in the city. His character is the link between the killings and we learn the story of the killers through his investigation.Altough it involves God and religion, the movie is far from moralistic. It's just a very good movie, brilliantly directed and very enjoyable for anyone who likes a good action/crime movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anyone who makes a comparison with this movie and 'Dogs' or 'Pulp' is a complete idiot (including the reviewers). Every movie (regardless of how good or bad) leaves its own signature on the movie-going public. This movie left me laughing about the ironies of life while still feeling like there was just a bit of justice and belief in human nature; very few films have affected me in both directions. 'Pulp' was more a dialogue between the history of the actors and the audience while 'Dogs' was a complete story meant to be told TO the audience. BDS was both; a story and a dialogue. The audience WANTS to know more about the brothers but is willing to settle for the interaction between them and those people they are willing to kill.Overall, the film itself got slow at (a very few) times, but I still give it a 9/10 because of the serious comic relief following a truly righteous act; especially Dafoe's willing ignorance of wanting to arrest these 'God fearing' people.</fullReview>

Billy Connolly as the Killer-killer is also a great choice. The pictures and the music are truly good, the story that is told is a bit too crazy - so what? If you haven´t seen this masterpiece of film, get it now, rent it, buy it, see it!! The idea, that you first see what the police sees, and then get told what really happened is something new, I think. Troy Duffy should make more of this style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being somewhat of a film noir buff, this "film" hit's the mark for a long forgotten genre. What other film has the protaganist leaping from a seven story roof top, in his robe, hand cuffed to a toilet, onto a russian mobster to save the life of his only brother? All in the first three minutes. The film is set in the back drop of Boston Mass. ( a primo local for filming, i.e. Good Will Hunting). As two brothers quit their day job at the meat packing plant, to punish the wicked. Look for a flawlessly exacuted script rife with richly comical dialogue, superbly crafted directing, fine acting from an excellent cast; Dafoe, Flannery (in a not so pretty boy role), Reedus (always a good performance), and a stand out performance from newcomer David Della Rocco, that is classic in a Woody Allenesque meet's Bruce Campbell kinda way.

Of course, the actor who stole the show was David Della Rocco. He was an excellent actor who, I hope, will show up again in other films. The film raises several moral questions. They kill people who would kill good people. The Saints kill mobsters, pimps, and thugs. Are their actions truly harming society?Who knows for sure...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film, I thought to myself "This could have been an absolute Mega-Hit Film!" The story is by far the most interesting thing about this film. With big name actors and a much higher budget. . . this could have been a summer blockbuster. Not only that, but the storyline opens itself for sequel after sequel. But there were no big name actors (except for William Dafoe) and the budget for this film was not large. However I loved the movie. The acting was great, the music was beautiful at times, and I found myself laughing out loud throughout the whole movie. On the other hand, if you were to cover your eyes every time they showed blood and guts, then you would have seen more of the previews than the film. Overall the movie gives you everything we ask for in a film. It makes you believe that something so absurd and deranged not only could, but perhaps should happen. Or should it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints, written by Troy Duffy, really makes an impact on people. All of the people who I have shown it to have loved it, it's just one of those kind of movies. A movie with a plot that is hilarious at moments, to a powerful ending with smart dialogue. It is telling the story of two brothers who are doing something that everyone know's is wrong, but we love it anyway. We want to say what they are doing is wrong, but in the back of your mind you ask questions to yourself if it can really be classified as wrong. After all, they are killing bad men, or maybe that's what they tell themselves so they can feel better? People ask questions at the end of the movie if it is really up to them to decide, which is a good touch by the director to show controversy.The Boondock Saints is a great movie. I loved it for it's story, and dialogue. The way it was shot was great too. And I really wish that the writer/director Troy Duffy would get more praise for it. This has all the flash of a major production, even though it was independent. That's how good a job Troy Duffy did, I guess he just knows how to make movies.</fullReview>

Browsing through the late night movies on cable last night i noticed it was showing so decided to check it out... boy am i glad i did. Its absurdly cool, very funny and dripping violent gunplay. Two Irish-American brothers kill two russian mafia henchmen in self defence and find themselves minor celebrities amongst the locals and the police, meeting gay FBI agent Willem Defoe (in a classic role) at the same time. The brothers then find themselves with the equipment and motive to start a crusade to rid the streets of Boston of "evil" men. Joined by a small time mafia "runner" called Rocco (looking suspiciously like a thin Mick Foley ;) )they take down mafia members and lowlifes one by one all the while being pursued by Defoe's FBI agent and hired gun "The Duke" (the awesome Billy Connoly). Their quest for their own brand of justice leads to many very violent scenes, but done in the kind of cool well choreographed way of so many other modern action/criminal films, but somehow managing to seem original and outclassing them all in the cool stakes, but its hard to ignore the humor of this movie too, both in dialog and situation and the breakneck yet laid-back pace of the story (i dont know if that makes sense but it will when u see the movie). Some of Defoe's dialog in particular and the scene with the cat, are very very funny. I guess there are points in the movie i could criticise but right now i cant think of any.

Everything is exaggerated, but without getting corny or stupid. John Woo eat your heart out - this movie takes slow motion sequences to another level. I always liked Willem Dafoe. In this one he starts out as a wise-guy cop, but as the movie progress, his dark and paranoiac behaviour surfaces, scene by scene. Great performance from him.I can't believe that this is the only movie that David Della Rocco has been in. His performance was great as 'the funny man' (and funny he was). This movie succeeds because it blends so many genres (drama, comedy, action) and does it well. The script is really good, as well.

		<shortDescription>One of the best films seen in a long time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going by the opinions and the voting on IMDB it did not really appeal to me due to the lack of gritty storyline.I recently rented this movie and I am so glad i did this is one of the best films i have watched in quite some timeI must admit that the 2 Actors playing the brothers were unknown to me But Wilem Dafoe and Billy Conolly definately are.Without giving too much of the plot away i would just recommend anyone doubting this movie to go and watch it. It is full of action, drama, religious overtones and humour.10 out of 10 for me well done to the cast and crew on making my year. even if it is a bit late :)DA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really don´t know where I shall begin in my comment on this movie........ well except that it is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The acting in this movie is spectacular. Willem Dafoe does a brilliant performance as FBI agent Smecker, and Sean Patrick Flaherty and Norman Reedus does a really good piece of work as the McManus-brothers.Other things I feel I should mention is the dialogues, especially between the McManus-brothers, they are really funny, and the way Agent Smecker talk to his co-workers.....it´s just hilarious.At first this movie seem like your typical hero-actionmovie, with the McManus-brothers sent on a God-given crusade, against evil men. They walk the streets of Boston, killing one gangster after the other. They do this without really having a plan, it all start as self defense against some russian blokes they beat the crap out of in a barfight the night before. The russians want revenge and surprises the brothers in their own apartment, but the brothers get away in a rather unusual way..... Later they´re joined by Rocco, who has a lot of information about Boston-gangsters, so they start to wipe them out. During the McManus-brothers´ crusade, agent Smecker is constantly following them one little step behind, and when he cathes up with them he realize that the brothers really "helps" the police by killing badguys, so he decide to help them out.But maybe the most brilliant thing about this movie is the way the story goes. When the McManus-brothers have killed someone, you don´t really get to see how they have done it. You have to wait until Smecker start to solve the crime and figures out what happened before you can see it. And that is really cool.So the conclusion must be that this is a brilliant movie with great acting performances. A movie I can see over and over and over again....My english is not so good, but I hope you understand what I mean..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If every time the infamous f-word appears in the movie would have been replaced by a beep, in my head there would still be beeping right now.No, this movie is great. There is the beautiful (read: quite interesting and funny) story about an Irish twin cleaning up Boston's streets, wiping out syndicate clans and other scum. I also loved the general atmosphere in the movie. Beautiful colors were used; making it a totally non-pulp-fiction-alike movie. It really made me think of bright happy happy joy joy summer days -setting the ideal atmosphere for the film-. Colors can help setting a flick 's atmosphere; and maybe I wouldn't have liked the movie that much if it were much more dull, misty and gray.The dialogues between the two brothers, discussions at the police department about who did what, how and why... These things spice the whole movie up.Only weak point: the ending of the movie. Just have a look and agree with me. I give it a 9 out of 10... Recommended if you want some suspension and a good laugh...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well directed crime flick with good characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Boondock Saints," despite it's usual negative review, is a good film. The way that the events were layed out was unique in that the events weren't on a time-line, a crime was first investigated and then it was acted out by the criminals. This creative style yielded positive results in that it turned the film into more of a work of art than a teenage crime flick. Good directorial skills truly are responsible for the transtion from a good movie into a great movie. I regret that the producers opted not for a theater release, which probably would have made the movie a box-office smash, rather than a somewhat cult film for teenagers who just liked the great action sequences.Sticking back to the subject, "Boondock Saints" was a good movie. In fact, it is one of the best crime dramas I have ever seen. The shootouts and crimes were thrilling and interesting. The cast and acting provide a substantial amount of quality for the movie, due primarily to the main role, played by one of my favorite actors, Willem Dafoe. You may remeber him as the compassionate Vietnam martyr in the academy award winning "Platoon." he used his on screen grace to master the role as a homesexual detective trying to crack the case of his life. Don't get me wrong, the twin brothers, Conner and Murphy Macmanus, were great characters. Both displayed raw emotion and feelings, pain and joy. Their kind personalitys but countless homicides gave us a tough moral question: is it wrong to kill criminals? Criminals who make the world a terrible place: the drug dealers, mobsters, scum bags - is it wrong to kill them?Answer this question for yourself when you rent the fabulous film, "Boondock Saints."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I initially heard about this film from a friend who raved about it's excellence. Being intrigued,I rented it and was NOT disappointed. Concerning two Irish-American brothers in Boston who become vigilantes against the mob and general criminal element of Boston. The young actors portraying the brothers are excellent,especially Sean Patrick Flannery. Willem Dafoe plays a detective who can recreate the crime scene with an uncanny flair for detail. As he does so,we the viewers actually get to see what happened as he describes it. The brothers are sometimes aided by their friend and mob insider Rocco. Although the movie is violent,it is not excessively so,and the film is punctuated with much humor,particularly from Rocco and Dafoe's character. One person in the cast is particularly good in a small role that would not be fair to describe as this character is vital the last section of the film. I immediately went out and bought this on video. My friend assures me that you can purchase on DVD,although it is in the $60 range. He also says it's available only through Blockbuster video although I have yet to try. All in all,an excellent film and highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a masterpice of independent filmaking. This movie is set in South Boston and is about two irish brothers, (Conner and Murphy) who turn into vigalanties who kill mafia bad guys with the help of their friend Rocco, who is connected to the mob. The action in this movie is amazing, the best thing is that all the action sceens are done in flash back. Showing you the aftermath and the dectectives trying to figure out what happend. The acting is great Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus make the brothers likeable without being heavy handed and overly religious. David Della Rocco is a bit too over the top in most of his sceens. Willem Dafoe is excellent as always (will some one give this man an oscar already). My only complaint is that you can see the ending plot twist coming from a mile away, and that there is no sequel. Overall if you are a fan of action movies you will most likely love this one. If you don't, then I suggest you check your pulse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although we have had a spate of similar films like The Boondock Saints in recent years, I feel it is one of the best ever made in it's genre. It's a fresh and different take on the low-end gangster movie. It was a great idea to show the crime after, then before, to watch how two brothers, with so much love for each other overcome their circumstances, to do some "good". Although the ethics of their actions should be judged in a real life situation, in a film setting, it was a fun and wonderful look at the seedy underworld. I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys "gangster" type films. In comparision, it's closer to Guy Ritchie than is to Quentin Tarentino, but Troy is definitely his own man. I am looking forward to seeing his next film................</fullReview>

Nobody I knew had heard of it but I finally convinced them to see it (after they saw the trailer too).They enjoyed it more than I did! (and I liked it alot!)Good pacing, excellent directorial work and gunfight choreographing make this a definite contender for my "Top 5 Action Movies" list.

		<shortDescription>A movie everyone should watch - twice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the bad reviews I have read I would recommend watching this movie at least twice. Watch it once for whatever pre-conceptions you have about the film. Then, put your sensitivities aside and watch it again. There is so much hidden meaning it is difficult to understand the full scope of the movie in just one viewing. Yes, there is a lot of profanity, but that's realism. The violence is there as well, but it is presented as the alternative to indifference.I found the movie to be both entertaining and moving. I love the acting and the overall cinema tics. Perhaps it has been done before, but the energy and emotion of the film is so tangible. Although the circumstances of the film are a little outlandish, it still demonstrates the depth of love a person can have for another and the moral dilemmas society faces when deciding how to react to deviant behavior.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock was unexpectedly a terrific film. What was anticipated to be an ordinary mafia, 'good guys conquer' film unravelled as a fast paced, witty, funny, realistically violent, clever &amp; an intense film that needed to be watched at least several times to be fully appreciated. As a past film student, I also found the camera techniques, cinematography &amp; montages utilised as groundbreaking - everything was thrown in to create an interesting yet artistic piece of film. Not a second of the movie could be missed - there was an overwhelming amount of action continuing in the backgrounds. The soundtrack was as euphonic as the actors awesome. Definately one of the best action/drama films seen in a long time.</fullReview>

Their Language which some of you mentioned as profane is actually how most people talk from the bogside or Derry. And for those of you who didn't catch the religious side of the movie well throughout the movie, the stigmata are given to the Brothers. On the Wrists, and on their heads. And if you really want to get into it, look up the prayer they say and the tattoos on their hands.For those of you who thought the movie sucked, understand the culture before you pass judgement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints is a particularly likeable film in spite of its violence. Its a lot smarter, fresher and more thought provoking than the films oft invoked in its presence, like "Pulp Fiction". Troy Duffy's take on the cops and criminals genre is at times cardboard cut-out, but believably so. The 'boys' are good and Rocco's a bit of fun. Perhaps Willem Dafoe's best role since "The Last Temptation of Christ". I have to admit I rented this movie for Billy Connolly and was disappointed that there wasn't more of him, but I was pleased with what there was.Despite really liking this movie something has to be said about the portrayal of "crusading vengeance". There is an attractiveness to seeing the unforgivables of society dealt with "by the sword" as it were, but the arguments that can be made for self-dispensating justice are few.Enjoy the movie but no copycats please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's sad is that this film was involved in a botched business deal with Mirimax and was forced to go almost directly to video, where is was labeled a "B-Movie" without anyone seeing it, because despite a few first-timer flaws, this is an excellent film. The story really makes you think, the characters are very likable and intriguing, and the direction was superb.Although it does have many obvious references to Tarantino, but that doesn't mean it's not original at times, with very funny dialogue and situations and a keen sense of style. The soundtrack is also used very effectivly, especially in one scene where the saints break into a hitman's card game and turn the place into a bloodbath which ends up with a man being murdered with a cue ball. The music was perfect for this scene, blasting rythmic rock and then turning orchestral as they begin a shootout on a suburban street. Along with the fantastic Willem Dafoe's play by play explanation of what occurred AS the shootout is happening, this had to be one of the best shootout scenes i've seen since The Matrix. This is an extremely impressive debut from writer/director Troy Duffy, and saying it's the same as the direct-to-video trash with Mark Dacoscos and Eric Roberts doesn't do it justice. Hopefully Duffy's next effort with bring this film into light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a film on the lines of Reservoir Dogs and Trainspotting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When my brother watched this film with my father, he told me afterward that it was, and I quote, "Better than Reservoir Dogs." Better than Reservoir Dogs? That's a serious review. So for my birthday he bought it for me from a local Blockbuster and that night, I watched it for the first time. And I have to say, he was right. Reservoir Dogs was great I don't deny that. But this film managed more laughs and looks of quiet awe than Reservoir Dogs.This, I think, is writer/director Troy Duffy's first big film. And I say he did a fine job. He laid the storyboard perfectly, using a lot of flashback techniques. He presented a horrifying scene at first, then he shows you how it happens. Like how it was done in Reservoir Dogs.The two main characters, played excellently by Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus, had light twangy accents from the Isles that made me think of Trainspotting. That and the fact that Sean Patrick Flannery vaguely looked like Ewan McGregor in the film. I also liked how, despite the fact that they were killers, they managed to pull it off like teenaged hooligans.I also tip my proverbial hat to Willem Dafoe for playing such an odd character, an highly-stressed, highly-intelligent, highly unorthodox homosexual FBI agent. And I also tip my hat off to David Della Rocco. He played a laughable, bumbling mafia turncoat quite well. And I loved how the Saints managed to pick on him from time to time.And the ending was definitely powerful. A definite way to end an excellent action film, but at the same time make room for a potential sequel.</fullReview>

There is something for every decent movie fan in this wonderfully directed (first time director Troy Duffy) film. We can start with Duffy. He was a bartender who wrote the script, was wooed by Miramax and then dumped because he didn't want to play by the Hollywood rules. (See Oliver Stone Platton and Kubrick). I have respect for men who want to do movies the way THEY want to, not the way people tell them to do it. Next move on to the pure comedy of the movie. I laughed as much in this movie as i have in any Tarintino movie, and comparisons, other than the time segments is not fair. The movie can stand on its own without any comparisons made. The numerous jokes made about Vigilantes and Charlie Bronson were also an excellent add in. The pure violence in the movie was smooth, not too excessive but there was enough to make it not fall into that boring/too fake violence era known as the 80s. The plot is simple enough, two brothers becomming vigilantes by accident and finding themselves strangely good at it. "We're good...YES WE ARE." But not TOO good, pretty much it seems as if The Hand of God IS guiding them and getting them out of trouble. Its not too religious, its not too much bullshit, its a great blend of action and comedy. The question is WHY NOT can't this happen? A great added bonus to the movie is the interviews at the end, perhaps poking fun at the american public and the media. There are some good comments.Conclusion: This is one the best movies that will never make it to theaters....because Hollywood didn't let it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Second favorite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite movie of all time is Reservoir Dogs. This movies just slipped into a close second. I had walked past this movie a couple of times while in the video stores. Well finally I picked it up cause a friend suggested it. Well I am glad I listened to him. I have already watched it three times in one day. It is rare I do that. Dogs, The Killer, Hard Boiled, Better Tomorrow are pretty much the only movies I have done that with.The one big plot twist at the end caught me by surprise and that doesn't happen often, hey I figured out Sixth Sense mid way through.I really liked the way Defoe's character played out the scene's especially the one at the house where he is shown side by side with the boys.I recommend anyone who likes John Woo or Quentin Tarrantino pick this movie up. I am on my way to buy it now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boondock Saints" is probably one of the greastes sleeper hits since "Reservoir Dogs". Many have compared Tarantino's breakthrough hit and this film and they "Boondock Saints" is just as good if not better than "Reservoir Dogs" (and that's saying a lot because I'm a huge Tarantino fan). This has got to be one of the best crime flicks in a long time and ranks up there with "Pulp Fiction", "Reservoir Dogs", and "The Usual Suspects".With the accents of the two Irish brothers it also resembled that little English hit called "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" but with a little more edge to it. Wilem DeFoe was great in and it's one of his best since "Platoon". Sure it was violent but it was for the sake of good.There were some obvious influences in this movie that made it fun to watch. The prayer that the two brothers recite before they shot their target is a lot like Jule's Ezekiel 25:17 from "Pulp Fiction". In the end this movie was just great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I LOVED this movie !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie at the recommendation of a friend and I am so glad. This is the best movie I have seen in a long time and will be one of my all time favorites.I don't know any technical movie jargon but this film has some really neat elements. I especially enjoyed the scene where the FBI guy (Willem Dafoe) reenacts a crime at the scene and they superimpose him as a watcher during the crime while he narrates.This movie is violent but I grew up watching Mafia movies, cop movies and other hard action films with my dad so I'm conditioned not to notice. If you are easily offended by violence (gun play and more original fight scenes). I've heard this compared to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs but I think this movie is totally unique. It is a movie which contains vigilantism but I wouldn't say that's the whole plot. All of the actors gave top notch performances. And I love the twist, near the end. I love movies that make you route for the bad guys and these "bad guys" are very endearing. The film was action packed, they had me on the edge of my seat all the way through. At one point I actually sat forward in my chair in shock and then laughed out of shear joy (has to do with the twist) And at the end I rewound the movie and watched it again.I read a review which objected to Willem Dafoe's character being gay. I admit that it didn't tie to the plot in an important way. But I didn't feel it detracted from the film. Being a woman I enjoyed the fact there were no real sex scenes. The characters were all very single minded to their own causes and didn't distract themselves with a moment of unnecessary passion.I hope you watch this film and love it as much as I did !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most excellent first-try for Duffy. YES!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel much pain for those unfortunate enough to not like this movie. Any objections to what this movie is saying about how "murder" is right must have been written by someone who either fell asleep during the movie or is just a bit slow, the movie doesn't say that at all(the movie simply has good people doing what they feel is right and if we all did what we actually thought was right wouldn't this world be a better place?). Despite what you may have read in some reviews this movie is quite original, and you have to give Troy Duffy much credit for doing Tarantino time schemas better than Tarantino does. I've seen a number of gay characters done well in movies, but Willem Dafoe's character Paul Smecker was the only part of the movie that wasn't excellent, the only flaw in an otherwise perfect movie and Dafoe's worst movie. While I guess I have to respect Duffy and Dafoe for trying to break the mold, I was surprised there was no women in this movie, with both make-out scenes being male-male.Excellent casting of the MacManus brothers, Rocco, and even of the police force, but Dafoe was just blech. The brothers were awesome even if I couldn't understand some of what they said by the eighth time I saw it(this morning). 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie because my name is Chris Brinker, and in one of my idle points during the day I looked up my own name in the IMDB directory. Sure enough there was another Chris Brinker out there, and he produced this movie. I figured that I would go ahead and see it, why not?! So bam, I did and it was great. The movie is somewhat original (even the beginning credits are good to watch) but there are some overlapping areas in style that have been in other movies I know. With all the movies out there though, it doesn't bother me at all, and I'm sure the directors and producers knew of it anyways, so I don't waste too much time thinking about that one. Let me get down to it though, this movie really gets you into it, and the violence of each scene is displayed very well with flashbacks n such. Overall, just check it out, it's one of those movies that you'll show to all your friends sometime. I always like finding surprises on video, and this movie reminds me of that idea.</fullReview>

I actually rented it on a whim, and have never been more grateful to have had nothing better to do with my time than browse the shelves at Blockbuster. William Dafoe gives an amazing performer,almost making puke with laughter when he dances the riverdance. The two american lead actors are respectable with their irish accents, but even more appealing with their amazingly good looks.

		<shortDescription>Let's go bag some bad guys.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That is the first thing I wanted to do after I watched Boondock Saints. It is one of those kinds of movies. The story revolves around two brothers who become "super heroes" to the people of Boston. Modern day Robin Hoods. But instead of taking from the rich and giving to the poor they are just offing the scum of society. The drug dealers, pimps, thieves, and mafia boys who are preying on the innocent. The movie is filled with a lot of action, and a religious delima. The brothers are faced with the question, "Is it right to kill the evildoers in society in the name of God?". Their answer, "Yes". One of the questions another commenter raised is, "What about turn the other cheek?". Well what about, "An eye for an eye."? The fact of the matter is if the justice system wasn't so screwed up, these questions would be moot. But enough of the political commentary, it's just cool to watch a movie that makes you think about this sort of thing. The acting was great, along with the action and storyline. The best scene in the movie, in my opinion, was the toilet scene, about a half an hour into the movie. A little unbeiliveable, but cool just the same. If you haven't seen this movie, because you never heard of it, like myself, go rent it. Not only is it entertaining, it also makes you think. And it is rare to find a movie like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symbolism and The American Unconscious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to stumble on this movie at my local video store. What an unexpected joy it was to watch this iconoclastic film. The humor, action, symbolism, and overall inter-connectedness of the film is excellent. I particularly enjoyed the numerous symbolic representations as well as the mythic hero's journey in modern day Boston. My friends and I were touched by the brotherly love, the direct action (retribution), and the interwoven expressions of authentic spiritual focus.What American doesn't have at least an occasional desire to "take out the bad guys?" What person, with any intelligence, isn't sick &amp; tired of the stifling oppression of "political correctness" that has flooded into every aspect of American life in the last 15 years. This film gives vent to many of those feelings, and puts "paid" to the account.I think that this film will end up a cult classic. It is an modern epic, a revolution of iconoclastic blasts at the excepted and explained, the injustice and absurdity of current American society.And... it is just plain good fun. Humor, action, good guys winning, bad guys wasted, the forces of light marching to glory against darkness. Luke Skywalker</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defending the "Saints..." against ALL evil comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read some previous reviews on this outstanding film (remembering that Troy Duffy is brand new to the directing industry), I have picked up a problem which I foresaw immediately after having spoken with others about it : a mere misunderstanding of the films intentions...bearing in mind that directors like Goddard paid homage to great pieces of film in his own creations, I think it is unfair to criticize Duffy for picking up on themes and ideas from "Pulp Fiction" or "Lock Stock..." ,Is there a problem with recognising cinematic genius in the past, and using it as a basis to push those boundaries a little further?! Without ackowledging the past, we cannot hope to learn from those who are wise in their art!!Plus, there seems to be an assumption that the film overtly condones vigilantism...come on, it is full of paradoxes which give it it's ironic comic character,I highlt doubt that it was Duffy's intention to generate such a message...what's more, it's full of homosexual undertones not just in the obvious form of Agent Smecker (Willem Dafoe outdoes himself), "butt" between the brothers, while subtle religious "symbology" may have been neglected by the average theatre-goer.I could write a thesis on the symbolism and inter-textuality of the film, and would love to discuss it further, but for now I'll leave it at that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fraternal twins, Connor and Murphy MacManus, beginning with a good old fashioned barroom brawl, receive-for lack of a better phrase- orders from God to rid the streets of Boston of the criminal element. I liked this movie, and for the following reasons;This is one of those movies where the less explained the better.Pay attention to the narrative in this movie, it is superbly done. It's both necessary to the central plot, but unobtrusive.David Della Rocco (Rooco) is absolutely funny as the inept mafia peon (read; total idiot.)I've never seen Norman Reedus (Murphy) before but after this, I'll definitely look for him in future projects.After Simply Irresistable, I was ready to give up on Sean Flanery (Connor). Fortunately for us all, he does a complete 180 in this movie. Unlike in 'Simply Irresistable', he's almost instantly believable as a pretty fierce guy. I say almost because of the occasional lapses in his accent.And as for Willem Dafoe, his take on a gay man in a straight law enforcement world is at once honest and funny adding an extra pinch of spice. (But then, he's always great).The only hitch in this film is the actual message. It was never clear to me that God intended this, or if the twins are little on the flip side.None the less...A great spin on an old fashioned shoot 'em up that doesn't involve fancy martial arts, explosions, or special effects. It's got believable characters in believable situations. And it's got the twice the bang because of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a unique and exciting action film presenting a clever moral dilemma for the viewer. One of the best films of its kind that I have seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Willem Dafoe is humorous and mesmerizing as a brilliant but tortured gay FBI agent, hot on the trail of two Boston-Irish brothers committed to exterminate the top organized crime figures in Boston. The fast moving action plot creates a feeling of suspense and conflict as Agent Smecker gradually confronts his own personal dilemma - whether to arrest the two young men, who are eliminating known criminals, or look the other way and condone their "illegal" brand of justice.A surprise twist in the plot gives added credibility to the brothers and their mission to protect society from evil forces. However, a clever ending ultimately leaves Agent Smecker's dilemma in the hands of the film viewer.I found the film exciting and thought provoking. The use of flashbacks from various crime scenes, to reveal the actual events of the crimes is very powerful. The talented Willem Dafoe was great as usual, turning in an exceptional performance as the arrogant but tormented FBI Agent.</fullReview>

The story of two Irish brothers who start to free Boston from human waste (e.g. Russian gangsters, Italian pimps and contract killers) is surprisingly well written. Camera and editing is superb. But most of all "The Boondock Saints" lives from its characters. "Young Indiana Jones" Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as Irish brothers are overwhelming and Willem Dafoe delivers his best performance since "Platoon". Although the movie is quite violent (I have not seen shootouts and bloodshed like this since "Hard-Boiled"), it does not lack a certain humanity, which makes it different from "Natural Born Killers".

		<fullReview>First, I was positively surprised by the apparent coolness of the movie. Then, I saw that the motivation of the brothers was quite real and understandable. In my belief it is not allowed to anyone to take what he can't give. You can't destroy what you can't create. So, nobody is allowed to take life, as nobody is able to give life. On the other hand, we can see that fighting evil (which is crime here, but it could be anything else, like environmental sins, racial discrimination or software monopoly) effectively calls for extreme measures, as prison nowadays does not seem to help much. But killing, the way the Saints chose, is not a way to go either. This film, which I loved and enjoyed very much, should not be mistaken as a call for self-justice, it should be taken as what it is: The propaganda of finding the courage for taking steps which are creative, effective, without personal advantage and not thought of yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from an ordinary action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a big action fan, but you are getting somewhat tired of the standard action movie car chases, fights, and explosions that seem thrown into the movie so it can be called an action film, this movie is ideal for you.The story is told from three different perspectives, so you have to think about what's going on. But don't get me wrong. It's not the type of complexity that makes you frustrated to the point where you have absolutely no clue what's happening. You just have to keep up with the three perspectives, and I found it pretty fun seeing the main story from the three different characters and how they all found out different things at different times.The main perspective focuses on Agent Smecker,a very intelligent, yet somewhat crazy detective who handles organized crime murders and things of that nature. He basically tries to track down the twin brothers, and tries to figure out all of the clues to the murders they commit.The secondary perspective (although some consider it the main perspective) revolves around two twin brothers named Conner and Murphy who are avid Christians, and they believe that they are saints and God wants them to rid the world of evil so all of the innocent can thrive. So the two twins eventually decide they will kill all evil people in the world like mobsters and pimps until the world has been "cleansed".And lastly, there is the story as told from the perspective of mob boss Papa Joe. He is the main target of Conner and Murphy, and he has organized the murders of several men.All of the perspectives and details I have mentioned sound pretty ordinary and generic, but I didn't want to give any spoilers, because there are plenty of twists and turns, as well as more characters that appear, so if you want to know all of the bigger details that shift up the story, you're going to want to watch this for yourself. Everyone plays a unique part in the story, and by the end, everything comes together perfectly, and you realized that you have just watched easily one of the most creative movies of the past decade.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually my most favorite movie. Everyone has a fantasy of being a vigilante and doing something to clean up our society, taking action against evil that is protected by miles of red tape. The Boondock Saints satisfies that craving. My only disappointment is that there have been rumors of a sequel "All Saints Day" which was supposed to have started filming some time in 2003 but that was the last I have heard of it. I have been patiently waiting for 9 years for another great Boondock Saints film. This movie should be seen by every human being. Other movies I would recommend for people who enjoy this movie are Frailty, and The Brave One. Both are different in story line which is what makes each film so unique yet satisfying in their own way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Someone gave me this title on a DVD- As I sat down and watched it, I realised that this film is the best directed film I have ever seen.I did not know what to think of it... I had never even heard of this flick until someone put the DVD in my hands. So, I wanted a second opinion, and I showed it for my good friend who knows more about movies than that guy on TCM- He was riveted, the guy has the attention span of a gnat, and if the moovie we are watching ain't great, he stops watching it and starts fiddling with his laptop, and he'll never look at that particular film again.Not so with Boondick Saints: He had his eyes forward all through the thing, never turned his head, never uttered a word... Duffy really hit it on the head with this, and after watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, it becomes apparent that the editing is equally phenomenal. That's all we can say about The Boondock Saints: A phenomenon.Now, regarding the things that were cut, and I understand that Duffy had an extraordinarily difficult time with the MPAA regarding certain "shots" (Literally, the shots of bullets entering heads)- But the MPAA, in trying to hamper Duffy, actually improved the work, and elevated it to "Fantastic" status... "Fantastic" and "High Level Cult Film" status. I enjoy Directors Cuts... As in Pete Jacksons director's cuts of LOTR and King Kong (and as an aside, I would like to see an extended cut of The Frightners) - But this film is a container and you can't open it and you cant add anything to it... The only thing you can do is make a sequel, and I hope Troy is able to do it.This is a compleat story, it is fated to be told exactly the way it is told from start to finish. When the film is done, the tendency is to watch it again instantly. Ergo, the need for a sequel IMMEDIATELY!Duffy was handed a raw deal when he was making this moovie, and he is being handed the same shaft now. I think Duffy can be making moovies that are better than any Scorcese, Tarantino, Rodriguez, or I?árritu film: But instead, Hollywood is handing lots and lots of money to very lousy directors to make movies based on VERY poor scripts: When they COULD be backing Troy in a sequel, at least.Damn their Eyes for their stupidity!

		<fullReview>I am not one who normally enjoys excessive killing and very foul language as entertainment, but this movie was so well done and captivating, that I could not stop watching it. It had humor, morality, and a sense of purpose. I am also not one to repeatedly watch the same movie. However, I must confess that I have watched this one five times so far. I did not find out about it until St. Patty's day of this year. I was shocked that I had never heard of it before. Considering that the horrible Colombine issue is long past, I believe this movie should have a new debut and nominations for Oscars. William Dafoe was creative, entertaining, and ended up be coming an inspiration to the detectives that worked under him. It was brilliantly done and kudos to Troy Duffy and all those that made the film possible. Just when you think you can figure out what is going to happen next, you discover you are clueless. Being Scotch-Irish, I understood the moral mentality behind the movie in spite of its vigilante message. It corresponds to how we have had to fight our way to freedom and continue to do so to this day! Great film and deserves a second shot at becoming an Oscar nominee in several categories. Where is Boonedock Saints II? There needs to be a follow up film for this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch This Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a wonderful performance of power, strength of will and fortitude. Not to mention dedication and faith. I guess it is the vigilante in me that agrees so much with this flick. It is not, by any means, a high end production. The main cast is excellent. The supporting casts performance left something to be desired, but it is easily looked past. It was never truly meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster. It has Ron Jeremy in it for crying out loud. However, it is a movie with a definitive message. A truly decent message at that, no matter what your spirituality. It should be a mandatory watch for everyone. A wonderful ride. The soundtrack is fantastic. 100% entertainment. It is the epitome of "cult classic".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this film about 10 times in the last 3 years.I only stumbled across it by accident, I don't think it was released in Ireland as everyone that I lent it to has never heard or seen it. Firstly this film rates in my top 10 movies of all time. It might not have the big actors or the big budget but it makes up for that in a lot of ways. Its funny, violent, actioned packed, sometimes far fetched but it pulls it off all the time. I recently rented the departed and lent it along with the boondock saints to a mate at work, when he returned them all he was talking about was the boondock saints. I recommend this film as an easy watch that will suck you in and really surprise you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what more could I have ever asked for in a movie? It's got action, it's witty and funny, it's got good-looking guys (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus: Hello, rest of my life! ), and there's a certain beauty to it. The fact that it has the classical, opera-type music behind action, that was ingenious. They say the Boondock Saints was the rise and fall of Troy Duffy, but my opinion is, he should write some more good stuff like this. Can't wait for Boondock Saints II and I hope you can get around all the bullshit holding you back from making and releasing it, Troy. I don't think this movie could've been any better. I guess all I can say now that hasn't already been said is, Thank you for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's it About?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I sit down to watch a movie with a preconceived notion of what I'm going to be getting out of it. I already know the plot somewhat and I'm pretty sure I know how the characters are going to be used. The odd thing about this movie is that I had no idea what it was going to be about. I had no idea who the actors were or what the genre was. I think that was a great idea because it really allowed me to approach it with a clear mind.The story bounces back and forth between the Saints, two brothers on a vigilante-killing spree, and the detectives investigating the murders. The way in which the plots weave in and out through scenes from the future, past, and current times really sets it apart. The story is told logically, but in a way that it is really only conveyed in bite sized bits.The acting was spot on from the opening credits to the closing ones and I must say a few parts caught me off guard due to the amazing presence that was displayed bey the relatively nameless actors. This is one of those movies that I went out and bought simply because I heard a friend talking about it. He said I had to see it. I had never heard of it before that, but it will now be going into my collection of movies to watch often right up there with Reservoir Dogs and V for Vendetta. Loved it, and I can't say much more than go out and WATCH it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boondock Saints is a must watch !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This action flick is about two brothers who swear by their principles to fight the scum who have grown to populate their city. It isn't like most mindless predictable car-crashing, Do-nut munching, crack trading gangster movies. The story isn't the big draw either- its the usual good vs evil preacher ideology. However, the style and panache with which most action sequences are shot combined with excellent dialog delivery is what makes it different. In fact every killing scene has an amazing musical score making it thoroughly exhilarating. The gay cop who has an intuitive talent of running through the event of massacre and who does so listening to an opera waving his hands in the air adds a dash of ecstasy to the gory manner of the murders. Its not bad on the dialog front either.. with the essential supplies of mindless crassiemathafakisms... This one truly is a gem and is in my opinion on the lines of pulp fiction and reservoir dogs.. An ideal substitute for those who've been missing the Tarantino movies lately....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Readers,Crime and Chaos are running rampart in the city of Boston. Two Irish brothers decided they should kill off the members of the Italian and Russian Mafias one by one in the name of god. Everyone's rooting for them, except one brilliant but unorthodox FBI agent named Smecker. With their wacky friend Rocco and brutally vicious hit-man known only as The Duke, Connor and Murphy McMannus wage a bloody war 'to destroy that which is evil, so that good may flourish'.I had heard a bit about the Boondock Saints from the media, but it was my cool brother who got me to watch it. I was very impressed when I watched it. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reefus are great, menacing, and funny all at once. The guy who played Rocco was a laugh-riot (For those who like real off-color humor, though...) and Bill Connolly, one of my fav actors, was awesome as The Duke. It's Willem Dafoe who has one of the best performances in this film, topped only by the Saints themselves. Dafoe plays a well-learned, gay, unorthodox FBI agent who is impressed by what the Saints are doing and is not sure what to do about them.Now comes the bad stuff. I thought Bad Boys II was violent till I watched this. There is extremely intense shooting and a good amount of gore while the swearing is waaaaay over the top (Possibly more F-bombs than Scarface.) and the sexual jokes and scenes are disgusting. Plus, seeing Willem Dafoe in drag was an image I seriously did not want to see. All in all, the violence and sex was the main focus of the film and drowned out the extremely well-written storyline.One more thing: You will NEVER believe how purely awesome the ending is.Signed, The Constant DVD Collector Matt Macleod</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vigilantism at Its Deadliest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a name that movies like this fall under: Tarantino. But this one isn't by that guy that directed Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs; it's directed by Troy Duffy("who?"). Yes, and its a pity Mr. Duffy was such a jerk, or else he would be cashing in on this outstanding films success a bit more.Oh well, enough of that, onto the actual review. Quite simply, "The Boondock Saints" is one of the best vigilante movies I've seen in my life. Now we all love Batman and the Punisher as established icons who each have years of history behind them, and Sin City takes the cake in style as much as the next guy, but if you try to label or compare these films to Saints, you'll come up dry. What Mr. Duffy did was take concepts of vigilantism, revenge, religion, brotherhood, and good old right-and-wrong, and he rolled them up into 110 minutes of an excellent film.It's the story of two Irish brothers, who are slapped in the face with a mission they both feel they must carry out after they are forced to kill two Russian mobsters in self-defense. They get off, but they realize that what they've just done is remove a threat to their South Boston neighborhood's streets, and they want to do it again and keep doing it. They eventually recruit their Italian friend, Rocco to help them. Rocco contrasts heavily with the brothers' cool, impersonal demeanors and approaches to killing, and this brings them at odds with each other.Also a major player in the storyline is the gay, classical music loving FBI Agent Paul Smecker, who is Willem Dafoe in another five-star performance. Smecker remains in conflict with himself throughout the film, as is evident in Dafoe's expressive acting. He doesn't want to bring these guys in, as he feels they're doing something necessary: cleaning up the messes in society that the law can't. By the end of the movie, his conclusion is--(that would be telling wouldn't it?).Added to that, the highly skilled hit man, Il Duce, is sent after the Saints (as reporter Sally McBride--peppered throughout the course of the film--refers to them). He remains a mystery until one of the final scenes in the Italian don's house. Who he really is may be a predictable twist, but it is done in a way that is both meaningful and works so well in context that it doesn't take away from the film's style or innate majesty.People will also criticize the violence of the movie, but, in what is arguably one of the most surreal scenes of the film, keep an eye on Dafoe as he plays Smecker, who, though not personally involved, appears to be directing the bloodletting as a conductor of an orchestra. The difference is all in the presentation. We could watch a movie like "Pulp Fiction" or "Sin City" and their hyper violence and in-your-face presentation of the violence is construed as tasteful, but with classical music playing in the background and a conductor who appears too into his job is seen as "excessive"? Please, you're a hypocrite if you don't criticize the violence in "Pulp Fiction" but you do criticize it in "Saints". The fact is, the exposition (and the music) reminded me more of a John Woo scene than anything else; I half-expected doves to fly up around them when they started shooting. The scene immediately after when the three effectively licked their wounds was excellently acted and shot, as well, even if you didn't find the last scene in your taste.At the end of the day, it puts forth the question, "Are vigilantes necessary or correct in society." Some will say it's pro-vigilantism, some say the opposite. Personally, I think it splits us down the middle. Either way, the message the Saints give at the end of the film is one of the most memorable in the genre's history, and that in itself is commendable in this film, and makes it worth the last 100 minutes of your life.The best part of the film is why it's "vigilantism at its deadliest." They allow us to answer the question of vigilantism it presents, instead of telling us whether it's right or wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vigilante Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is well acted and packed full of action as well as some comedy. Willem Defoe is an accomplished actor and his character's negative opinion of the Boston police is evident. It is nice to see that as the story unfolds he does seem to like them a lot better as they become more competent in the case. I liked that the brothers were educated and religious. I know that they are supposed to be fraternal twins but it seems more like big brother/little brother the way they act. Conner (Sean Patrick Flanery) acts more mature and level headed. He seems to always be trying to calm things down. Murphy (Norman Reedus) is more youthful and definitely less serious. He is very excitable and the way they play off each other is incredible. Some of the looks that pass between the two of them are intense; you can feel what they are saying. Both of those actors were very good and their Irish accent could melt ice it was so hot. The last main character, Rocco, played by David Della Rocco is the complete opposite of the McManus brothers. I liked his wit and the humor he added to some situations. "Is it dead?" after he had just shot a cat and splattered it on the wall. Funny. The religious aspect of the vigilantism puts some meaning other than just killing behind the violence. "Evil man, dead man." The prayer is exceptional and fits the movie perfectly. One of the biggest draws to the movie for me was the way Smecker (Willem Defoe) would say what he thinks happened then we get to see what really happened. As he gets closer to figuring them out the two aspects of this start combining. Very well played. All in all I would recommend seeing/purchasing this movie to anyone. I loved it!</fullReview>

I finally saw the true-ness of this fantastic flick and HIGHLY Recommend this. Just make sure your "parent figure" is not in the room if ur under 18.

		<fullReview>OK, so I'm a little biased since this is one of my favorite movies, and yes, I'm a little biased because I'm 16 and enjoy watching people get shot and killed. Sorry, can't help it.This movie was just so well done. Granted, it is a cult film, but once you see it, you know exactly why. The two leads just encourage what modern society feels sometimes. If we know who the bad guys are, and we have the power to stop them before they do anything else, then why don't we? This movie shows two brothers who feel religiously compelled to rid the world of evil.In my opinion, this is the new brand of super hero. These two brothers fight bad guys, but they are still human, and they smoke, they curse, they aren't some super human. It looks a lot like Constantine, and to some degree even Batman. Heroes, without the million dollar smile and the stop kids from smoking program on the side. Real people stopping real crime. I love it.</fullReview>

If you have ever lost yourself in a movie where justice is done, bullets fly and all the while, there is an underlying message of family and friendship, this movie is for you. At the end of this film, you will be wanting more and more. Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick, and Norman Reedus have outdone themselves in this one. If you liked Snatch, you will love this. This is a movie that is definitely deserving of a sequel and I am not quite sure why one has not been made yet. This is the Braveheart of the inner city.

		<shortDescription>a very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The very first thing that struck me when i first watched this movie is that it could have been a lot better. Some of the acting is below par and you can tell that the making of the boondock saints was severely hampered by its low budget. It does still have a hell of a lot of redeeming features. The dialogue only rarely slips below excellent, the story itself is, in my opinion, one of the best of the last 15 years or so and there is some truly great camera work to appreciate.I just cannot help wondering how great it would have been if miramax had kept its considerable weight behind the project. The higher budget would have enabled the hiring better actors (mainly in the supporting roles, it is unfair to criticise the lead actors as they put in great performances). In my opinion, having a strong supporting cast is what makes a good movie great.So, all in all i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes good characters, great story and sharp, witty dialogue. It will not be the best movie you have ever seen and it probably will not change your life, but it will seriously entertain you and there is enough substance to justify at least a couple of repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in America on Holiday about three years ago. I was staying in New Orleans with a friend and for a week we went to stay with his family in Florida. Him and his cousins kept ranting and raving about this film about two Irish-American brother, Conor and Murphy McManus, and couldn't believe that I had never heard of it never mind seen it. That film was The Boondock Saints. I watched and was amazed. The film was absolutely amazing. The story revolves around two deeply religious Irish-American brother who are put 'in an extra-ordinary situation' and end up on top. They then receive a message from God and decide to go on a mission to protect the innocent ... by punishing the wicked. Together with their friend Rocco, excellently played by David Del La Rocha, they track down the drug dealers, the mobsters, the phedos and punish them with biblical styles justice. However they are tracked by the master assassin The Duce, played by a seriously amazing Billy Connelly, and the brilliant detective, played by Willem Defoe in my favourite performance he has ever made. Fans of Connelly will be amazed by how he plays the serious character instead of the 'funnyman'.I've never seen a film that mixes seamless action and asks the highest moral question. Should the wicked and evil be punished by death? Much like Japanese cinema the film leaves this question on the table and while the film does not answer this question it poses it in such a manner that you can't help but think about it. Yes this film is has a lot of gore but it is not gore for gores sake. It is realistic. It makes you feel for these brothers. While one brother is being trailed off to be executed the other is handcuffed to a toilet. The love is so strong Conor tries to pull his hands through the handcuffs, blood gushing he manages to break the toilet. Only to go and jump off a roof to save his brother.Moreover the film has a wicked sense of humour. De La Rocha is hilarious and the interaction between the three main characters is oft times inspired. Watch out for the scene with the cat, comic genius. This movie has something for everybody and don't be put off by the religious tone set in the movie. Watch this movie, it is quite simply a true classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the little things in this movie make it what it is. There's so many layers of reference that if you don't catch on early you'll be completely lost. I find myself watching it again about once ever 6 months; and it's the only movie I can watch more than twice. The way the producer lays the story out is so original that it's the best part of the cinematography. Also, the lack of technology is kind of refreshing. Not because I'm sick of technology (I'm pretty much a geek), but I'm sick of the fake crap most movies have in them. (Swordfish, remember the computer with eight monitors?! Please! No use for that what so ever.) The actors chosen really bring the movie together. William Dafoe gives a performance careers are made from, just too early for its time. (Now there's some queer movie about cowboys... Broke back Mt. or something. John Wayne is clawing his way out of his grave.) In short, it's the only movie I force my friends to watch. However, a couple of them haven't shown my love for the film.-Siress</fullReview>

It has such an array of amazing film effects used throughout years, ranging from brilliant camera angles and suspenseful slow motion to lighthearted comedy to break the tough moods. The religious aspect added such an epic feel, and when usually I'm not too keen on it, loved every bit of the story unfolding from beginning to end. I believe everyone should see this movie once in their life, some may feel the way I do, some may hate it. But I feel its a life changing experience for anyone.

		<fullReview>A few weeks ago this movie was on Dutch television, I had seen it maybe 15 times in advance but hey....why not watch it again. A very appreciated Dutch television guide said: 'The story is a bunch of separate events put together, causing the story to be a big mess. It's hard to keep up with the events. The only thing that makes you continue watching until the end is the fact that it is a unpredictable story. Watching this movie is interesting but not satisfying at all, you'll regret watching it.' I totally disagree with that. The story is great! It really sets you to thinking about the difference between good and evil, and especially how close good comes to evil sometimes. Director Troy Duffy also did a great job combining the action and comedy in this film. Rocco gives this film the bit of extra spice it needed, he's like a finishing touch. The only point I agree on with the television guide is the fact that the story is absolutely unpredictable! But that's a good thing! The soundtrack of the film is superb.So, if you want to watch a good film, while having some beers with your friends...this is THE film I'd recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie gets mixed reviews and for good reason, but overall, it is a good movie, and a great take on the whole vigilante genre. It has a good amount of acting as well as dialogue. Della Rocco is quite effective, despite his immaturity as an actor. Reedus and Flannery do a respectable job, and they really fit the stereotypical "closet killer/ don't judge a book by its cover" look. Willem Dafoe is amazing as usual, and if you are not sold on him being an amazing actor, this movie will definitely incline you to think that way. The best thing about the whole "against great odds"/assassin genre is the making sure that the characters death defying stunts are believable. When the brothers fall out of the ceiling, with their ropes on their backs, I find it quite unbelievable that the rope could have possible hooked on to anything (let alone, something strong enough to hold their collective weight). The use of religion unexpectedly symbolizes the false sense of religious activism, that we see in todays society. The whole concept of the assassinations being done through FBI agent Smecker's eyes is a very good one. Anyhow, this is a good movie, and it is a shame that it didn't get the initial exposure that it shouldve received. The sequel will undoubtedly be well received by the public.

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing. There are some comments here about poor acting and plot...but really, who cares? They turned a cat into a giant bloody smear. That alone makes this movie a 10 out of 10. There may be some naysayers who say the fight is not realistic (ie the entrance from the air vent), to them I would say that's a good thing. I don't know about other people, but I watch movies to be entertained. If I wanted to see realism, then I would watch the news. This movie is basically a killing spree paired with humor. Isn't that what one wants to see in a movie? If you want to see a plot then go watch gone with the wind, you pansy little school girls. If you want to see guys get shot and have comedy to go along with it then watch the boondock saints. Afterall, isn't being entertained the whole point of watching movies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Saints Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This may be one of the most UNDER-rated movies ever made. The action and the intense drama makes this a must see film for anyone over the age of 13. I have found that if you're of the Irish decent you'll especially like this movie, but don't worry Germany, England, Jamaica, fellow Italy, or every other nation... this movie is still amazing! It's cast,though unknown, is one of the greatest assembly of actors I've ever witnessed. Each actor fits their characters perfectly, not to mention a nice surprise visit by Ron Jeremy. Also, I must give credit to a GREAT Willem Dafoe; his performance as the FBI agent is nothing short of perfect. If you like this movie then be sure to catch "The Boondock Saints 2: All Saints Day" coming out late 2005. It is sure to be action packed and suspenseful.

		<fullReview>Watch this film and have fun. So what if every hack out in the world thinks that this movie is a Quentin Taratino (QT) rip-off. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but every movie AFTER Pulp Fiction is a rip-off of QT. Has there been another Citizen Kane? Has there been another Casablanca? You get what I mean.Also with all these critics saying that Troy Duffy is a bad writer and director my comment to that is what movie have they made? With all this in mind rent, no in fact go buy this film. This is a fun movie. Who cares if the story line is so outrageous? Isn't that what fiction is all about, particularly in the movies. Isn't that why we go to the movies? To be entertained. Anyone who like's action, and mindless entertainment please do yourself a favor and see this movie. For those Willem Dafoe fans, this is probably one his best roles ever.*One spoiler note - The last 10-15 minutes of the film is a little "long in the tooth". Probably could have done without it. However it sets the stage for the sequel, which is production now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My sister made me watching claiming i would like it. but as usual she was wrong i loved it. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus did an excellent acting job. They play two Irish twins on a mission.The gun fights were great. I loved how they used Opera and Gaelic music instead of the more popular stuff. Connor and Murphy are so hot shooting for their belief's. I was on the edge of my seat with laughing and suspense. When I showed my friend He sat there naming all their weapons. More men should be like them. They show loyalty to each as brother and friends while fighting for the underdog.It has some Catholic lesson about the 10 commandments. Even tho I am not christen the movie would not be the same with out it. The movie makes you want to join the boys cause by killing evil. Like my sister said "there is nothing worse one could do then to close an Irishman's bar on st. Patrick's day." I hope this help you out and made you want to watch the movie.</fullReview>

I would completely loose faith in the world if it didn't. I wish it had been theatrically released though. The humor was actually intellectually stimulating, which is something I've found lacking in most of today's movies. It was a perfect mix of serious and fun.

		<fullReview>If you have seen this movie, I salute you. Show it to your friends, family, whoever. Because there are not a lot of people that have seen this movie so its really hard to talk about a movie that nobody has seen. It's pretty funny, kick butt moves, violent (to the max!), cussing (to the extreme!), and there is partial nudity. I mean come on, what else could be better in a movie, I cannot wait till the sequel comes out. I bet its going to be even better than the first. Boondock II: All Saints Day is the title of the sequel to The Boondock Saints. One thing that I do not really understand in this movie though is that when they are locked up in the basement, one brother breaks the other brother's arm so he can get himself out of the handcuffs.

		<fullReview>Not only did this movie have a great plot, but it was beautifully filmed and wonderful in the particulars. As a forensics student, I appreciate the crime scene reconstruction that Willem Dafoe's character goes through. Further, the sequencing, which cannot be called linear at all, is very innovative and keeps the watcher enthralled as to what happens next. A couple of scenes are very surprising like Dafoe in bed with another man, or Dafoe in a dress... but watching Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus is enough to make any girl happy. And guys will have fun with all the killing, winning by accident and especially the weapon-choosing scene. The death of Rocco makes this film masterful in delivering a message with intermitten comedy. Everyone should see this film, and I can't wait for the sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have several friends who have been talking this film up for years. I finally broke down and barrowed it from one of them and I LOVED it!! The film is about two Irish brothers who take it upon themselves to rid Boston of all "evil" men. Violence ensues. They are pursued by an FBI agent played by Willem Defoe. As Defoe's character starts to understand the motive of these fledgling vigilantes, he begins to wonder if maybe they're not really the bad guys. The film has a strong ending that leaves you asking yourself the same question. No mater how you answer it, this movie definitely makes you think while, at the same time being extremely entertaining. If you haven't seen it I definitely recommend it. If you have seen it you should probably go out and buy it. ...I know I'm gonna!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is, simply put, very fun to watch. There's a nice big chunk of a morality issue that you can chew on long after the end credits roll, and it was very well presented. The only thing that really bothered me was the plot holes. Certain things, logically shouldn't have happened which would negate the entire reason for the movie to continue. Why would they have the Russians pager if they put all of his stuff into a bag and gave it to the bartender? Why would the Russian mob still call the pager and give the necessary information when the story had already leaked to the press. I'm sure even the Russian mob reads the paper. But other than that, I thought the acting was swell, and they made a sub-par script come together nice and neat. Props to Troy Duffy, though, for making it work. Conveying religious undertones without getting cheesy or over-worked is a hard thing to do. Watch this film, watch it many, many times.</fullReview>

I was so miffed by the posts talking down to people who like this movie, that I took the time to create an account, just to respond! This movie is great, one of my personal favorites, but even if it weren't, why get personal with the people who like it? I wouldn't, for instance, call any of the previous post authors elitists just because they were preaching to the rest of us, because I see no need to get personal.Back to the Saints...awesome movie. I may or may not agree with the vigilantism, but that's not the point. All of you who were raving about Tarantino; if you thought the Kill Bill movies were great (which they were), should we all assume you revel in blood lust? No! You can like a movie and still not want to live it. Which brings me back to my point, I loved this movie. I thought it was well-acted, hilarious, poignant, moving, and above all else, entertaining, which is all a movie ever needs to be. I thought there were times in the movie when the cinematography was unique and even a little bit wonderful. While I could see how some of the other critiques would write this film off as a Tarantino wanna-be, probably due, for the most part, to the cinematography, especially the scene sequence, I thought it was great. Jumbling the scenes was as integral to the plot as the lines of the script themselves. Duffy wasn't ripping off a great filmmaker, he was simply making a great film. I'm not going to get into my personal opinion on the message of the film, because that's not what this forum is for. All I'll say is that I loved the movie, and you really ought to see it, if for nothing else, because it raises some serious issues, and that alone makes it worth two hours of your time. Watch the "news cast" while the credits are rolling, and you will see how easily this subject can divide opinions. Love it or hate it, it will make you think, read the rest of the posts and tell me I'm wrong about that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far one of the GREATEST movies i have ever seen. You might be thinking if its so good, why didn't i hear about it? or why wasn't it in the movies? or why did rotten tomatoes give it such a bad review?well here are those answers!1. you didn't hear about the movie probably because there wasn't that much advertising/marketing for it. As far as i know. I could be wrong, i mean, I'm not a professional or anything, but this is just what i think. If you find out otherwise, please lemme know thanks.2.A. There are 2 different stories i heard for this. I was talking to a lady at blockbuster about the movie and she said that it never came out in the movies and that was because the "producers/important people" were afraid that it would influence too big of a crowd and people might imitate the movie.Possibly Causing The "Producers/ Important People" a lot of lawsuits.(You know how crazy the world is today and how people will sue over anything.) Well, OK thats sort of believable. But this isn't coming from a professional either, just a blockbuster employee yall, remember that.2.B. Another story i heard was that it did come out in the movies, except it didn't get much attention because it wasn't released everywhere, it was a "limited release", (meaning only playing at limited theaters) and also there was not much advertising or promotion for it. ya know, and i also heard that they might have had a short budget too.I've had enough, this movie is an all time monster! its the king of kings! I'm new here, so I'm just getting started, i plan on writing reviews for almost every movie! if you have my tastes and feelings on movies, then list me as one of your friends, if i find someone out there that has my tastes and feelings then I'm putting you as one of my friends, this way, if i see you rated a movie good, and i haven't seen it, then i will know to check it out!</fullReview>

This work of art, should be shown to every student in the world.So in closing, if you ask the question "which movie is better, The Boondock Saints or any other movie made" The answer will always be The Boondock Saints.

		<shortDescription>Natural Born Killers with a moral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tale of two Irish Brothers that decide to make justice the good old fashion way (blowing the enemy away) is a really good surprise. The script is nicely written, it features Willem Dafoe as the cop that arrives at the place where every massacre by the Boondock Saint's took place. And he tries to understand what happened and the spectator follows him as we are shown what happened as Dafoe speaks. Like in Natural Born Killers by Oliver Stone, the killers become popular by the media, but they're different from Mickey and Mallory and their random acts of violence since they mainly attack the mafia (the bad guys and not just anyone). It's nice to see a movie that provides a "fun" and effective solution against organized crime. It's an impressive debut for Director Troy Duffy, it's original, entertaining and well developed. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel, and I hope It'll live up to the high standards set by the first one.</fullReview>

It's so meaningful for the characters, I was sucked in, I was in a trance watching what they would do next. And the last bit was so strongly acted, and the integrity behind their actions made it hard for me to tear my eyes away from the screen. I thought the acting was tremendous, especially William Defoe.

		<fullReview>Well lets get down to brass tacks, this aint winning any Oscars, but everyone i know that has seen this has absolutely loved it . Basically this is a cheap film, it looks like it was made with the same budget as straight to TV drama, but that's where the similarities end. Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery play two Irish brothers who turn vigilantes to rid Boston of street scum and gangsters, yes they have the worst Irish accents since Darby O 'Gill but they work well together and add a believable stupidity and at times a very funny side to this dark film. The pearl of this movie is Willem Defoe, he absolutely steals the show and gives it that something extra His performance is simply brilliant, his character is a sharp witted F.B.I will have you memorised by his sheer magnetism. There are times when his delivery of lines will have you splitting with laughter, especially when he's giving his fellow agents some samples of his sarcasm.This humour backed up with a very strange supporting cast that includes Comedian Billy Connolly, Ron Jeremy and the excellent Davis Della Rocco which adds up to one of the most entertaining films I've seen in ages. I know they will make a sequel and make a complete mess of it but judging by the cult following the film is getting,people can't wait for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a fan of violent movies, stylized action, off beat plots and dark humour you are going to love this film. The story follows two Irish lads in Boston who believe that God has sent them to kill mobsters. They are pursued by a camp brilliant FBI agent (played excellently by Willem Defoe). Gun fights, visions, glorious music and cop-villain drama plays out in a surreal and often darkly hilarious world. Imagine Tarantino crossed with David Lynch. For those with eclectic tastes this is a must see. Willem Defoe deserves an Oscar for his role. It raises important moral questions on the issue of using violence to fight violence. But you will be loving the action too much to worry about that thorny issue for long. The musical combination of Catholic psalms and excerpts from opera (La Boheme) is sublime. It is quite simply a brilliant tour-de-force of movie making. Go see it! Now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is unique and intriguing, yet one that touches a familiar yearning in everyone. Mixing Catholicism and Irish American culture with elements of a detective story and a call for justice and reform, Boondock Saints speaks to the inherent flaws of our justice system as well as the inherent moral conflict in individuals of justice vs. law, two concepts whose interests aren't always aligned.Character. This film presents a variety of interesting characters, charismatic and intriguing in their own way, from the brothers with a mission from God to the detective with a moral dilemma. The movie does a good job of creating well rounded characters.I love the constant mix of intense chant music. Each scene is played out as a true work of art with the balance of music, atmosphere, story, and humor.Humor - very well done and carried out throughout the film without detracting from the substance of the plot or the message. None of the humor is cheesy, obnoxious, or overly perverse. This film rises above such things.The action is also very well done, making each scene feel unique and interesting, rather than simply mundane explosions and shootings that every film has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First - what is this film really about? Towards the end of the last century, only two cities in America had an "Irish mob", Boston and Brooklyn, and Brooklyn's was fading fast, caught up in smuggling in easily identifiable illegal aliens and smuggling guns back to an IRA that's no longer even all that popular in the north.. During the 1980s, an enterprising FBI agent got it in his head that the way to contain the Italian mob in Boston (which was still strong on the docks) was to pay the South Boston Irish mob to rub them out. The scheme not only proved ineffective, but surfaced publicly and created quite a scandal. Several films were made about it; besides this one, the only other film loosely derived from the event that I've seen is "Southie". Most of these films - including this one, have taken an odd tact - they have concerned themselves largely with two questions: First, what does it mean to be "Irish American" in the post-modern era, when no American gives a damn about Irish ancestry anymore; and second, what is the difference between Irish Catholicism and Italian Catholicism, as found in the underworld, which, after all, suffers from a want of morality all together.Those who've seen "GoodWill Hunting" will recognize the first question. Although the second question seems completely off the wall, it should still ring a few bells - remember "Road to Perdition"? How about Ray Iotta's character in "Goodfellas" (he's never a 'made-man' to the mob because he's half-Irish)? Troy Duffy has made this second issue central and made the first dependent on it - what remains of Irish-American culture is derived from Irish Catholicism (this, by the way, is a very Irish view on the matter). However, being an Irish Catholic in America inevitably involves a certain amount of apostasy - i.e., transgressive skepticism - which, for every Irish American boy leads through a phase of a profound sense of undefinable guilt - God probably doesn't exist, but he's still judging us anyway. Eventually, there are only two ways to wrench one's self out of this guilt - through art or through laughter. Duffy is clearly using both.What Duffy has done is to take Irish Catholicism, sent it back to its roots in the later Dark Ages, dragged it through all kinds of post-modern angst (represented largely by Dafoe, but discoverable at virtually every turn), and resurrected it as an allegory of Christ's Passion represented as tale of Medieval knights in navy pea-coats with guns.Whew! But this explains why someone like myself, hardly an adolescent "fanboy", might actually like this film. The ironies are so rich, and so deeply embedded with history, that there's always some new twist on the ancient myths turning up at every moment. And the complete disjunction between the ancient myths and the post-modern world in which they appear creates a tension that cannot be resolved in the film itself, but must be left with the audience as a question.A violent funny gut-wrenching and disturbing film; a fine farewell to the last century, even if it bodes not well for the new.(Oh, and what IS the difference between Irish Catholicism and Italian Catholicism in the criminal underworld? In the old Irish ghettos you either became a priest, a cop, or a drunk; and later your mom made you feel bad for not becoming one of the other two. In the old Italian ghettos you became a drunken priest and shot the cop. Later your mom made you lasagna.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boondock Saints is the MOST AWESOME of Movies, it is just phenomenal in its portrayal of the ideal of Killing for good. God had an Angel of death, and these two brothers, Irish Cathlic none-the-less, find that God has chosen them to be his dealer of death in this movie, and there is the complexity of once someone kills, be it for good or evil, that one becomes evil. Thou shalt not Kill. But EVIL people need to die, it's really that simple... I firmly agree with the movie, however a "scale" of evil is never truly placed... there is a line, its boundaries are vague "we urge you lesser forms of filth to not push the boundaries into our domain true corruption." If in fact death is dealt to those that are evil, so that they may come to be judged, and they atone their sins with God, who then Exonerates them, it is not an issue of moral rights and wrongs, it is an issue between them and God, and it only reminds me of a scene of Man on Fire with Denzel Washington, when asked "Isn't up to God to Judge men" he responded "Yes, its just up to me to arrange the meeting." I find no faults. Magnificent movie, too bad the sequel never came through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does many things. Some good, some bad. It justifies vigilantism and at the same time swears a lot. Yet it is one of my favorite movies of all time. Some times when others wont stand up for each other someone has to stand up against tyranny. Sometimes it is a local cop. Sometimes it is a preacher. Sometimes it is a child. Sometimes God asks it to be you. That you say.. "no more." That you defend what is right. I do not recommend you do so in the manner depicted in this film. But you don't always have to use guns to stand for what you believe. Just remember that as you watch this film and you will be fine.</fullReview>

William Dafoe was genius in this movie. i never respected him as an actor until now. and I have always loved Sean Patrick Flanery, ever since Powder, but he and Norman Reedus in the movie were as well genius. everyone need to see this movie. I was never a fan of blood and guts, but this movie take it to a whole new level, not a gross out level, but a realistic level. With all the mob work and the brothers gunning them down, i felt like i was watching a real life new cast, it was fantastic. and the credits with the new reporter was talking to people was so real, if this happened in real life people would react the exact same way!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was awesome! It was very funny and looked like it was highly influenced by movies like Pulp Fiction, Desperado, Reservoir Dogs and even the greatest movie ever The Pofessional. Every scene was awesome with things from gun fights to cats getting blown away. The film is full of classic characters like mob errand boy Rocco. Its full of classic lines and great humor.This is a film for people who like violent action films with great wit (Like Pulp Fiction). It also has a terrific performance from William Dafoe.

		<fullReview>Most of you audiences say "Saints" is too similar to Tarrantino's films. Forgive me, but I'm not agree with you anyway. Do you know what is different with "Saints"?First of all, young director of the film (Troy Duffy) is more clever than Tarrantino, I think. At the time his mind power and talent get together, this GREAT film occurred. Film is enough to satisfy anyone whose thoughts are whatever. I mean, you maybe a religious man or an atheist; maybe your whole life is standing on the philosophy of "Carpe Diem" or you are interested on the "art of living"; THIS film will actually satisfy you.According to me the most attractive part of the movie is that: It does NOT force you to believe in ONE WAY which you are supposed to think it's the RIGHT one. Film leaves you free to give your OWN idea on the topic "discussed" at the screen.To me, chosen question to be discussed at the film -about judgment is perfect and the way of director's representing language of this question is genius.If you haven't seen it yet, don't spend time and see it. If you have already seen it, see it again and THINK TWICE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seen this movie for the first time a couple of years ago just by chance on one of the sky movie channels and since must have seen it 100 times.The movie is well written with a lot of black humor scattered about throughout the film. It does try to take itself a little to seriously in places and forgets its a very good and clever action movie and trys to convey a moral message and ask a question about the state of the world and just how right the vengeance of boondock saints actually is. putting this to one side the movie does stir up emotions and i have to admit feeling slightly like buying several big guns and cleaning up my town every time i watch the movie. It affected me enough to get the whole of my back tattooed with an image based on the movie and I'm very proud to say the tattoo can be seen on the official movie site. The film runs in an unusual order that many people compare to Pulp Fiction however it is nothing like you simply see the crime scene before you see what actually happened to cause it this is the best feature of the movie and extremely fun watching agent Smecker trying to work out what the saints had done and who they are. An exceptional movie and well recommended.</fullReview>

I say those people are idiots who cannot use their imaginations to draw conclusions about the characters. The story with right where it should and follows it's course well. There is some very witty humor dashed in with the action, and the good guys triumph in the end (unlike real life).

		<fullReview>Like PULP FICTION, BOONDOCK SAINTS makes a perfect combination of out-n-out violence and out-n-out humor. But in this one, the viewer actually CARES about the McManus brothers (Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery) and roots for them to carry out their plans in cleaning the streets of evil elements!! I loved this one! And truly believe that it deserves a lot of attention that it is not currently getting. And on the subject of deserved attention...BRAVO!BRAVO!BRAVO! to Troy Duffy, the first-time writer and first-time director of this film! He definitely proves that it is possible for a talented unknown to make a great film, without Mainstream HOLLYWOOD's help. If you haven't seen this film...RENT it immediately. You won't regret it! Look for GREAT performances by Flanery, Reedus and Willem Defoe, who plays the rather unusual FBI agent trailing the twins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indulgent Cultism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film was first released it was hated by most critics and did very poorly at the box office . Over the years THE BOONDOCK SAINTS has built up a very loyal cult fan base who adore the film and sung its praises . To be honest I do like vigilante movies where good villains redeem themselves via the use of torture , mutilation and bloody murder against bad villains . It's a rather self limiting genre of course since there's only so many ways you can kill evil people . I thought because of the good word of mouth I might be watching something along the lines of TAXI DRIVER with Celtic accents but after seeing the film just before the festive period I realised I'd just been fed a total turkey Director Troy Duffy knows he's making a cult film and over does it big time . The cops find a couple of bodys down a Boston alleyway and it's not enough for the investigating detective to be some quirky caricature - we need to see FBI fed turn up in slow-mo and steal the scene in a display of over indulgent campness . Willem Defoe does indeed steal the scene and the whole film but this isn't necessarily a good thing because you have to remember that he seems to be doing a bad Gary Oldman impersonation and that there's not much of a film to steal in the first place A lot of people who disliked the film have stated that it seems like a bad Tarantino wannabe . It's true that there's a lot of bad language and much of the humour arises from the language , but it's slightly misleading to dismiss it as being a Taratino clone . PULP FICTION has a similar sort of quirky nature but the overall feel of PULP FICTION is still one of seriousness . In this film it's consciously not serious . In short it's a film impossible to believe in and if you're looking for a modern day TAXI DRIVER you're going to be seriously disappointed</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The justice-seeking vigilante takes a new, ultra-cool form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine Batman and Superman were two Irish Catholics from Boston that sprayed their hapless, costume-free villains with bullets. That's "Boondock Saints," sort of a "Guy Ritchie meets vigilante justice" crime film that relishes in the cool rather than the real. Still, over- the-top as it may be at times, there's no denying "Boondock Saints" both its cool and cult status.Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) are a pair of Irish fraternal twins with unflinching faith and a lot of body art who after an attack on their favorite bar by Russian mobsters on St. Patrick's Day goes awry, realize they can rid Boston of its crime filth, fulfill a religious responsibility and make some money on the side by killing sinners. On their trail is arrogant and borderline crazy FBI detective Paul Smecker (Willam Defoe), known for accurately reconstructing crime scenes (as long as he has his classical music handy).Once the McManus brothers go on their spree, the film takes an interesting approach, showing Smecker go through each crime scene and guess what happened before actually showing you what happened, increasing the suspense and getting across Smecker's frustration with how clean these guys manage to be.Although the plot and style of the film is dominated by the McManus brothers and their not nearly as sharp or morally sound companion Rocco, character-wise, this film belongs to Defoe. In his strongest character maybe ever, Defoe's distinguished and inherently insane features work perfectly for a detective who is so smart he's nearly a lunatic. His performance is nuanced at times and over-the-top at others and while the other over-the-top parts of the film detract a bit from it, Defoe manages to make his ridiculousness work, namely the cool scene where director Troy Duffy films both Defoe constructing the scene and the Saints actually doing all that, together.The film's greatest weakness is that it glorifies the vigilantism of the McManus brothers in a way that detracts from the realism. They become superheroes in almost too much of the sense of the word. Their clean kills and getaways, even their reception by the public (which is more told than shown) seems a bit too far-fetched. Even the symbolism is overdone with the twins' rosaries shaking on the wall pegs or thrashing about as they get beaten. The religious angle is highly controversial, but this is also the point. Never before has religion been a motivating factor in vigilantism in film. Still, the execution is more about style and entertainment than about the real possibility of these figures existing.</fullReview>

This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.It is basically about two Catholic brothers who decide to rid the world of evil by killing bad guys. Yes, it is a simple concept but the director pulls if off nicely. The acting is top notch and there is enough action to keep the movie interesting. The only complaint i have as far as acting is Ron Jeremy. I think he looks funny in that role and it is hard to take him seriously.

		<fullReview>I truly enjoyed this movie, though I thought I wouldn't. My friend made me watch it and I am so glad she did. The story of the two brothers never stops feeling connected, no matter how much blood is shed, the result being a good mixture of anger, violence, humor and a strong bond.The humor in the movie is as funny as the action is packed. The movie follows two brothers in New York who decide after spending a night in jail that they have a mission to rid the city of it's evil, ie, the crime lords. They do this in an entertaining and violent manner. I must admit, their friend bothers me, but he does have some of the funniest lines in the movie, so I forgive him. Close behind the brothers is an outwardly gay cop whose antics are halfway between genius and loony, though they honestly seem a cross between the two. At one point, he directs a symphony at a crime scene to show how it could have gone down.In the end, the message in the film is a good, though-provoking one. Should citizens be allowed to take law in their own hand, even if it is in an effective way? See the movie for the creativity, see the movie for the acting, see it for the action or the plot. It doesn't really matter, just see it.</fullReview>

So he let me borrow it, and I didn't give it back for about a week or so. I absolutely loved it. It raises a good point, has great characters/actors and it is just a well plotted and well performed movie. It's entertaining and exhilarating at the same time. This is a movie that I watch over and over again and never get tired of it. Someone posted that this is a testosterone film and for guys only, I totally disagree. I'm a chick. I like chick flicks too. BUT, this has to be one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time, so it really isn't a man-movie. My advice to people who haven't seen this, if someone you know talks about this movie: GO SEE IT! rent it, buy it, whatever, just go watch this.

Star Wars was a good film, The Matrix was a good film, The Lord of the Rings was a good film, etc? You see, you don't need to be realistic to tell a good story.Two brothers who are fed up with the scum running around doing whatever they want decide they will be the lesser of two evils and spill the blood of the corrupt of society. A better moral plot has yet to be developed in any movie.I believe the end of the movie summed up exactly why this movie is either hated or loved. When interviewing people on the street half of the people supported the "Saints" and what they were doing while the other half felt they were nothing more than criminals themselves. To the lovers of this movie; I, like you, will continue to watch this movie frequently. To the haters of this movie; I will still continue to watch this movie frequently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know Troy Duffy sucks at life. But give credit where credit is due: he came out with a great movie, and this movie has earned a score reserved for the likes Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.The premise of this movie, first off, was very interesting. I like how it took on the issue of vigilantism and the blurry line between the law and taking the law into your own hands. It was a very thoughtful concept and a very impressive working ground for this film to base itself on.The acting, secondly, was pretty good. I wouldn't say every actor gave a powerhouse performance, but Willem Dafoe absolutely MADE this movie. He really took over his role with body gestures, tone, and grace. The two brothers were OK at their roles, not great, but enough to do the job. Unlike most people, I really thought the guy who played Rocco did a great job too. He did overact sometimes, but looking back at when he's telling the joke to Yakavetta, he made that scene what it was.In addition to a solid acting performance, it was assisted by good writing. Call Troy Duffy whatever you want, but he wrote a very well rounded film that blended comedy, action, and emotion. Me and my friends use some of these lines on a daily basis now. This script really carried this movie more than anything else.The soundtrack and soundtrack were also impressive. The opening track, The Blood Of Cuchulainn, is one of my favorite songs, period. I was very impressed with the way Duffy blended the epic soundtrack, the slow motion techniques, and camera placement. It really couldn't have been better the way it was shot and accompanied. Also, a nice bonus was the street interview ending. Absolutely brilliant placement.Three Good things about this Movie 1. Willem Dafoe was absolutely wonderful 2. Loads of fun little cult one-liners to say amongst your friends 3. It took its issue and really dealt with it Three Bad Things about this Movie 1. The two actors that played the brothers could have been a bit better 2. You didn't get a good hold on how much of a monster Il Duce actually was. 3. There were a couple scenes you kind of couldn't pick up what exactly was being said. Overall, a 10. I don't care what anyone else says about it. This movie was an absolutely great film and one of my personal favorites that I'd recommend to anyone not afraid of a little blood. Take care, guys."Hey Greenly.

The juxtaposition of the scenes of action and exposition are played beautifully, and actually make the movie more fun -- for example, as the police try to figure out what happened and decide on a theory, we flashback to what actually happened.Second, it is acted beautifully. Perhaps with a script as good as this, it's easier, I don't know. My only experience with a script half as good as this is was on stage, and nothing I could have done could have messed up the character of Doc O'Connor (in "The Laramie Project" FYI... and yes, Buscemi played it better...). Billy Connolly (sp?) is amazing. My only other views of him before this came in "Lemony Snicket..." and on a "Daily Show" interview promoting his new comedy act. The brothers played their parts wonderfully, in fact nearly in synchronization. I in fact asked my friend how long she suspected they rehearsed that relationship to get it just right.Third, the morals. I believe whole-heartedly in the messages of this movie. Yes, not message, messages. To reveal them here would ruin the movie for those of you who have not seen it.Suffice it to say, this movie is awesome. I hate to sound like a teenage dumbass, but you can't quite gather how good of a movie this is until you see it.If I had to go negative, the only bad thing I can think of is that it is too short. I'd like to see more about the relationship between Il Duce and the brothers, among other things. But, at the moment, having just finished the movie, I can't think of anything else to go negative about.YOU SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was one of the best films I have ever seen. The theatrical talent displayed in this movie was astounding thinking back on that they couldn't get funding. The is truly an exciting film with a bit of controversy in taking law into your own hands. It shows a complete understanding of what the fans want and need to be entertained. The film will twist your mind at the end making you decide what you think of the issue brought up in the movie. It also has just the right mix of violence and drugs that it makes you think; did i just watch a political action movie. This movie is truly the most astonishing action I have ever seen and definitely one of the three best movies I have ever seen bested only by Crash and maybe Remember the Titans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie You Never Heard Of.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boondock Saints" was an amazing film. I myself have never even heard of it until I had multiple people recommend it to me. It was as good as they said it was. It has a really great story line about two young Irish brothers in Boston who get into a bar fight with some Russian gangsters at a local pub. Afterwards they have a revelation and feel that they were called upon by God to clean up the city and rid them of these gangsters, thugs, pimps, etc. Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery have great chemistry with each other and excel in their roles. William Dafoe who is the detective after them, not realizing they are the ones killing all of these criminals plays an awesome character. He is very smart yet crazy at the same time. The supporting cast (which includes the infamous Ron Jeremy) are masterful in their small parts also. The filming of this movie is what I liked about it the most. Instead of showing the brothers killing everyone at the time it takes place, we are first lead to the crime scene after the fact and relive it through Dafoe's analysis. It is interesting because sometimes there will be multiple ways of showing what took place as they try and figure it out from the clues left behind. There are a lot of action moments, funny moments, and even emotional ones as this film is very well balanced. With great acting and a great script, I think many people will like this film, even if you aren't into the whole detective/gangster scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first Boondock saints is about two Irish boys who take the law in their own hands and kill all the scum in their home town. In this perfectly acted movie the acting takes the movie to the next level. This movie is exactly how you want to see it when you read about the subject and even more artistic and really sick making. The next boon-dock saints is about the dad of this two boys that were raised for higher purposes. He started their "work" and now the three of them are continuing to judge and kill the villains of new York. Might they expand to the international crime scene in part three? I hope so if the actors stay genuine and the acting remains as great as it is now!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that there's anything wrong with that... Lots of stuff in the screenplay did not quite make sense. You really have to suspend your disbelief in order to appreciate "The Boondock Saints". I disagree that the film glorifies violence and vigilance. It shows both sides of the coin, as I believe another viewer said. Furthermore, during the end credits, the people who thought the Saints were as bad as the criminals were just as many as the Saints' "followers". I really like the idea of the film. As silly, gory, and violence-driven as this flick is, it makes you think: about what kind of person you are, about whether or not you would do the same things if you got a chance, whether you approve of this type of "justice", etc. The cinematography was spectacular and I loved the dialogue.On to the acting now... As always, Willem Dafoe is excellent. He really shines compared to the pedestrian acting by just about everyone else. Dafoe's whole gay-bashing thing was really amusing. And I enjoy Billy Connolly everywhere I see him. Ron Jeremy... He can't act but at least I was glad he kept his clothes on this time.As a whole, I loved "The Boondock Saints" but I probably would have hated it if I couldn't stand violence. With a more coherent script, it would have been a 10. I give it a 9, realizing I may have been a bit too generous.</fullReview>

The 1st time i saw the film was this winter holiday, and after renting it; I bought the film because it was so damn good. I enjoyed this films' message and I could relate to these guys very easily. Hell I'm 75 percent Irish, very familiar with Boston since i have much family there, and i go to Boston quite a bit... I can relate too these guys "Killing for the greater good" what a better message? Such a shame this film did not make it into theaters because of Columbine... It would have been interesting to see the reactions of people if this film were released nationwide.Not opening up in theaters took away the fame from this movie.... it would have been greater than it is now. Even if this film were to be torn apart by by the box office, like a handful of individuals are doing so in these boards... the film would have gotten all the recognition it deserved rather it be good or bad.. The extreme views on this film would have attracted many others to go out and check the film out for themselves... Thus creating a huge box office hit.Boondocks got robbed by a tragedy.. how Unfourtunate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was one of those ones that really surprised me. I had seen it a few times in the Movie Store, but I had never bothered to rent it. One day I headed to a friend's house, and that was the movie that we were going to watch. 15 minutes into it, I had become another fan. This movie is brilliant, with some of the most original characters that I've ever seen. Il Duce, the hit-man, was one of those, with his 6 guns. Paul Smecker, the homosexual FBI Agent, was another great addition to the cast. Rocco, and of course, the McManus brothers, were a load of fun to watch as well. Another thing that I loved was the action sequences. These are very well done, and above all, original; the scene in the strip club where Rocco executes the two guys in the booths; just watch it and you'll see what I mean. This is an amazing debut for Troy Duffy. "The Boondock Saints" is a movie that has been slammed for its vigilantism, but the reality is that all of the guys that the brothers and Rocco kill are men that we have all, at some time or another, fantasized about doing likewise to. Despite my above praise, this is certainly not a movie for those under 15, at least. There's almost 250 f words, and the movie is pretty ultraviolet. Still, if you don't mind continuous profanity, and brutal violence, and enjoy original, hilarious action movies, this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoiler alert((( The Irish brothers Connor and Murphy live and work in Boston. Having the feeling of that God gave them the mission to get rid of all evil in the city. Becoming "Saints" after killing a couple of Russian mobsters, they set out to complete the mission. Having FBI Agent Smecker on their neck, who admits that the boys are doing exactly what he's always secretly wishing for, cause what they are doing is right eh? Connor and Murphy risking their lives for beliefs of Veritas and Aequitas...THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a pretty freaking good action movie! Having the fabulous acting of Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the two brothers and Williem Dafoe as the FBI Agent. The action scenes are truly violent and stuff, and this adds the truly spectacle of the movie's pretty bold messages. Having all evil men killed is a pretty heavy mission after all! The theme song is truly great, fine Irish melody rolling as the credits starts appearing. The pure - cool brothers wearing black coates and sunglasses and this cheap trousers makes them so realistic, gives the movie a very down-on-Earth aspect. The religious content and especially the brilliant finale. "Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace"The movie was a huge pleasent surprise that off course never got a lot of media discussion, but the movie is truly a little masterpiece. Great scenes like the brothers hanging in a rope while firing maniac around them, killing man after man. And we've got David Della Rocco who plays the character with the same name, who's truly a insane, hairy guy that teams up with the brothers. You feel they're doing the right thing, but in the same time you feel guilty about it because it's truly a brutal way of scoring justice. Dafoe is also great as the gay-inspired Agent Smecker that really is fascinated by the team. The pure brutality, great soundtrack and the surprisingly fine acting makes this movie one of the finest of 1999. THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a really great movie, no doubt about it! Having the Irish f**k-asses killed is a totally new consept, and having it succeeding like this is truly a joy watching. Sequel on its way. STARS: 4-5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two boys that work in a factory, and live in a shut down building are attacked by some russian mobsters they got in a bar fight with the night before (St. Patricks day). They chain one to the toilet, and take the other down into the street to shoot him in the head. These brothers are very closely knit, so the chained down brother struggles, and ends up pulling up the toilet, walking out to the roof holding it, and throws it down onto the head of the one of the mobster that was going to shoot his brother, instantly killing him. Then he jumps down 5 stories to land on the other mobster. They voluntarily come into the police station for questioning, and explain the whole thing. The cops let them loose since it was self defense, and let them sleep in a cell overnight. The next day they get a page on the pager they stole from the mobster. They call the number and the person on the phone tells them to go to where all the heads of the russian mobs are meeting. They decide to kill the rest of the russian mob. They put a plan together, and go to an underground dealer of guns. They trade in everything they have, and sneak into the building and drop down from the vents. They get snagged on the rope that one of the brothers got, much in protest of the other. They hang upside down, and just start shooting. They kill everyone in the room with little effort. This is just the beginning of a wonderfully violent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting, Hilarious, Subversive, but Worth Watching Twice Or More!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bartender turned director Troy Duffy's contemporary action melodrama "The Boondocks Saints" bears all the influences of Quentin Tarantino with its ultra-violent shoot-outs, use of profanity, over-the-top situations, fractured time lines and gallery of memorable characters. Two multi-lingual Irish lads from South Boston awaken one day after they hear the Lord tell them to hit the vigilante trail. Actually, despite its far-fetched storyline, "The Boondocks Saints" spouts the message that evil flourishes only when good men look the other way. Duffy hammers this theme home in an early scene when the minister recaps the real-life tragedy of Kitty Genovese. In 1964, Genovese was raped and murdered near her home while thirteen eyewitnesses cowered in either fear or indifference to her plight back and did not intervene. Consequently, "The Boondocks Saints" advocates vigilantism. Unfortunately, whatever credibility that Duffy generates for his message is obliterated by those kinetically staged gunfights, rampant profanity, and the melodramatic plot twists. Basically, "The Boondocks Saints" is a beer &amp; pizza saga that shows some tolerance for homosexuality because one of its chief characters?an erudite FBI agent?is gay but not gay is an over-the-top way. Sadly, this independently produced actioneer got lost in the politics of its day. According to Duffy, the Columbine massacre prompted the distributors to curb release of the film because of its violent fare. The heroes?who perform primarily good deeds?dress in black like the Columbine gunmen and wipe out Russian mobsters galore. Nevertheless, this ranks as first-rate entertainment if you enjoy gritty gunplay, provocative characters, and some surreal staging. People who love cats may not enjoy "The Boondocks Saints" because a cat is accidentally shot and splattered like a tomato against a wall. Of course, the actual cat was never harmed, but some cat lovers cannot differentiate between reality and illusion so this film may leave a dire taste in their mouths.The Cold War has concluded and Russian criminals have migrated to America and the Russian syndicate is buying up property in Boston, much to the chagrin of some leaseholders, like poor old Doc (Gerard Parkes of "Short Circuit 2") a barkeeper afflicted with Tourette's syndrome who runs McGinty's Bar. The patrons are celebrating Saint Patrick's Day when three imposing big bruisers, among them Ivan Checkov (Scott Griffith), walk in to lay down the law and encounter the McManus twins, Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery of "The Suicide Kings" ) and Murphy (Norman Reedus of "Deuces Wild"), who precipitate a barroom brawl with them. They tied the biggest Russian to the bar and set his butt on fire. The next day two of the Russians, including burnt butt, barge into their apartment. They handcuff Connor to a toilet and threaten to kill Murphy. Connor rips out the toilet?possible but not likely?and goes to the roof and drops it on the biggest Russian and saves his brother from certain death. FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe of "Platoon") launches an investigation because he is part of the Organized Crime Task Force. Smecker hooks himself up to his portable CD player, pops on his disposable gloves, and analyzes the crime scene to the strains of classic composer Puccini's operatic La boh?me. Although the chronology of the scene is fractured like a Tarantino bloodbath, Duffy appears to invoke the kind of cross-cutting that worked so well for Hong Kong director John Woo so that we get to see both the crime and the analysis of the crime. Later, when Smecker presents the details of the crime to his colleagues, he is in the same shot with our heroes when they perform their community service. Our heroes give themselves up and Smecker lets them go and informs the Boston press that they killed the Russians in self-defense. Later, our heroes hear voices and believe that the Lord wants them to destroy evil men. The MacManus brothers receive help from one of their loony friends, David Della 'Roc (David Della 'Roc' of "Jake's Corner"), who serves as an errand boy of sorts for the Boston mob. He provides our heroes with all the information that they need to start wiping out mobsters with extreme prejudice. Roc is the crazy one of the bunch and he lacks the focus of the MacManus twins. Meanwhile, Smecker investigates each convoluted crime scene and shows the Boston Police, particularly the three detectives on the case, Dolly (David Ferry), Duffy (Brian Mahoney) and Greenly (Bob Marley), why he is such a genius. By now, our heroes have become 'saints' in the newspapers, and they obtain a cache of silenced automatic pistols with which to carry out their work. When they ice top-level hoods, Connor and Murphy utter a prayer while they have their victim on his knees and shoot him through the back of the head so that their bullets exit through the eye sockets. Afterward, they place pennies on the dead man's eyes. Each execution gets wilder and crazier until the mobsters catch up with them. Meanwhile, Smecker has so underestimated the MacManus brothers that he never imagines what they have been doing until Roc loses a finger during a shoot-out and he connects them with Roc. By this time, the mob has declared war on them."The Boondocks Saints" is for action-oriented film fans who know they are only watching a movie. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are perfectly cast as brothers and they kindle a lot of charisma as vigilantes in the tradition of Charles Bronson from the "Death Wish" movies. Make no mistake, however, Willem Dafoe and David Della 'Roc' steal the show. Close behind them in his peripheral role is Gerard Parkes who has only a couple of scenes, but he is unforgettable, especially with his use of the F-bomb and the A-word followed in rapid succession. Mind you, "The Boondocks Saints" is not remotely believable, but it is a terrific, entertaining, action-packed opus with colorful character, blue dialogue, and Duffy's imaginative staging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and blunt movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 90s can almost be defined as a slew of zany action comedy movies with quirky fast-talking characters. Tarantino and Ritchie stand out as possibly the most lasting of the filmmakers operating under this style, but The Boondock Saints, I've found, has some real legs in terms of how long its lasted as a cult product.If Tarantino is screwball, this movie is definitely slapstick. Most of it is nearly all physical humor. The playful narrative structure going back and forth through time is also used to create probably one of the greatest sight gags in cinematic history, as the action is presented while Willem Dafoe's FBI investigator pantomimes it in the same frames. Definitely some classic set-ups, and if Duffy had Sayles and Powell in mind while he was filming it, I gotta give him a pat on the back for parody.As for the story, though, it's a little strange. This is definitely a movie for the pure blissful entertainment of it, so I know it's not trying to make any, for instance, deep statement on the act of vigilantism. However, it's still a little disturbing. Each character in some way has to go through a moral crisis in understanding the vigilantism occurring--except for the vigilantes themselves. The two Irish brothers are essentially Superman--their characters need not and do not change, everyone else apparently has to adjust to them. Again, I know that the concerns of the movie are not such that this is an issue for the script, but for me I found it a little weird. I'm just sayin', is all.Otherwise, it's a comforting movie in its lack of subtlety. Everyone speaks with exaggerated accents as becomes their character, you get to see David Della Rocco go postal, and you get fire-y action with equally as rapid-fire back-and-forth dialog. Sweet! --PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boondock Saints, might just be the greatest action "gore" ( If I may call it that ), film out there, i've seen a lot of movies, and judging them compared to this one is tough, Boondock Saints is the one movie where violent mind-numbing action takes on humour and actually makes THE movie of the year, the main actors are low-class, simple Irish boys, turning into high-class a**kicking ones, just with the help of this film! So what does really make Boondock Saints good? The environment, the landscape, the music, the fact that they are IRISH, the accent just makes it even more perfect, I could not see this movie in any other way, Sean Patrick and Norman Reedus dominates the movie together with David Della Rocco(which is a tremendously good actor). Billy Connoly (Il Duce) has a shrunken role in the movie, yet he succeeds on the screen with his grief attitude and style. You will have to look for a better action-movie than this one! I dare to promise you two hours of joy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seldom if ever have I heard of anyone disliking this movie. Only the language puts it over the edge for some people. The moral message is unmistakable, and it even highlights the very real problems we are currently facing in our judicial system. The action is great. Your typical "shoot-em-up" element is very much there, but mixed with a comic premise (which is also very much there), it becomes 10x better than either of those elements alone. The only element present in the film with which I disagree is the allegorical. Even as "typical" Irish-Catholic brothers, I didn't think it was best to show them getting drunk, cussing, and smoking all through the movie. This is not to say that I think killing people is any more or less "christian," or that I disagree with a "christian" element in the film entirely. I am only saying that given the set of circumstances, their "mission" could have stood alone without casting the brothers in a bad light of their own.</fullReview>

The casting for this movie was above par if you ask me, the detective was so good at what he did. There are so many good lines to recite and say over and over again from that movie alone. The way the brothers have so much love for one another, just shows that family does come first. They definitely showed that they will do anything for one another, even if it means dying. This movie had everything in it, drama, comedy, suspense, and violence, which I think make a great movie. There's another thing from that movie that blew me away and that was the music. The music that was chosen for it was perfect and you couldn't get any better then the music they had. Catch you on the flip side!</fullReview>
