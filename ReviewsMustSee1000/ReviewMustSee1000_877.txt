		<shortDescription>A memorable, tragic story with roots in reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is such a fascinating film that it made worthwhile a little research into the dance marathon craze of the 1920s and early 1930s. According to the DVD extra, the set was modeled on the old Aragon Ballroom, built in the 1920s on the Lick Pier at Santa Monica, California. The once-elegant ballroom had grown seedy by the early 1950s, at which time it enjoyed a brief revival as the location of early Lawrence Welk show broadcasts. In the 1960s, the Aragon was again revamped under a different name as a short-lived rock concert venue - with appearances by Alice Cooper (is his pre-Cooper days) and Jim Morrison of the Doors. It was destroyed by fire shortly afterward.Marathon dancing was, according to most historians, as brutal and exploitive as it is depicted in "Horses." It was for that reason that this early 20th century variety of Roman coliseum culture was banned in much of the country by the late 1930s.This movie uses fictitious characters to tell a story that appears to be remarkably accurate from a historical point of view. Jane Fonda's ultra-cynical, sharp-tongued character, Gloria, along with ruthless manager/promoter Rocky (played by Gig Young), contrast perfectly with the eerily-resigned and unpretentious Robert (Michael Serrazin). The casting and dialogue are brilliant. The visual effects are haunting.This film is not for everyone. But for those interested in the social pathology that allows human suffering to become a form of amusement, the malicious ill-treatment of the poor, or the harsh realities of the depression era, this is multifaceted cinema that can be watched again and again, each time yielding new subtleties. It is a morbidly fascinating character study that reflects a truly desperate time.For those watching on DVD, it is advisable to see the short background feature before the movie in order to fully appreciate its context. The movie is unforgettable, a true classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People as Expendable Cattle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this movie's only moment of deadpan black humor, a nurse asks Gloria Beatty (Jane Fonda) after an exhausting dance session that has lasted nearly 1,000 hours, "Can I get you something for your feet?" Her response, as black as night, is, "How about a saw?" Taken out of context, her retort would inspire at least a barf of nervous laughter -- comic relief mirroring the temporary relief that particular something would give Gloria. But knowing the fury that her character has, this dissatisfaction with life in general, it wouldn't be a far stretch to see her amputate her feet right off and be done with it as the band plays on and Gig Young herds his cattle into mindless motion, for a promise of a little over one grand as a prize. She has nothing, she expects nothing -- and this is her last exit to a better life.Such is the heroine of Horace McCoy's novel of the same name, which appeared in 1935 and told a story so lurid it could not possibly be true: that of the horror of dance marathons in which people down on their luck danced for interminable hours with brief "rest periods" no longer than 15 minutes, and all for free food and money. The ultimate price to pay for an era of abundance turned inside out into the belly of the beast the Depression Era was. All the time while Ginger and Fred danced under the stars and brought Hollywood magic to their eyes, all false promises. The greater irony is that its plot is set right at the edge of the world: the West, where dreams have been known to come true, especially for aspiring actors looking for their Big Break. That it was written by someone who was himself in the fringes is only fitting: some of the more effective stories come from people at the edges of society.In a tone similar to Hubert Selby's REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, several characters are caught under the wheels of the American Dream and the need to escape the rampant poverty that had the nation under a vise. Dancing with Gloria are Robert Syverton (Michael Sarrazin), who seems to have committed a crime which makes this a story told in extensive flashbacks; Alice LeBlanc (Susannah York), who with partner Joel (Robert Fields) aspired to be a star; Ruby (Bonnie Bedelia) and James (Bruce Dern), a young married couple expecting their first child; and the Sailor (Red Buttons), a veteran of dance marathons. Rocky (Gig Young), the emcee, holds the ultimate poker card as to who will win this coveted prize and has the morals of a two-dollar bill.What neither of them begin to suspect is that there is no light at the end of this tunnel. Rocky, the emcee, as corrupt as he is, is the only one who knows the final outcome and plays the game and each contestant until many of them literally fall dead... or worse, become raving lunatics moving for the sake of moving. Like the quick fix that the characters of REQUIEM were hooked on, he is just that to these people who soon progress from dancers full of life to zoned-out zombies in one horrific shot where we see their reflections through shards of broken glass, their eyes staring, looking at nothing, as they shuffle about in mock-dancing. Alice will lose her dreams and turn into a shell of her former self: a scene in which she tries to seduce Robert is painful, especially when it happens right by a picture of an actress she emulates, Jean Harlow. Gloria will become even more bitter, and a sense of Hell on Earth will be the dominant feeling once the stakes become higher. And throughout it all, the dance.But if the dancing in itself is punishing, nothing can account or compare to the two horrifying sequences where all of the contestants must race around the ballroom and avoid at all costs at being the last three couples, grounds for elimination. The first of them runs for the entire duration of its ten minutes and is a reverse chariot sequence in BEN HUR: instead of chariots, there are desperate people -- one of them, Ruby, is seven months pregnant -- and instead of a whip we have the emcee. It is interminable, and hits home at just how inhuman this contest is. The second one is even more terrible: the unforgettable image of Jane Fonda dragging the Sailor behind her back, a symbolic horse trying to remain in the game.THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? comes with a heavy dose of nihilism that would be the tone set throughout the Seventies and in many ways, it can be said that Seventies cinema began in 1969 with this and with MIDNIGHT COWBOY, both films about the underbelly of society. Every performance in the movie is on-target including that of Michael Sarrazin who is looks like a non-entity but is more the chewed-up remains of the dream machine. Sydney Pollack uses a number of flashy techniques appropriate of the time -- flashcuts, stylized sequences that seem out of a narrative structure -- and in doing so has created his own masterpiece. Timeless, the story of human exploitation is even more relevant today with the advent of reality game shows like Fear Factor and its self-degrading contestants. It's an ugly portrayal of us as a society, willing to partake in the spectacle of seeing people worse than we are acting little more than animals destined for carnage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Grisly, Sickly Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brutally bleak screen adaptation of the pulpy Horace McCoy novella, about a Depression-era dance marathon where down-and-outers drive themselves to the brink of exhaustion to win the cash prize.This film has become relevant again today in the age of reality T.V., where people tune in to watch strangers be humiliated, rejected and made fun of. Meanness and suffering sells today, and apparently it sold back then as well. The M.C. of the dance marathon, played wonderfully by Gig Young in one of his last (if not the last) film performances before the troubled actor murdered his wife and then killed himself, creates little narratives and dramas around each of the dancers, so that the audience can have their favorites to root for. Every once in a while, someone will show off a special talent, singing a song or hoofing a little dance number, and the audience will throw change at them, which the performer then frantically scrabbles up like a desperate pigeon. The cast of dancers is led by Jane Fonda, in a break-out role as Gloria, the jaded woman-of-the-world who's seen it all and doesn't want to see anymore; Susannah York, as a pretentious wannabe actress, who acts up a storm during a mesmerizing breakdown scene; Red Buttons, as an aging ex-serviceman who struggles to keep up with the young kids around him; and Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia, as a sweet couple of country bumpkins who are desperate to win the cash for their unborn baby. And yes, that is Al Lewis (aka Grandpa Munster) lurking around in the background as one of the dance marathon officials.Director Sydney Pollack vastly improves on the source material, making something much richer and deeper out of McCoy's lurid novella. He uses an edgy, jarring style that's suited perfectly to the material, and which he would never again display."They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" holds a sort of grisly fascination over its audience. Bleak as it is, it's also entertaining in a rather morbid way, making us feel like we're members of the audience watching this sick spectacle and making it that much harder for us to condemn the film audience without labeling ourselves as hypocrites.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard To Watch, But A Memorable Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie in the theater over 35 years ago, I found it very interesting and one of those movies you don't forget about an hour after you leave the theater. This was a haunting type of story, especially when my folks, who went with me, informed me that these marathon type of dance contests really did happen. The characters might have been fictional, but not story of these awful contests.Jane Fonda plays the central character, "Gloria Beatty," an angry-at-the-world and profane woman who certainly has a cynical attitude. It almost echoed her real-life persona at the time, but I won't go there. I was more fascinated with Gig Young's performance in this film as the ruthless dance promoter - emcee "Rocky." To me - and Academy Award voters - his performance stands out among all the others, even though everyone does an outstanding job. That includes director Sydney Pollack, who had only made a few movies until this one.The deep cast in this film did not include big-name stars but they were known celebrities: actors like Michael Sarrazin, Susannah York, Red Buttons, Bonnie Bedalia, Bruce Dern and Al Lewis.This is a sad tale of desperate people in desperate times trying to make a few extra bucks during the Great Depression years. Dancing in pairs, they literally risked their health by trying to stay on their feet by dancing longer than every other couple. One became mentally exhausted just watching these poor people on screen trying to survive these "marathons."Like a lot of movies which deal with unpleasant topics, this is a haunting film that will leave you thinking about it for a long time afterward. I can't say I enjoyed watching it the second time around, on VHS - Fonda's nastiness too much to take - but I certainly wouldn't discourage anyone from watching this movie. It's a story about an unique event in American history guaranteed to be one you won't forget.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY? This movie stays in the memory, partly because it stands out from other mainstream Hollywood products of its time in subject matter (the dance marathons of the 20s and 30s) and tone (pitilessly and harshly negative; even the humor is bleak). The message: life (the marathon) is a desperate rat race with a rigged outcome.How certain actors end up with certain roles depends on the crazy complicated game known as Hollywood casting, but sometimes even a miscast performer will bring an unexpected something to the table and triumph. Such was the case with Bette Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE (written with Claudette Colbert or Gertrude Lawrence in mind) and such is the case with Jane Fonda in a role that would have been better suited to someone like Stella Stevens. Fonda overcomes the odds as Gloria, the morbidly cynical and impoverished young woman whose brief life has been a series of abuses, disappointments and defeats. Even though the actress looks and speaks like a patrician, her defiant, angry, controlled desperation burns through the superficialities. Her performance culminates in an emotional meltdown which she handles with skill. It was her great breakthrough as a screen actress.Another career peak is reached by Gig Young who, as the master of ceremonies, personifies all the dishonesty, cruelty and pathos of the marathon itself. Bonnie Bedelia and Susannah York also score as different kinds of vulnerable innocents. Michael Sarrazin as Fonda's dance partner serves as the passive instrument that allows Fonda to play out her tortured personal drama. His unchanging wounded puppy dog expression speaks for itself.Ironically, the musical arrangements by John Green, a brilliant and very active composer of early 30's popular songs (including "Body and Soul"), sound more like Lawrence Welk than a real third-rate dance band of the early Depression era. As musical supervisor of this film I wonder if it was Green who anachronistically included songs that hadn't even been written when the story takes place, including "I Cover the Waterfront" (1933) and "Easy Come, Easy Go" (1934), both of which Green composed himself.For some reason the scriptwriter chose to move the story to 1932 from its original placement in 1934 by author Horace McCoy in the novel on which this film is based. At one point an old lady tells Fonda and Sarrazin that they are her favorite dance couple because they're wearing the number "67" which is the year she was born (1867). Later Fonda calculates her age: "Sixty-five." Which enables us to figure out that the action is taking place in 1932. In another scene Fonda, referring to Bonnie Bedelia, quips, "If she's not pregnant, then I'm Nelson Eddy." Eddy didn't become a nationally known name until 1935 when he teamed with Jeanette MacDonald. He didn't even appear in a major motion picture until 1933 (DANCING LADY, MGM). A woman of 1932 would have been more likely to say "Bing Crosby" or "Rudy Vallee" or even "Russ Columbo." So one can't help wondering why the screenwriter bothered to move the action backwards by two years.Exhausted couples staggering around a dance floor under a shining, spinning ball composed of mirror fragments that reflect off the ceiling, walls and floor - a symbol of Earth and the cosmos around it and oppressed humanity on the bottom grimly pressing on. That's the film in a nutshell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply unsettling and emotionally draining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the Depression, many had nothing... and the few that did were almost equally as miserable. This movie displays a dance marathon, held for the entertainment of the latter, and the expense of the former. The contestants dance for daily meals and a place to sleep, and the weak hope of a prize, if they are the last couple standing. The rules are cruel, and whilst the many dancers fight to remain standing, the audience is served snacks and fast-food. The film shows how callous people can be, sometimes. The plot is magnificent, the story-telling excellent. Acting(Sarrazin can exude an extraordinary amount of emotion through his eyes), casting, editing(with extremely few slightly weak moments), pacing, direction, cinematography, lighting, music, production design, everything, it's all amazing. This is a very difficult film to watch(which is by no means to say that I regret doing so). It is not entertainment, nor is it something to escape one's everyday life with. It is brutal and uncompromising, a window into an era and an event, both of which show humanity at its worst. A masterpiece. I intend to look for other films by Pollack, there is no doubt about that... fortunately, my fiancée has told me that he has done lighter fare(I would prefer watching something less bleak than this for the next of his movies I view). This is a very important movie, particularly in today's world, where reality shows are all over TV. I recommend this to anyone certain that they can sit through it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the movie that "The Day of the Locust" might have aspired to be. It captures the tone of desperation and helplessness of Depression-era characters (would-bes, wanna-bes, and fade-outs) like few films I've seen. It's a fascinating downer, ripe with interesting losers and gritty drama. Jane Fonda's performance as a marathon-entry at the end of her rope ranks with her very best work, and Oscar-winner Gig Young is smashing as the M.C. Also superb: Susannah York as a glamor girl who gets her clothes (and sanity) dirty, and Red Buttons as an over-the-hill sailor. There's not a happy or hopeful moment in sight, but for gripping human drama you could do no better. James Poe and Robert E. Thompson adapted their screenplay from Horace McCoy's novel; Sydney Pollack directed, impeccably. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dance Marathon Macabre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewing "They Shoot Horses, Don't They" is like rubbernecking a horrific traffic accident, or watching a train wreck. The images, no matter how painful, are too disturbing to turn away. This movie documents the depression era pathos by showing us a glimse of a group of dance-marathon contestants battling it out for a winner-take-all purse. Their lives become symbolic of their efforts in the marathon: inexorable pain, constant cramping, and a constant questioning of just "why live in all this misery?" Eventually, the lead performances, especially those of Susanna York and Jane Fonda, show at once characters strong-willed but overcome by simple animal survival. The rest of the stellar cast captures this bleakness as well (watch a young Bonnie Bedelia sing for thrown pennies!!!). Eventually the movie painfully climaxes to let one realize the issues raised by the movie title. The film is stunning in capturing the simple struggle of humanity; it's a must-see, but only once!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Set in the 1930s, it revoleved around a group of people entering/running a depression dance marathon. The group entering the contest(The principle characters being Fonda, Sarrazin, York, Buttons, Bedilia, Fields)Can't pass up the seven meals a day, or the top prize of 1500 dollars, no matter how grueling the dance will be. Fonda, is a drifter looking for money, Sarrazin wanders into the contest by accident, York and Fields are an actor and actress hoping to be "Discovered", and Buttons is also looking for money. The management of the contest is represented by Young, Lewis, and (To a lesser extent)Conrad. While this is not a "Pick me up" movie, it is definitely worth seeing. The cast is excellent, and the movie moves along well. Director Sydney Pollack filmed the movie in sequence, which helps to show the fatigue that the characters are feeling. They Shoot horses was nominated for nine academy awards, inglinging Best actress(Fonda), Best Supporting Actress(York) and Best Director(Pollack).However, only Gig Young walked away with the statuette(For best Supporting Actor) and he deserved every inch of it. Playing against typecasting, he knew he was getting the role of a lifetime and he gives one of the best performance of his career. I actually liked Rocky, with his White Tux and his "Yowza!Yowza!Yowza!" I don't know if I would have liked the character if Gig Young had not been in the role.Overall, this movie is definitely worth seeing. If you have a chance, give it a look.10/10 ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Depression Era Reality Show...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few months ago, I saw 1969's THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? for the first time in its entirety. I had heard a lot about this film when it was first released and had seen bits and pieces of it in the past,but I found watching the entire film to be a devastating and shattering experience. I must concur with another poster's comparison to the marathon dance contest participants to today's reality show contestants...there is an air of desperation surrounding these people that is sad and frightening to watch. Some of these people have pinned their entire existence on winning this marathon and you just know everyone can't win. As a matter of fact, if memory serves, we never find out who won, because the film focuses on those losers who have pinned their entire lives on this and don't make it. Jane Fonda should have won the Best Actress Oscar for her Gloria Beatty, a strong yet pathetic creature who MUST win this marathon. Michael Sarrazin had the role of his career as Robert, the young man who becomes Gloria's partner by fate and becomes drawn into her web of depression and loneliness. Gig Young won an Oscar for his ultra-slick turn as the host and promoter of the marathon. Memorable characterizations of other participants in the marathon are offered by Suhsannah York, Red Buttons, Bonnie Bedelia, and Bruce Dern. This film is not for very taste, but can be a haunting yet satisfying film experience for those who can handle it. Definitely not for the faint of heart and way ahead of its time. Exceptional direction by Sidney Pollack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1932, in the Great Depression, a group of hopeless people participates of a dance marathon contest on the Santa Monica Pier in California. Among them are the bitter and disillusioned Gloria (Jane Fonda); a sailor (Red Buttons) that fought in the war; the aspirant actress and actor Alice (Susannah York) and Joel (Robert Fields); the farmer James (Bruce Dern) and his pregnant wife Ruby (Bonnie Bedella); all of them expecting to win the award of US$ 1,500.00. Gloria's partner has a threatening cough and is disqualified before the contest. However, the Master of Ceremony Rocky (Gig Young) summons the stranger Robert (Michael Sarrazin) to replace her partner and dance with Gloria. Along more than forty days, the weakest couples are disqualified from the contest. When Rocky proposes that the exhausted Gloria and Robert get married during the dance marathon to raise money with the gifts, Rocky discloses that the winners will have their expenses deducted from the prize resting almost nothing from the US$ 1,500.00. Gloria leaves the contest with Robert and asks him for an ultimate solution for her suffering. "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is one of the most impressive and depressive movies I have ever seen. I read Horace McCoy's unforgettable novel when I was a fourteen year-old teenager and I recall how sad I was with this tragic story of human suffering and the comparison of people with cattle. Later I saw this movie twice on VHS (last time on 16 March 2000) and yesterday I saw it on DVD. The direction and performances are top-notch and in the end I was weirdly depressed despite knowing the story and the conclusion. My vote is nine.

		<shortDescription>Exceptionallly creepy and unsettling depiction of human depravity as spectator sport</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not heard of the era's small scale obsession with human suffering in the form of Dance Marathons. Although some have commented that these were the first reality shows, I would argue that nothing has changed in the human psyche from thousands of years earlier, when the Roman Colosseum was the outlet for the dark side of the human imagination, where food and gore was served up as a circus of demented and tasteless pastimes, where for a set period of time you could forget your own travails and feast your senses on the pains of someone else.This disturbing film begins and ends on the same coda, that of how a broken animal is shot out of sympathy, to put it out of any more misery. You have to see the film to understand what this means and the final scene completes the thought. The tensions that exist for all contestants is underscored by personal anxieties and humiliation. I suspect that you would not appear on the dance floor of a marathon unless you were down on your luck, probably very hungry and desperate to feed a family. This is what afflicts most of the contestants. Consider other layers of tension that make your skin crawl. At first when the character Robert appears, he denies that he is interested in dancing with anyone and without any chance to give an alternative to why he is there, we are left wondering if he really was too embarrassed to admit his needs or was just drifting aimlessly, waiting to be drawn into the vortex freak show that was just about ready to start. And drawn into it and his fate he unexpectedly gets pushed. He is matched up as Gloria's dance partner and in her you get a woman whose veins are filled to the brim with acid. A partner like that makes you prefer to sit in the electric chair first. Their most unlikely partnership hinges almost entirely on the smoldering rage that Fonda's character holds on to, with Sarrazin's character just about as malleable as silly putty. If his character is portrayed that way in the novel then fine, I guess the director had little choice. I found his passivity more confusing and after a while I was hoping that he would show some backbone (sorry for the terrible pun).The movie is deeply layered with enough time taken to show how the contestants slowly but surely burn down like candles on their last lights. Especially difficult to watch are the emotionally explosive mental breakdowns of several characters, one who looses her mind and screams that she is covered with insects crawling on her. Just as disturbing is the final break down of Alice LeBlanc, who, now jilted by her long time partner and having had her clothing and makeup taken from her by someone, having lost all her props (again, sorry for the pun) imploded and ended up breaking apart in a shower scene. Her painful scream followed by a soft voiced recognition that "someone" had screamed is almost too much to bear watching. Susanna York was outstanding in her role. Red Buttons is very good as a Sailor from World War one (again, we wonder why he would have entered such a crazy contest - except that perhaps he was there to show off his strength, now past his prime, or else because he too was down on his luck).I quite agree the fast walking timed sprinting scenes (both of them) are hideously played out and in our minds we are wondering who will drop dead first? Will it be the pregnant lady (Bonny Bedelia) or the sailor or anyone else? This is truly where the humans are turned into horses panting and pushed to their limits in a small scale chariot race and the full crowds cheer them on. It is utterly sickening and it goes on and on.(Spoiler major)....When Gig Young's character spills the beans about how little the winner will actually get (my mouth popped open when he said the words) you just look at Jane Fonda's face and you can see her think and do the simple calculation and you realize that she is totally manipulated and demolished and destroyed by the ruthless rules. The utterly soulless Rocky just explains to her that it is just business and he's not out to rip anyone off and he's got all the receipts to prove it. I think of the way the banks foreclosed on thousands of homeowners who could not pay their mortgages during the depression because of a massive economic contraction and huge unemployment and how the bankers would say the same thing: it was just business and they have the receipts.If ever there was a more heartless depiction of the dark side of humanity I do not know of a more painful collection of images. The actors are all outstanding in their roles, some more developed or limited as the director and script saw fit. I felt that Jane Fonda nailed her role with perfection and she showed that the Fonda family had only outstanding acting talent. The great Al Lewis (you will remember him from his hilarious stint on the Munster television show) is all understated with hardly a scene he is in where he does not have a small cigar chomped between his teeth. This is not a film that needs to be re-done as I think that Pollack has captured what needed to be said and shown. It is truly a horror show but not the type we normally associate with that emotion. The mirror it holds up to our dark side is supposed to make you squirm. Very unsettling but important film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nihilistic Allegory for Profit-Driven Society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a competition-based social order, such as ours, more should ask why the impoverished never seem to improve their living conditions. But there are people who are successful! Could it be that they always have been? That they stay that way by keeping everyone else fighting, distrusting, conniving, with the idea of attaining the prize of wealth, which is already systematically divvied up amongst an elite handful and protected as such? This disturbing mood picture boils down to the impending existentially compassionate act of a human being, which he cannot help but associate with an act of the same kind that had a profound effect on him in his youth. The act from his past is socially accepted, the one in his future a capital crime. Both extinguish the misery of a life beyond its own control, no matter how much it strives to express its freedom. Reflecting upon this momentous instant of his past, he happens upon an event that, in a time of depression, promises financial security, thus a fierce swarm of competition. He becomes involved due to the reluctant necessity of another human being with similar needs.This young man defined by his book-ending experiences had big dreams that were crushed. He finds himself now competing with others of big aspirations, young, old, impoverished, pregnant, all encouraged, indeed compelled, to pair with the opposite sex, more for the sake of spectators whose values must be reflected in the competition's spectacle. The weaker pairs are swiftly eradicated, exploited for the spectators' amusement. Already desperate circumstances are worsened by unresolved crime, leading to deepened internal strife, intensified competition. Job offers for some cause rejection by others, realignment, taking sides.The competition lasts insufferably long, and spikes in its amusement value are needed by the powers-that-be to distract the spectators from its obvious misery. So sport is staged using the contestants, masqueraded in cheerful spirit wear. Injuries, even fatal ones, are no matter. It continues. These burdens are loaded from one contestant to another, nervous breakdowns causing further realignments. The powers-that-be remain unaffected.Ultimately, it's the sacred institution of marriage that the powers-that-be utilize for the climactic publicity stunt, promising rewards, honors. The human with broken dreams and his chance counterpart cannot bring themselves to pretend the necessary emotion for the purely profit-driven ritual, and reveal the entire epic contest to be nothing of what it appears to be. When they can no longer maintain their integrity by being involved, they're left with nothing. Not even hope. What's one to do? When one's in such misery, and the other's willing to do anything to extinguish it, what does the law become? A mere protector of the very sham set of values engendered by the shamelessly exploitative competition? With this key American film, Sydney Pollack conveyed early signs that he could bring together and harness an ensemble cast effectively. It reaches moments of hypnotic artistry in its New Wave-inspired cutting that adds more internal psychology to the male lead, quiet character moments and energetic dance sequences. This is head and shoulders above any other film to the late director's name, as it lacks the sugar-coated worthiness hampering his serious attempts to tackle important themes in his later, mostly formulaic work, though work which comprises some classic, star-studded Hollywood thrillers, romances and comedies.But one of the highest achievements of his work here, I feel, is rooted in my notion that the film heroes who involve me most aren't romantic icons, they don't epitomize masculinity or necessarily get the girl. They have not offensive linemen or Medal of Freedom recipients. They're common people who are confronted with a necessity and face their predicament. The vast American majority was starving, careers were without hope, the public was unable to comprehend what had occurred. Most of them had been raised to trust that if you worked hard and persisted, and otherwise behaved yourself, prosperity would befall you. But during the Depression, catastrophe, poverty and loss befell multitudes. This grim spectacle of hardship is more than a suggestion of that era. It's a glass-half-empty microcosm of capitalism.The film's loaded with strong acting, from Red Buttons whose career as a comedian somehow deepens the desperation his character suffers, Susannah York who captures the tragedy of a woman with no insight into her loss of touch with reality, a stunningly innocent Bonnie Bedelia before she was Mrs. McClaine, from Michael Sarrazin as young man whose blow of mercy presages and caps his life, which is ultimately as insignificant as everyone else's in this society where all are subjugated, a life perhaps only significant to Gloria. Gloria, a contagion of existential desolation, is the petrified and petrifying chance counterpart of the man with broken dreams, as well as a great tragic heroine. Not like this is anything unusual, but Jane Fonda gives a dramatic performance that endows the film with personal spotlight and emotionally spellbinding might more effectively even than the film's brilliant, abstract use of flashes forward in sudden, subconscious, highly stylized cuts. Swollen-eyed, unkempt, stinking of must and smoke, Gig Young is inspired, a pointed change from his customary gourmet roles, as the powers that be, a man arguably as cynical and misanthropic as his desperate contestants.The film's awash with rather stunning period strokes, the songs, settings, costumes language, all so unsettling in such imperative ways. While the cameras remain, as if they had been condemned to do so, in the ballroom, capturing the fine points of the rising hopelessness of the dancers, They Shoot Horses, Don't They? becomes a marathon of collapse and futility. The circular arrangements of the dancers, the movement that heads nowhere, are the allegories of this existentialist metaphor for life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grand Prize: Surviving The Depression!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I first noticed the credits to this movie, it came to my attention that Sydney Pollack was the director of this film... This should come as no surprise to me, Sydney Pollack is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood!! He pinpoints reality to an unprecedented succinctness level!! Reality is often times a subtle yet very rude formidability with indisputable facts that will decimate anyone or anything that gets in the way!!The movie "They Shoot Horses Don't They" depicts a cross section of individuals who masquerade a paper thin veneer of flippancy about them selves. These actions serve as a subterfuge for the fact that they have been mangled by the Depression!! Everybody is at the same place, a dance marathon.. By tittle, a dance marathon would seemingly suggest a sort of paraded panacea, in reality, it is a cinematic slaughterhouse!! Such an event cultivates a macabre audience whose voyeuristic amusement is based on witnessing human misery.. The tragic social pitfalls of financial collapse caused by the Great Depression are the culprits to spurring on these dance marathons, nevertheless, regardless of cause and effect, the show must go on!!As the movie lingers on, it portrays the desperation and apocalyptic suffering all of the major characters endure... This needless agony is all in the hopes that they will win the grand prize.. The indigence everybody is victimized by sparks a pejorative identification that all involved parties are afflicted with!! All of them are mired in an abyss of despondence and gridlocked by the sorry element of individual demoralization!!The acting in this movie is absolutely phenomenal!! Jane Fonda is superb at portraying the disgruntled spawn of economic hardship!! Her witty retorts and justified pathos resonate themselves to a point of insignificant consolation and comfort for her overall situation!! Gig Young is terrific as the dance marathon coordinator, he has become callous as a necessary defense mechanism for his basic survival!! Jane Fonda's dance partner, Michael Sarrazin, must expedite moral imperatives, his final dilemma makes him very peccant, this is accompanied by a gargantuan ethical conundrum!! That is all I can say without giving away the plot to this movie!! As I previously stated, Sydney Pollack does a remarkable job directing this film!! All of the dance marathon victims have become sullen and dejected!! The Depression has evoked a totally effective form of vilification to each and every one of them by making them realize the outcome of their end results!! Heroics would allow people to rise above adversity, even the Great Depression!! Reality, however, dictates that the vast majority of Americans did not fall through the cracks, nor, did they divide and conquer... the fact is, that anonymity and attrition relegated most working class Americans to tragic statistics!! The dreadful circumstances of the Depression cogently asserted that many lives were virtually categorized as utterly valueless!!The talent and powerful story line make this film worth seeing!! Reality is a prevailing quality in a film, even if it is difficult to stomach, try to remember that and you will probably enjoy this film quite a bit!! Catastrophe has been calculated in this movie, to effectuate tragic poignancy to the letter of the law!! The law of the jungle that is!! If one of your favorite hobbies is ruminating the unfortunate truth, then, you will like this film very much!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once Seen, Never Forgotten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" makes such an indelible impression on anyone who sees it that they're never likely to either forget it or mix it up with any other movie they've ever seen. It's rare indeed for any movie to possess this kind of power but the sheer intensity of its story, the desperation of its characters and the quality of its cast really do make this film extremely memorable and quite unique.This depression-era drama about the experiences of a group of poverty stricken people who enter a dance marathon at a run-down ballroom on the Santa Monica Pier near L.A. describes the hopes that motivate them and also shows the suffering and humiliation that they experience as they struggle against impossible odds to chase their dreams of a $1,500 prize or the fame and fortune that could follow, if they get spotted by any of the talent scouts who might be in the audience. The depressing reality, however, is that the promises of these prizes (for different reasons) are both a sham and the contestants' endeavours are all in vain.Gloria Beatty (Jane Fonda) is a would-be actress whose experiences have made her very bitter and deeply cynical. She's habitually unpleasant to everybody she encounters but is, nevertheless, very determined to win the marathon. When her original partner is not allowed to compete for medical reasons, she quickly finds herself teamed up with Robert Syverton (Michael Sarrazin) who's an ex-farm boy who just happened to be in the vicinity and hadn't arrived with any intention of competing.Alice LeBlanc (Susannah York) is another aspiring actress who, despite her circumstances, takes a great pride in her appearance because she's convinced that she's likely to be recruited by some movie producer who'll spot her obvious talent. Harry Kline (Red Buttons) is an old sailor who lies about his age to enter the competition and is sure that his extensive experience of taking part in similar marathons will stand him in good stead this time around.Ruby (Bonnie Bodelia) is a heavily pregnant young woman who, together with her husband James (Bruce Dern), is competing in the hope of winning enough money to help with the expense of having their first baby.The ballroom full of couples who start the marathon are continually urged on by Rocky (Gig Young) who's the promoter of the event. He periodically hollers "Yowsa, Yowsa, Yowsa" to rouse both the competitors and the audience and every week "ups the stakes" by organising a Derby, which is a frantic, energy sapping, walking race which leads to the last three couples being eliminated on each occasion.What transpires during the marathon illustrates forcibly just how hopeless the lives of the competitors are, how futile their attempts to improve their circumstances are and how mercilessly their misfortunes are exploited by Rocky who never misses an opportunity to add to the contestants' humiliation and anguish. All this is done to entertain his audience who derive pleasure from watching the systematic degradation of less fortunate people and also leads to all the dancers losing their dignity and self respect.Gig Young's performance is sensational and made even more remarkable by the fact that his role is so different to those he normally played during his career. He's thoroughly convincing as the sleazy villain of the piece and exceptionally good at conveying his character's callous attitude to the competitors as he cruelly mocks their predicaments. Michael Sarrazin is ideal as the passive Robert who simply allows himself to be swept along by events and almost nonchalantly accepts whatever fate throws at him. Jane Fonda and Susannah York make their characters unforgettable and Red Buttons is marvellous as the determinedly optimistic and energetic "old salt"."They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is a tragic and very human story which, despite its depressing subject matter and shocking conclusion, is both thought provoking and riveting from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a dance competition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is a dance competition They shoot horses, don't they?Set in the 1930's, years of the depression, the Great War behind them and another to come, we find a whole generation that is trying to cope with a raw and harsh reality. The message this movie conveys is the same as the cold, pathetic and pessimistic view of life that the existentialist movements being born were spreading around.We all wanted to know who would win. We were unsure who to root for ?certainly not Jane Fonda's apathetic character. Then who? The washed out wannabe and talentless actress or her egocentric partner; the married couple that blind themselves with some sort of a possible "lived happily ever after" ending? No. None of them could win. All the characters are selfish and blind to reality with hopes of winning something that is ephemeral. Inside the dance floor they are stripped naked of their dignity and humanity. The only character who seems free of this heaviness turns out to be the worst of them, encarnating those that permit others to give up.Mr. Pollack very effectively introduces us into a world where life is an unending dance marathon. The struggle in life, like the struggle to keep dancing, is meaningless and empty; a mere movement that seems to go on and on until it crashes to an end. Contestants begin the challenge enthusiastically and motivated because they have a goal, a purpose. But we shockingly discover that people compete, not against each other as initially believed, but with the inevitable pull of gravity to the floor. This is why we're not really surprised at Gloria when she decides to shoot herself once she's outside. Loosing the competition is, in fact, death, and death is more reasonable, more real than "dancing away" through life. Death is the only certainty. Those who don't die dancing will die anyway, despite any resistance. In the end they were all cattle, lining up to be fattened before being slaughtered: an existence void of any meaning. A movie worth watching thanks to Mr. Pollack's brilliant directing and real, sober and contained performances, all committed to the point the movie wants to make. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..what a historical comment on our society..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you won't be confused, I rate this film at 100 - can't believe it isn't in ALL the top lists of "best"..... I remember when it first was released, and the "dance-hall" theme stayed with me for decades, although I didn't see it again until I bought the VHS in 2005.Indeed, "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is a bleak, terrifying, depressing BUT truthful portrait of how our society can be brutal toward other people unlike us. If you only watch movies to be happily entertained, you miss-out on how life can also be brutal - in ways one can't predict nor escape. This movie paints a graphic picture (as gripping as "Once Upon a Time in America") of some desperate people at the bottom of the ladder - and also some unfeeling individuals who enjoy seeing others suffer. "Horses" is CERTAINLY about suffering...I've read every comment posted here: so few users could connect the importance of the beautiful, only really happy scene in the entire movie, of a young boy who is captivated by the power of his horse running freely. When the horse falls and has to be destroyed, it is a prediction of how all of the dancers will be destroyed. The young boy just happens to become "Robert" (Michael Sarrazin), who is hanging-around the dance-hall and is drafted to be "Gloria's" (Jane Fonda) dance-partner, simply because she doesn't have one. Some of the users even ridicule him for his sweetness, the only dancer who has no idea why he's there nor has any reason to be.I agree this movie is MEANT to be a downer - it is a document to show how mean-spirited-but-innocent ordinary people can be. "Gloria" is determined to win - she is a savvy lady, but she does not realize to win is also to lose, no matter how close you come to winning. Her "merry-go-round" will never end, and she wants off. No matter how anyone feels about "Hanoi Jane", they cannot deny her role packs a powerful punch, and she plays it with stellar skill. Sarrazin is also stellar, and underplays his role with intense innocence. Susannah York's ("Alice") role is in the same league. "Sailor" (Red Buttons) delivers a brilliant role to demonstrate that older people are just as determined to win. "Ruby" (Bonnie Bedelia) is heart-breaking, simply because she wants to follow her husband's lead, at any cost. AL Lewis ("Turkey") is set-dressing, but ties weirdness to this already-stressful story. "Rocky" (Gig Young) is the professional user - "it's all business, honey", and is fascinating in his harshly intimidating character. (He did deserve his Oscar, but Jane got robbed.) "Mrs Laydon" (Madge Kennedy) knows the whole contest is a scam and nervously watches it unfold before her eyes.What a cast - many not mentioned here - and what a wallop they all deliver. I can't imagine how ANYONE can miss the impact this film delivers, nor understand how this character-study reveals we all are vulnerable to uncontrollable circumstances,and somehow flawed. The other films produced the same year this movie is filmed and released should be further proof that WHOLE DECADE depicted human frailties. INDEED, Syndey Pollack and James Poe deserved Oscars for giving us a good look at ourselves.If you can't sit through this movie, you gotta be a coward; so, watch it and be glad you're not in this situation, and lucky life has treated you well.....Bravo! to anyone who had the smallest part it making it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exhausting movie in every way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They Shoot Horses, Don't They (1969)This is almost a mainstream experimental film, coming out of the New Hollywood transformation, and it has a huge reputation. It centers around the basically true events of a typical late-1920s dance marathon, with contestants dancing (and resting at times) for weeks straight (four or five weeks wasn't unusual). Naturally, contestants freak out and get obsessive and generally push their limits, and that ultimately is what the movie portrays.I found it a bore. I like Sydney Pollack's approach to movies, in general, and he's directed some real gems. I can tolerate Jane Fonda, too, and she is an irritable, pushy young woman in this one, pretty convincing. There are other characters with similar selfish, and increasingly tired, attitudes, and by half way through you realize that it's a downer movie with nearly everyone snarly and mean and deceptive. By the end, with the great climax hinted at a couple times along the way, you expect and get the culmination of all that. But it's a pretty linear experience, almost entirely shot in the gymnasium serving as a dance hall. The spectators are barely mentioned (and there are generally very few). The bands providing the dance music are dull (and maybe incorrect for the times--not only is there an all-Black group, which might have been included, but one of them is a mixed race group, and this isn't a barrier crossed until the late 1930s, a decade later). People's attitudes struck me as more 1960s than 1920s, with women openly crude and aggressive, and maybe this is my own shortcoming (I see the aggressive, successful women in Reds as more accurate, for whatever reason). Mostly there is nothing much happening except a kind of petty competition between two women, and with two men half caring and just tagging along. And everyone getting weary. It's a spectacle, for sure, but imagine watching it for a month? And then squeezing that boredom into a two hour movie, narrative one liner with a strained script. Loaded with awards and praise, but not here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analogy of a slow, painful suicide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With society moving towards degradation in the late 1960's, filmmakers took more serious looks at earlier eras romanticized during the golden age of Hollywood. The popular dance marathons of the early 1930's, most famously done in Atlantic City, were a cavalcade of desperate young people trying to survive through the depression. This movie serves as a metaphor for the lost youth of the late 1960's dealing with civil rights and a war in Vietnam they wanted no part of.Jane Fonda and Michael Sarrazin are just two of the contestants caught up in this hoopla as they struggle to last through the grueling dances, sprint races and bad entertainment provided by some of the pathetic people trying to either gain fame or win a sponsor. The faces of all of these contestants show their world weariness, especially Fonda's who seems to long for the peace of death. Add in Gig Young as the emcee/producer of the marathon, a lecherous man who has no qualms in attempting to rape one of the exhausted dancers (Susannah York). He is both equally ruthless and charming as he utilizes every trick in the book to put on a show. Reminding me of the emcee in "Cabaret", it is no wonder that when Kander and Ebb did their own marathon musical "Steel Pier", the emcee/host of that marathon was a combination of both characters in this and in "Cabaret".Depression films of the past fifty years have touched on the many aspects of survival, whether through the violence of "Bonnie and Clyde" or the sleaziness of "Ironweed". "They Shoot Horses" takes on the world of entertainment and adds in some sports plus lots of desperation, despair and finally exhaustion towards life itself, reminding us that each era has had its share of miserable social moments which looked like the end of civilized society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>grim Depression drama that says a lot about our view of 'entertainment'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1932 - hard-up couples in Hoover's America enter a dance 'marathon' - if they are the last couple still on their feet, they will win $1500. Original and rarely seen on TV. Rather like NETWORK or THE DAY OF THE LOCUST, it interrogates 'we the audience' in our ceaseless search for 'entertainment.' As the film rolled on, I was continually drawing comparisons with the sickening drivel of BIG BROTHER and all its tatty copies, with every tawdry 'talent show,' and with the excruciatingly embarrassing annual pantomime of 'Red Nose Day.' The very fact that it's done for good causes doesn't excuse it - it makes it all the worse. When Gig Young (the sleazy comp?re of the show, looking like a ghastly mixture of Hughie Green, Bob Monkhouse, and Garner Ted Armstrong) helps to pull together one of the over-wrought contestants who is having hallucinations, Jane Fonda remarks caustically, 'I thought you'd have done that in the show - increase the admittance charge.' But Young replies, 'No, it's too real for them.' (Like the difference between EASTENDERS and NIL BY MOUTH, between EMMERDALE and THE WAR ZONE.) And when one of the contestants loses her dress and make-up, Young admits that he did it himself in order to improve the show. Michael Sarrazin naively retorts, 'But this is supposed to be a contest, not a show.' Young corrects him: 'They come to see this in their own misery. Seeing YOUR misery makes them feel happier...' One of the contestants collapses and has to be evicted from the dance floor. Young's announcement could be Davina McCall outside the Big Brother house: 'After we've been together all these hours and days, it's sorry to have to say goodbye to Shirley...' Gig Young is just superb - he's not simply a corrupt, insincere fairground huckster, but a fully formed character. Young uses his ageing face to portray a man who's seen it all... and yet found nothing to believe in. He mentions that his father was a phony 'faith healer'; when Young was a boy he had to pretend to be miraculously healed when the 'show' was flagging. To prove that nothing has changed, watch Rory &amp; Alec's so-called GOD TV when they have one of those 3- or 4-hour long 'conferences' of boring 'Christian' music, healing, and 'anointing in the Spirit.' Al Lewis (yes, Grandpa from THE MUNSTERS) is Young's right hand man. He only says a few words, but his looks and mannerisms add to the hard-wired atmosphere of cheapness and dishonesty. Michael Sarrazin (recently deceased), Susannah York (ditto), Jane Fonda (a great actress in her youth - shame about the identikit 'liberal' politics), Bruce Dern, Red Buttons - you couldn't ask for a better cast, but I still think it's Gig Young who steals the show (literally, as it turns out).Sydney Pollack uses great looming close-ups and strange camera angles; even the colour of it all looks rather weird and somehow tacky. Slow-motion sections often irritate me (think of the terrible 'run toward the funeral' at the end of CAPRICORN ONE - so embarrassing that it almost completely ruins the whole picture) - but the use of it in the second 'Dance Derby' to which the contestants are subjected works very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperate dancing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a bushel of fine performances to be found on the pier dance hall floor in this grim depression era story about marathon dancers. A popular entertainment in its day the competition would go on round the clock for days with contestants working themselves into a state of exhaustion and collapse in the hope of winning a meager prize. With massive unemployment across the country there was no shortage of contestants and Horses is filled with hard luck cases. Director Sidney Pollack keeps the pace brisk by inter-cutting scenes between his large cast then amps things up further with dizzying elimination races. Hard luck hoofers Michael Sarrizin, Sussanah York, Red Buttons, Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia all contribute powerful performances while Jane Fonda with hard edged cynicism delivers arguably the best acting job of her career. It is Gig Young as the emcee however that steals the film. A light comedy actor in most films Young's jaded good looks and forced optimism ("Yowsa, yowsa") to rouse the audience into thinking the torture on the floor is wholesome entertainment is an incredible portrait of calibrated hypocrisy and exploitation. Horses oozes cynicism from start to finish with no let up. There is not an ounce of comedy relief and the few scenes that take place outside the dark stifling dance hall in the welcome sun serves only the despair back inside where a sentimental audience tosses coins to a pregnant Bonnie Bedelia warbling "The best things in life are free." Without any upbeat distractions the film can become an endurance of melancholy for the viewer but Pollack and company keep things highly absorbing most of the way in what might be termed a dark piece of historical nostalgia .</fullReview>

I know that a review should be at least ten lines long. What I remember doesn't take long to describe. This is easily one of the best films I've ever seen. The acting of the two protagonists is breathtaking. I wish the disc was available here. I'd buy it in an instance. If you read this don't hesitate to rent or buy this film. Some reviews have been derogatory I'm sorry to say. My advise is see it for yourself and then judge. There is an unbearable beauty in all its squalor. Give it a chance. It's definitely worth it.

But so is life. To those who would ask what's the use of adding yet-another movie to the downer heap I say this: Horses is absolved of the sin of negativism because it doesn't INCREASE darkness, it sublimates the darkness of real life and thereby gives us a handle on doing something about it. It doesn't add darkness; it gives us nitevision goggles to pierce the darkness.Remember: What you don't cop to as a possibility might blindside you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" has to be one of the most pessimistic of all American films, and unapologetically so. It is not pleasant to watch, is in no way uplifting, and might be construed as the polar opposite of Hollywood's favorite theme for "serious" films, The Triumph of the Human Spirit.No wonder that many people who post here dislike this movie. And, yet, if only for its sheer rarity among American movies, it IS worth a viewing now and then. The Depression dance marathon setting can be viewed in a strictly historical context, but I gather the screenwriters, James Poe and Robert E. Thompson, and director Sydney Pollack were shooting at a bigger metaphor here -- Life is a marathon, it's all rigged anyway, and no one gets out alive. (I'm not familiar with Horace McCoy's source novel, sorry.)Since watching people dance themselves into exhaustion tends to lose its interest after a half-hour or so, it's the characters who really carry this movie. The soul of TSHDT is Gig Young, the dance promoter/emcee who plays -- or is -- God. His Best "Supporting" Actor Oscar may have been a disappointment to him in later years as his career declined, but here he is truly superb in the role -- largely hateful but surprisingly sympathetic at times. Red Buttons deservedly received a Golden Globe nomination for his nicely restrained performance, and Susannah York (who lrooks mahvuhlous!) also got Oscar and Golden Globe noms, as well as a BAFTA Supporting Actress award for her performance (which she later said she didn't care for). Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia are a bit bland as a country couple hoping to win big bucks on the dance floor, but Al Lewis, Michael Conrad, Allyn Anne McLerie, and most of the other actors do succeed is making us care about these characters and their predicament.Unfortunately, the character of Robert is not well defined, and Michael Sarrazin plays him as though in a daze much of the time. Jane Fonda's character also disappoints. This was her first post-"Barbarella" part, and she's struggling to present herself here both as a serious actress and as a political/social commentator. The acting chops were undoubtedly there (she got an Oscar nom for this role and won two years later for "Klute"), but her Gloria is so bitchy and sullen that it's difficult to believe that Robert is going to work up the sympathy for her that leads to the film's climax. A few additional glimmers of humanity in Gloria might have made this film the true tragedy that its creators were aiming for.TSHDT is set in 1932, one of the worst years in America's past, and the film was no doubt green-lighted and filmed in the aftermath of another horrific year, 1968, when Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, race riots broke out across the country, and the Tet offensive snuffed the light in the end of the Vietnam tunnel. Perhaps the filmmakers believed that young moviegoers would be receptive to the unrelenting grimness of this film. But most Americans -- no matter how poor or powerless, in 1932, 1968, or 2007 -- have little appreciation of what true desperation and hopelessness are. The U.S. economic dislocation of the 1930s was hardly in the same global ballpark as plague, famine, tyranny and genocide; and as bad as 1968 may have appeared on TV, most Americans came through it largely unscathed. There is something far too affected and world-weary about the pessimism of TSHDT, and it's amusing to think of all the 1970 college students (including me) emerging from their local twin theaters after seeing TSHDT, shaking their heads and crying, "Boy, life really is a bitch!" before getting into the cars that their Mommies and Daddies provided and heading out in search of something to get high on. But as American films go, I'll give the makers of TSHDT credit for their integrity in sticking to the script and not leavening the pessimism with a ray or two of hope. As far as this movie's concerned, there ain't no hope. The marathon never ends, and, to borrow a phrase, we're all dancing as long as we can.</fullReview>

A long film about a dance marathon set in the time of the great depression of the thirties. Starring Jane Fonda she got this role after "Barbarella" and just before her fantastic performance in "KLUTE". Surely this period was the peak of Jane Fonda's career and Sydney Pollack was wise to choose her for this role which required intensity and endurance. Hailed by critics as not only one of Sydney Pollacks greatest works but also set the benchmark for films with unusual endings for the seventies. Now is the time to catch up on this classic on DVD and get a further reminder how the films of today mostly lack substance. A great event in American Cinema History.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie that revealed the exploitation of a starving generation I didn't think much of it, more I was just like, "Woah." But this film stuck with me months after I saw it. I drew many parallels to the depression era trend and to reality television today. The mere difference is only that in the 30's people were dancing for their supper...now they're embarrassing themselves for plasma tvs and hummers. Michael Sarrazzin and Jane Fonda were so rightfully cast as Robert and GLoria. Robert was more or less accidentally entered into the dance contest and GLoria has made a profession out of doing anything to get out of her life that has been so obviously riddle with misery. The movie is a gift from Sydney Pollack and no one actress could possibly have breathed life into GLoria Beatty the way that Jane Fonda did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of the greatest films ever made. Do not read this review if you haven't seen the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite films. The only flaw was the unbelievable ending when we find out there is no prize money for the winners. I feel they should have stayed with the way it ended in the book. In the book the health department closed the marathon after the second derby, mainly because Ruby went into labor. They then split the 1500 dollars among the remaining contestants so each one received 50 dollars a piece, and yes Gloria still committed suicide,that is why I gave the film a 9 out of 10.I read where Charlie Chaplin wanted to make this film starring Claudett Goodard as Gloria but the codes back then would never have allowed it.Had he been able to, the perfect cast would have been Goodard as Gloria(Though Barbara Stanwick, Davis,or Crawford would have been good), Leslie Howard as Robert,Charles Laughton as Rockey and Frances Farmer as Alice. Heres something to think about: Had Gloria won the 1500 dollars, would she still have committed suicide?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a kind...a searing, engagingly sad commentary on the desperation of Depression-era America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, this is one of the most fascinating depictions of one of the darkest times in modern American history. I saw this incredible feature when it was first released and recall myself glued to the seat 15 minutes after the house lights came on -- overwhelmed, exhausted, suicidal and completely enthralled. Now that's cinema!Director Sydney Pollack inhales the gathering gloom of a motley group of 30's Depression-era victims and spits it out against the seedy backdrop of a dance marathon, pitting one miserable soul against another in a cruel contest of endurance while exposing each of their inner tales of woe.Jane Fonda blotted out her "Barbarella" eye candy image forever with her staggering portrayal of the brutally cynical spitfire Gloria, a never-was, never-will-be actress who refuses to see blue skies ahead for herself or anybody else -- despite the outcome. Her caustic despair taints everything around her, while foreshadowing the inevitable tragedy that lies ahead. Fonda equals, if not betters, her performance in "Klute."Michael Sarrazin as Fonda's partner, a calm, poetic drifter, Susannah York as the Jean Harlow-like hopeful desperate for a chance to be discovered, and Bonnie Bedelia, a pitiable, impossibly pregnant waif are the stand-out participants of this grueling nightmare, while Gig Young's award-winning emcee touchingly reminds us that not all the pathetics are hugging the floorboards. The cast is absolutely perfect...down to the extras. There isn't a false note in this elegy of misery.Pollack stages the couples' interactions and dance sequences most impressively, but its the so-called racing "sprints" shot in such a blurring, whirling, surreal fashion, that highlight this film masterpiece.One of the most exhilarating and depressing movies you'll ever witness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, and have been quite obsessed with it since I saw it a few years ago. I've never been able to get hold of it to watch on video or DVD, and yet have seen it twice on TV. I think because it was quite like anything I had ever seen before, the themes of desperation, the tension, the heartbreak. I did not know that these sorts of dance marathons had ever taken place, and the competition comes across as macabre and quite unbelievable; it amazes me that this sort of thing used to exist; how people put themselves through days worth of agony in order to win some money to live. The performance of Jane Fonda is superb, and I can't recommend this movie enough, if you can get hold of a copy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Necessary Reminder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outstanding movie that packs a very powerful punch. When it was made, a new energy was firing American cinema - EASY RIDER came out the same year, FIVE EASY PIECES the year after. As the war with Vietnam dragged on, old values were being fearlessly re-examined. The dance hall of Horace McCoy's Depression era novel here becomes the stage on which the more questionable of those values are acted out.For all the characters, what the marathon is and what it means depends on what they need to get out of it. For James and Ruby (Dern and Bedilia) it's food for themselves and the baby that's on the way; for Alice and Joel (York and Fields) it's the chance of being seen by someone influential from the movie industry; for Gloria (Fonda), and for the Sailor and Shirl (Buttons and McLerie) it's to earn some money; and, as succinctly expressed in a scene between Robert (Sarrazin) and Rocky (Young), for the former the marathon is a competition, whilst for the latter, it's a show. As the marathon proceeds, the physical reality of it takes its mental toll, and its true meaning becomes clear. Rocky turns out to be right: it's an entertainment for those without much, so that they can feel better about themselves by watching the suffering of those with less. I write this nearly 80 years after McCoy's book was first published, nearly 45 years since the movie was released: regrettably, not much has changed.I saw the movie when I was a teenager, when it first came out. I retained some images from it, but I don't think it could have struck me then as it did last night when I watched it again, this time on DVD. It's an immense work by Sydney Pollack and his collaborators - particularly his screenwriters James Poe and Robert E. Thompson, his DOP Philip Lathrop, and his editor Frederic Steinkamp. The derby sequences in particular are tremendous - the camera gets amongst the competitors, forcing you to really feel what they're going through. It's as discomforting as it should be.The performances are all superb. Although Susannah York was apparently dismissive of her contribution, it is probably the best work she did on film. Similarly, Gig Young, who is extraordinarily good. Jane Fonda, Allyn Ann McLerie, Red Buttons, Bruce Dern, Bonnie Bedelia, Robert Fields, Madge Kennedy, Al Lewis and the wonderful Michael Sarrazin - all terrific.I write this early on Christmas Day. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE will be on TV at some point. Quite right, too, it's a great movie. But in my heart I feel that its seasonal message of hope should be balanced by a recognition that there are many - too many - in whose lives there is no hope. An annual peak-time showing of THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? as a companion piece to the Capra would act as the necessary bracing reminder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A damning indictment of reality programming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Public spectacles that feed audience's schadenfreude have a long and sordid history. Before "reality" TV shows put damaged people (or actors portraying same) on display, there were public hangings and gladiatorial arenas. And, perhaps, dance competitions. A marathon dance contest that requires contestants to stay on their feet for weeks at a time could be an innocent test of endurance. But add corporate sponsors, a cash prize, and bleachers full of people seeking thrills and story lines, and it becomes something darker. On a story level, "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is about the dehumanizing effects of the spotlight. On the level of the film's presentation, however, director Sydney Pollack and his actors ensure that the humanity of the characters takes center stage. If the final act is not entirely satisfying, perhaps it is because we the audience, like the onlookers at the dance competition, have improper expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched for the first time last night - certainly relentlessly grim but gripping &amp; brilliant nevertheless. I don't always like Jane Fonda's performances but I thought she ACED this one: there's no humour which makes it a challenge, but her brittle cynicism is entirely convincing. The script &amp; direction are equally impressive: when do the dance contest audience change from cheering on talent contestants to sick voyeurs (which I guess includes us,continuing to watch the film) waiting for the first person to drop - Can you spot the moment? I agree with other reviewers, it's a film that sticks in your head, I'm still thinking about it now. At the start, everyone's focused on the little things - a missing dress, a cigarette, watching out for the producer who could give you your big breaks. Then of course it gets into the big stuff: dreams, ambition, illness, age, pregnancy, obsession, frailty and death - before returning to the little details at the end - a pair of ripped stockings. Interesting for story tellers as well as film watchers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grueling and impressive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, an extensive dance marathon slowly turns into a brutal exploration of the human spirit. Just about the entire film takes place within the confines of one building, the setting for the marathon lasting weeks, with a group of varied characters coming together in an attempt to outlast the rest for the grand cash prize. It's an interesting premise and has been used several times, mostly for comedic purposes, but the idea of it holds so much dramatic potential. Playing it for comedy would be easy, but the script by James Poe and Robert E. Thompson, adapted from a novel by Horace McCoy, goes for the harsh reality of it all and what comes out is a grueling, tragic display.The experience these characters put themselves through is torturous, always putting on a show for the crowd and at the mercy of the judges and Gig Young's announcer Rocky. It's like watching animals in a zoo, slowly being pushed down to their dying breath. The film provides an interesting social commentary in the way that the crowd starts off minimal, only a few spectators in the stands as the participants are relatively fresh and alert, but as the days go on and their hope dwindles the crowd grows and grows. They want to see the chaotic potential of the marathon, they want to see these human beings brought to their breaking point, and they get that in spades.Focusing on the young Robert (Michael Sarrazin) and Gloria (Jane Fonda), two loners who partner up for the contest, the film explores some dark themes through their experience of the contest and the downward spiral they are pushed through. There are flashes to Robert being arrested for an unknown crime that we see several times throughout the film, which provide an interesting look at his character and a curious mystery to try and decipher, but the primary focus of the film is on those themes of bringing a person to their breaking point and seeing what comes out as a result.The performances are uniformly strong, from the powerfully broken Fonda, to the borderline psychotic Susannah York, to the energetic and determined Red Buttons, but special note should be given to Young who is charismatic and malicious as the host of ceremonies but in his moments out of the spotlight presents a sort of bitter melancholy towards the world that adds another layer to his character. Pollack's direction here is understated but absolutely remarkable. He doesn't use a lot of flash or technique, but he seamlessly gives the film the sensation of it being a marathon itself. You can feel the days and weeks pressing on as they grow weaker, more tired and more hopeless.By the time the final act comes, the audience is in as much as a weary daze as the participants are. It all comes around to it's final sequence, which is tragic beyond the definition of the word. The revelations are powerful and finding out the true meaning of the title is a revelation for the ages. A strange, unique and utterly brilliant work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The glam-shot lobby posters were misleading. This is powerful and uncompromising movie-making of the sort that only existed for a few years between the family friendly mid-60s and the blockbuster-driven late 70s. It features the role that got Jane Fonda away from her Barbarella-style sex-kitten image to emerge as one of the great movie actresses of the age. Fonda is Gloria, a hard-edged, world-weary woman, who has been lied to and used for so long and fallen so far down on her luck that she finds herself competing in one of those grueling, spirit- breaking, mind-destroying dance marathon contests that proliferated for a few years during the Depression when folks would do anything for money and which serves as an allegory for the age. The contest is shown in all of its harsh and ugly details. Competitors dance until they drop, getting counted out on the floor like KOed fighters, eat while dancing, even try to sleep against one another while their feet keep moving. They wash their hair and clothes in the ballroom sinks, try to sleep on narrow, stinking cots during the rare rest periods, and keep moving, always moving, for two months of unending misery. As cynical MC Gig Young (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actor) points out, the spectators are not there to see a contest - they came to see folks worse off than they are. The film is shot in suitably harsh tones with unflattering lighting to point up the suffering on the actors' faces and uses semi-darkness to maximize the claustrophobic feeling of being stuck in the same building for so long and never seeing the sun. Michael Sarrazin plays a naive nice-guy who wanders in off the beach and finds himself in the contest. His is the viewpoint character, but Sarrazin himself never had much presence and is of little individual interest. Fonda and Young anchor the picture as victim and victimizer, in a literal dance to the bitter end. Some reviewers found the ending predictable and unnecessarily grim and tragic. Yet, the Depression itself had much of the grim inevitability of Greek tragedy, and one might argue that it is simply appropriate to all that came before. My view is that this is one of the best movies that came out that year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my most favorite movies. It personifies the desperation of the depression. The dance contest, pitched as fun in the beginning, is gradually exposed as the evil monster it is. The contestants are unforgettable. The supporting cast is made up of several big name stars who perform their roles in near-perfect form. You care about all of them in spite of their individual character flaws. It is heartbreaking to see the gradual destruction of Jane Fonda's unsinkable, independent female spirit. The round leading to Sailor's (Button's) elimination from the contest to the tune of "California, Here I Come" is haunting and surreal. The contest itself is interesting. The most interesting character was Rocky, played by Gig Young. This guy is emotionless user of others. He is a shameless huckster. He knows what he is and candidly admits it to Fonda late in the movie. Any concern he has for the contestants is motivated by how their collapse will affect the contest, not by sympathy or empathy for their plights. The tragic ending is logical and believable. This movie is entertaining from start to finish. It can be enjoyed over and over.</fullReview>

This movie was memorable, all right--haunting and brutal would be more fitting. If you want to be bummed out, watch this movie--it's a guaranteed downer! So this movie did me a great service.

		<shortDescription>The Spirit Died in the Stock Market Crash.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jane Fonda's performance of a beat and tired hopeful performer caught during the Great Depression is the standout feature of They Shoot Horses Don't They. The spectacle of the young people trying to win some extra money to pay the rent is exhausting in and of itself. You might have trouble staying awake during this film merely because as you look at them dancing. Even the musicians play tired after a while, but they're relieved and the dancers aren't.Marathon dancing started during the Roaring Twenties when the country was in a partying mood. During the years of prosperity, the spirit on the dance floor would have been lively. The fad carried over to the Depression, but the spirit died in the Stock Market Crash. Now all the hopefuls are just trying to earn money for the bills.When Fonda's original partner is disqualified, she hurriedly teams up with Michael Sarrazin who still has a spirit of some optimism which is ground out of him by the grueling dancing. As things progress and Fonda sees how corrupt the system is even here, tragedy results.They Shoot Horses Don't They won a flock of Oscar nominations except curiously enough for Best Picture. Fonda and Sussanah York were nominated for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress as was director Sydney Pollak, but the only winner on Oscar night was Gig Young for Best Supporting Actor as the Master of Ceremonies at the dance palace. His performance ought to be seen side by side with another Oscar winner, Joel Grey in Cabaret. Both are in the same kind of roles although Young is more involved with the rest of the cast and Grey just serves as a commentator.Watching Young the best comparison I could also give is with Vince McMahon at the WWE. Fonda is like one of the trial horses in a wrestling match there, one of the ones who perpetually loses in those fixed contests. And as Young said he may not know a winner, but he can spot a sure loser, one the crowd will not be pleased with.Sarrazin's character was a bit strange and I couldn't quite accept him or his motivations. Despite that They Shoot Horse Don't They is a classic from the Sixties and the first film where Jane Fonda really was given a meaty role to lead a film with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This beguiling and mesmerizing piece of cinematic poetry is a melancholy masterpiece, a great companion piece to the more sinister and despairing DAY OF THE LOCUST. Both films detail the depression era sadness and desperation of wannabees and losers rendered prickly and desperate by poverty and Hollywood imagery. THEY SHOOT HORSES is a really great and bitter film, a superbly realized reality check in its anti musical point of view on life in the early 30s. Perhaps CABARET can be added to make a trilogy of deluded people and their astonishing disillusionment...... Today in 2009 I realize I am 40 years beyond the film's production which was 40 years beyond the time it is set.... and we are in another financial depression. The irony! With simply terrific emotional performances by a truly gorgeous post-Bonnie Jane Fonda and the mysteriously now AWOL Michael Sarrazin with sub leads creepy Bruce Dern and gasping Red Buttons and a fragile Harlow-like Susannah York... all in a grinding music stew of financial nervousness. Gig Young as an oily MC was a clear front-runner before Joel Grey trumped him in the Oscar stakes for such a similar role. Other films like QUEEN OF THE STARDUST BALLROOM, or the incredible ruined ballroom scene from THE WRESTLER only add to the admiration of this film when each seen in quick succession as I did. THEY SHOOT HORSES is a major piece of genuinely epic suspenseful sadness. Just great. The human spectacle as a carnival race of ordinary people's small lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fonda Soars in an Evocative Microcosm of Depression-Era Hopelessness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marathon dancing as a spectator sport during the Great Depression must have resonated with Vietnam War-era audiences who looked at the bloody carnage of that conflict on the network news every night. To a great degree, it still does today given the ceaseless appetite for reality TV. Just before his film-making career took off, Sydney Pollack helmed this powerful but relentlessly downbeat 1969 drama about one such marathon dance contest set in a decrepit dance hall on the Santa Monica Pier in 1932. Adapted by screenwriters James Poe and Robert E. Thompson, the movie takes the semi-famous 1935 Horace McCoy novel and highlights the microcosm that the author created to show how hopeless people felt during the depths of the Depression, none more so than Gloria Beatty, the embittered and failed wannabe actress desperate to win half the $1,500 grand prize.In her breakthrough dramatic role, Jane Fonda brings an unmitigated feral quality to Gloria that must have been startling at the time since her previous two films were the lightweight "Barefoot in the Park" and the campy pin-up comic fantasy, "Barbarella". For all her outwardly aggressive behavior, Gloria could have been a completely detestable character, but Fonda makes her desperation and diminished self-worth palpable in surprisingly subtle ways. The other standouts in the cast are a very young Bonnie Bedelia as the extremely pregnant Ruby clinging in exhaustion to her husband, Susannah York as the unstable starlet Alice, Red Buttons as seen-it-all Sailor, and Gig Young who upturned his long-established light comedy image as the Machiavellian dance emcee Rocky.You will likely recognize Al Lewis (Grandpa on "The Munsters") as Rocky's mercenary assistant Turkey and Michael Conrad (Sgt. Phil Esterhaus on "Hill Street Blues") as the cynical roller skating referee. The fly in the ointment is wide-eyed Michael Sarrazin, who plays the circumstantial protagonist Robert Syverton with an utter lack of depth. Pollack unfortunately uses a flash-forward technique with Robert which punctuates the story unnecessarily. However, when he sticks to the dance hall, he is quite masterful, especially in the two defining derby scenes where he fully captures the desperation of the contestants in a grueling, humiliating foot race. Harry Horner's period production and Philip H. Lathrop's darkly lit cinematography effectively evoke the sleaziness and claustrophobia within the hall in measured detail. There are no extras in the 2004 MGM DVD package.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this film is quite difficult to watch sometimes. I believe Jane Fonda gave one of her best dramatic performances as a desperate woman. She earned an academy award nomination for her performance and it was worth it. Her co-star Michael Sarrazin won an Academy Award for his role in "West Side Story." I think this was a great performance that followed his success but he never went anywhere. I like watching Bonnie Bedelia as the pregnant dancer. I have to confess that the main reason that I rented this film wasn't for any of the listed actors but for one of my all time favorite soap opera actresses, Beverlee McKinsey. I would give anything to see her act again whether it was a commercial or reading the phone book. SHe had a non-speaking role but her facial expressions was priceless. The dance telethon is cruel at times. The dancing goes on forever with breaks where the characters get to know each other a little better.

		<fullReview>"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" chronicles a dance marathon competition in Santa Monica in the post-Great Depression era. Among the contestants vying for the $1,500 victory are a depressive and damaged aspiring actress (Jane Fonda), a wannabe filmmaker-turned-criminal (Michael Sarrazin), another aspiring Hollywood starlet (Susannah York), and a pregnant wife and her husband (Bonnie Bedelia and Bruce Dern). The competition begins to wear on the already- downtrodden contestants, slowly transforming into a grand guignol of psychological and physical horrors.Based on the 1935 novel of the same name, "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is one of those rare films that are so solid across the board (acting, cinematography, writing) that it's something of a masterpiece. The premise is almost paper-thin and on the surface sounds somewhat dull: a dance marathon where contestants have to stay on their feet for hundreds upon hundreds of hours till they all fall down; but the emotional depth of the characters is the key ingredient that enriches the entire film.Each of the characters carry with them an array of baggage and psychological complexity that is subtly unraveled, and the writing is really the glue that keeps the show together, supplemented with career-defining performances from Fonda and York. It is an extremely attentive character study above all else, but simultaneously operates as a grim metaphor for American society that is as relevant today as it was in the wake of the Great Depression. Sydney Pollack is able to paint layer upon layer of tension and the audience sees a disaster coming from the first frame, but the writing and performances never cease to be completely engrossing. The fact that actual dance marathons were a reality (and an en vogue one at that) makes the film's bite even more vicious. While the film has certainly been praised by critics and cinephiles over the years, it is not exactly a well-known film, which is a bit of a shame. The filmmakers here managed to take a straightforward premise and present it as a psychologically complex and disturbing portrait of broken people in an increasingly dire situation. Phenomenal all across the board. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Sidney Pollack's "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?", it is impossible not to think of reality shows and their piles of human souls desperate for success' shortcuts. Indeed, whenever there will be depression and desperation, such shows will exist. The only difference is that during the Great Depression, when Horace McCoy wrote the novel, there was no screen between the audience and the contestants, a thinner progress than the fact that, contrarily to Rome's gladiators, contestants didn't kill each other, though they seriously jeopardized their physical and mental health.The film centers on a Dance Marathon, one of the 30's crazes, set in a West Coast ballroom, the concept is so vicious that you wonder why sensitive people would go to such extremes. From a 2010's standpoint, it makes sense as there's no difference between this and programs like "Survivor" or "Fear Factor", and no more between the charismatic Master of Ceremony, played by Gig Young and a TV host who displays hypocritical empathy toward contestants while developing new tricks to increase their suffering. Watching Young's Oscar-winning performance, we wonder whether we should despise his cynicism or enthusiastically respond to his repeated "Yowsa!" Young embodies the bittersweet appeal reality TV shows, something that is part of human nature to which German language found a word for: 'shadenfreude'. When someone falls or fails, we're somewhat glad to be in the comfortable viewer's side. We don't like other people's successes, but any sight of a human being in a less favorable position is most welcome. That's how depressing a depression is, when we can't feel better for ourselves win, we do it by proxy, by enjoying someone's failure. Regarding the Dance Marathon, whoever will win the 1500 dollars prize will be less interesting than the dozens of delightful losers.Take the character Alice, played by Susannah York, she's a young actress coming with her partner, together they expect to catch the eye of a director. Alice is like today's wannabe Cyrus or Kardashian who don't believe in bad publicity and think fame precedes artistic achievement. Later, Rocky reveals that he deliberately took her dresses and make-up, because she was spoiling the game by not looking messy and exhausted as she was supposed to be. He says about the audience that they "just want to see a little misery out there so they can feel a little better maybe." This revelation will come as a shock to Robert (Michael Sarrazin), an aspiring director who naively thought he was in a contest, rather than a show. Like in Ancient Rome, those who don't have 'bread and wine' make the 'circus' to the haves. Seriously, did he forget he was sponsored? There are also two tragic characters: Kline, an aging sailor, played by wonderful character actor Red Buttons, the WWI veteran knows the marathon, and teaches a few tricks to Robert. And there's a pregnant Okie farmer's wife played by unrecognizable Bonnie Bedelia (she was John McClane's wife in "Die Hard"), and entrusted with more than she can cope with, and nor her husband (Bruce Dern) or the doctors or Rocky think that she might endanger her kid's life or her own. The sight of this little heavy-loaded women forced to run that awful ten-minute derby is one of the most disturbing sights of the movie along with Kline's death, desperately dragged by Gloria Betty (Jane Fonda) till the finish line.The power of Pollack's directing is to switch from the contestants' perspective to Rocky's (and his partner played by Al Lewis). For instance, you see the participants groaning at the derby's white lines being painted and then you see the puppet masters of this tragicomedy, and you wonder why these people who can leave at any time, let their health and sanity being sucked out by these heartless bastards in tuxedos. The reason is simple: the two points of view never meet, except for Robert and Gloria. And all naturally, they leave the show. When Gloria learns that the winner will pay the expenses, that's too much to accept, she understands that "the whole world is like central casting. They got it all rigged before you ever show up." As Gloria, Jane Fonda is the soul of the story, a perpetually malcontent woman whose participation was the last string on which to hang her faith on life. But while the film is mainly focused on Fonda, it starts with flashbacks from Robert's childhood - one involving a beautiful black stallion, falling and then mercilessly put out of his misery- and then it's punctuated with images of Robert being arrested and interrogated for what seems to be a murder. I thought that (accidentally) knowing Gloria would die, would spoil my enjoyment. As a matter of fact, from the title to the poster, and the arrest scenes, we understand that it's a matter of time before the contest finally get the most of her, and makes her death inevitable.This is not depression as an Era, or as the disillusioned New Hollywood movies that provided the great unequaled masterpieces of American cinema, but plain and bleak 'state of mind' depression. It's like a feeling of psychological claustrophobia in an agoraphobia-inducing world, too many people and not enough souls to reach you or to reach. The ball-room, with all its flashiness and shiny floor, is the extraordinary metaphor of this Depression, however you define it. And Fonda conveys her sadness so convincingly that we no longer feel sorry for her when Robert pulls the trigger. As he says to the disbelieving cops: "they shoot horses, don't they?". Gloria didn't break her leg though, only her spirit, and that's something you can't recover from."They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"is one of the most depressing movies I saw, even more because it hasn't lost one ounce of relevance, proving that History keeps repeating itself, staged by the worst of human nature. What an exhausting depressing, haunting and unforgettable movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great desperation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the Great Depression at the Santa Monica Pier near Hollywood. Robert Syverton (Michael Sarrazin) happens upon a dance marathon and is pulled in to participate. As a child, he witnessed the mercy killing of his horse. MC Rocky (Gig Young) makes him the replacement to Gloria (Jane Fonda)'s sick partner. She's a bitter woman and the years have not been kind to her. Other participants include confident elderly sailer Harry Kline (Red Buttons), aspiring actors Alice (Susannah York) and Joel (Robert Fields), and poverty-stricken James (Bruce Dern) and his pregnant wife Ruby (Bonnie Bedelia) who are willing to dance simply for the food.Director Sydney Pollack is able to bring a sense of rising desperation to the movie. Fonda has a great broken character. They are all great. This is a broken world full of broken people. It does meander a bit with the flashbacks and internal squabbles but each derby injects more harrowing energy to the movie. It has great desperation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the film can blow you away for its uncompromising reprimand of what a degraded world we are living!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sydney Pollack's pungent film adaptation of Horace McCoy's 1935 novel about a dance marathon contest during the Depression-era - the ultimate test of energy and endurance, which blurs the line between competition and reality show. The various contestants spurred by the 1500$ reward, push their strength and fortitude to the limits, little they know, they are merely dispensable pawns to attract audience, since the mass needs something they can believe in in that particular era, and clearly, watching other people in suffering and bad shapes is a massively effective way to achieve that, what a sadistic revelation! Also the film has an unflinchingly bleak ending can give a gut punch to first-time viewers who are unfamiliar with the source novel. The main players in the game are Gloria (Fonda), a cynical, embittered woman whose intention to become an actress has never materialised, randomly paired with Robert (Sarrazin), a wide-eyed (literally) young man who is aimless wandering around; Harry Kline (Buttons), a middle-aged sailor with his partner Shirli (Ann McLerie), British aspiring actress Alice (York) and her partner Joel (Fields), a young farmer James (Dern) with his pregnant wife Ruby (Bedelia), yes, no possible sick people allowed but a pregnant woman, welcome on board! The contest is hosted by a veteran emcee Rocky (Young), who represents the ruthless rules-maker and exploiter of the poor participants. Barely a dance competition, the entire extravaganza is an overlong battle against sleep deprivation, more heart-tugging scenes are deployed when a so-called derby is introduced, forces each pair to race in circles for 10 minutes non-stop and the last three pairs are automatically eliminated, how barbarian is could be? People die in progress, we are no more civilised than the ancient Romans who are hailing for gladiators' slaughtering, or worse, since hypocrisy even masks the tragic event with uplifting spirits, how messed-up and phony USA was at then? The film does bespeak Pollack's true grit in making this magnificent social critique. Thus, one can much appreciate the unexpected ending, Gloria tries very hard to comply to the rules, but the overwhelming futility of life - the overt metaphor of the marathon, waylays her with such irreconcilable disappointment, the pathos is sudden but perfectly justified at that moment when she makes that crucial decision, Fonda receives her first ever Oscar- nomination for her affecting portrayal of a woman who has nothing to live for and simultaneously is a soul full of vehemence, two-thumbs up! Gig Young won the only Oscar among the film's overall 9 nominations (it still holds the record as the most nominated one sans a BEST PICTURE nomination), a qualified win for his outward showmanship and the script doesn't forget to let slip his own monologue of what is made of his callous personality. York is also Oscar-nominated, and her final exit performance is so stunning, when she showers with her full dress on, after witnessing a sudden death, the horror finally overtakes her mentally, she is that scene alone should win her the golden statute which she deserves. Red Buttons, a showbiz triple-threat, previous Oscar-winner, also impresses with his physical endeavour in the derby races.Last but not the least, Sarrazin, with his trademark big, soulful eyes, is left unheralded, his Robert is so different from the hero image required for a leading man at that time, however his bashful, effeminate persona is so spot-on for the role, in contrast with a sharp-tongued and spitfire Fonda. He is the one granted with an opening flashback, as a young boy witnessing a horse being shot after breaking a leg (and the one who articulates the profound title in the coda) and flash-forward sequences (which viewers will only realise near the end) of being interrogated for an unspecified crime, Sarration is so unassuming and non-threatening against the whole backdrop of competition and dissatisfaction, his innocence is the last straw of hop in the story, which albeit hasn't been shown on screen, will be harshly stripped of in audience's mind picture, again, one should truly admire the courage of the filmmakers here, all the wistful tunes, big band rollicking aside, the film can blow you away for its uncompromising reprimand of what a degraded world we are living and a high point in Pollack's just burgeoning career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One-of-a-kind film about dance marathons during the depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"They Shoot Horses Don't They?" is based on the 1935 book of the same name and is a realistic look at those grueling dance marathons during the 30s broadcast on radio. Jane Fonda stars as an embittered biyatch and Michael Sarrazin as her na?ve partner. Other down-and-out contestants include Red Buttons, Susanna York, Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia.Gig Young stands out as the charismatic MC who justifies the marathon and constantly makes brutal exploitation sound like good fun. For instant, he constantly refers to the desperate contestants as "kids" when most of them are anything but. To him it's not really a contest, but rather a spectacle designed to make Depression-era viewers feel better about their own lives. No one wins in the truest sense since the winners' expenses are taken out of their prize money and what they "win" after a couple of months of exhausting dancing (!) wouldn't amount to much or be proper compensation for their considerable time and energy. Thus the "haves" exploit the "have-nots" to keep the other "have-nots" placated. You could view the dance marathon as a microcosm of society: Life is a rigged game where those in power make the rules and the poor can't win for losing, no matter how hard they try or how closely they follow the rules.However, there's another view that can be derived from the proceedings: The dance isn't really rigged because the winners ? those who endure to the end and refuse to give up no matter what ? DO win a prize even if their expenses are taken out. These expenses could be considered "taxes" withdrawn from the person's hard-earned income by "Big Brother," liberals who "take care" of the proletariat without their approval. As such, they can still win and get ahead if you don't give up.Regardless of how you interpret it, I like how the movie takes you back to the troubled times of 1932 and educates you on something you wouldn't otherwise know much about. It's a unique, realistic drama with a potent ending. I also appreciate the Southern Cal coastal locations. I was surprised at how good this movie is.The film runs 129 minutes and was shot on the Santa Monica Pier, CA, and Burbank Studios.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jane Fonda's best performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sydney Pollack's They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, is a very strange experience, a dark-hearted adaptation of Horace McCoy's novel about several people involved in a nightmarish dance marathon. I am at an impass here because I am choosing to reward Fonda's performance for a movie I didn't like very much. What is special is that Fonda here is that she shows a side of her talent that I never knew existed. She had been known personally as Henry's daughter and professionally as the star of featherweight pictures like Barefoot in the Park, Cat Ballou and the awful Barbarella. Yet, it was her role in Pollack's film that would show what she could really do as an actress.They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (a comical title but a deadly serious picture) takes place in 1932 in a shabby ballroom in Santa Monica, California. Fonda plays Gloria Beatty, an angry, embittered woman trying to enter a dance marathon with her partner who is disqualified because of a noisy cough. At the last minute, she picks Robert Syverton (Michael Sarrazin), a tall kid who is standing alone out of line. They enter a dance marathon in which a hundred couples have to keep dancing until they drop to their knees and are disqualified. Last couple standing gets 1,500 silver dollars. These contests were common in the 1930s and this one apparently goes on for weeks, with periodic rest breaks. The contest is merciless; it goes on and on and on while the sadistic MC Rocky (Supporting Actor winner Gig Young) scans the contestants to spot their weaknesses and exploit them in an effort to keep up the audience enthusiasm. He keeps raising the stakes, adding frequent heel-toe derbies in which the contestants have to heel-toe around a track for 10 agonizing minutes, with the last three couples to cross the finish line eliminated. As the dance goes on, it begins having horrifying effects on the dancers, who begin to crack under the pressure.The contestants circling around Robert and Gloria are an assorted cast of characters, all of whom are dancing as fast as they can for various reasons. There's the sailor and his wife, who are former dance marathon winners. There's the farm couple (Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedilia) who need the money because she is pregnant. There are a couple of wannabe actors (Suzanna York and Robert Fields) who are in the contest hoping to be spotted by talent scouts. Each one has a reason for being there and each one is desperate to win for one reason or another. They are willing to kill themselves for the money and the MC, in an effort to keep the crowd entertained, is all too happy to oblige.This is the angriest character that Fonda has ever played. Gloria exhibits not one moment of happiness and never smiles. She has eyes that betray a life spent in misery and pain. What is most troubling is that she is still young, still beautiful and her disillusionment in life has come to her while her age is still fresh enough to offer possibilities. Yet, there's something else going on, something hidden. We learn very little about Gloria's past and that leaves us to fill in the blanks. We do know that she wanted to become an actress but failed, and we sense that her pathway to that dream perhaps led her to the casting couch. There's a perfect moment in which Rocky gives her a suggestive look and she defiantly tells him "no." We also sense that she has entered this contest as a means of last resort. When her dance partner is disqualified during the sign-up process, there is a panic in her eyes and she chooses Robert, the only man who doesn't seem partnered up. We expect that something will crack, that her personality is a facade that will begin to fade once they fall in love, but no romance blooms ? Robert is just a means to an end. She is a woman hanging onto life by her fingernails and, late in the film, when she discovers that most of the prize money will be used to pay for contest expenses, it becomes clear that all the hours and days and weeks of continuous dancing are all for nothing, she has lost all reason to live. In this torturous rat race that "just goes on and on and on and on," she opts out, the hard way.This is a very effective performance by Jane Fonda. It explored a darkness that she never explored before or after. It was the beginning of a brilliant dramatic career that would make her one of the best actresses of her generation ? she would play strong women, professional women, passionate women, but she would never show this dark heart again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The lives of a disparate group of contestants intertwine in an inhumanely gruelling dance marathon. They Shoot Horses, Don't They? Is a movie set in the Depression. Gloria, played by Jane Fonda, has aged beyond her years and feels as if her life is worthless, through been cheated and betrayed by many of her friends in her past. While recovering from a suicide attempt, she decides to become an actress. Robert is a desperately trying to become a director, having no doubts that he'll make it. Robert and Gloria then meet and decide to enter a dance marathon together. The punishing marathon takes its toll on Gloria and she tells Robert that she wished she was dead, while at the same time those around her cruelly. At times They Shoot Horses, Don't They? Is difficult to view at times but at the same time it is so fascinating in terms of trying to understand why these people would put them-selves through such punishment as they have. While at the same time I found They Shoot Horses, Don't They? To be entertaining I also found it to be an deeply unsettling and emotionally draining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, 'They shoot horses don't they' is not for the fainthearted or those looking for a feel good firm. It depicts a variety of characters who enter a grueling dance contest during the Great Depression. Only the last couple remaining will receive the prize money. Over time the contestants will go through various stages of exhaustion and some have psychological breakdowns. The film direction is great, the characters feel real and the time period feels appropriate. This firm can sometimes be physically exhausting to watch at times and can be slow moving at around two hours. Overall I would say that this was a great character study but not a movie that will appeal towards everyone's taste in movies, especially with the fast paced, quick cut action that people are used to seeing now. I recommend this movie for those who wish to see something different then what they're used to seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A piece of Americana ! Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, here's my story about this film. I grew up in the 60's when we got to see older movies on the TV, that had been edited for time and content. That's where I first saw "They Shoot Horses Don't They?" on late night TV. It was one of those films that my Mom let me stay up to watch with her. I remember not understanding the title back then, but I remember being amazed by the film's story, even at a very young age. I was a big fan of Michael Sarrazin who I had seen in "Frankenstein The True Story", and the eerie, "The Reincarnation Of Peter Proud". Along with Jane Fonda, Red Buttons, and yes, The Munsters Al Lewis. I hadn't seen it again until I found a used copy in a store the other day. This time I was again blown away by it! It is the story of dancers competing in a dance marathon during the days of the depression in the United States, and what they go through for the "entertainment of the crowd" and the winning prize money. The performances are totally engaging,and director Sidney Pollack is at the top of his game on this one! It was nominated for nine academy awards, and is a stunning period piece of Americana.The entire cast is a perfect mix for this film including, Gig Young, Susannah York, and Bonnie Bedelia. You'll be as exhausted as the competitors following this one! Don't miss it!! By the way, I understand the meaning of the title now too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eugh...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this film, I initially thought it was incredibly unrealistic. But it turns out, to my surprise, the historical aspects of this film are pretty close to reality. Apparently dance marathons in the 1920s and 30s, also known as "walkathons", did proceed something like the one depicted in the film. Many of the details of the competition ? 10 minutes of sleep per hour, several meals a day eaten while standing, sponsors, contestant performances, the proposed "wedding", special endurance events ? actually occurred in historical dance marathons. Even the ending is not too far from reality ? in 1928 a Seattle woman attempted suicide after finishing in fifth in one such competition.However, despite the apparent historical accuracy of this film, it remained unconvincing due to poor writing and characterization. The character played by Jane Fonda was supposed to seem desperate and bitter, I think, but just came off as cruel and dislikable. She wasn't just defensive, she seemed to go out of her way to hurt and antagonize those around her. What a b****, seriously. The male lead was also underdeveloped; his only character traits were a sort of perpetual bewilderment and a vague fondness for the ocean and/or the sun. The MC was probably supposed to seem like a long-time showman with occasional moments of sympathy for the contestants, but his alternations between kindness and callousness just seemed inconsistent. The other characters functioned as sort of bipedal set pieces and were given even less depth and development than the main characters. In fact, the only development that seemed to happen during the film was a long, slow slide into exhaustion, both for the characters and the audience.This brings me to my second complaint ? the pacing was rather poor. Due to the nature of the competition, there were long periods where nothing was happening. These could have been used to give us some more insight into the characters' thoughts, feelings, or motivations but instead the audience was treated to periods of boredom, sporadically broken up by miscellaneous events, few of which had any real significance to the story. The ending just came out of nowhere for me, although I figured out midway through what was going to happen due to the clumsily-administered flashbacks and film title. It was as if, after reaching a certain desired length for the film, they decided it had to end somehow and this was the quickest way. Since we never really got to see why the whole thing mattered so much to the female lead, there was no motivation for her sudden plunge into suicidal despair at the end. The intended metaphor is of a broken-legged horse, writhing in suffering on the ground. But all that I saw in front of me was a bitter woman who was apparently unable to cope with the tragedy of a ripped stocking, an unsuccessful acting career, and a rigged endurance competition. And the laconic male lead, while seeming to exude a sort of naive sympathy for everyone around him, didn't seem to have any good reason for assisting in the act. If he really cared about the Jane Fonda character, he would've taken the gun away from her and put her to bed.There were a couple of other things that bothered me here and there. One thing was the pointless partner-swapping somewhere in the middle of the film. The Fonda character has known the Sarrazin character for a few weeks at most, most of which was spent shuffling around half-asleep. Why would she even care if he sleeps with some woman? The whole thing just seemed contrived and unnecessary. A second quibble was with one of the last scenes of the movie, where the male lead utters the movie's line that makes the movie's title. To all you would-be screenwriters out there: DON'T EXPLAIN THE F***ING SYMBOLISM! It's enough to show the woman falling down like the horse in the meadow. We don't need to have the guy specifically tell the audience what it meant.If I had to say the one defining flaw of the movie, it was that it spent too much time showing us the particulars of the event and not enough letting us get to know the characters. Interestingly enough, by placing the focus on the event itself and not on its participants, the film effectively denies the characters their humanity, showing them instead as little more than livestock. As a result, the drama is reduced to spectacle and the viewer is placed in the same role as the people who attended these events back in the 20s and 30s. I don't think this was intentional, but it was still interesting. It kind of makes you wonder: why am I watching this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the background in one shot of Sydney Pollack's great film, one can see the poster for MGM's all-star GRAND HOTEL. This places the film around 1932, when Busby Berkeley was beginning to put on his kaleidoscopic, dreamy dance numbers and Marlene Dietrich was gliding on the other side of the gauze-filtered camera. These are the films that were popular distractions, one which Jean Harlow lookalike Alice Leblanc (Susannah York) probably flocked to see. THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? (TSHDT) is closer in tone with the gritty noir films starring Paul Muni, I WAS A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG and SCARFACE, deeply black portraits of a world gone crazy--films which the strong-willed but brittle Gloria Beatty (Jane Fonda in one of her greatest performances) surely would've tipped her hat off to. TSHDT is closer to the latter, though the contestants are deceived by images of the former, with females hoping to be noticed by talent scouts or directors in the audience. This false sense of hope is what causes them to be put through an inhumane dance marathon (which includes dancing for 10+hour stretches and three-legged races) that really makes the contestants closer to cattle than humans, bet on for sport and by the end hoping for a way out. The marathon will eventually break the spirits or minds or bodies of almost everyone involved in one shape or form, leading to a finale that may be downbeat, but all the same I feel that there's really no other way this film could've ended.There are flaws in the late Sydney Pollack's depressing Depression-era masterpiece, the first being the flash-forwards that take us out of the action and try to make it be a murder mystery that really doesn't matter (I feel Pollack was trying too hard to make Robert, Gloria's dance partner, likable), and the second is Michael Sarrazin's bland performance next to the ferocity of Jane Fonda's amazing performance as the brave but breaking spirit Gloria, the quiet explosion of Susannah York and Gig Young as the ringmaster who knows he's manipulating the contestants. But Pollack's film is tonally assured--one can almost feel the exhaustion of the parade of desperate people who become human race horses, agreeing to be part of a non-stop dance contest in the blind hope of getting a $1,500 prize money. And yet even before the downbeat and unresolved ending, we never really care about who wins the contest--not because we aren't fascinated by the characters, but because already we can sense that there will be no happy ending (trust me, this ain't Capra) for these survivors struggling not to lose themselves to their environment. Maybe the bigger reason for doing the contest isn't the money--maybe it's the need to have hope in something.</fullReview>

The performances from the whole cast was good but Lady Jane's performance was superb. She played the aggressive, angry but strong woman who, with the help of Sarrazin, commits suicide. The great Sydney Pollack proves that he once again can make movies that people care about and feel. It was the same with Out Of Africa. This film is sensitive and if you are gonna watch it, then be prepared to see something you have never seen before. The depression could really make people do some crazy things. Thanks</fullReview>

But, like Ultimate Fighting Championships today, I feel no connection with those who "enjoy" the grinding up of folks for its own sake. That's what seems to distinguish the old dance marathons: people in the audience feeling superior or some kind of rush for not being nearly half as bad off as those on the floor. I guess in evaluating the morality of a promoter like Rocky relative to a good share of the fans?some fans were genuinely caring, and sought heroism of a sort?who like seeing humiliation, I'd give the edge to Rocky....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2010</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Period Piece, Far ahead of its time!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Pollack's foray into the "Period Piece" genre is without a doubt, a milestone in effective casting and direction, it is in many ways very hard to watch without feeling an occasional wince. The film starts out with a vague vignette of a boy (Robert in youth) witnessing the slaying of a horse. He is a young man that enjoys the simple pleasures in life, like watching the lapping waves of the ocean, and this is precisely how the film commences, with an air of sadness and beauty. Shortly after this monochromatic flashback, we witness a large line of anxious contestants, preparing for the Dance Deby Marathon. It is made extremely apparent by the end of the film, that not one of the contestants is prepared for not only the physical agonies and exhaustion they will face, but how challenging it is to one's fortitude. Although the story is presented from the probing eye of realism, Pollack's seamless direction and compassionate central characters make the film bearable. If not for these, as well as it's artistic merit, the film would come across as austerely depressing. The central Characters Gloria and Robert were played equally well, full of nuance, pathos, and humanity. The chemistry between Sarrzin and Fonda was electrifying.Although the film garnered many fine performances, Gig Young as Rocky, the calloused, lonely Owner and Proctor of this horrid spectacle won the Academy Award for his exceptional performance. I could go on and on (literally) regarding the quality and subtly of the film, but, I don't plan on writing a book if you know what I mean. Overall, "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is a powerful study of history and human nature, with some very shocking implications and tough questions. Along with the many layers and realistic characters, the underlying message is one of humanity, of how cruel and strange people behave in distress. The fact that the film is based on true events in our history adds to the viscerally disturbing nature of the story. It's message is universal, the performances, exceptional (especially Jane Fonda), and it's images, unforgettable! I give it my strongest and most heartfelt recommendation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dance Marathon of Life and Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1969, at the beginning of Jane Fonda's career, it certainly promised a long one to this young and talented actress. She almost steals the show, folks. The time is in the 1930s, the place a Steel Pier look alike at the beach. The setting is a dance marathon that lasts for days until the last person drops over from fatigue. It seems everybody that enters this contest have their own desperate reason for doing it. Gig Young is brilliant as the master of ceremonies. I believe he got the Academy Award for Supporting Actor with this. Well deserved. Think Fonda should have won Best Actress. Others in this stellar cast are Michael Sarrazin, in a thankless role really, Red Buttons, a young Bruce Dern, Bonnie Bedelia, who is very good in this and Susannah York who should have received Best Supoporting Actress for this. It does get depressing after a while, but director, Sydney Pollock, made it all work well. There was eventually a Broadway stage version of this called Steel Pier. It starred Gregory Harrison in the Gig Young role.</fullReview>

Gig Young also gives the performance of his lifetime as the seedy, Master of Ceremonies, of this sadistic show with a paying audience. A 9 out of 10. Best performance = J. Fonda.Michael Sarrazin is fine as Ms. Fonda's dance partner, Red Buttons (Oscar Winner for SAYONARA) is demented and driven, Bonnie Bedelia is sweet and sad, Bruce Dern is animal-like as her husband, and Suzannah York is incredible as a Harlow-wannabe that doesn't quite live up to it. 9 or 10 Oscar nom's with one win. Adapted from a great novel by Horace McCoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is a gripping tale of just how desperate people were for money during the most difficult years of the Depression. Jane Fonda gives one of her greatest performances as Gloria, one of the many people who struggles during a dance marathon to gain some money. This is a great character study, and one of the most memorable movies of the 1960's. While it's very depressing, it's a powerful movie that's not to be missed. I strongly recommend "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" to any film fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relevant desperation or an exercise in angst?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has haunted me for three decades and recently I found the video for sale. My memory had glossed over just how grim and full of despair this film portrays life for its characters. It seemed too grim, too dark to be relevant now. But that, in a way, was also how I watched this film three decades ago.Just as before, it was later that the underlying images and conflicts in the film surfaced in my thinking: the characters, with a few obvious exceptions, do not recognize just how grim, how desperate their lives are. Even Ruby, so full of angst and anger, spitting bitter cynicism and despair, does not recognize how little hope there is of anything better until Rocky clues her in to what happens even if they win.In part the film eventually demands us to examine our own marathons, our jobs and careers, our social ambitions, and to ask ourselves why. The implication too is to ask ourselves to question what we might be sacrificing in order to stay in the dance, so to speak. It offers no answer but succumbing or death, and in that remains an exercise in gloom and despair, leaving us to walk away from this film, on our own, to find and embrace something more positive in our lives.No, this is not a good film to watch for those already feeling down about their lot in life. It is, however, a powerful, intense work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw the last third of this film, and kicked myself for sitting through "Mrs Doubtfire" on the other channel while this famous film was on. It was dubbed into Spanish, which I don't understand very well, so I really concentrated on the look of the film. I found the clothes and hairlsytles and sets -- all that dark wood and faintly sordid-looking red velvet -- really convincing, as well as beautiful to look at. The sprinting scene, with all that bug-eyed desperation, was also brilliantly done. That "Bonnie and Clyde" rubbish, made at more or less the same time, I think, and set in the same era, was on the telly a month or two ago. It really makes you appreciate the quality of this film. I thought Susannah York went nuts quite convincingly and tragically, though I was surprised that showering in her clothes was enough to convince the other dancers that she'd lost it. My biggest gripe is that Jane Fonda kept looking fresh-faced and beautiful for far too long, even as Susannah York got convincingly haggard. And right at the end, when she and Robert are out there looking at the sea, they don't move like exhausted people. After just one hard night when I was young one would move a lot more slowly and erratically than those two moved after supposedly dancing for more than 40 days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As bleak as can be!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite possibly the bleakest movie Hollywood has ever produced. Sydney Pollack's brilliant film of Horace McCoy's slim novel is a grueling viewing experience. Set against the backdrop of a depression-era dance marathon, THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY stars Jane Fonda and Michael Sarazzin as an unexpected couple literally competing for their lives. Director Pollack keeps things moving at a brisk clip through a slew of subplots involving the likes of Red Buttons, Susannah York, Bruce Dern and, best of all, Gig Young as the emcee. He's like a carnival barker version of the Joel Grey character in CABARET. Young won a much deserved Oscar, but all of the actors are excellent. This was Fonda's breakthrough as a "serious" actress.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one line summary is a quote from the DVD package, and it's apt. An unusual and downbeat film that earned Jane Fonda her first Oscar nomination and established her as a serious actress. She was named Best Actress by The New York Film Critics Circle. In the diverse cast, Bruce Dern Bonnie Bedelia, Red Buttons, and Susannah York provide excellent support, and Gig Young is brilliant and deservedly won the Oscar. The editing,camera-work,costuming, and art direction are all first-rate. This is Pollack's most interesting film and arguably his best film; only Tootsie comes close. It was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, but not best picture; Midnight Cowboy, Z, Hello Dolly, Anne of the Thousand Days, and Butch Cassidy haven't aged as well, and in 1969 The National Board of Review named TSHDT? Best Picture. Not flawless but, a 9 out of 10. The recent MGM/DVD release seems to have brightened the image too much. The trailer for the movie,included on the DVD,is good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a duel nature within my head. Two sides of the same coin, so to speak. One is dark and shadowy and one is happy go lucky. I have to say that the dark and depressing Film Noir cynical side of my brain liked THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY?And what's not to like? A modern film noir movie (film noir isn't restricted to crime, you know) where, in the Great Depression, you can take part in dance marathon that go on for years and years where you literally dance till you drop. 10/20 minutes of rest, sleep or to eat, and then the dancing stretch again. People who are better off than you can go and sit and watch you. If you wear a jersey with a sponser on you can get a few cents extra per dance. And so it goes, it goes. On and on in a depressing circus, around and around, where it stop no one knows. Some go crazy, some die on this dancing floor, everyone marching in tune with the dance of death. The people on the floor dance for the grand prize that they will never get!It's pretty obvious the dancefloor and dance is symbolism for life. The people on the floor are the poor and the downtrodden (Les Miserables, if you will) of society and the guys watching are the rich and well off. And you are in the circus which we call life. Gig Young, as the cruel two faced commentator who I suspect is supposed to be God. In the end all humans are like horses. (!!!Spoiler begins here!!!)And the only way out is to kill yourself and if you are in misery you got to get shot like a horse! You get the picture....(!!!Spoiler ends here!!!)Then (thank goodness) my reasonable side (which is also my happy go-lucky side) flips over and cries halt to all the negative absurdism that this movie throws at the audience. Sure, life is a pretty horrible deal, but it isn't that bad! I guess the filmmakers (for shame, Pollack!) are just trying to get the audience to commit suicide. God is not cruel and two-faced! And life isn't that repetative! Life has meaning! Life has good things! Look out the beauty of the ocean, of mountains, of good movies like Casablanca, Ben Hur, Vertigo (bad example, maybe), Maltese Falcon. What about great books like Les Miserables, Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia! Life is not as bad as this! And God is Good, despite what some materialists think. And materialists, I guess, won't like this movie either since it's against materialism as well.I am a firm believer that life is what you make it! Just as long as you stop dreaming and get some direction!In short, this movie is too negative for me to take seriously. But, for the type of movie that it is, They Shoot Horses, don't they? is a masterpiece! It certainly is not overated! And, even though I don't like it, even my reasonable and happy-go-lucky side has to agree that it a good movie for what it is.I would have given it a 9, but that Yowza Yowza Yowza got on my nerves. Probably has to do with the theme of repetativeness. But by this time I don't care....8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Metaphorically overflowing, punishingly grim glimpse into the emerging mindset (at least among the younger generation) of the late 1960's: It will fool you. It will toy with you. But the world is rotten. You stand no chance. The whole thing is rigged. Much more difficult to accept here in the year 2000 of course, and perhaps that partly explains how it's slipped somewhat into obscurity, but this is a legitimate classic. It has the throb and breathlessness of great filmmaking. Like the director, Sydney Pollack, HAD to get this story out there, or else he'd go insane. It's also an invaluable historical document not only of Vietnam-era pessimism and disillusionment but of the time when it's set, the Depression, as well.The tragic actor Gig Young has been given the role of a lifetime and he tears into it like a dog that seldom gets fed. It's an extraordinary, shattering performance and it's unfortunate that he wasn't able to translate his Oscar win into consistently better parts in the years to come. The whole cast is outstanding; I'd be surprised if actors like Michael Conrad, Bonnie Bedelia and Red Buttons didn't consider this to be their most cherished achievement in film. A young, wide-eyed Michael Sarrizin functions well as our point of access into this alien world of 1930's marathon dance contests, but I agree with the critic Pauline Kael that his big action at the end is under-motivated, based on how he's decided to play his character up to that point.But the movie belongs to Jane Fonda. When she defiantly implores her exhausted to the point of dying marathon partner "Hang onto me! I'm tired of losing!" your heart will break. This is a movie about hollow victories, the hollowest. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>'They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,' is a film that is as complex as life, itself. It is a multi-layered account of Depression-Era life, that makes subtle statements about life in that era, life in the time the film was made, and how human nature is to capitalize on the pain of others, in our society.First, the film is an historically accurate detail of the lengths desperate people went to, during the Depression. The contest, itself, involved the constant breakdown of human spirit -- something that often happens in life, on a much larger scale.Second, the film is an example of the era that produced it. Movies had just begun to break the censorship that bound them, for nearly 70 years. The harsh reality displayed in the movie is a direct result of the filmmaking industry's new found freedoms; and it couldn't have come at a better time. The brutality in the film is necessary for maximum effect. Late 60's culture is evident, as well. Following a series of political assassinations, America had "lost its innocence," and often searched for truth.Finally, it is human nature to survive. In 'They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,' everyone tries to take advantage of the weak -- it's a constant battle between contestants, when the real battle is against the authority (Another trait of the 60's era). Most of the characters don't realize that the enemy is the system, which makes money off of their misery. This is an excellent film, as good as an other movie, ever made. Please, if you have a chance, check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sydney Pollack's marvellous 1969 movie, set in the weeks-long torment of a Depression dance marathon, is, among other things, probably the darkest movie ever made in Hollywood. The metaphor of the dance marathon resonates in all directions--as a more literally murderous version of Hollywood, as an illustration of the shackles of the race toward wealth and comfort, as a sort of perverse Holocaust trope, and as perhaps the movies' most indelible image of Hell itself. Pollack pulls no punches and throws no sops; he keeps you right in there with the anguished, then numb, then delirious couples lunging at that prize money.The discipline of Pollack's work is amazing, and some may find his rigor unduly punishing--there's not a sentimental wink or a relaxation into humor in the movie. ("No sunshine lessons," the heroine advises her naif partner.) Every moment in it drives along to the climactic scene, from which the title is derived--and yet no matter how many times you've seen it, its brazenness is still almost unbelievable. The performances are what makes the picture haunting thirty years later. As the prickly force field Gloria, Jane Fonda seems Bryn Mawrish in the early scenes but has an amazing moment late in the picture when the loss of an article of clothing brings on a thousand sleepless hours' worth of breakdown. Her opposite number, Michael Sarrazin, is the wide-eyed picture of innocence burnt. That careworn matinee idol Gig Young is a dream as the rancid emcee, and as a deluded British actress, Susannah York gives the performance of a lifetime. A mad scene in a shower is further aided by Pollack's use of desaturated color. In that one brief scene, all the shellshock and horror of 1969 seems to capture you and transport you back to that moment. Which, by the way, reminds me of the movie's other resonance: If you think this is just a movie about the thirties, you'd better watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spinning like the wheel of fortune/this one ends in tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most common motifs of the Middle Ages was that of the wheel of fortune. The apex being the best of luck, good fortune and plenty. The low point being misery or that of the dispossessed. The idea that one could at one time or another end up anywhere on the wheel must have been great solace to those who felt they were at the bottom.In Sydney Pollack's 1969 film, `They Shoot Horses, Don't They?' we are given this idea of life in a microcosm. The film, set during the Great Depression is a perfect representation of the same kind of desperation felt during the Middle Ages (or any age, for that matter). This film looks at the Great Depression, and the gimick of a Dance Marathon as a depiction of times in history when the fear of utter loss is very acute. The people facing this challenge are represented in the film by the marathon dancers. The dancers are an ensemble cast including: Jane Fonda as Gloria Beatty, Michael Sarrazin as Robert Syverton, Susannah York as Alice LeBlanc, Red Buttons as `Sailor,' Bonnie Bedelia as Ruby, Bruce Dern as James, and other minor characters.Of course, certain people have always seemed to be outside of the desperation of life. There are peoples whose fortunes seem set, and sometimes may even seem to be puppet-masters pulling the strings. This was represented in the film by the characters such as Gig Young as `Rocky,' and his partner Al Lewis (III) as `Turkey.' Even an audience members seemed to be one of the quasi-puppet-masters (the audience were people who paid to come see these grueling marathons as entertainment) most notably represented by Madge Kennedy as Mrs. Laydon. In this respect it reminded me of Greek Tragedy (mainly the Ilyad,) with the non-dancing cast as part of the pantheon of gods. Sometimes they are empathetic to the mortals (the cast on the dance floor). Just as in the Greek stories, the gods are pulling for their own personal favorite.This film is an example of good acting. The acting is so critical to the enjoyment of an otherwise very depressing story. Each of the actors was completely believable in the part the played. No one's acting was `over the top.' I would note however, that Jane Fonda's character, Gloria, was a bit too void of emotion, other than bitterness, until the very end. Her story-telling scene with her second partner was delivered a little too flatly. On the positive side, it she is also in one of the best scenes in the film, which I will address in a minute.It was the lesser characters that really brought the most credibility to the story and the film. Each of the folks were merely background and then, we are sucked into the film, just as though we were in the audience of the dance hall, they'd pass near... where we could almost hear their individual stories... just for a moment, and then they'd swirl, sway or stagger away... back into oblivion.As we watched the film we can feel their desperation. In the scenes of the track, One might get the sense, `that's what I am doing. I am one of them... a hamster on the treadmill, all for the next silver dollar. For someone else's entertainment...'The female character I liked the most was a difficult decision. The Mrs. Laydon character (fits the Greek Goddess Hera role, to continue my earlier analogy...) sat with her kerchief waving, her eyes full of compassion. Alice LeBlanc, the platinum coifed, her eyes hollow as she finally lost touch with the only thing she had to cling to... her hope for stardom extinguished in the shower, just before she is escorted out, `exit, stage right...' As touching and real as these two women played their parts, I felt that Rocky had it right when he told Gloria, `I may not know a winner when I see one, but I sure know a loser...' and Ruby was certainly not. Ruby was determined to give the baby she was carrying a fighting chance in life... even off screen, you could sense her determination. So, Ruby gets my vote for most convincing female role.The male character that provided the best acting was tough, but the competition was not as stiff as competition between the women. Rocky played the Zeus role to a `T'. But it was the feisty determination and ultimate collapse of `Sailor' that won me over. His character was perhaps the most human of the men. He really wanted to win it, you could sense that. At the same time he was not above feeling for some of the people he was competing against, encouraging them.I enjoyed the picture, and I found it relevant to today's marathon. The silicon-valley is full of folks all competing for that somewhat empty promise and the same dollar. One of the wisest scenes of the movie was the dialogue between Rocky and Gloria. She enters his office to ask him to change the rules. He's busy at something else. She asks what he's doing and he points out that he's been keeping tabs on everyone. The prize will be reconciled after the bills are exacted. This is life. Anyone who's had a run of misfortune could relate to that. I was reluctant to watch the film after all these years, especially with my aversion to Jane Fonda. Nevertheless, it was perhaps one of the best films of the late sixties/early seventies.</fullReview>

Quite simply put, its a masterpiece. Jane Fonda's Gloria certainly ranks among her very best performances, and she most deservedly won the New York Film Critic's Award for Best Actress of the year. The same can be said for Oscar-winner Gig Young, and Susannah York who somehow lost the Oscar to Goldie Hawn in CACTUS FLOWER that year. I was most pleased to see that The National Board Of Review named it as their best film for 1969. Well deserved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yauzer, Yauzer. "They Shoot Horses, Don't They,?" is only moderately successful in recreating the dance marathon of the 1930s during the depression years.Jane Fonda and Susannah York received well-deserved Oscar nominations for their portrayals as dance contestants eager to win the big prize for survival. As Gloria, the heroine of dance hall contests, Fonda was the embodiment of a period of social turmoil in America. Her utter despair and hopelessness as a born loser is well depicted in the film. York, as an aspiring actress, who seduces, Sarrazin, partner to Fonda, seems to be in a whirlwind of utter chaos. Her cracking up scene in a shower following the collapse of Red Buttons is memorable and poignant.We feel the tiredness of the contestants as the hours pass and they desperately try to stay on course so as not to be eliminated. Due to the depression-like atmosphere, there is still plenty of food for the aspiring contestants to eat. It's very hard to conceive that Bruce Dern and Bonnie Bedelia, who plays his pregnant wife, could endure so many hours of this torment. The lackluster effect is somewhat offset by the derby sequences. Played with the tunes of California Here I Come and By the Sea, By the Sea the contestants jog quickly so as to avoid elimination. Red Buttons portrays an aging sailor who does a nice tap dance scene but it's too much for him in the end.As the marathon emcee, Gig Young won a best supporting Oscar. This award was his 3rd nomination. He had been nominated for his alcoholic portrayals in both the drama "Come fill the Cup," in 1951 and the delightful comedy, "Teacher's Pet,"in 1958. In 'Horses' he is right on step with the contestants, following their every movement. He is sort of like a town barker. Seemingly sympathetic to the contestants, he is nonetheless a businessman at heart.The film is truly a haunting portrayal of what marathon dancers went through in their quest for survival. Those revolving chandeliers shows a possible elegance in a period of want and deprivation. The problem is the gloom and doom depicted in the film. After all, even the Great Depression ended. It's still difficult to figure out the Sarrazin character. Was he victim of the depression, a lunatic or a loner caught up in an air of hopelessness?</fullReview>

Until today.As another fellow poster had written, before the "blockbuster" - there were these wonderful films and in the mid to late 60's we got many gems: Midnight Cowboy, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Z, Bonnie and Clyde...etc, etc. And now this one.This film is a horror. No..not in the way of today where we must see blood and gore and eye-balls pop out to squirm in our seats..this is about human emotion, the depths we will go to to survive and what we will do to obtain that. This film should make you feel uneasy, and it does. And every actor made me FEEL for them. The setting? Not in a place you would expect - but a dance marathon. I am sure many are already questioning how THAT could be interesting. Jane Fonda, Susannah York, Micheal Sarazin and the wonderful Gig Young made me believe.Disturbing, Horrific, Scary. You pray these times would never happen to human beings again for them to resort to such actions. This is film-making, direction and storytelling at it's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A musing on Pauline Kael's review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was in my teens people said that movies weren't what they used to be. As we look back on that period - between the censorship rules being loosened in the 1960s to the "Jaws"/"Star Wars" blockbuster mentality - it seems like a golden age of movie-making. It was also a period when "nostalgia" was gaining popularity. Nostalgia was big business and continued for several years with Bway successes like the revival "Irene" (w/Debbie Reynolds) and then the failure of the 1974 movies "Day of the Locust" and "The Great Gatsby" probably killed it (although "Chinatown" was an arty success and "Grease" was yet to come). There were the sunnier nostalgia trips like the Bway "No, No, Nanette," but there were also the bleaker projects. "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" was one of them, and 1969 was a good year to get it made. It's hard to imagine a studio deciding nowadays to make a movie about a 1930's dance marathon with a fatalistic lead character.When "...Horses..." came out it was hot stuff and still packs a wallop. I recently re-watched it and then read Pauline Kael's review. She gave it a mixed to negative review and I agree with her a lot about several things. She found the flashbacks and flash-forwards potentially confusing. I totally understood them in 1969, and I was just a kid, so her concerns about the inter-cutting may be unwarranted. Now the flashes just seem unnecessary and the music under the opening flashback is annoying. Also, the horse doesn't seem really injured. (See "Marnie" for a devastating horse injury scene.) Kael said (amusingly but with vitriol) that Susannah York's big scene reminded her of old Isabel Jewell movies. I don't know what Isabel Jewell movies she had been seeing, but I wish I could! York, by the way, is excellent as always. She had such an interesting career for several years around that time.Some people consider this Sydney Pollack's best film, and perhaps it is. He certainly has the touch with actors, although his sense of spectacle isn't quite as good. For instance, the pile-up at the end of the first "Derby" in the movie seems like a missed opportunity.Kael doesn't mention some of the excellent actors such as Al Lewis (of TV's "The Munsters") in what I think is a completely silent role, Bruce Dern, Bonnie Bedelia (Macauley Culkin's aunt?), or Paul Mantee who is barely seen. And who's the bald-headed referee on skates? Is that Severn Darden as Susannah York's partner? And there's another couple, both with dark hair, and he's very handsome, she's short, whose names I wish I knew.Jane Fonda is great in a role that is almost completely devoid of humor and tortured Gig Young had the part of his life. It's almost hard to believe that someone as beautiful as Fonda could be such a loser in a culture that worships beauty, but that's quibbling, especially since the marathon is presented as a metaphor for the rat race of life. Kael regarded the existential symbolism as Hollywood claptrap, and I get her point, but it is effective, especially nowadays when the public is even more fascinated by celebrity than it was in the 30s or the 60s (catch Fonda's glare at "Helen Twelvetrees" in the marathon audience. Twelvetrees is a now-forgotten 30s movie star) and also SEEMS to be fascinated by so-called "reality" TV shows that present people as spectacle (in reference to the movie's tag line).Another quibble is that the hairstyles in the movie look almost too good. But they did have Sydney Guillaroff, the greatest Hollywood hairstylist of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving Film about the Suffering during the Depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film because I wanted to see what those dance marathons were like. I figure it would be a 24 hour thing, but this film is almost like a horror film when you learn this kind of contest can be easily over a 1000 continuous hours of nearly constant motion.When you know that, the interest goes to the people to find the basic question, what kind of person would be willing to submit themselves to this kind of endurance run/freak show? Well, the film runs the gamit from a desperate young couple with a baby due, a retired sailor, a young hopeful actress, an older despairing one and one young drifter who almost gets pushed into this experience.Red Buttons as the sailor is one of the best characters in this film with his humour, humanity and will to win, which unfortunately is not enough. Jane Fonda is the star, but she turned me off with her character that doesn't so much speak her lines as snarl them to any target she can find. Yet, she does win you over when you learn that all the effort has less worth than she thought, and she felt there was only one way out.In short, if you want to learn what a soul destroying experience the Great Depression was, and how people tried to cope with it, then this is the film for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY? is a brilliant film, almost an existential allegory of the meaningless monotony of the dance of life, which unfortunately is also a fairly realistic portrait of suffering and exploitation during the Depression of the 1930s. When I first saw this film I was awakened to what a great actress Jane Fonda could be. (This film makes a worthy Depression film-bookend with her father's THE GRAPES OF WRATH.) The direction, writing, and acting in this film are wonderful. Susannah York, Bonnie Bedelia, and Gig Young are especially good, in addition to Fonda. Highly recommended, a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sydney Pollack's best -slight spoiler ahead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Influential critics like John Simon and Pauline Kael gave praise to director Sydney Pollack's almost-now-forgotten emotional masterpiece and it holds up better than any film of its time. It's a cynical, depressing film but its story looks prophetic in this Survivor day and age. A dance hall marathon set during the Great Depression becomes a powerful metaphor for human endurance and Pollack does something quite remarkable: he takes stereotypical characters that usually only work in literature -the seedy emcee, the hard-as-nails babe, the wide-eyed poetic young man, the old crusty sailor, the would-be starlet- and humanizes each one by slowly churning them through a meat grinder (if you will). The flash forward/flashback structure may be distracting yet it's faithful to the outline of Horace McCoy's novel and the film would be anticlimactic without it. Jane Fonda smashed her Barbarella image once and for all with the character of Gloria: the bitter cynicism mixed with silent tears and searing desperation make her performance unforgettable. There's been some comparison made with Fonda and Bette Davis in her great days but you can also see how Fonda had to have influenced future stars like Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver, and Susan Sarandon, especially with the no b.s. attitude. Gig Young also put to rest his charming playboy character and won an Oscar for his interpretation of Rocky. Giving his lines a feeling that rings somewhere between false enthusiam and lingering sadness, he appears tired, puffy, and sweaty yet never loses his dark charisma. Michael Sarrazin looks beautiful and underplays nicely as Robert, Red Buttons does fine work as Sailor, and Susannah York makes Alice a haunting, jaded innocent. Bruce Dern, Bonnie Bedelia, and a wonderful Allyn Ann Maclerie stand out with the supporting performances. The Derby sequences are timeless and probably the most talked about but there are others that deserve to be mentioned: Alice's descent into madness, a set piece where the contestants have to solo around the floor while Japanese Sandman plays is done with facial reactions and closeups instead of words making it intriguing instead of dull, the Gloria-Robert-Alice interaction is handled delicately and without maudlin soap opera dramatics; actually, all of the film is. Most important is the quiet intensity during the final scene with Robert and Gloria: it has an effect that stays with you. The laserdisc version contained a splendid commentary by Sydney Pollack as well as contributions by Jane Fonda, Michael Sarrazin, Bonnie Bedelia, Red Buttons, hairstylist Sydney Guilaroff, and producer Irwin Winkler. The bare bones DVD edition offers only a short featurette and the trailer. Hopefully, that will change. They Shoot Horses, Don't They? is a lost classic deserving of a special edition, not to mention more attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Betty &amp; I very much wanted to see this movie after completing our own marathon of books (B) &amp; films (F) about (or by) Gypsy Rose Lee and her sister, June Havoc: "Gypsy" B&amp;F, "Stripping Gypsy" B, "American Rose" B, "My G-String Mother" B, "Early Havoc" B, "More Havoc" B, "February House" B. June Havoc was in several dance marathons in the '30s and her "Early Havoc" details a great deal about her experiences in them. In that era, jobs were scarce, millions were hungry and desperate; there were no social nets: no welfare, no unemployment checks, no medical services for the poor, etc. These marathons dangled the promise of a rich reward to the desperate: the one winning couple left standing after thousands of hours dancing, moving 40-60 days--contestants danced 24/7 in 2 hour shifts relieved by 10 minute breaks for sleeping/eating/toilets (they were fed 7 meals in every 24 hours). Their promised reward ($1,500, for example) to the winning couple would be enough to buy 2 new Ford or Chevvy cars with almost $400 left over (in 1934). And even the losing participants got free meals and a place to stay--for as long as they continued dancing. (Among dance marathon participants, there were the newbies and those experienced from previous contests; those in that latter group called themselves the "horses.") This film only indirectly captures the desperation flooding America at that time: it drove these marathon dancers to compete and drew their paying spectators (some nearly as strapped). These audiences watched contests that were VERY similar to the survival battles in the Coliseum of ancient Rome.The film depicts quite well the common, transient bouts of psychosis (getting "squirrely" in marathoners' parlance), the lugging around of sleeping partners by whichever partner was more awake, the drastic "first aid" measures used to keep dancers participating, and much of the behind the scenes behaviors common in these inhumane, torturous events.And, the MANY ways the sponsors shaped their presentations to entertain their audiences: spotlighting talents of individual dancers, elimination derbies, destroying a dancer's clothing to make a more pitiful appearance, announcing a collapsed dancer was recovering nicely in a hospital rather than the truth: he'd died from over-exertion (the truth might create bad publicity).Also, this movie reveals the naked truth of these marathons: they were scams run solely to enrich the promoters, designed to lure in both contestants and (paying) audiences. The promoters deducted from the winning couple's $1,500 reward their accrued bills for all their food, room, sleeping supplies, "medical" care, etc. So even the "winners" ended up nearly as poor as when they started.Fonda's character from the beginning is sarcastic, critical, and not particularly likable. She'd obviously been previously hurt, abused, seriously emotionally scarred. Why and in what ways?--that we're left to conjecture. And that's (IMO) the downside of this film: that narrative arc is left blank. The film's upside is its poignant, rich portrayal of this slice of an American era.Gig Young's Oscar for marathon "ring master" was richly deserved; he was superb and his performance significantly gave this film strength.For such an EXCELLENT depiction of this slice of an American era: (10/10)--but for such an incomplete personal narrative of Fonda's character (7/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Shoot Horses, Don't They?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Sydney Pollack (Tootsie, Out of Africa), I was confused by the meaning of the title which I had heard a number of times, so I was very interested to give it a go and hope for the best. Basically, set in the Depression era of America, a big dance marathon competition is going on in the shabby La Monica Ballroom, located over the Pacific Ocean on the Santa Monica Pier, near Los Angeles. Many couples are competing for a cash prize of $1500, with Master of Ceremonies Rocky (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Gig Young, he beat Jack Nicholson in Easy Rider) keeping an eye on proceedings, and as time goes by giving no regard for their well being. Couples in the competition include hopeless feeling Gloria (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jane Fonda) and new wannabe Hollywood film director dancing partner Robert (BAFTA nominated Michael Sarrazin), middle aged sailor Harry Kline (Golden Globe nominated Red Buttons), delusional Jean Harlow lookalike Alice (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Susannah York) and her aspiring actor dance partner Joel (Robert Fields), and farm worker James (Bruce Dern, Laura's father) with his pregnant wife Ruby (Bonnie Bedelia). As the competition goes on the weaker couples are eliminated when they either give up or collapse, but Rocky is not concerned as he cares more about entertaining the audience watching them. Weeks pass with most of the contestants remaining to take part in the run included with the dancing, in this run Harry collapses, and Gloria carries his body for victory, and when he is found out to be dead from a heart attack Alice suffers a nervous breakdown. Gloria and Robert had split as dance partners, but without another person for each other they are forced back together as a pair, and they are asked by Rocky to get married for more publicity, including gifts from Mrs. Laydon (Madge Kennedy), but she refuses. It is discovered after this that due to expenses the prize money is being used, meaning there is hardly anything to be won, and shocked the couple drop out of the competition, and Gloria confesses how empty she feels and wants Robert to assist her in suicide, he shoots her in the head with her permission, the winner of the dance marathon is never revealed. Also starring Michael Conrad as Rollo, Al Lewis as Turkey and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes' Severn Darden as Cecil. Fonda as the struggling woman, York as the strange lookalike, and Young as the monstrous competition manager give really good performances, the story has an overwhelming dark side, and baring in mind the time this is set in you can believe it, these competitions really happened, and you can completely sympathise with the characters as they force themselves to carry on dancing, a good dark drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Johnny Green and Albert Woodbury and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film Editing and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

		<fullReview>I've never been much of a Jane Fonda admirer but I must admit that she does impress in fragment of social history although nothing eclipsed the outstanding performance of Gig Young who picked up a thoroughly deserved Best Supporting Actor gong for this role. By 1969 regular moviegoers had watched his easy charm and goofy grin punctuate a dozen or so RomComs (although I doubt the term was in use at that time) invariably top-billing Doris Day and Young standing by and watching her go off with Sinatra, Rock Hudson, James Garner, etc, so it was a sharp reminder that he could do drama as well (those with long memories would cite Come Fill The Cup in which Jimmy Cagney played a lush). Dance Marathons were a way of life albeit a brutal one in the late twenties and early thirties and a short time later June Havoc, who had taken part herself in at least one, wrote a play entitled Marathon. Horses is not for everyone holding up as it does a mirror on the depth of cynicism that obtained in the Great Depression but it should be seen.</fullReview>

This is one of the "best" films that has ever been made, and by far my personal favorite of Ms. Fonda's. I am hoping she will reconsider her retirement and return to the big screen again.....

		<fullReview>During the Depression of the 1930s, couples compete for a big prize in a dance marathon. This film does a good job of conveying the desperation of the time and is excellently acted, particularly by Fonda as a bitter woman, York as a Jean Harlow wannabe, Bedilia as a pregnant contestant, and Young as the MC. However, the film, like the contestants, runs out of steam, and the behavior of some of the characters makes no sense. The biggest drawback is the contrived and unbelievable ending, which undermines the film's achievements. The ending, along with the scenes during the opening credits, seems to have been tacked on just for dramatic effect and to justify the title of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sydney Pollack drives me a bit crazy. I like his ideas, when he has them. I like his approach to cinema as cinema first, story second and acting as support. I'm particularly fond of his ambitions in this film, especially the urgencies; life, context, camera.But it all seems a waste because he never has enough confidence ? in any of his films ? to matter. He's terrific at the engagement part, and then while he has us captivated, we simply discover that he has nothing to say. It isn't the greatest sin, or is it? We only have so many episodes in life that could matter; why waste them on mere Uncle Remus tales?You'll find this has two engaging things apart from the assembly. One is the intermingling of the camera in the contest, and particularly in the periodic races the dancers have to go through. This was in an era when this effort was both rare and risky. It matters though it seems tame today.The other is that there are a couple of terrific actresses, at near their peak. I prefer York of the pair. Its a more nuanced character, and the microhesitations seem perfect. We really care what happens to her. Fonda shines also, but all she has to do is spit.If that's enough for you, you'll find this an interesting visit to a bold Hollywood experiment.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unpleasant but powerful and generally well-made film about desperation during the Depression, the film also manages to cover some ideas about loyalty too. The dancers and the marathon are in many ways symbolic of life in the Depression, with parallels to how many persons would work rather than beg to survive, and how cotton pickers would compete for work. Jane Fonda and Gig Young both deliver strong performances here: Fonda cynical and unhappy with her life and the times; Young as a strong outer personality who is still weak on the inside. It is a gloomy and brutal film, far from entertaining, but that is nothing to criticise the film on. It is however episodic and repetitive with a very limited sense of time between events, and the film gains nothing by its awkward structure. Although the editing work in general shows skill, the editing in of past and future events at random points in the film is not exactly skillful, even if perhaps the writer is to blame; it either way further disrupts the continuous flow of action. Following the characters around, and gliding here and there, the cinematography is almost always good on the other hand. Although difficult to watch, the overall film is very good too, if not exactly flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jumping Through Hoops</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greedy ringmasters can persuade desperate people to jump through hoops like trained circus animals. That's the obvious, but deep, theme of this Sydney Pollack directed melodrama. The film takes place during the Great Depression, when poor people would do almost anything for money, including endure a non-stop, month long dance marathon.This is really Robert Syverton's (Michael Sarrazin) story. The plot begins and ends with him. Yet Jane Fonda, who plays an embittered young woman named Gloria, gets top billing because of her name. Robert and Gloria are dance partners in the marathon. Except for the first few minutes, almost the entire plot takes place inside a large building that has been converted into a dance floor, complete with bleachers for paying spectators who watch, laugh at, and cheer on the participants.Gig Young does indeed give a fine performance. He plays the film's villain, Rocky, the master of ceremonies. As he yells into the loudspeaker, his voice echoes through the cavernous hall, as if he were some great and powerful wizard: "Each of these (participants) is fighting down pain, exhaustion, weariness, struggling to keep going, battling to win; and isn't that the American way? You bet it is", he shouts, to cheers from spectators.Though the story's theme is profound, the plot is one of the most repetitive of any film I have ever seen. Once you've seen the first twenty minutes, you've seen basically all there is to see, except for the film's climax. The plot goes round and round in circles, and then just stops.The best way to describe my reaction to "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is to say ... I endured it. The initial setup is intriguing. But the plot becomes ever more tedious and tiresome. And I was glad when the film ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A marathon in more ways than one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well....THAT was an experience! I just finished watching THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON'T THEY and found it was a marathon in more ways than one. On one hand, the story is all about a dance marathon. On the other, watching it FELT like a dance marathon--it seemed to go on and on and on. Now if the film had some sort of payoff after all this waiting, then I would have thought my time was worth it. But, like the experience of the two central characters in the film, it turned out to be pretty much for nothing.As I said, the film is set at a dance marathon--a very popular sort of event back in the 1920s and 30s. In such a contest, couples dance and dance and dance with only brief breaks for weeks on end until ultimately only one couple remains--and they win some sort of monetary prize.The format of the movie is to feature a few couples in particular--one made up of a nasty and thoroughly unpleasant woman (Jane Fonda) and Michael Sarrazin (who has all the personality of a piece of soggy cheese), Red Buttons and some lady with no personality whatsoever, Bruce Dern and his very pregnant wife, and, two out of work bit actors (Susannah York and some other guy). The problem is that through the course of this very, very long film, you never really get to know any of them particularly well. Many were just like "the pregnant woman" or "the guy with Susannah York" but not much more. In fact, there was much more character development in the guests on a "Fantasy Island" episode. The only character who was more developed was Fonda, but sadly all you came to learn about her was unpleasant. This gave the movie a giant "who cares" factor and making its 129 minute run-time seem like 229 minutes. To make things worse, the ending really made no sense AND there were many, many plot points that were completely unresolved--such as exactly what happened with Red Buttons.Despite these HUGE complaints, the actors tried very hard, the film had the look of the period and the film got lots of Oscar nominations (1969 must have been a horrible year). Technically, aside from the script, the film was well made...but you wonder about a film with such one-dimensional and unlikable characters? Seen today, it's really hard to see what the critics saw in this film since it was such a chore to continue watching this film. In many ways, it felt like you were watching a train wreck--interesting but thoroughly unpleasant.By the way, and I know this is in very bad taste, but shouldn't they have had Gig Young do what Sarrazin did at the end of the film? It would have been a lot more ironic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems I am the only reviewer that didn't like this film.Although this film aims to reflect the desperation in people's lives during the Depression and that attempting to escape this can only lead to further misery and failure, I was never interested in nor cared for any of the characters.Instead of being unbearably harrowing and depressing (which the film clearly sets out to be) the film develops into a seemingly endless pattern: dance for a bit, then talk; dance for a bit, then talk...Even though there is little else the dancers can do, this makes for very dull viewing. Films with little action rely on a strong script and excellent all-round performances in order to succeed and this is where They Shoot Horses, Don't They? fails.There are good performances by Michael Sarrazin and Gig Young but Jane Fonda is badly miscast in this role. This woman simply can not act, she delivers her lines poorly and is not helped by some woeful dialogue 'I've got my eye on you' one referee says to her, 'Which one?' she replies.Amazingly she would later win two thoroughly undeserved Best Actress Oscars for equally poor performances in Coming Home and Klute.The weak characterisations mean that we can never care sufficiently about the dancers to find their plight either harrowing, disturbing or even worth watching and the story is further confused by unnecessary flash-forwards relating to the totally unbelievable climax to this rather pointless film.</fullReview>

There is no explanationto her negativism, so she comes across as nothing but anannoying bully who can't get anything right. We have no reason tosympathize with her. Robert is more sympathetic, although helacks personality.The movie moreover fails at representing the Depression throughits actions, so we have to be reminded by the characters in themovie that we're in the middle of the Depression ("She's 65 if shewas born in 67"). If this movie aims to be a psychological portraitof a breakdown, it fails miserably at doing so. It is only normal tobe tired after staying up for all this time, so I don't understand whatthis movie brings in; there is no progression or evolution. There isno depth to either the story or the characters, nothing exceptionalabout the photography or the soundtrack, so what's it about?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to comment on this movie without a spoiler but I'll try. ... The bulk of the plot depicts a "marathon dance" in a large indoor dance hall in the early-mid 1930's during the depths of the depression. Every penny was valued. The couple wore numbers like athletes. The couple who stayed on their feet and kept moving the longest was declared the winner and entitled to a $1,500 prize, a huge sum in those days.I remember seeing a real marathon dance at the Texas Centennial in 1936 and can say this film gave a very realistic portrayal in every way. This part of the film rates a solid 10 for showing the viewer what these Marathon "Dances" were really like. People were unbelievably down on their luck and would do just about anything to get their hands on some money or a job. It was a very sad and painful period in our history.There were many interesting though tragic sub-plots in the film, and these could have been developed further. A different beginning and ending could have made the film into a masterpiece. The acting and directing were good, but the unnecessarily contrived and depressing beginning and ending turned it into a dark and depressing downer. This aspect wasn't "art," it was stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Boring, plot less piece of trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An awful movie! The characters are all so deplorable, that the ending, instead of being sad, is joyous! I thought, thank God that this horrible movie with hardly any plot, is finally over. It says more about the writer and director, than it does about the era depicted. Audiences accept this piece of junk as an accurate depiction of 1930's America. Let's remember that movies are not reality. This started as an idea in a writer's mind, and was then brought to picture form by a bunch of people who had a very warped sense of entertainment. Not too many good films have come out of Hollywood since the 1950's. If one wants to see films about the Depression era, I recommend the Hollywood films made during the 1930's. Those films say more than this ratty film ever could. That the despicable Jane Fonda was nominated for Best Actress for this trash, only sounded a death toll for the greatness that was once Hollywood.</fullReview>
