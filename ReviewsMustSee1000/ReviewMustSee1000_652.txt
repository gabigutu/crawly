		<shortDescription>Terrific, moving film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"With Honors" and the French-Canadian film "Jesus of Montreal" are my two favorite films, period. "With Honors" means so much to me...it takes on an issue - homelessness - that most film studios won't touch with a ten-foot pole. Then, it manages to make a funny, warm, touching film that's also fairly mainstream in its appeal. It's amazing that someone could make a film largely about a homeless man into a commercially acceptable film without sugar-coating the issue, but they did it.Stellar performances abound here, including Joe Pesci, Brendan Fraser, Josh Hamilton, and the spectacular Moira Kelly. With a great performance by the priceless Gore Vidal - who's also in another of my favorite films, "Bob Roberts."There are also some nice shots of the Harvard University campus, and the film accurately re-creates the turmoil, joy, and passion and the hundred other emotions that come with college life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I´m one of those people who knows what to expect from a movie and the best part of it is that you can be surprised."With Honors" is certainly one of my favorite little movies so far. There are times when one gets tired from blockbuster-movies and cars blowing up and heros and spies and guns and the all-so-great 'wipe out the world ploy' (yes, I am quoting The Mummy Returns). I stopped by Blockbuster and decided I´d watch old movies and simple ones, so I got what I wanted but it was more than satisfying.I love Joe Pesci and as surreal and unreal as his bum version was, you can´t help loving the guy. There was something very ´common place´ (the poor but incredibly wise man that is) about it, but the movie has it´s merits.I knew Brendan Fraser could kick ass and look hot but I was pleased to see him act. The guy´s good and his character was really captivating, which gets the movie going.There is a lesson coming from the movie, but it´s not one that will make you want roll your eyes (although it´s perfectly acceptable).I watched it twice, and I´d watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeing It With a Homeless Person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film when it first came out and as it turned out I saw it with someone who spent a few stretches of his life homeless. The late David T. Frank was most moved by the film and I take that as the highest possible accolade.In a day and age when so few of us put anything aside as a cushion against hard times, lots of people are one paycheck away from being as homeless as Joe Pesci was here. Others like Pesci, have a debilitating illness and there's no place for them. The saddest of all are some of those with mental illnesses who are surviving on medication to keep psychoses under control.Brendan Fraser is a Harvard undergraduate who is writing his senior thesis when his computer crashes, leaving him with only one printed out copy. I've had the experience of losing valuable files when the hard drive I'm writing this review crashed, so I know exactly where he was coming from. Topping that off he loses that copy to Joe Pesci who's made himself a makeshift shelter in the boiler room of the Harvard library. Fraser finds Pesci throwing his thesis page by page into the boiler for some heat. Pesci's got him by the short hairs and they make an incredible bargain. He'll give Fraser back his thesis page by page for favors done. Incredibly he accepts the deal.More incredibly the two of them form a unique bond and Pesci goes to live with Fraser and his roommates, Moira Kelly, Patrick Dempsey and Josh Hamilton. Of the group of them I really enjoyed Hamilton's portrayal of the uptight pre-med student.The four Harvard kids learn a whole lot about life and what's really important in it. And I think they all will graduate life with honors.This review is respectfully dedicated to David T. Frank who checked out of life way too soon. Brendan, Joe, and the rest of the cast, this film deeply moved him, good job folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What couldn't you say about "With Honors"? I know! You couldn't say it was horrible, tasteless and uncreative movie. "With Honors" is what movies were intended to be like in the beginning of movie making. Like many or any good movies it has a great cast, excellent dialogue, and a small percentage of charm. In every cast members case this movie would have to be the climax of their career. Not one of the major cast members failed to become their characters. In fact, everyone hit a bullseye on what they were suppose to become. With four students and a bum, a college setting and a warm and interesting feeling, "With Honors" becomes a very realistic movie. One of which you wish was done on a home video, just to know that it was real.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So i caught this movie in the store and thought I'd give it a go because of Joe Pesci and Brendan Frasier. It's a very rewarding movie about life, and how sometimes we need to step back and see that we're all human. I'll definatly have to commend Brendan on his acting, a great job, and he's won new respect. Heartwarming film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie with great characters and an awesome storyline. Brendan Frasier plays Monty who is obsessed with making it at Harvard, spending most of his time working on his thesis. In the story, Frasier and housemates (a great bunch, I might add) meet Simon, a sick homeless man who is living in a broken down van in the backyard of the group's house. Simon defies the stereotypes of homeless people, in that he's very smart and very classy when he wants to be...in an odd kind of way. Frasier is indifferent toward Simon, but thru the story, they both become very close, culminating in an awesome friendship in the end. The bad thing is--Simon is dying, because of asbestos in his lungs he picked up from working in the merchant marine. This is just an awesome movie, that's funny, touching, and downright beautiful. It's one of those movies you can't help but cry at. The acting is great, the movie is beautifully shot, and as I said before, the story is just perfect. The music is well done also. Great film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie through once, then rewound it and watched it again. I loved it both times through. This movie shows that you've got to choose how to live your life rather than just let it happen. It's a very "carpe diem" experience ;) It's also a perfect mix of comedy and drama, Patrick Dempsey and Joe Pesci kept the laughs coming. Not for the cynical or the bitter, enter it with an open heart and you can't help but be affected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With Honors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic movie and I loved it! Basically, Monty is a Harvard student who thinks he knows it all and is writing his senior thesis but while running to make a copy of it (cliche, his computer crashed and he only has one copy) he slips and his work falls into the hands of Harvard bum Simon. What ensues can only be described as "masterful" as Monty and Simon develop as the story continues with different little twists and an ending that leaves you in tears. You can really FEEL the portrayal of the characters from Pesci and Fraser, but adding Patrick Dempsey, Moira Kelly, and Josh Hamilton completes the group. It is truly a beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie for the subjects exposed in it. It speaks of freedom, integrity love for our selves and others, priorities and one nice look at a society changing towards individualism but never to far from mutual aid. the actors are terrific. Joe Pesci is simple and very transparent. Brendan Fraser is very good. Very smooth in his character's evolution during the movie. Moira Kelly, well beside the fact that she is very pretty. She plays an important grounding role. Patrick Dempsey, I never saw him much but this role was played perfectly. He plays the the kind very sensitives guy that does not take to much things seriously. And Josh Halmilton even though you probably wont like him at first he supports one feeling of wrongness trough the movie by not getting involved, fitting ones beliefs because thats Wat he was thought, and breaks down slowly trough the movie. Enjoy. This is the kind of movie you watch when you are down or that it is raining. It kind of makes things a little easier. Also see Dead poets society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was once asked: "What is your favorite movie?" in a graduate school application.I have many movies that I love and I couldn't ever decide on a favorite movie. At the time, however, I had recently watched "With Honors" for about the 20th time and I chose it for my answer. Researching the movie on this website, I was astounded when I discovered that it did not win (well, it wasn't even nominated for) any award on screen writing or acting. It was only nominated for Best Original Song ("I'll Remember", performed by Madonna).The film centers on Montgomery 'Monty' Kessler (Brendan Fraser) a government senior student at Harvard University, who thinks his life depends on his thesis. When his computer crashes, Monty decides that the reasonable thing to do is to rush to make copies of the only hard copy of the thesis he has. But on the way to the copy shop, he has an accident and the thesis falls into the boiler room of the library and into the hands of Simon Wilder (Joe Pesci), a homeless man who has made a makeshift home in there. At first, there is tension between the two, as Monty is outraged for the deal he is forced to make with Simon: for each day of food and shelter, Monty gets one page of the thesis. As time goes by, Monty realizes that there is more to Simon than meets the eye. The relationship between Monty and Simon develops into a strong friendship and Monty soon learns that there is more to life than graduating with honors.I am always moved by the beautiful story and the incredible acting in this film. The performances are so honest that the story seems to have been taken out of real life. The transition in the character of Monty, from a young man that considers grades and recognition to be the most important things in the world, to a man, touched by the life of a "bum" ? as Simon refers to himself ? who is intelligent and good-natured, and knows the meaning of love.The last few lines in the movie always bring tears to my eyes, as Monty reads Simon's self-written obituary: "He is survived by his family: Jeff Hawks, who always remembers to flush; Everett Calloway, who knows how to use words; Courtney Blumenthal, who is strong, and also knows how to love; and by Montgomery Kessler, who will graduate life with honor, and without regret."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely an A++</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one movie that I will be urging my future children to see. It conveys a special message to everyone, and that is the importance of distinguishing between "schooling" and "education," which we often use interchangeably to judge others in this credentialistic society.I thought ab initio that this movie was going to be amazing. With such a stellar cast as this, I expected a whole lot from it, but I did not really think it would hit me as massively as this. I have seen it five times so far, and the fifth time ? I was still shedding tears. And I must say it was mainly because of Joe Pesci ? of all actors in Hollywood! He delivered such a compelling act in this film. Don't get me wrong ? I never doubted Pesci's acting abilities, but after seeing him in Raging Bull, Casino, Goodfellas, and Lethal Weapon, it became harder for me to picture him doing a heavily sensitive role like this. But, no, this movie is simply an attestation to his versatility. I wouldn't cut the other guys short, either. Brendan Fraser, Moira Kelly, Patrick Dempsey and Josh Hamilton were all very convincing. Just?wow.This movie is definitely an A++.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly touching, and honorable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film with honors is a movie about the troubles of life and how we can't judge people the second we see them, since everybody always has a story. The movie itself is very touching and deep if you are to listen to every word and see what is trying to be said. It's a very sad movie, with a lot of meaning and a lot of emotion. Joe Pesci does a really good job portraying a Bum who is much more than what he seems. Moira Kelley does pretty bad, but Brendan Fraser does surprisingly well. This was one of the few movies that I cried at during the end. A film about Honor and love. It is a film like The Breakfast Club, but in my eyes is much better. This movie really touched me and made me see people differently, one of Joe Pescis line's really touched me. "What did you see when you looked at me Harvard? You didn't see a human being, you saw a piece of sh#t!" As a film I give it 8/10 because it's somewhat slow at the beginning, but as for honor it gets a 10/10. Actually when I think about it, the film entirely is a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Want A Degree, Go to Harvard. If You Want an Education, See Simon Wilder!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] Monty Kessler is a senior student at Harvard university. He lives in a house outside campus with his roommates: Jeff, Everett, and Courtney. Graduation was right around the corner so thesises were due. Monty was working on his that night when suddenly there was a power surge and his computer hardrive was wiped out. Luckily Monty had printed the first 10 chapters so he rushed to the library to have them xeroxed. Courtney came alone. En route, Monty slipped and fell, the thesis flew from his hands and fell down a vent and into the boiler room. So while Courtney distracted the guard, Monty ventured down into the boiler room. Once down there, he entered a small room to see a man throwing his thesis, page by page, into the furnace. Monty stopped him. The man was Simon Wilder, who had claimed this to be his home. He refused to return the thesis, but he and Monty reached an agreement: for each one favor Monty does for him, he'd return one page. He first requested some new underwear and a glazed donut. Jeff called campus security and they arrested Simon. The judge cited him with trespassing, public drunkeness and vagrancy, but Simon was able to prove himself innocent on all those charges. However he used a smart mouth to the judge so he was held in contempt and charged $50, which Monty agreed to pay. Simon was angry with Monty for what happened so Monty offered Simon a new place to stay: an old van in the back of the house. It once belonged to a former roommate: Boz. Jeff and Everett weren't too thrilled with having him staying out back, but Courtney gave him some extra blankets because it would be freezing that night. In the morning, Simon returned a few pages of the thesis and they go to the library to study, then they go to Professor Pitkannan's class where Simon has a battle of wills with him. Monty noticed that Simon had a violent cough and wanted him to sleep in the cellar, but that was off when Jeff complained. Simon could take the hint so he left the next day. Jeff, Everett and Courtney went home for Christmas break. Monty wanted to stay and salvage what was left of his thesis. Then one day, Monty got the remainder of his thesis from Simon along with a secret message. He went to find Simon and found him very ill in the streets. He took him to a doctor and Monty learned the terrifying truth: Simon was dying. He had been exposed to asbestos many years ago and it was slowly killing his lungs. But some days later, Simon felt much better. He even cooked dinner: Everett's pet rooster Gorky. Jeff, Everett and Courtnet return some days later; Simon repaired the van in the back and began work on his obituary. He said that in 1962 he got married and had a son the following year and that same year he abandoned them so he could join the marines. It's something he regrets. Monty and Courtney begin to get close when her boyfriend dumps her. The two go share a kiss ALL NIGHT! Later that night, Simon felt very bad. He survived the night so he requested his friends drive him up to Maine to see his son so they pile into the van, even Jeff, and head up there. They try to convince Simon's son to atleast talk to him for a little bit, but much like a creep, the man sassed Simon, told Simon's granddaughter that he was nobody and went inside. Jerk! When they returned to the house, Monty, Courtney, Jeff and Everett took turns reading Simon his favorite book, then Simon closed his eyes, laid back and would never wake up. After the funeral, Professor Pitkannan told Monty that since he turned in his thesis late, he had no hope graduating with honors, but on the up side, he and his friends did graduate Harvard and moved on to bigger and better things. What can I say? JOE PESCI RULES!!! He was so good in this movie. He deserved another Oscar! Brendan Fraser was good too. He can actually act! I'm impressed! This movie starts out funny but then becomes a powerful drama. Death is such an unforgiving reality and what happened with Simon was a terrible thing to happen to such a wonderful man and I didn't like the scene with Simon's son. That jerk! Sure Simon up and left he and his mother thirty years ago, but poor Simon was dying, I think his son should've at least been a little nicer. You shouldn't speak to your father that way no matter what he's done to you! But anyway, Joe Pesci fans, see this movie today! If you like dramatic films, I recommend With Honors to you too. Either way, see it today!-</fullReview>

If he would just stop taking stupid roles in stupid movies, he would have a much better reputation.I have read the harsh comments and criticisms of this movie and can't really argue too much except to say RELAX and enjoy a movie.This movie really had me engaged and emotionally involved, and I can't say that for a lot of movies. 8 out fo 10</fullReview>

But Simon Wilder taught him the importance of life is life itself, is to live it with honors. Life is too short to make mistakes and regret.. what i learn in this movie was that one should earn his respect himself and should see life as a whole, not just one happy or one sad day in it. Lets hope that when we died one day we would be proud, because we know we have lived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i'm tough on movies. i'm a critic for my college paper and i don't like alot of films i see. "with honors" impressed me, though.i have never liked brenden frasier but he fit this part well. i totally bought him as a harvard student bent on graduating with honors. he begins the movie obsessed with his classes, thinking that receiving his "honors" diploma was all that was important in life for him. he spends day and night studying and working on his senior thesis. when joe pesci's character gets his hands on the only copy of the thesis, though, frasier is forced to focus on other things. pesci handles this role very well. he has never looked like mel gibson or kevin costner or whoever the big leading men are and he was a fine choice to play a down-and-out homeless man. he's a great actor who is probably the reason this movie is labeled "comedy." pesci is seen as a pain by frasier and his roommates for a while, as they see him as being a bum and not an equal to themselves. however, through his kind nature and wisdom from living a very difficult life, he earns their respect and makes them realize that some things are more important than graduating college with honors. life is the thing you want to end with honor. to say these were one-dimensional characters is blatantly false. frasier and each of his roommates grow as a result of their relationship with pesci. they change their whole focuses in life and find what is really important: friendship and honor. pesci's character undergoes his own transformation as he goes from an unlikeable, greedy man to an honorable man with good friends who have great admiration for him.

Being successful isn't about graduating with honors or doing well on a senior thesis. It's all about people and how we treat them and remembering we're all different and each of us have a different story. Great movie and I'd recommend it to everyone!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alek Keshishian's "With Honors" was shown on cable recently. The film tries to tells us that not all the knowledge in life comes in the way of a university education, but by experience and hard knocks, as is the case with Simon Wilder, a homeless man, who has more knowledge than the young people that befriend him."With Honors" is a film with good intentions. It presents us a group of four Harvard students sharing a house. They are bright and want to do well. In fact, they have been conditioned to excel in their studies, but in doing so, and coming from some money, they are not experienced in the ways of the world.All that changes when Monty loses the only copy of his thesis that falls into the basement of the Harvard library. Breaking into the building he discovers the homeless person who is feeding his work to the furnace. Horrified, he wants to get it back, but Simon has other plans for him.At the same time, Simon, has a dark past. That secret is only revealed toward the end, and it comes as a shock. Monte and his roommates have to deal with reality as they realize Simon is a sick man. At the end, Monte, who has been a student expected to graduate suma cum laude, realizes he has learned an important lesson in his meeting that strange man, and how his life has taken a different turn.Mr. Keshishian got good acting in genera. Joe Pesce and Brendan Fraser do excellent job. Patrick Dempsey, Josh Hamilton, Moira Kelly and Gore Vidal make valuable contributions to the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out. If not for the comedic scenes early on, I might have fallen asleep. I'm glad I didn't. We don't often see movies that have dialog as real as this one. This ensemble cast just...plain...works. The heart-breaking reunion and the final graduation scene are forever stamped into my memory. And the real meaning of "With Honors" will remain with me for all time. Years later, I still have several pebbles in a bag representing MY fondest memories. This is a movie for everyone. I have acquired many movies over the years, but this is still one of my all-time favorites.

		<fullReview>The movie reminds me of the good old college days. The up and down times the kids face which actually develops them/prepares them for the future.Well Monty plays an impressive role in bringing out a university student from Harvard that takes in a bum. Both of them exchange ideas and feed off each others energy. Monty learns wisdom and life from the bums perspective and the pesci learns that life is not supposed to quit upon no matter what the situation is.I work in a shipyard, i understand the problems that people encounter when they are exposed to asbestos. Seems like things that you cant see really can hurt you. To make things worst you don't see it with immediate - its a slow killer.The caste is straight out simple, no complicated relationship and issues to tackle. Kind off reminds me of dps, maybe because of the setting. At first glance of pesci in the bums set up, i thought it was robin Williams. Overall an entertaining movie, would recommend to all to have a laid back movie with some hints/tips of life :)... from a fresh perspective.</fullReview>

It displays a change of heart through an experience that many of us don't receive when we are young.As a Harvard student sets forth to write his assigned term paper, he runs into a homeless man, a self-professed "bum." He loses his term paper to the "bum" who is living in the library basement and the "bum" makes an exchange for each page of his term paper. In the process, the college student learns more about the realities of life.This movie could change your attitude about how you view people on the streets. It could also change your attitude about how you view our president and other representatives.Love, Hope, Peace, &amp; Christ Be With You, Cal-el &amp; Black Canary</fullReview>

Pesci, who plays a homeless man, finds college student Brendan Fraser's senior thesis and works out a deal with him:he'll return the thesis one page at a time in exchange for food, room, and board per day.

		<shortDescription>A true work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An actor, producer, director, or movie studio prays for a script like this to come along, and it rarely does. This is a piece of cinematic genius. The casting was so perfect, that each character as an individual can stand, but when the whole cast is together, they make up one person. Fraser's character Monty is the Brain, Kelly's character Courtney is the Heart, Dempsy's character Everett is the Soul, and Hamilton's character Jeff is the (sadly) Attitude. But it is not until Pesci's character Simon is introduced that the characters realize hoe close they really are. This movie is funny, sad, thought provoking and smart. It is well written and the cast delivered a truly believable performance. No film has been able to compete with "With Honors", at least not yet. It is a bitter sweet symphony of life and it's rewards.I give this film **** (and if I could more)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie for two reasons.. Number 1 the soundtrack is awesome! There is music for everyone, from "Blue Skies" by Lyle Lovett, to "She Sells Sanctuary," by the Cult. And who can complain about Duran Duran and Madonna!Reason number two is the classic lines in the movie.. I love the line "I'm ending our friendship," and "I've never wanted to be a razor so badly in my life."I suppose there is a reason number three too, because I think that it is a great flick for college students (of which I was just one) to get rid of their self-centeredness, and to realize that there are other people in the world than just them and their circle of friends! And who hasn't had a relationship with a member of the opposite sex and wished it would be "more than friends."Excellent flick.. 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brendan Fraser, Moira Kelley and the great Joe Pesci</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an amazing meeting of the minds. In a time where compassion is barely making rounds, and where those who make it part of their vocabulary are deemed as lower than criminals, with honors illustrates that as individualistic as our society likes to be deemed, we are a community. Joe Pesci plays Simon Wilder, a homeless ex-merchant marine, who teaches Montgomery, played by Brendan Fraser, generosity and compassion. He retains a draft of Monty's thesis, the center of Brendan's grim existence, after it falls down into the boiler room of Harvard University's library.Pesci decides to leverage this circumstance and offers a page in exchange for various items which includes a van where he shall sleep. Monty, in exasperation, re-evaluates his priorities and the thesis itself as he realizes that selfishness and being cold, makes him that less human and honorable. At the possible brink of Pesci's character's death, Monty does a full 180 degree turn. Additionally, he then changes his thesis to the disdain of Gore Vidal.This movie is a must see for all that study, vote or even think about government and its role in society. Our growing homeless situation in the States and abroad is a reminder that we do need each other to some degree.An excellent movie by Keshishian who was also a Harvard graduate. The song by Madonna is moving and an excellent accompaniment to this stellar movie. Not to mention, a step up for Moira Kelley who had previously done that ridiculous skating movie and then went to do a sting on One Tree Hill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have wanted to see this movie for the longest of times, and now that I have; I can honestly say that it was definitely worth the wait.A moment that angered me is; when Simon is sitting with Monty in the library with Monty- reading from their books- then, this woman comes over and says (to Simon) "Um, excuse me, sir; but you can't stay here." Now, that, to me said one of two things; A.) That she is either telling him this because the library is for student use only, or B.) she is telling him this because of what he is. And my guess is, it's probably B! I know how people react to those in Simon's position. Now, on a lighter note; Two of my favourite scenes are: When Simon and Monty sit down to dinner, and Simon reveals that he used whatever was available. And then, a horrified look comes to Monty's face as he realises that what he is eating is not a chicken, but in fact; it is the beloved rooster belonging to his room-mate.And my second favourite scene is when another one of Monty's room-mates walks into the bathroom, sees Simon sitting there, reading a paper and says; "Holy s**t!" Then Simon- who is wearing a Tye-dye hippy shirt and sunglasses- stands up, looks down and says "You think so? 'Cos it looks like the regular, garden variety to me." I also liked the moment when Simon is talking about a dog he had as a child, and how it used to love chasing cars ("He got run over 3 times!")By the end of this movie, my mother and me were both in tears (But I wont go into the details as to why. You'll have to see the movie to find the reason.) Adue, Adue. Parting is such sweet sorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this film several times (twice at the theater). The formula used to concoct this film was just right. The storyline was not too slow &amp; draggy nor is it too fast that made the audience say "I dun have a clue what is going on". It wasn't too dramatic and the comic reliefs were very much appropriate to the scenes. The cast was superbly assigned. There wasn't much of famous names involved (other than Joe Pesci &amp; Brendan Fraser) to divert the audiences' attention to the main storyline.Even the music by Patrick Leonard blended nicely together with the main theme of "I'll Remember" by Madonna. It had that essence of "coming of age" feel and "being human" emotions.At some point, this movie was like GOOD WILL HUNTING.However, my only dissatisfaction was why wasn't this movie did not receive any Oscar nominations. Gawd, it seemed that the members of the Academy might have overlooked the quality of this good film. I was like totally surprised and baffled. I mean this movie was really really good.Anyhow, here's my favored list of categories that WITH HONORS deserved to receive:Best Picture Best Director - Alek Keshishian Best Original Screenplay - William Mastrosimone Best Actor (Leading) - Joe Pesci Best Actor (Supporting) - Brendan Fraser Best Original Song ("I'll Remember") - Madonna &amp; Patrick Leonard</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid drama with a bit of fine acting from Joe Pesci</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to school is a pain in the butt, especially if you're Monty (Brendan Fraser) and lost a thesis paper that counted for graduation. That's what happens to him in the film before finding portions of the paper in the basement to homeless man Simon (Joe Pesci) where a deal is made by the sheltered bum that if he helps him out, he'll give him the thesis paper along with helping him out on the report. Monty and Simon become pals where they know each other quite a bit about themselves; the homeless man tells Monty everything about life from wooing women to telling him the back story on what he used to do.Some parts of the movie are too cliché for a drama and some of us know what's going to happen in the end, but a scene between Monty's professor and Simon in the classroom is a true highlight to make students and fans alike raise their eyebrows.Not a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monty Kessler is on track to graduate from Harvard till the one copy of his thesis falls into the hands of a squatter in the library basement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monty Kessler (Fraser) is a Harvard senior on track to graduate with honors under the tutelage of conservative Prof. Pitkannan, portrayed with delightful condescension (and irony) by Vidal. Mistrustful of humanity, his father having walked out on him and his mother, Kessler has absorbed Pitkannan's viewpoint that the U.S. Constitution's "faith in the wisdom of the people" is misplaced, and has adopted this as the premise of his thesis, the one copy of which falls into the hands of self-described bum Simon Wilder (Pesci). Wilder's extraction of favors from Kessler as the price for returning pages is the film's McGuffin.As a plot device, this is admittedly strained, but so's that of "Groundhog Day," another film in which the protagonist learns that there's more to life than being a self-absorbed jackass. While Kessler's character is not as sorely in need of a makeover as Bill Murray's Phil Connors, the experience of satisfying Wilder's demands, then caring for, and finally, caring about him, transforms Kessler, as well as his three house-mates, played by Kelly, Dempsey and Hamilton.Several of the negative railings of the film on this site seem to be by "conservatives" offended by Kessler's abandonment of a Hobbesian world view in favor of an embrace of humanity, warts and all. Certainly the film is somewhat preachy and a bit clichéd, yet it is hardly hackneyed. Pesci's Wilder is a stand-in for the life-embracing American archetype immortalized in Walt Whitman's "Leaves of Grass," quotations from which arise seamlessly in the plot.Fraser's portrayal of Kessler is sincere and unaffected, less broad and superficial than his better known work in films such as "Bedazzled" and "The Mummy." Kelly, Dempsey and Hamilton, like Fraser in their twenties at the time, each capture something essential and vulnerable in the college students they portray. Through their performances, "With Honors" delves into aspects of college life seldom attempted in American cinema--the experience of forming friendships with promising (and even not so promising) young peers in a world where ideas matter and that life's most valuable lessons are seldom learned in the classroom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overplotted, overthemed and, at times, over preachy, nonetheless, "With Honors" is extremely satisfying. Much of the credit can be laid to intelligent, sensitive performances by Joe Pesci and Brendan Frasier, and some very clever dialogue. Part teen comedy-romance,partpolitical polemic, part "illness of the week" drama, the movie boast at least three themes: "rites of passage," "redemption through sacrifice" and "redemption through forgiveness". That "With Honors" accomplishes all this is remarkable and admirable, though juggling so elements means a few are finessed with uneven results. Hey, the DVD is worth its modest cost for the music alone. "I Remember" is my favorite Madonna hit and you get it here, uninterrupted,during the end title credits. Such a deal...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes movies have to be viewed in just the right mood to really stick with you. This is one of those titles for me. As a HUGE Goodfellas fan, I saw Pesci as the Harvard bum and had to give it a shot. Good lively soundtrack accents characters you actually care about. From Fraser's perfect puppet wanting to have a heart to Dempsey's whimsical DJ, they're fun people you might have hung out with at college. Pesci in far and away his best performance, adds the lightning to this mix, bouncing back and forth from hateful curmudgeon to bi-polar nut case in equal measure. Very few movies can get me to cry, but this one managed at the end. I recommend it for anyone wanting a good little emotional roller-coaster, taking you from mild despair to raucous laughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Honors is not a great movie. Nor is it a good movie at that, but I found the film to be a satisfying experience for one or two reasons. First, the actors do what they can with the messy script, which isn't much, although it has its moments, like one scene involving Pesci and a lecture. Fraser and Pesci really do their best with what they're given and I respect that. Their acting really "makes" the movie cause the story is not really believable, if you really think about what is going down on screen.Second, the film delivers a good message, even if it gets lost at times during the movie's sappiness. That's actually a good word to describe the last act of the movie: sappy. The movie tries to be a comedy, then tries to be a drama and then the process repeats itself so you really don't know what the movie is until the last few minutes.With Honors is messy, but some pretty good acting and interesting messages save the movie from being a mess, and although it's by no means a great film, it's an OK one.</fullReview>

His roommates are rowing crew leader Courtney Blumenthal (Moira Kelly), pre-med Jeff Hawkes and trust fund college radio DJ Everett Calloway (Patrick Dempsey). His thesis with Professor Pitkannan (Gore Vidal) is to leave governing to the political elite rather than the needy minorities. His hard drive crashes and he loses his only copy to homeless guy Simon B. Wilder (Joe Pesci). Wilder offers to exchange one page for every one thing and the first thing being a glazed donut. He calls the campus police on Wilder but the thesis is gone.Brendan Fraser doesn't really fit this young Republican character. At its best, the movie is a cliché with heart. At its worst, it's "Boy Oh Boy" annoyingly clunky. I admit to being a sucker for clichés with heart. I'm willing to buy into these likable stock characters but it has too many clunky moments.

The homeless man is portrayed by Joe Pesci while Brendan Fraser,Moira Kelly,Patrick Dempsey and Josh Hamilton were cast as the students. This film feature was directed by Alek Keshishian,who happens to have a degree from Harvard.This could have been a great film considering that it has a talented cast like Pesci who happens to be an Academy Award winner,it was just too bad that it has a somewhat a simplistic screenplay. It was contrived and clichéd as the viewer could have seen how the relationship with the homeless man and the students would turn out,how the conflicts will be resolved and the conclusion that came to happens to be no surprise at all.Added to that,the cast wasn't able to elevate it due to average performances despite having being talented and the direction was far from being wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With Honors is a comedy which turned into much more by addressing the topic of human motivation. William Mastrosimone should have written a novel instead of just a screenplay and it would have been a bestseller. With Honors is one of the great screenplays ever written in that it transcends time. I expect it will eventually be a Turner Classic.What I like most about the movie is how it teaches one to put oneself into someone else's shoes. There are so many out there who are completely insensitive to what others are up against. Be it inexperience, hard heartedness, or political correctness, the fact remains our world is full of those who completely lack the ability to put themselves into someone else's shoes.Brendan Fraser does a superb job as Montgomery Kessler, a government student who genuinely cares for people. He has excellent on screen chemistry with Moira Kelly, who plays the part of student Courtney Blumenthal. It's excellent chemistry in that Courtney Blumenthal brings out the best in Montgomery Kessler. She understands the term "love" better than Kessler and hence Joe Pesci's plug for her towards the end.Patrick Dempsey does an excellent job as Everett Calloway, the school's radio talk show host while Josh Hamilton plays an antagonistic role as Jeffrey Hawks, the spoiled insensitive preppie who is by far the least spiritually developed of the group.Gore Vidal is excellent as Professor Pitkannen and is part of a priceless sequence in the movie. It's fun to examine the countenances of those sitting behind Fraser and Pesci during the scene.With Honors teaches us to not pre-judge others as time and experience on this earth may equal great wisdom. More importantly it teaches us there are more important things in life than status and achievement; namely, love and compassion for others.</fullReview>

I hope no one actually associates the way Pesci (as Simon Wilder) acted in the movie with real homeless people. In the real world, Montgomery Kessler (played by Brendan Fraser) could have had this arrogant little urchin committed. I've been homeless. I know that real homeless people do not act like they are doing a standup comedy act, or preach constantly (unless it is someone who has psychiatric problems and they are off their meds). I don't know.., I just hate Joe Pesci. That squeaky, little voice coupled with the arrogant, Guido demeanor. He's not funny. He's just irritating.

		<fullReview>I think this movie is decent. I've read comments on it being only appealing to liberals, bashed by critics, etc. I, although being a lefty, actually think, that although this movie has good intentions, and some touching moments, does have an element of phoniness. For one, a big scene in the movie is when Peschi's character gets into an argument with a Harvard professor about the constitution. The professor actually says "Faith in the wisdom of the people is exactly what makes the Constitution incomplete and crude." There is no way a Harvard college professor would say something like that, the comment itself being totally unconstitutional. Feel free to argue this too, but I honestly don't see it happening. Also, in the beginning, just the dialog between the college students, is unrealistic to me. People don't talk that way in real life. I could compare that to the show Dawson's Creek. Same thing, it's unrealistic to the way people communicate with each other. I prefer movies that have a less phony quality. But as I said I do think this movie has a good message, which is pretty much about finding out what's really important in life, and there really are some touching moments.</fullReview>

He has given his character such a warmth and pitiful soul that you can't help but root for him in everything he does and what he stands for. The script is phenomenal and takes you through the film without even considering the film itself...before you know it the film has finished and you are left breathless and emotional. The acting is also very good and Moria Kelly is such a driving force and I believe this is one of the greatest acting collaborations ever seen. Over the top? See the film and find out for yourself. You will laugh, cry and consider your own view of the world and how you can change it for the better. One of the best films of the decade.

		<shortDescription>I'm ending our friendship?With Honors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Honors is one of those films that I remember enjoying back in the day, but never could recall what actually happened in it, let alone what it was about. Sure I knew that Joe Pesci played a bum attempting to show Brendan Fraser what life is all about, but that was pretty much it. Watching it again, probably more than ten years later, I can safely agree with myself from back then on how good of a movie it is. The acting is great and the story, while maybe a tad too sentimental and emotionally manipulating, is enthralling enough to stick with the characters and feel for them and their plight in getting through college with an education, along with their souls intact.A film like this makes you think about how good Joe Pesci used to be and regret that he has been out of the business for a while now. The guy never had the looks, the height, or even a voice that won't start grating on your ears before he even opens his mouth, but the guy is fantastic. He plays Simon Wilder with heart and realism, a homeless man who has regrets, but also piece of mind, knowing what went wrong and living life for meaning not materialistic necessity. In exchange for warm meals from Fraser's Harvard co-ed, he agrees to return the government thesis paper he is holding hostage. The paper is one that Fraser's professor fully endorses, but in the end is just a pile of nonsense that he himself doesn't believe in. Pesci must then try and make his young "student" learn how to see inside himself and realize that catering to those in power will never cause change or evolution in thinking.Besides Pesci, the main principles all do wonderful as well. It is a shame that Fraser has since rode his career down the toilet by doing children's fare and stupid comedies. Back in his heyday with this and School Ties, the guy showed he had some promise. Even the funny roles like Airheads worked, but unfortunately after that, he started to cash in the paychecks. Fraser shows that despite his jock physique, he has the ability to show inner intellect as well as a capacity to emit emotion. Some of the things that go on between he and Pesci strike tough cords and bring repressed feelings to the surface, but it is all a catharsis for both characters as they find out what it really is they need out of their own existences. As for the others, Moira Kelly makes you wonder what ever happened to her as far as film goes, Patrick Dempsey gives a performance with meaning while still keeping with his image of the day, and Josh Hamilton is entertaining enough to have made me see what else he's done since, surprising me to find he was one of my favorite roles in last year's comedy gem Diggers.Throughout the film, you know that tragedy will soon hit and the tears will flow, however, that knowledge never detracts from what is happening on screen. The writer doesn't copout when he could have, and the emotionally resonant moments are so because he allowed them to be hurtful and real. Infused consistently with the drama, though, are many moments of nice humor. No matter how serious Pesci might play, he is still a goofball through and through. A brilliant example of this is when he sits in on a government lecture at the school. His quips are funny, but when the professor finally calls him out, he holds his own and proves that looks are most definitely deceiving. That scene is worth seeing the film all by itself and it encompasses everything that the story is trying to convey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bunch of lovable characters in search of a plausible story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, let's just say I found this movie in a remainders bin in a downtown MegaBookSTORE/former empty storefront. All I needed to see were the words"Moira Kelly" and I was sold. So, I got home, popped it into the VCR and watched. I like the opening voice-over by Everett about drowning and Harvard. It seems very true to life. The story though was pretty clichéd; Bright underdog kid( Brendan Fraser) is a star at Harvard, destined for great things. Accident forces him to discover the underside of the Ivy League in the person of Simon Wilder, played by Joe Pesci. Simon's a former Merchant Marine who has been poisoned by asbestos while working and holds a grudge against "ol' Uncle Sammy" and therefore collects no VA benefits or disability. With no money coming in, his lives in the basement of Harvard's Widener Library. I found it hard to believe that he wouldn't get found and booted out. Through an exceptionally implausible set of events, the ONLY copy of Fraser's Senior Thesis winds up in Pesci's possession and Fraser needs to help Pesci in exchange for his thesis. Of course, the charming bum thrills the rich kids and ends up a house-mate( in this HUGE house that would go for at LEAST $4-5k a month and have 8 roomies instead of 4, but of COURSE they can ALL afford that, a la 'friends'. and then.....sob.....dies...but not before changing all their lives. It's been done and done better, but I gave it a 7 out 0f 10, simply because I liked the characters and the glimpses of Harvard. And Moira in a silk teddy......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely buy films. I hate re-runs.Watched this movie again yesterday on TV and as usual, it was great. No explosions, no shots fired and yet compelling and thought provoking.Characters are excellent and the interactions are great. Joe does some of his best work in this one.One of the few movies that I actually bought and watched over again. I recommend it. A very few here give it bad reviews but the consensus seems to be that it is very worth watching. Might as well take the plunge and watch it. Might just turn out to be one of your favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing film that i first watched on one saturday night in england whilst in bed. Its the first film that i've cried in everytime i've watched it, well the second, the first being My Girl (bows head in shame) Yes anyway, Brendan Fraser's character is a pompus brain, from Harvard, expected by all to end up becoming a high ranking government official. Simon (Joe Pesci) is a bum, who's left his wife and child. How can we feel sympathetic for this wretch. Its simple Joe Pesci plays to our sentimental sides and his love for pebbles is unique. He brings the ever rising star Fraser, back to earth with a bone jarring thud, as he shows that life in its inactitude gives some headstarts over others, but in god's eyes all are equal. As Simon says in his Obituary - and its all downhill after you've taught at Harvard!</fullReview>

(Especially Moira Kelly who is just lovely.)The welfare of a person who occupies even the lowest station in life (homeless &amp; broke) outweighs such things as turning in your thesis on time and graduating Harvard with honors.And if you don't find the bitter-sweet ending moving you haven't lived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm tale from the 90's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie as a kid, maybe 13/14 in which I could still fill the gaps and magnify the story by sheer force of imagination and innocence. Today I saw it again as a young adult and while the film-making doesn't shine and the acting isn't as top notch as I had remembered it, the movie still delivers a warm feeling. This is the type of movie that unfortunately doesn't get made in Hollywood anymore. A simple premise,contrived scope, time frame and number of characters and an optimistic view of the world and people. As a child this perspectives filled the TV and cinema,everything had a moral and the bad guy was always defeated. Today, the movies don't carry the same idealistic view on human nature, preferring the darker(some will claim more realistic) approach on character and plot development. I rather that we had stories of hope than displays of human atrocities."When we are dreaming alone it is only a dream. When we are dreaming with others, it is the beginning of reality." ---Dom Helder Camera</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many contrived, corny moments mixed in with smart ideas (see Joe Pesci's speech on the Founding Fathers), humor (see Joe Pesci's bath), and poetry (Walt Whitman's death poem). If you thought "Pursuit of Happiness" was the best movie ever, you'll find this moving. There's nothing new in this movie to be said you can't find in better form elsewhere, which is why I gave it below a 7/10.IMO, as long as you don't take it too seriously and you're with a silly friend or possibly a good plate of food to take the phony-Hollywood-fabrication edge off, it's worth seeing.</fullReview>

You can guess the ending once Simon's taken to the doctor's, but the road to the end is endearing with teeny surprises along the way.This has to be one of my best college dramas out there - far more PG than St. Elmo's Fire but as engaging. I'll watch it again and will recommend it to anyone who likes American college dramas.I've got nothing else to say but I have to pad to reach 10 lines so that i submit this.

		<fullReview>Sweet memories... I remember watching this movie just hours before I had my first month celebration with my girlfriend at the time. It was a cold night as far as I remember. This movie moved me because it taught me a lesson about forgiving, changing for good, but most important of all; not handling with the future adequately. The plot is moving and convincing for an audience that enjoys these kind of movies. If you liked "Scent of a Woman" for example, "With Honors" will please you completely. I won't get into the plot because many people what reviewed it but all I can tell you is that the performances and plot will leave you with a smile. Pesci's performance is terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bad movie wrongly casts Joe Pesci as a bum living under a library at Harvard where he takes Brendan Fraser's senior thesis and holds it ransom in exchange for food and shelter from Fraser and his friends. Of course the plot is incredibly contrived, Pesci's character is very unsympathetic and makes it very obvious that he has let petty things rule his life. Fraser and friends are incredibly underdeveloped as characters and one wonders why they keep Pesci around. The biggest problem with this movie is Pesci, he is completely miscast and makes you wonder if the movie could have been better with a different actor in the part. Of course the biggest question is at a school as prestigious and select as Harvard how can Pesci live under the library with no one finding out?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when i was a kind and i hated it, but that i saw it again a few days ago and this time i liked it. Most of all, you'll be interested to see Brendan Frazer in a role that is not humorous or too serious, its just a plain simple real characters. and Joe Pesci goes beyond "the bad guy from Home alone". The acting is not too good, its kept on a simple level and just strong enough to make the story go. The story itself is simple and yet there is more behind what is shown. The rest of the characters are individuals and the thing i liked the most is that the movie kept in touch with reality, what more and more movies fail to do. Some lines might be funny and so are some situations. All in all, this movie is not a comedy nor a drama, its just something to chill out with, or to kill some time. Not really worth much money to see...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed another error of continuity in this film. When Simon comes down in the kitchen after taking a bath and is wearing Courtney's robe, as everyone is bickering over him being there, he is obviously drinking a beer, as it shows him going to the refrigerator to get one. as the roommates are discussing him being there, he drinks the beer, and then when he gets up to go leave, and Courtney asks for her robe back, he puts the beer on the table, then it cuts to Courtney telling him to keep it, then in the next scene you see him pick up the beer bottle and it still has the bottle cap on it. As you can tell the bottle was never opened and it shows him drinking it a few scenes before that. I believe that wasn't on the list of goofs. So if you could add that it would be greatly appreciated. Thank You,</fullReview>

This is a good movie, but not great.The movie does have a nice message and all, and it has A-list actors (Joe Pesci and Brandon Frasier), but this movie was never monumental, and I am pretty sure it never will be. It won no awards and hasn't received much attention. It's a shame actually -- this really is a nice little film. I think it's tons better than Titanic, but it will never be recognized as such. This movie was made almost 12 years ago, and soon it will fade into obscurity.I doubt that most people would want this in their DVD collection, unless someone sells it for under a buck or someone gives it as a gift. It's worth it though, if you go for these nice small movies rather than big thrillers or cheap comedies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joe Pesci is great. Anyone who´s seen him in gangster roles has to acknowledge that. Those who saw "Jimmy Hollywood" will acknowledge him when doing some drama. But in this movie he is just phony. As if the story weren´t bad enough, of a homeless but brilliant intellectual, former seaman, contaminated with asbestos, fond of philosophy who lives in Harvard basement... (I´m not making it up), he speaks in a soft, dramatic voice that sounds really bad. It lacks some anger, some Pesci attitude of a short tempered short guy. Even Leo from Lethal Weapon crying about the death of his pet "Froggy" is better than the genius bum of "With Honors". Watch it if you like Brendan Fraser, but be advised: he never appears without a shirt on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fair little film that is never sure where it wants to go with the audience. Homeless man Joe Pesci blackmails Harvard student Brendan Fraser into giving him anything he wants after Pesci obtains pages from one of Fraser's major assignments. Fraser, terrified, does all that Pesci asks for. Eventually they develop a father-son relationship and Fraser lets Pesci move in with him and his three college friends (Moira Kelly, Patrick Dempsey and Josh Hamilton). As the film progresses we learn that Fraser comes from a broken home and that Pesci left his own wife and son when he was younger. It is also learned that Pesci is becoming gravely ill with respiratory problems due to years of work in a factory. A film that tries to entertain and tries to show that the things that are most important are not always the first priorities in our lives. The last act gets really emotional and the film just seems to be spinning like a top by that time. Some real good things are here, but overall the final product includes lots of parts that are not connected well enough to make a suitable whole. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Brendan Fraser plays "Stuck Up But Finds Out What Really Matters In Life", which I have seen a bajillion times before. You know what's going to happen from the second your eye catches the box in the video store. That's how predictable it is. I am always amazed at how many people rave over this film.
