		<shortDescription>An American Masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Faces is one of the first American films to reach to the &gt;core of people's relationships. It provides wonderful insight into a lifestyle that is distinctly American. The detached way that the characters interact most of the time is only a logical conclusion of the commerce-driven world we live in. The film is personal in a way that many European films of the 1950's and 1960's were. Even the title suggests the intimacy of the film and its treatment of its characters.Cassavettes must have been repulsed by the insincerity of the people who were surrounding him when he wrote Faces. Few films have so many moments where characters are together but not talking to each other. They are merely talking, or laughing, or singing, doing anything they can to avoid having to confront the other person. Only once, when the young lover boy talks about the mechanical nature of people in America, do we even get any hint that the filmmaker is put off by the behavior of his characters. The rest of the time he merely films them and shows us what they do. This unsentimental approach can leave the viewer feeling a bit odd, but it works very well in the end. By seeing these character's shortcomings without any hint of disapproval from the filmmaker, the viewer is forced to consider their own lives and the people around them. It allows for an honesty not found in any, I repeat ANY other American film of the 1960's. Even Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf has some indications of Nichols' attitude towards the material. Faces is just the facts.I can only imagine the excitement that people interested in film must have felt upon the release of this film. Here was a personal, Bergman-esque film made about American people living American lives. (Note: Bergman is referenced during the film.) The quiet desperation of the housewife, the empty feeling inside the businessman, the false nature of each and every relationship speak volumes about the reality of American family life. How refreshing it must have been to see these topics approached in an American film.The film's style is notable as well. It is independent in every sense of the word. It uses a fluid camera, freeform acting, and natural lighting. In many ways, it paved the way for a lot of the young filmmakers of the 1970's by providing them with a stylistic freedom that Hollywood had previously ignored. Today, it appears as a fairly standard film in terms of style, but at the time it was groundbreaking and exciting. In fact, it retains that excitement today, although the real revelation is how much has been taken from the film and used by others.Faces is a great movie experience. Anyone frustrated with the lack of real connection in their lives should see it, if only to realize that many others are suffering from the same fate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intimate, exposed performances that break down the fourth wall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is one of the supreme masterworks of all of American cinema. It is absolutely essential. Yes, it is "difficult." Yes, it is "slow." But those standards are for enterainment. Cassavetes wants to take us out of our ordinary ways of viewing. He wants to deny us the escapism of "entertainment." That's the point. If you have trouble with this film--good! If you find it infuriating--good! If you find it not entertaining--good! It wants to get under your skin. It wants to shake you up.It is a deep exploration of manhood in America, of the power games that men play with women, and of the other kinds of games women victimize themselves with. Deeper than Citizen Kane, more abrasive than Magnolia or American Beauty, Faces turns the camera on the ordinary, everyday ways men and women treat each other. It wants to get under your skin, and if you allow it to, without giving up or shutting your mind to it, it will profoundly enlighten you.I also want to highly recommend a stunning book about Cassavetes that makes a nice companion piece to a viewing of the film. Ray Carney's Cassavetes on Cassavetes book (or his web site devoted to Cassavetes) has almost 100 pages about the making of this film. Both throw more light on how Cassavetes got the amazingly intimate and exposed performances he did.But trust me, this film can change your life. It is one of the greatest works of art in all of film. And the resistance it meets with is proof of it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Marley plays a fatted-calf spawn of affluent suburbia, who is tired of his wife (Lyn Carlin) JUST BECAUSE!!..He goes off with Gena Rowlands, who condones infidelity if it is conditionally based on a bond between two people, and not just for purposes of sordid sex..The common ground all of the characters in the movie share is not love nor understanding, but as is often the case... ALCOHOL!!!.. The director, John Cassevetes, is once again superb in his character portrayal of morally inept people who rely on their misguided self-serving interests and callous logic to carry them through their meaningless pursuits.. Before we do anything, let's pour another drink...We act the way the alcohol tells us to act, the convoluted line of logic being " I can't help what I did and said, the highly toxic cocktails made me act that way".... These antics are more adolescent than anyone could possibly imagine, yet they go under the guise of sophisticated fun!! Such charades fall into the category of extremely dangerous thrills..both emotionally and physically as well!! A precariously select set of upscale Los Angeles clicks have unearthed an onslaught of social misgivings about themselves which have plummeted them down to a pathetically denigrating conscious pitfall level!! These fragile and ominous emotions inevitably become purulent once these individuals' drunken stupors have punctured them open!! SO NOW!! HUSBAND AND WIFE HAVE PLAYED SWITCHIES!!.. What's next?..For starters, they've been painfully reminded that their lives have been obviated from happiness and even contentment!!.. Self destruction is so ugly it just cannot be ignored!! Nothing works for me, nothing works for my spouse, nothing works for my mistress, nothing works for anybody!!!...Their ultimate undoing is not necessarily the marital infidelity on it's own right, but rather, emotions that are predicated on unscrupulous gratification, and a volatile unwillingness to empathize with anyone or anything!!! John Cassevetes evokes a cynicism in this film that touches the core of non-productive selfishness.. Itemization of the character's unchanging flaws is an aspect of behavior that Cassevetes implements in virtually every one of his films... Cassevetes articulates an introverted disarray with his characters in "Faces" by way of manufacturing a set of prevailing circumstances being such whereby the most felonious afflictions with all of the people in the movie are directly attributed to an affluent monotony, as well as an executive class alienation!! The end result of such a fate has fatalistic repercussions!! Cassevetes did not consult with the actors and actresses in this movie, once he assigned them their character roles, he then told them that they now owned these roles and they should treat them accordingly!! The camera angles in "Faces" are spectacular as they illustrate the pejorative reactions of perplexing curiosity with virtually everyone in the film!! Cassevetes is brilliant...Usually the debate is how brilliant...I say EXTREMELY BRILLIANT!!!... However!! I am not a professional movie critic!! SORRY ABOUT THAT JOHN!!! A great director does not even consider himself a director, rather, someone who just understands people... This is what I heard anyway!!!... John Cassevetes goes out on a limb by being so overtly non-conventional.. Guess what?...It definitely works!!!! AN UTTERLY OUTSTANDING MOVIE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good, it hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is the epitome of brilliantly dramatic character study: It's so phenomenal, watching it is excruciating. Cassavetes takes us deep inside the lives of a bored, shallow upper-middle-class couple, and as his skilled actors improvise remarkably realistic scenes, down to the smallest mannerism of their characters, Cassavetes forces us to watch every knife-twisting second. It's difficult: Rather than watching an unpleasant situation, then getting pulled away by an editor's cut, we have to sit through all 20 or 25 minutes of a scene that makes us squirm, whether it's a middle-aged man making an ass of himself to impress a young prostitute or his wife feigning laughter to make a young man think she's having fun with him. While not the best movie I've ever seen, it's unique: A great work to whose style nothing else compares.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Timeless Tautology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I began watching Faces, I realized that I never knew just when the present scene was going to end. I then realized that I wished that it would last forever. I found myself so engrossed in the scene that I was fascinated with it by itself. Then the next scene began, and the next scene, and within each one, there is a whole single movie with characters and a story arch. Faces is a film that does not allow any given scene to simply be a communication of plot information. Cassavetes created an entire universe for his actors in every scene. Each scene is a million years of passion spliced together, each demonstrating brazenly his brilliant recognition of human exchange and in conversation and conflict what is exchanged and what is left to be desired.The film has moments of great pain because miniature struggles are so real and they tend to be vocalizations of a person's deeper fears in social interactions and in the structure of life. The film has scenes of furious drama because characters will experience blind unleashing of their ids as middle-aged people. Faces also delivers highly during moments of happiness and fun because, the situation's comfort level gracefully allowing, the characters will show the fieriest, grandiose, extroverted parts of themselves.The movie's message, ironically, is not about the inner self and the unleashing of it but about the naiveté with which people carry out their normal married lives and don't care to face their flaws and problems and, though they gradually strip their personalities down bare throughout interactions, they continue not knowing themselves or each other. Faces is now among my favorite films of all time and places John Cassavetes on a pedestal as an idol of mine. The movie is a supreme demonstration of powerhouse acting, wherein each performance can be cherished by the performer with a feeling of ownership. There is a bit of real actor in each character played, and that can be seen in each and every powerhouse scene in a row.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>favorite Cassavetes film I've seen so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Faces is a torrid story of what people do when they're in fractured relationships, and, really, what a lot of lives are really like out there. What Faces offers just on its own as a character based drama is almost enough to see what the director is all about. No big budget, no fake sets, just people on the screen who have real personalities and histories with each other, and conflicts that are given enough light to get an idea of what they're about. But what is given, shot in a grainy 16mm feel by Cassavetes, using mostly theater actors (and Cassavetes's wonderful wife Gena Rowlands), are compelling enough to stay with them, through their flaws and difficulties with one another, and through this we get a look into their small world. Film-making like this is rare, where the director- also as writer- can work with so little to provide so much emotionally for a viewer. It's definitely a certain kind of world shown, of New Yorkers with relationship crises and psychological complexes that may go a bit beyond some viewer's expectations. That how they communicate is so raw is also a little unnerving at times, and some scenes deserve to be seen twice to grasp everything that's going on.But Faces, for all its moments of improvisation, is a work that is alive, because it has characters who question their own excesses and escapes while not being able to really escape them. There's adultery, alcohol, an overdose, and lots of talking at times. But there's also moments of true compassion, and reality that likely could be found in few exceptions of films at the time it was made (especially about the middle class). And at times what the filmmaker gets us to feel for these completely imperfect and almost damaged people (underneath their middle class side) is a bit shattering. Take the scenes involving Seymour Cassel and the woman he's found in the morning unable to really wake up. This whole set of events as he tries to wake her up is a true knockout kind of cinema, where there's no pretense between what is being shown on the screen and what the audience is receiving. Arguably, there are at times scenes that feel nearly too theater-based, as if we might as well see this on an off-Broadway production.But in this kind of independent film, where there really aren't limits, Cassavetes is interested in characters and situations that Hollywood would just take as stereotypes or more conventional forms. And with the professionals like John Marley, Rowlands, Cassel, and especially Lynn Carlin (who along with Cassel got richly deserved Oscar nominations), Cassavetes at times just lets his script go with them and the conviction they bring is, at times, shocking. This is the sort of film that influenced Scorsese, though his style has also influenced a good chunk of what are American independent films, where the limits of budget, time, and Hollywood perks like staged sets and special effects, can sometimes be used for an advantage with a good enough script and cast. To put it mildly, I can't wait to see this film again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the story of an aging business man, his quirky wife, an escort and a gigolo on an unpredictable evening in LA.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Cassavetes had impressed me with Shadows, charmed me with Minnie and Moskowitz, and disturbed me with Husbands and The Killing of A Chinese Bookie, but Faces evoked all of these reactions simultaneously. The film balances the spontaneous vision and participation of the camera as it dances around the characters with the relentless exploration of awkward human contact. After watching Faces, it is difficult to return to some of the French New Wave films, with which Cassavetes' early work holds much in common. He simply embraced an akin visual style without diminishing psychological facets of his characters' abandon. Faces is truly Cassavetes' masterpiece and a work that brings to light all of his talents and contributions in the cinematic medium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a marvelous movie to watch. It is so intelligent and informed most of the time, it is hard to believe there were improvisations by Cassevetes and company.Although themes such as those which the movie revolves around were already then considered Bergmanesque, the movie evokes the spirit of other great non-Hollywood directors of the era: Fellini and Antoninoni. Still it retains its integrity and is rather unique. I think that it is a very impressive film even today. Puts many to shame.NSFC did the right thing in awarding the film with Screenplay and Supporting Actor honors. Oscars on the other hands were not so generous. It did not get a nod for best picture nor did Cassevetes for best directors. What a shame! Since Stanley KUbrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey was snubbed the same year, making it a double debacle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very unusual in a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see movies hoping that they're different. I've seen so many films that were exactly the same and that's really just a waste of time. Well, Faces is certainly different. It's hard to get through. It actually took me a week. That's because there is little action and it is hard to get interested in it. The reason why it's so original is because it is practcially a documentary on social life in this time period. It's as low budget as you get. Characters just hang around houses drinking and enjoying themselves. So I guess there isn't much of a plot, but on the good side this might be the most realistic movie I've ever seen. I really felt like nothing was unrealistic, not even a single one of the conversations. That's different. Most movies try to impress, but Faces tries to be natural. That doesn't make much sense because "natural" means you're not trying to do anything, you're just existing as you always do. Maybe that was how Faces was filmed. It definately feels natural and that's a big achievment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All we have here is Cassavetes' name to draw us into this hopeless waste of someone's production money. I've never understood the Cassavetes directorial style (expression of his intense anger), nor the masochism of his film audiences. This is a typical Cassavetes product - characters are in-your-face loud, crass, and shallow (again: reflecting the director's personality). Overly theatrical "performances", abrupt, artificial mood changes, and hysterical, mindless, irritating laughter. Misogynistic, forced humor. Good camera work but poor sound and lighting. One would be seriously deluded to consider this art. Throughout the film you will feel uncomfortable, and ask yourself, "Why am I watching this?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional performances, but film is fatuous, irritating, and occasionally meandering...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reviewing writer-director John Cassavetes' cinema verite-styled "Faces" for the New Yorker, film critic Pauline Kael was more interested in the theater audience's reaction to the picture than the picture itself. She noted that everyone in the crowd seemed to accept this "bad office party" with the utmost seriousness, as if what they were witnessing was extremely personal and important. "Faces" is probably still quite important to revolutionary filmmakers, but it doesn't feel very personal. Cassavetes views a sad, crumbling, upper-class marriage between a businessman and a housewife in Los Angeles with blank eyes. The conversation between the two is vapid and disconnected--and later, when the couple separates and he finds company with a prostitute while she brings home a gigolo, the dialogue remains flat and monotonous. Is Cassavetes trying to say that some marriages become zombie-fied to the point where no amount of conversation breaks through? The wife overdoses on pills and is rescued by the stud, but when the husband comes back and sees the bottle and the mess in the bathroom, he doesn't even ask her about it. The film is stultified by its need to be raw and uncompromising in an arty fashion (with Mount Rushmore-like close-ups of the four principals, a gambit which gets tiresome). Flickers of truth permeate the production, though it isn't very well-shot or lighted, and the editing (purposefully) allows scenes to ramble on passed their emotional peak. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, a bit inaccessible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Cassavetes is certainly an interesting director (great actor too, but interesting director). Instead of directing films for entertainment, he directs them to present a "slice-of-life", so to speak, only one that is usually tumultuous and unkind. His movies are generally uphill battles to watch, but they're worth it.In this film, an over-the-hill man and woman break up and pursue other, younger paramours. While successful, they still have to deal with their own separate pain and fear of many things, amongst them age, loneliness, and friendship.The writing and the acting are the most important parts. The writing is at times brilliant, the rest of the time brutal. Cassavetes tries for a more realistic, human approach, which means characters go off in tangents, talk unproductively, and are often really mean to each other. The acting complements the dialog so perfectly that one doesn't see actors on screen, but characters; only moreso than characters, one sees people, as if watching a home video with a disturbing and powerful plot.Cassavetes was also one to specifically not care about structure. This makes the directing, editing, and cinematography rather jarring and condense. Luckily, it works with the themes of this movie well enough that the movie itself maintains a sense of entrapment and abuse.It's a great film, though it's an uphill battle to watch. It's amazingly written but it's very inaccessible. I'd recommend it, but you must heed that it won't be something you can just sit down and escape into.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Faces, by John Cassavetes, is a 1968 film generally credited as being the first popular independent film in America to make an impact in the public consciousness. But, it is more than that. It is a film that totally subverted the dominant themes and forms of Hollywood cinema, at the time, showed that 'adult' films, truly adult, not a euphemism for pornography, could have mass appeal, and paved the way for the great auteur decade of American film-making that was the 1970s. That things have regressed severely, since then, only shows how much a young Cassavetes is needed these days.But, it was totally different from the European auteur films of the 1960s, in that it eschewed symbolism, framing, and Post-Modern techniques of storytelling. Faces is a raw film that is laced with searing, realistic dialogue, and gives the impression that the viewer is truly eavesdropping on the private lives of people who could be them, for there are no Hollywood goddesses nor buff Adonises to be found in any scenes. And, unlike a master like Ingmar Bergman, who also focused on the inner emotional and psychological lives of individuals, Cassavetes' characters are not philosophizing nor posing in neatly framed boxes. This is not so much a criticism of the European poetic approach to film, merely to state that Cassavetes' style was far more revolutionary, and felt like actual cinema verité. In that sense, while one can argue ceaselessly over the relative excellence of certain directors, it is impossible to deny Cassavetes' importance in the pantheon of film's first century.Nor can one deny Faces' importance, at least as a landmark, if not having lasting influence in Hollywood's Lowest Common Denominator output. The film follows the demise of the fourteen year marriage of Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin), two LA suburban children of the post-World War Two boom, at the height of American affluence, just before Vietnam, Watergate, and the 1970s allowed the Conservative movement of the 1980s send standards of living into a spiral that has yet to stem. Why are they breaking up? We are never directly told. He's the head of a large company, and she a bored housewife, and while they still have things in common, and enjoy each other- as shown in a terrific scene of the couple in bed, laughing their heads off over lame jokes Richard tells, their marriage has just died. Neither could probably pinpoint where, much less why. But, the fact that they are still chuckling over the most inane jokes, just to please one another, says it all about most relationships- that they almost all end up as zombies. That's what makes this film so real, potent, and discomfiting. Contrast this to the Hollywood paradigm of the mid-1960s, Doris Day comedies, when the film was first started, and the difference is stark?.But, the real stars of this film are the writing and acting. Cassavetes reaches Chekhovian heights of drama, admixed with Tennessee Williams' poetic realism, in his Oscar nominated Best Original Screenplay. It is truly among the greatest screenplays ever written, even if, as rumored, there was much improvisation in the dialogue. Here, for one of the few times on screen or stage, one gets to see the actor as creator, not merely collaborator. Lynn Carlin, in her first film role, is authentic as the clueless abandoned wife, and got an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress. Seymour Cassel, as he lover, is also fantastic, as a gigolo with a soft side, and also got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Gena Rowlands, as the prostitute, is neither victim nor saint, just a real person struggling with real problems, and gives her usual great performance, as one of the great actresses of all time in film. But, this film is dominated, from start to finish, by the towering performance of John Marley. How many of us have worked for a son of a bitch like him? How many women know a bastard like him? How many men reading this are a Richard Forst? The supporting actors- Fred Draper as Richard's drunken pal Freddie, Val Avery as the drunken Jim McCarthy, Dorothy Gulliver as Florence, the old lady Chet deigns to kiss, when she drunkenly pleads for affection- are uniformly terrific, as well.The title of the film is based upon the notion that we all act in ways that are mere role playing for others, mere faces, and this has never been more true than in this film. A more apt title, though, might have been Personae, but since Bergman's singular Persona had recently been released, to great acclaim, this title suffices. No scene better and more aptly depicts why it suffices than in the terrific, nearly twenty minute opening scene, after the title sequence, which hints at the fact that, as Bergman was doing in that era, this film may all be a film some of the characters are watching, as a presentation to Forst as 'the Dolce Vita of the commercial field.' That this meta-narrative aspect has not been commented on by many critics I find curious, but understandable, since no more than two or three minutes into the nearly twenty minutes that follow, we are given a bravura performance of drunkenness never before equaled, for its realism, on screen. The strengths of this film are so many and so potent that things that in other films that would be weaknesses, such as fashions and dated slang, become strengths for this film has not dated. Its characters are as fresh as they were four decades ago, even if the film, itself, serves as a time capsule of the 1960s, yet one that is timeless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult but worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only recently become acquainted with Cassavetes films and I am continually impressed. This film was made on a shoestring budget filming primarily at night because the actors had day jobs. The working title, I understand, was "Dinosaurs" which sums up things up nicely. This is an important film since it shows flawed human beings especially in a time that was truly in upheaval - the late `60's. But Cassavetes was already anticipating the attempt at overthrowing the status-quo. This is a hard but fascinating film to watch. The masks, the self-loathing, the fear, the confusion of intimacy, the now tired slogan of the war between the sexes with entertainment all driven by prescription pills, alcohol and cigarettes...it's all here. Is it "real" or is it "contrived"? Even a well acted scripted play still can penetrate us. The people and conversation "inane"? You bet. Go to work or a club and listen closely -- we live lives that should never be filmed. Cassavetes films as if he's eavesdropping. Lastly - I could not imagine this film or 'Shadows' in anything but b/w....even if he COULD have afforded color stock. Excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is obviously not your average, everyday movie. It's some thing you could only watch at an art-house theater, so clearly this movie is not for just everyone.John Cassavetes was a sort of guerrilla film-maker. His movies never felt like it had any storyboards or were rehearsed in any way. There was never a pre-setup plan, concerning any of its camera-work or positions and the actors all also seemed to be ad-libbing at points. They were just simply shooting away, which gives the movie a very raw and authentic feeling. I think this is the foremost reason why people really like his movies. I myself can appreciate it but that doesn't mean I'm that fond or impressed with it as well.No, it's not really an easy or pleasant movie to watch. It's because the story is not really following a clear main plot line and things just seem to happen very randomly. I just simply prefer a more clear and straightforward story, since it also seemed to me that because of Cassavetes' approach, some of the sequences seemed to go on for ever and often weren't making that much sense for the story either.I can still understand the story and what Cassavetes was trying to do and tell with it. It's basically a look into married life and not about any of its peachy or happy aspects. But however, like I mentioned before, I would had been more taken by it and probably would had find the story to be a more interesting one, if it had a more straightforward story and approach to it.But yet I never hated watching this movie either. I can still definitely appreciate the way it got made and also all of the actors were a joy to watch. The movie really has some fine actors in it and I was especially fond of John Marley's performance. It were however Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel who received an Oscar nomination for their roles in this move.Actually it seems quite amazing to me how this movie managed to score 3 Oscar nominations, since it's such an artistic movie, that normally would hardly get ever noticed or recognized by any of the big award shows. It perhaps says something about the popularity or status of director and writer John Cassavetes at the time or how people looked at movies.For most people this movie will probably be too tough to bite through, or it simply won't be interesting enough to sit through but there is still a large crowd for these sort of movies out there. So if it sounds like it's your thing, chances are you'll probably end up loving it.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one can be characterised as some sort of an intermediate Cassavetes film. After his vibrant Shadows, Cassavetes could gain experiences in directing studio productions with two films before he tared his certain form of improvised actor's cinema and which he brought to perfection in the 70s. The look at a small group of people, at the centre is a couple drifting apart, serves as a microcosm and makes porous spots of society visible. In long, extensive, and intensive tableaux, Cassavetes dismantles the bourgeois experience realm of a couple and leaves behind two broken characters.The director's fourth directing work is as timeless as Shadows and goes back to the essence of an acting ensemble. John Marley, Gena Rowlands, Seymour Cassel, Lynn Carlin are all equally brilliant, true, authentic, real, physical, and their performances make Faces so convincing. Cassavetes allowed all freedom and sometimes the cast looks like they're at some kind of acting workshop, but in scenes of tenderness and painful silence, especially between Marley and Rowlands, the vital sparks, their pain jump over. Cassavetes' direction of the actors seems more secure and mature than in Shadows and the wild, uncontrolled camera contributes to the psychologically deep study of the characters and to a well-balanced cinematic entity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the very, very positive reviews for this film, this film is NOT for everyone. I think had the film been shown to a hundred people and they reviewed and scored it, it would have been a lot lower--and with a WIDELY skewed distribution. People would either love it or hate it. However, the average person also would not just pick up a film directed by John Cassavetes. They might love him in "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby"--but these are his commercial projects and ones in which he only acted. His own films are very personal and don't even attempt to be commercial but are artsy and often about topics that aren't all that marketable. The bottom line is that he did films he loved to make and didn't seem to care if the public embraced them--at least that's the perception most people 'in the know' have of his movies.When "Faces" first begins, it's VERY obvious this is not a Hollywood film (this would also be pretty clear if you just read the IMDb summary of the film). The movie is an example of 'Cinéma vérité'--a film technique that is typified by the non-professional and provocative aspects of the film. This film appears to have been shot with a cheap non-professional camera and the print is very grainy. As far and the acting and script goes, it looks like a movie made by friends after they had a few drinks--they appear to think they are quite clever. So, from the look of it, the $275,000 budget seems to be exaggerated--especially since it was, literally, a home-made film--being made in Cassevetes' apartment! As I said, it does not appear to be yet another Hollywood type of film! Now the film does have a few professional actors in it--with Cassavetes' own wife (Gena Rowlands) and John Marley starring in the movie. Most of the rest are mostly unknowns--and I have no idea if they were professional actors or just acquaintances of Cassavetes.While I like some French New Wave films, some absurdist films and and even some experimental and Dogma 95 films, I really did not enjoy this particular film. While I am not at all a typical viewer, I clearly don't fall into the very small but wildly enthusiastic crowd of Cassavetes fans. I just found it all to be cheap and pretentious...and dull. To each his or her own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented Faces about a week ago after reading a description of it and thought this might be interesting. I am always interested is watching a film whose theme has to do with marital issues since I don't have to deal with such things (I am single). Well back to the point here. I was kind of surprised for a 1968 film this was in B&amp;W. The print wasn't the greatest either. The first say 30 minutes was a struggle for me because I didn't know what the hell the two main characters (the husband and wife) were babbling about. I guess this was the set up but a poor attempt at one at best in my opinion.(they should have been throwing some pots and pans at each other in the kitchen to let you clearly know there was some marital strife going on !!!SPOILERSSurpringly enough this movie did get interesting as soon as the husband makes a phone call in front of his wife to meet another woman (played by a young and semi hot looking Gena Rowlands). At this point i stopped yawning and began to focus on Faces.Like another one of Cassavettes films, (Shadows also in B&amp;W and even more horrendous print quality), i didn't realize what Mr. Cassavettes was aiming at until about a day later after i saw the film. i think he does an excellent job of portraying some lonely individuals in their meaningless and temporary bond with others thinking that it will forever distract them from their pathetic and dull lives. I am guess that everybody has been through or knew somebody going through something like this at a down point in their life (not necessarily with a prostitute though), therefore i thought it was a very real story. Worth checking out but just fast forward past the the 30 minutes. the real story doesn't even begin until then in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sanctity of Marriage just got a shock thorough it's veins. John Casssavates's film "Faces" is a heartbreaking, urgent, real journey through the darkest realms of adultery. Cassavetes must be a traditionalist when it comes to marriage, because he makes this seem like a cautionary tale. A sense of how depression, lust and exploration outside of marriage could lead to vile, uncertain consequences. This movie is absolutely beautiful, and it's earned a spot on my list of the best films that I have ever seen. As grim as this movie is, it captures absolute desperation like few movies have ever did. The characters, Richard and Maria Frost are seen dipping their toes into the lustful life of mistresses and swinging. Not only do they want to mess around between the sheets with a dirty concubine, but they want to experience the love that they never found in each other, and rekindle the times of their youth. In both sections of their escapades, they dance and sing with their mistresses, and just laugh the night away with the swinging cohorts. Each scene lasts about 20 minutes a piece, and examine the surreal experience closely, almost like a stage play would have it. These scenes exist to also make note of the fantastic performances between every character on screen, and they shine brightly. Gena Rowlands's character of the mistress is seen as capitulating to the every fantasy of the men she fools around with, while at the same time losing her dignity and self-respect with every time the men fight for her attention. The character of Maria's concubine, Chet, on the other hand, is a commanding and brooding performance. We see him as a man who wants to take control of multiple women, and seemingly unprepared when his lust almost kills Maria after he lets her overdose on sleeping pills. That scene in particular is the greatest in the entire movie, as it beautifully shows the lowest point in Maria's life. How did she go from a lovely housewife to being unconscious in her own home, and a creepy man slaps her silly and chokes her violently in order to bring her back to life? Cassavetes plays up the ridiculousness of the situation, in order to shock us and make us think. The feeling of the entire picture was disorienting and just plain wrong in every aspect. The couple seemed way over their heads the entire time, and it what also seemed like a life or death situation. Every person in the rooms seemed to be on the verge of screaming, or crying or dying. The tension here is so fierce, you could cut it with a butter knife. Again, I focus on the acting, because that is where the film shines the brightest. It is pitch perfect. The cinematography is world's better here than it was in "Shadows", and it gives us the opportunity to explore the spaces that they live in. For example, the scene in which Richard comes home and eats dinner is filmed tensely, with shots that carefully and seamlessly follow his every move through the house and around his own wife. I know that there were clear cuts, but I simply didn't notice them. Everything seemed to be going in real time, and the performances helped make that time seem genuine. Each situation and scene had a build up period that was so frighteningly real. Emotions just build throughout all of the scenes. John Cassavetes proves here more than ever that he is the master and true father of the independent cinema movement, by making a film so profound in nature, without having any big money and sets to work around. In fact, here, he captures much more than any Hollywood film is willing to capture. Cassavetes was always a Hollywood golden boy, but I think that he should've just walked entirely away, and kept making incredible films. I am now reminded of how amazing it was to meet his son, Nick, at the Syracuse International Film Festival. I know now how important it was for us to see him, and how the Cassavetes name helps us as filmmakers in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I definitely can appreciate good conversations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is the work of John Cassavetes? Pretty good, I must say. I definitely can appreciate good conversations and witty dialogue any day.This film, I would say is another one of those indie films (sort of foreign-filmmaking- esque) from how it is much ado about NOTHING. I love these films. They are like a breath of fresh air. That, and they always seem so personal. I wonder if it was actually scripted or if it was improvised like most Cassavetes projects.The only work I have seen of Mr. John Cassavetes was his depute film, Shadows, which was mainly all improve, or so he says in his interviews. I take a strong liking to these films because of how slow they are, yet SO INVITING; so UN-American, if you will. - People have said that Cassavetes brought the indie film movement to the states. So far I have not been proved wrong so far. His films, such as Faces, are all so unique and timeless. Like literally, I believe this movie will be studied until THE END OF TIME.I like seeing people celebrating. It is nice. Gives one the feeling of calmness; like nothing extreme is happening so we don't have to waste any time stressing about it. Does that make sense?Our main protagonist, Richard Forst (played by John Marley), is a (so called) businessman who has an affair with a much younger woman. Little does he know that his wife has some plans of her own.. You can really tell what kind of man Robert is when he says:"I'm just a mild success in a dull profession, and I want to start over again. And I've got a bad kidney!"This just shows what kind of person he is as he says it to the younger girl, Jeannie (played by the beautiful Gene Rowlands).I really like the acting and love the struggles and conflict that this husband and wife go through. Both are trying to find happiness in so many ways, but is only making it worse for themselves. .-- Michael Mendez</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unforgettable Descent Into Misery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American Dream, from the '60s standpoint, was supposed to be a fantasy lived by Lucy and Ethel and the Bradys. But "Life", "Vanity Fair", and "Photoplay" tended to stretch the truth for the sake of eye catching imagery, all red lipstick, picnic baskets, Ford convertibles, and not much else. And while Debbie Reynolds and Dick Van Dyke told us how we should be looking, acting, feeling, the rest of the world shifted in its mindset, going from years of repression to a sudden soul searching state of disillusion, increasingly thrown off course by the sexual revolution, Vietnam, and Watergate. I'm sure some of the period's population was decently happy, but a time of changed attitudes and values can only lead sights and sounds into places unexplored before, unsatisfying at their revelatory peaks."Faces", a defining film in the astonishing breadth of the daring '60s, grabs The American Dream by its lapels and throws its ideals down a life-sized paper shredder, screaming in our faces that Doris Day and her well-off friends lied ? adorable romantic misunderstandings and colorful lifestyles is not the America America knows. It's just a drippingly chintzy version of one. So with its grainy, 16 mm black-and-white, emotive actors, and innate directorial style (courtesy of auteur John Cassavetes), "Faces" is one of the few films that convincingly captures the hardships that lacerate everyday life, placing each and every one of its characters at the center of a crisis and watching, unsparingly, how they handle it.Following the disintegration of a fourteen year marriage over the course of a series of drunken nights, "Faces" examines Richard (John Marley) and Maria Forst (Lynn Carlin) as they attempt to navigate their loose vulnerabilities after Richard suddenly announces he wants a divorce. The proclamation makes perfect sense to Richard ? he's been cheating on his wife for years (the film opens with a boozy get-together that sees him and his friend entertaining a couple of prostitutes) ? but the exclamation nearly tears Maria in half. Though she's been unhappy for far too long, there's an underlying feeling that she really does love her husband, and while the union has run its course, she doesn't want to be alone in this cold, cruel world.They spend the next few nights figuring out what's going to become of them, growing increasingly depressed and increasingly retrospective, pensive. Richard busies himself attempting to shack up with a hooker without a heart of gold (Gena Rowlands), Maria fogging out her loneliness with her female friends, gradually meeting a hippie (Seymour Cassel) well-meaning but damaging in his unrelenting positivity. By the end of the film, the Forsts don't find themselves freed by their lack of marital responsibility ? hanging over their heads is a question mark drenched in sleeping pills and liquor, wondering aloud if all there is to look forward to in life is misery."Faces" isn't the kind of film made for the pure sake of enjoyment ? most, including me, would much prefer to sit through a two-hour Bond adventure than a depressing, jarringly styled character piece ? but its blunt truthfulness and knee-jerking performances make it a tour-de-force rewarding in its mesmerizing account of a world more authentic in its bare bones anguish than most. Never has Cassavetes settled for anything less than honest, so it's only fitting that the majority of his films throw his characters into a pit of chaos and sees where they land. In his most famous moment, "A Woman Under the Influence", he details the dissolve of a housewife's psyche, taking her marriage down with her; in "Love Streams", he throws curveball after curveball at characters so lost in a maze of depression that it's only reasonable to predict that they'll never make their way out."Faces" is the movie that first bolded and underlined his filmmaking style, pulling out massive emotional punches and drawing out visceral performances from his stock of actors. His movie-making instincts are difficult to love at first glance ? but after getting to know the situation and the people, the shaky camera, documentary-like, heightens the gutsiness of it all, adding to the dire circumstances that befall nearly every scene. As we analyze the ensemble of "Faces", split in half most of the time, a sense of impending doom slithers along the cracks of the ceiling. None of these characters are stable, so much so that we can only ponder if they will die naturally or if they will inflict wounds upon themselves to make their demise come quicker. The women of the film, Rowlands and Carlin, cover their sorrows with fake laughs and unconvincing smiles; Rowlands makes the case that her character has always been that way ? she plays a prostitute, therefore used to irrepressible gloom ? but Carlin goes on a downward spiral resembling Monica Vitti's mental deterioration in "Red Desert", absorbing but absolutely gut wrenching. The men, Marley and Cassel, seem more in control: but it quickly becomes apparent that their masculinity can only cover so much ground before their weaknesses begin to present themselves loudly.At 147 minutes, "Faces" is demanding to sit through, sometimes tedious. But, like in all of Cassavetes' movies, there is so much depth to the lack of glamour that we're left torn up, perhaps longer than we'd like to admit. Because the Technicolor world isn't real ? the 16 mm one is, and it's hard to accept.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Try me"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, when I'm not careful, I have a tendency to cast blanket judgements on people, particularly on the middle-class. I do feel that subjecting yourself and your children to a middle-class lifestyle is akin to willingly giving up your ability to communicate directly. The moment one of the more searing emotions nudges its way through to the surface, you're immediately encouraged to suck it back down again. The cumulative effect of this process, which your average middle-class household may encounter three or four times a day, is a deadening of your nerve endings. You find yourself unable to communicate in any other way than in fluty chattering. I try to avoid these types of characters whenever I can, and like to think I've stepped outside of that world as much as possible, but I do know that it's the people outside of your realm of experience who are the most deserving of your empathy. It's lucky for me that there are individuals like John Cassavetes out there to remind me that these people are vulnerable victims as much worthy of my compassion as anyone else.Faces took over four years to make, and a large chunk of that time was spent in the editing suite (and by suite, I mean various offices, spare rooms and an array of international hotel rooms). It was whittled down from over fifty hours of footage. Cassavetes isn't really the type to set out to tell acutely defined stories with Aesop-like moral messages. While the notion that his whole oeuvre was improvised was indeed largely a myth (and one started by his early hype-merchant quotes during press tours, as well as glibly referring to Shadows as "an improvisation" at the end of the movie), he always let his actors draw their own conclusions about their characters. That said, I do think Cassavetes told a surprisingly clear story in his final cut- that of adults continually proving themselves to be wayward, neurotic, broken children, who, in spite of wending down dozens of blind alleys throughout their lives, still ultimately just want to be liked and to play. Perhaps it's a bit too pat to refer to adults as broken children;maybe we're actually our own alien species fuelled more on pride than juice cartons.More than any other of his films, I do think Faces has its own unique atmosphere like nothing else- either of his own works or anyone else's. It's probably a result of having so many man-hours put into the thing. The shooting took a few months, but having to contend with things like re-synching the sound after it botched up (not to mention having to edit out all the examples of Cassavetes unwittingly mimicking all the characters behind the camera, loudly), the stops-and-starts as Cassavetes acted in things like The Dirty Dozen, Italian crime movies and Corman biker b-pics to raise funds, having children (two of his principle cast, his wife Gena Rowlands and Lynn Carlin, were pregnant during shooting), hustling distribution deals, and thousands of other problems- all of these things resulted in a unique synthesis of spontaneity and painstaking fastidiousness. You'd think in a whirlwind period like the mid-to- late '60s, where new cultural revolutions were taking place every week, a four year delay between shooting and release would be noticeable on screen, but the actors' emotions remain undated even now. John Cassavetes, churlish nightmare as he could be to work with, loved people unashamedly, and it's hard to go back to regular Hollywood flicks, which are awash with editorialised opinions on their own characters, after watching a Cassavetes film. Though I'd probably have precious little opportunity of crossing paths with most of these sorts of characters in real life, the cast and crew's unwillingness to create encomiums or indictments on any of the broken-winged birds peopling Faces really pays off. I can feel for every Face on screen. I can feel it when they try to hurt the person they're talking to rather than admit their fondness, just in case it opens doors they've spent years trying to keep shut. I can feel just wanting to share a desperate kiss with someone to prove that you're as young as you're badly acting. I can feel all the wordless conversations which scream below the surface dialogue.Some people see Faces as a bit of a hopeless movie- "depressing"- but Cassavetes didn't see it that way, and I definitely don't. It may have taken a near-overdose, but to me it feels like Lynn Carlin's character did something near-impossible at the end of the picture... Getting back to the middle-class thing, I feel with a lot of the middle-class there are always two conversations taking place in any given exchange: the surface politesse, and something rawer and more yearning which very rarely is given voice. When you listen to Carlin's inflection when she replies to Cassel, after he frantically brought her back to life, there's a tone you hear nowhere else in the film. "Try me". Her voice sounds so present, so full of alacrity and humanity... It sounds as if she's finally broken free of a smothering chrysalis and she's THERE at last. Those two voices are one at last.It could be she'll slip back into her old habits again. Living in the same house with the same husband, the same ablutions and rituals (such as you see her performing in one scene when she goes through the house checking the appliances and lights are turned off), perhaps they'll drag her back into the doldrums again... For some reason, though, I don't think so. She's experienced incredible pain, and it's still infinitely better than being a "mechanical man". Cassavetes said he always loathed finger-pointing pictures which make the world seem like the flop-house of a race of irredeemable robbers and scoundrels. He preferred films which, while remaining honest, left their audience with a feeling of optimism. Every time I watch Faces, I'm optimistic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Raw Emotion; Unfiltered, Unstructured, Real.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To describe the story of "Faces" is futile, possibly even misleading. This film can best be described as a series of scenes conveying the intertwined lives of several people over an expanded period of time. Nothing is resolved. Characters are constantly switching topics, radically shifting through a series of emotions. There are about a handful of scenes in total, most of which last around fifteen to twenty five minutes. I hope by now I've conveyed that this is about as far from a conventional narrative as possible.The best way to describe this film is pure, raw intimacy and intensity. The camera is rarely far from anyone. The framing is always off center and close, which builds not just intimacy but total unease. The performances are absolutely authentic, not a line or moment feels inauthentic (besides when a character is being inauthentic, of course). The film is an exhausting watch, and getting through this in one sitting is often difficult. Cassavette's other films certainly feel more well paced and spaced out, but the degree to which this film can quickly overwhelm is a testament to the film's strength and the experience watching it.Yes, I could sit here and talk about the movie's themes, it's portrayal of intimate relationships and society in general, but I think the most honest way I could review this is to refer to this film as an experience. If you're willing to engage the film, to watch the loud, obnoxious characters often going on tangents, giving fake laughter and trying to be distracted from themselves, you will be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A slice of life from Cassavetes that captures the breaking point of a couple's marriage.I feel like watching a Cassavetes movie about once every ten years. That's about how long it takes me to recover from the last one. His films are exhausting, and I find myself admiring them more than I ever love them. I certainly felt that way during "Faces." There's no denying the skill of the actors or Cassavetes' merciless brand of filmmaking (I can't even begin to imagine what audiences at the time made of this film, which came out in a year when "Oliver!" won the Best Picture Academy Award), but I grew pretty tired of it before it was over.John Marley plays the male half of the married couple and probably gives the film's most memorable performance. Gena Rowlands, Cassavetes' long-time wife, plays one of his mistresses and isn't given a chance to display the acting chops she would use several years later to such devastating effect in "A Woman Under the Influence." Lynn Carlin (Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actress) plays the cheated-on wife who does some cheating of her own with Seymour Cassell (Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actor). And Cassavetes himself filled out the film's triumvirate of Oscar nominations with a nod for Best Original Story and Screenplay.While I can't say I necessarily enjoyed "Faces," I will say it did a marvelous job of capturing that sense of middle-age malaise that hits men and women when they start to think of their lives as half over rather than half begun and a desperate need to feel needed begins to take hold.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An older man (John Marley as Richard Forst) leaves his wife (Lynn Carlin as Maria Forst) and this film tracks the fallout as he takes up with a younger escort (Gena Rowlands as Jeannie Rapp) and she takes up with a more fun-loving younger man from Detroit (Seymour Cassel as Chet). The caustic moments in this film could peel the paint off walls. The false and forced bonhomie, the hollow laughter and the empty words will rip you to pieces.The cinematography overseen by Al Ruban astonishing. The quick cuts from speakers to their interpolators keep one just a little on edge but don't detract from the tension of the movie.The writing and acting are bracing - the early scene in which Richard shows affection and laughs almost manically as he and his wife share a nice domestic scene. Just a short time later though, we see the change in mood as they lay in bed and Richard, turning away from his wife, looks cold and distant, clearly about something not as pleasant. The rapidly shifting vibe between Richard and Jeannie as he flatters her and then seems cold and cruel toward her and she tries unsuccessfully to retain some emotional distance from him. Gena Rowlands is amazing in her scenes with John Marley. She conveys hurt, playfulness, need, and love in short order.Perhaps my favorite scene is when Richard goes to Jeannie only to find her entertaining two businessmen - Jim and Joe. Both men try to remain cool, not appearing too angry while also attempting to stake their claim for Jeannie's affections. Two powerful men trying to look cool while posturing makes for great entertainment. Cassavetes script conveys the difficulty of their task.The alienation and emotional isolation of Maria's nightcap with her friends and Chet (Seymour Cassel) is also bracing. They try to cheer her up but it seems no one is really having a good time. The mood shifts wildly and no one ends up happy. Astonishing writing and acting from Dorothy Gulliver as Florence and Darlene Conley as Billie Mae, as well as an amazing depiction of heartbreak from Lynn Carlin.The final scene is also amazing for the reserved way it holds in reserve vast amounts of emotional energy. The acting, writing, directing and camera-work here speak to professionals really working at a high level. The rawness of the acting, the skittish camera-work from Ruban, and Cassavetes control over, and vision of, it all, make this a film of the highest caliber.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but easily overrated film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rave reviews made me expect more from this film. It was clunky and, at times, highly artificial and stagey -- I wouldn't have minded the stageyness except for the endless reviews claiming it was the first honest depiction of how Americans lived, etc., etc. Ebert's review, for instance, sounds the trumpets because this film is the first time that our American way of life is depicted on film.Our way of life? The characters are boring middle-management businessmen and traveling salesmen -- the woman are housewives and prostitutes -- and there is almost no American life in this film whatsoever. The scenes are interesting and well-done, but they are staged arguments. The salesmen hang out with prostitutes and -- and tell each other limericks? Did no one have a hi-fi or a radio in this world? It's bizarre and unrealistic.However, taking it as a bizarre and unrealistic film, this is a good film. It dramatizes the vacancy of middle-class white culture, largely by showing scene after scene in which vapid middle-class white people have empty and meaningless conversations. This does not prove that life is meaningless in general, however. It only proves that middle-management and sale staff do not find fulfilling lives when they hang out getting drunk with prostitutes, with whom they do not have sex. It's all a little odd. Watch it, but be warned.</fullReview>

Renoir did it in "La R?gle du jeu". People playing different roles - master and servant, husband and lover, poacher and grounds-keeper, break for their roles and connect with each other. It is one of the most beautiful movies ever made and has been in AFI Top 10 since it was released.Faces is the anti-thesis of "La R?gle du jeu". Here to the player stop playing their parts but instead of connecting with each other, they distance themselves from each other. So we have husband and wife, married woman and a gigolo, married man and a prostitute, all breaking their roles but to distance themselves even more from each other. In process they reveal how the very roles are a sham, that we just play out of habit, convenience and society. It challenges our very lives.Of course, this makes for a very nasty picture but with incredible moments of truth. It is very honest and very depressing and a very hard watch while still being fascinating. Its the kind of picture that you appreciate more than you enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Cassavetes' second feature of any note after 1959's Shadows, Faces is one of the late director's most daring and experimental films. Telling the story of a disintegrating relationship and the love its members seek in the arms of strangers, the film stars, amongst others, Lynn Carlin, John Marley, Gena Rowlands, and Seymour Cassel. It is shot in black and white and has a freewheeling home video quality - Cassavetes' camera scanning across various "faces", faces blurred, in focus, laughing, and crying.The director's greatest success with the picture rests in his ability to dismantle traditional Hollywood ideas about plot and pacing and still stir up emotion and feeling in the viewer. Cassavetes manages to capture remarkably human and naturalistic performances from his cast (for instance, the way his roving camera captures a shirtless Seymour Cassel chasing flirtatiously after Lynn Carlin through their hotel room, or Lynn Carlin and John Marley rubbing noses together and laughing in a moment of ecstasy), helping the film become more than just a collection of meandering long takes.Essential viewing for anyone looking to explore Cassavetes' work or trace the roots of the current independent film movement. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Cassavetes' drama shows the breaking point of a long-disintegrating marriage between Richard and Maria Forst (John Marley and Lynn Carlin). At the start of the film, Richard joins his lifelong friend in the home of prostitute Jeannie (Gena Rowlands), where the two sing and dance, and drunkenly make fools of themselves as they try to impress her. He goes home to his wife and the two joke, only for Richard to suddenly announce his desire for a divorce. He goes back to Jeannie, who is now entertaining two businessmen. Maria goes out with her friends and they pick up optimistic dancer Chet (Seymour Cassel). He charms her friends and the two end up alone, where their desire for intimacy brings them together.Cassavetes, known as the pioneer of American independent film-making, is at his most cold here. We are forced to watch these often repulsive characters laugh and interact without ever really connecting. Most of the men in the film are unhappily married and try to fill the void by committing adultery. All they seem to be doing is distancing themselves more from their wives, and increasing the loathing they truly have for themselves. It's a stroke of genius how over the course of two hours, we get to fully understand the mechanics of Robert's and Maria's marriage, even though they only spend about 15 minutes of screen time together. We get to experience it through a facial expression, or a certain glance, or a line of dialogue.Filmed in the style of cinema verite, a device used most successfully by documentary film-makers The Maysles Brothers, Cassavates deploys it to truly get underneath the skin of the characters. We get to see the characters mainly in close-up, and although we are forced to swallow their meandering and dull conversations, the film never feels intimate. And this is the point. These people seem to exist for themselves, and although they communicate, they only really talk to themselves. The title Faces seems like a clever joke. All these people are, are faces. The director's true intentions come out in one of the final scenes, as Chet talks about how mechanical society is, and how everyone longs for, but is terrified, of intimacy. A truly great American drama featuring expert performances, namely from the Oscar-nominated Lynn Carlin and Seymour Cassel.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a Crude Joke without a Punchline ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Faces" is a slap in our faces. "Faces" faces reality like a telescopic mirror. Never had desperation and starving needs of love and respect looked so poignantly authentic. Not just because of the visions our discomforted eyes witness during these 24 hours of shouting, talking, arguing and laughing, but also, thanks to Cassavettes' genius directing, using close-ups on characters, so they can never lie or play. And when all the basis of the bourgeois way of life is hypocrisy, "Faces" plays a cathartic role, allowing us to stand back and realize that these "faces" are nothing else but ours.I can't count how many times "Faces" made me think "Oh, my God! This is so real" though I don't belong to any social category represented in this film, but this is more than slices of life stories about tired businessmen and disillusioned wives, all eager to maintain their sex or love appeal. "Faces" is about human relationships and the profound effect time exercise on men and women, old and young, married or single. Every interaction with people is guided by a personal approach to life and fear of death, inspiring to each character from this masterpiece a specific attitude, magnified in these denuding and disturbing close-ups. We can't help but feel a bit voyeuristic to watch them like this, but this indecency relies less on the actions than the disturbing truths they highlight. "Faces" is what prevails behind the masks of conformity, like the truest expression of the regrets and hopes governing our lives. "Faces" as Cassavettes's tribute to humanity and its poignant vulnerability. Vulnerability doesn't come easy in our relationships with strangers. Richard Frost, the businessman, portrayed by John Marley, personifies the fragility of an old man who must know where his life is going. Life is valuable and must focus on strong principles. Then he hides his doubt and weaknesses under a ludicrous carpet made of bad jokes and a manic laugh that doesn't fool anyone. When he's drunk with his friend (and never a drunk scene has been so realistic), he still tries to keep his dignity intact, and when Jeannie, played by a beautiful and delicate Gena Rowlands, criticizes the concept of friendship, he disagrees and expresses with seriousness its value then realizes that seriousness itself, is an overrated concept. Indeed, his best friend acts like a clown, then makes harsh remarks that hurt Jeannie's feelings, reminding her she's a whore. Jeannie disarms him, saying that he just doesn't know how to behave, and use aggressiveness as a mask to hide his vulnerability, hurting not to be hurt. They're all powerful businessmen, but yet vulnerable in their incapability to admit their doubts, their dependence of this cruel need to prove their manhood. This puerile pride is illustrated in a ridiculous fight scene between Richard and Jim, another executive played by Val Avery. When they realize how childishly they acted, they started talking like regular businessmen. But the need was still there. Need is the key word of "Faces", especially in the second part featuring the disillusioned wives of those men and Chet, a young swinger hippie they just met in a nightclub and brilliantly portrayed by Seymour Cassel. One of the women, played by Lynn Carlin, is Maria, Richard's wife, who's just been told by her husband, much older than her, that they should divorce. All these women know about their men and try to forget the emptiness of their marital situation, especially after the kids grew up and left the house. Inevitably, the need of being loved, desired and respected emerges back and spoils the evening. When a woman, encouraged by Chet, overcomes her shyness and starts dancing with him, she defensively reacts to Chet's "let's not make a fool of ourselves" and replies with hostility before leaving the house unaware that she's just made the wrong point. One of the friends understands that she's just doing this to make herself look honorable to forget her marriage's failure. Women also wear masks, using their status of accomplished mothers as an alibi to keep some ounces of dignity. The only one who doesn't care for dignity sees Chet with her drunk eyes as the opposite of her ugly uninteresting husband, and begs him for a poignant, but pitiful kiss.This pity is the response for fear and desperation. The climactic scene between Chet and Maria, will haunt me forever: the desperation when he tries to make her throw up, as to exorcise all the pain she accumulated is disturbingly poignant. This is a woman that can't play anymore, she just hates her life, and is too weak to simulate happiness. During a very insightful speech, Chet summarizes the whole point of the film, everything is almost mechanical, anyone, beautiful, ugly, happy or miserable is wearing a mask, and nothing matters more than the truth, honesty and the personal quest for happiness. This looks like the happy ending of a coming-of-age film, but this is brutally interrupted by Richard's arrival. We don't know what's going to happen next, Richard wanted a divorce but realized his disenchantment cost him his ability to love again, Maria lets him sitting on the stairs, after telling him, she's disgusted by her life, will she meet leave him or meet Chet again? Will Jeannie continue to wear this beautiful mask to hide her fear of not being attractive anymore? Are all these questions really relevant? Cassavettes point is not to teach, but to reveal, to show the face of truth in its poignant fragility. These are the faces, the rest is just feces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An old married man leaves his wife for a younger woman. Shortly after, his ex-wife also begins a relationship with a younger partner. The film follows their struggles to find love amongst each other.This was one of the most influential films of the 1960s, if you consider how it inspired Robert Altman and Woody Allen, as well as employing Steven Spielberg as a production assistant while he was still making short films and had not yet broken into feature films.How well the film has aged is debatable. While its influence is clear, the film itself is not necessarily the most fun. Some have called it "meandering", and it is hard to believe that at one point Cassavetes had a six-hour cut (allegedly).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director John Cassavetes (The Killing of a Chinese Bookie), this film from the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book was rated rather well by the critics, so I hoped I would agree with their opinions, as the book has often rewarded me with some great watches I otherwise may not have found. Basically, shot in a style similar to documentary, the marriage of a middle-aged couple is disintegrating and in its final stages, the husband Richard Forst (The Godfather's John Marley) is the one who demands the divorce from Maria (Oscar nominated Lynn Carlin), he is leaving her to be with Jeannie Rapp (The Notebook's Gena Rowlands) and many groups and individuals are coming to see them during this time. After the divorce is filed a company of brash businessmen and prostitutes is who Richard spends a night with, while his wife spends her time with middle-aged her female friends and an ageing free-associating playboy, and then young Chet (Oscar nominated Seymour Cassel) from Detroit. This night is full of conversations that cause tension and confrontations, modern American lifestyle is illustrating from all of this as interests, love lives and emotional/spiritual fulfilment of characters is brought into the situations. Pretty much all the character display dissatisfaction and are deeply happiness with their personal lives and try to cover this up while hanging with their friends putting on a false face, and overall there is no hope in the film at all, it only presumes most people in the world have to realise they may be unhappy in some way. Also starring Fred Draper as Freddie Draper, Val Avery as Jim McCarthy, Dorothy Gulliver as Florence, Joanne Moore Jordan as Louise Draper, Darlene Conley as Billy Mae, Gene Darfler as Joe Jackson and Elizabeth Deering as Stella. The performances by Marley and Rowlands and the supporting cast members are fine, and the direction is also fine, I think the only problem for me was that I couldn't really follow what was going on, apparently the film was meant to last six hours, so it was probably a good idea it was cut down, there were some interesting sequences so overall it was an alright drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In John Cassavettes' "Faces," Richard Forst (John Marley), a successful L.A. businessman, asks his wife, Maria (Lynn Carlin), for a divorce. Forst leaves his house and goes to see his mistress, Jeannie Rapp (Gena Rowlands), a prostitute who is still entertaining a couple of business clients (Val Avery; Gene Darfler) when he gets there.Meanwhile, Maria goes out with some friends to a nightclub (appropriately called "The Losers") that is filled with loud rock music. They meet Chet (Seymour Cassel), a young macho stud from Detroit, and bring him back home to Maria's house. After her friends go home sobbing over their lost youth, Maria goes to bed with Chet. The next morning, Maria attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills.Watching "Faces" is like being locked in a room for two hours with a bunch of loud, obnoxious, drunken people that you don't really like. The characters alternate between telling stupid, childish jokes and laughing hysterically, then dancing around the room while singing annoying song lyrics over and over again (i.e. "I dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair"), innately chanting nursery rhymes for no reason (i.e. "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers"), then arguing with each other, being caustic and cruel to the point of physical violence.Yes, I'm sure there are real people like this, but fortunately, I personally don't know any people who are like these characters. (At least, I *hope* I don't.) Much has been made of the movie's "realistic" style, with its hand-held camera and 16 mm black &amp; white look. This style has influenced everyone from Woody Allen to Robert Altman to today's independent filmmakers. But the fact that the style is good doesn't mean the *movie* is good.I know that some people (particularly film critics) enjoy this type of movie. Some people enjoy flagellation, but that doesn't mean you want to participate in it. This is one of those movies that you watch once, and then ? if you're lucky ? you forget about it.One line from the movie did make me laugh out loud: Maria: There's a Bergman film in the neighborhood.Richard: I don't feel like getting depressed tonight.Really! You could've fooled me!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film was so many eons in front of any other film event of the time, that even now it hits people in a personal way. every modern independent filmmaker should be, if not already is, aware of the power of this auteur's mark on their own personal vision.after almost thirty years after witnessing this movie for the first time, i am made more aware of the invaluable efforts he has given both to the non-hollywood, innovative filmmaker, and more importantly to the viewer who desires something more than a fleeting emotional right turn into la la land.this film lives to remind us not only of our fragilities as human beings, but also our potential strengths when suddenly made aware of the support others need from us. witness the amazing moments when jeannie and frankie in two seperate parts of the movie are suddenly made aware of their strengths in helping the person they are with to at least temporarily survive their emotional and real attempts at destroying themselves.this film is replete with sudden jolts underlined by the deliberate use of disturbing visuals and unfinished dialogue to remind us of our own often disjointed and unfinished lives. just as one person in the film must get slapped to wake-up to her own reason for being, we must be able to take the slaps this movie gives to see ours. thank you john.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suburban angst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A harrowing account of middle-class suburban angst in the 1960's. One of Cassavetes' best films (along with A Woman Under the Influence and Husbands). Outstanding performances from John Marley, Gena Rowlands, Seymour Cassell, and especially Lynn Carlin in her first film. His first collaboration with his wife netted 3 Oscar nominations (script, supporting actor, and supporting actress). Cassavetes is still under-appreciated by many American film-goers and is likely to remain so. This film was voted Best Script by the National Society of Film Critics in 1968. Well-worth the time and pain you put in viewing this one, but an unforgettable experience. The sadness and futility of these character's lives is overwhelming. Rated a 9.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrenching and true - people searching for passion and afraid of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this is a perfect film. It encompasses the entire range of human emotion, mostly setting the desire for love against the fear of being vulnerable. Each scene never goes for the easy answer, the simplistic dumbing down of behavior, but shows the momentary shifts from joy to hysteria, to fear to withdrawal, sometimes within seconds. The palette of human emotion is so rich that it can show how living is inevitably the greatest adventure imaginable. One thing that has bugged me about some of the critiques of Cassavetes has been that his work is 'technically crude'. At least in the case of this film, I vehemently disagree. The staging and the shots are powerful and true - a masterpiece. The use of the stairway alone in the last scene is up to that of any of the so-called 'visual' directors, yet with Cassavetes characteristic brilliance in eliciting the actors' performance. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had missed "Faces" until recently catching it by chance on cable. I began to watch it, as though it were a contemporary film. I knew nothing about it nor did I have any expectations. I just decided to stick with it, because it was obviously a piece of art from the beginning. I was fascinated by the middle of the film. I realized how ahead of its time it was. This is where context matters. When this film was made, Andy Warhol was quite the rage. I used to go to art houses to see his grainy, naughty improvs. But Cassavetes was doing this work, which is adult, well filmed and coherent, yet just as radical in its view of a real middle class of its time. (I suggest seeing "Ice Storm"). Warhol got the nod from the radical film set. I think Cassavetes was not as popular at this stage in his career. Well, Time does eventually determine what is great art and what is not. And, frankly, this film is art. I recommend trying to watch two hours of Warhol from the period and then watching this film. Context matters, and Time does indeed decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a hard time believing that the people who gave this movie a strong thumbs-up actually sat through it. John Cassavetes was a fine actor and director as evidenced by his superb performances in movies like The Dirty Dozen and Rosemary's Baby along with the directorial prowess of movies like A Woman Under the Influence and Husbands. For this reason, I was thrilled when his movies finally became available on video cassette. But Faces lost my attention at several instances. The scenes drag on indefinitely as if the actors are waiting for someone to yell "cut!", and as a result, the "deep character study" allegedly being transmitted becomes vague at best. The plot involves little more than a bored husband, a bored wife, a young blond woman, a bold young man, Friday night. Guess the rest.The performances by Marley, Rowland, and Carlin, as well as the supporting cast save the movie. I honestly thought I was eavesdropping on the private conversations taking place amongst their characters, and I think many viewers could identify with the typical suburban situation and the desire to break free from it all. After the first five minutes of each fifteen minute scene, however, I grew anxious for a change. Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

It is the landmark of all independent films that have followed. It laid all the ground work. But besides that, it is an excellent character study of various assorted lives in LA in the 1960's. Gena Rowlands is very good, as is John Marley. But a young Seymour Cassel, a Cassavetes regular is the real standout here.</fullReview>

THe world has really changed. This is the stuff Lars Von Trier eats off. FACES is the work of a director with excellent taste and superb instinct. The performance style is crafted with a fluid self-reflexive camera. Its seems we are always aware that these people, these performances are being filmed. The camera lurks in the corner of the room before confronting them with a closeup noiresque tilt. The camera work is muscular but there are no gratuitous moves or emotive tricks to allure the audience into the 'moment'. Instead, a subtler thing is at play : the masks and characters these people play are as much a surprise to themselves as they are to us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry. I can't quite say I LIKED this movie. But, if nothing else, I... appreciated it. NO ONE can accuse Cassavetes of being unoriginal in any aspect of the production. Every frame of the film is remarkably unconventional. And furthermore, the performances were so starkly real it makes the prospect that there even WAS a script seem impossible to me. Now, I don't know any back story about this movie, but I'm sure there had to have been some script involved somewhere. What I'm saying is that the way the actors played it, the lines seemed... unwriteable. It's as if we were watching a documentary, but one where we can be certain those involved didn't know they were being filmed. Basically, except for the poor dubbing that makes literally MOST of the dialogue in the film incomprehensible, I can't say there's anything about any individual sequences in the film that I disliked. HOWEVER, what I did have a problem with is this: the vanguard style of filmmaking, the characters, the situations they are in, the dialogue (if you want to call it that): does it all really come together to SAY anything? I didn't come away with any kind of an interesting or coherent message from the film. Which is fine if the scenes flow nicely together, but they really don't. Each scene as an entity unto itself is wonderful, but their juxtaposition together gets especially tiresome. I mean, for roughly 80% of the film, ALL of the characters onscreen are inebriated. Now, this makes it extremely difficult to get to know the characters beyond their buffoonish drunken altar egoes. Maybe, that was the point. I don't know. What I do know is that Cassavetes stubbornly refuses to reveal to us anything that even approximately resembles, plot, forward motion, or even... any kind of... an event... a happening until the last twenty minutes of the film when some interesting stuff finally happens. And this definitely alienates most audiences. Do you want to know why this movie has such a high rating? Because the people that didn't like it left after twenty-forty minutes. I know in the theater that I saw it in (a student film organization that watches intellectually stimulating independent fare weekly with warm response), the crowd of twenty people had been reduced by the end of the film to me, the president of the club (who was reading), and one other guy (whom I have a suspicion, fell asleep during at least part of the film) in the theater. EVERYBODY else got frustrated. Draw your own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cassavetes always has a good cast but he is a careless filmmaker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to TCM I have recently viewed 3 of John Cassavetes' films: A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE, A CHILD IS WAITING, and FACES. The last mentioned is the subject of this comment. I am not amazed that critics loved it, nor that audiences generally ignored or hated it. The film, to those who adore the avant garde willy nilly, looks as arty as all get-out. Hence critical approval. To audiences who live in the real world, it was apparent that Cassavetes had not managed to say anything really relevant to their lives. Oh, sure, a good many people have marital troubles galore, but the "solutions" which the film seems to offer look rather ugly as Cassavetes presents them. On the basis of the 3 films mentioned, it looks obvious that Cassavetes was a "convert" to the notion that "theatre of the absurd" was the ideal medium to convey his notion of meaningful cinema. I am sure he was a dedicated and sincere filmmaker. The problem is that to "Joe and Jane Doakes" and to the likes of me, he made lousy movies.What is "theatre of the absurd"? It more or less started with Albert Camus, who asserted in "The Myth of Sisyphus" sometime during WWII that mankind's situation vis-a-vis the universe is "absurd". Considering the world conflict that was raging and destroying mankind by the multi-millions, it would be difficult to disagree with him. Camus himself, I don't believe, ever wrote in the genre that came to be known as "theatre of the absurd", but a number of names still well remembered today did: Becket, Albee and Pinter come to mind. Some of these gradually abandoned the style, but echoes remained in their later works. Consider WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?. It isn't strictly "absurdist", but some aspects of "absurdism" remain. The characters are surely not "in phase" with life as most of us know it. Later, Albee wrote the screen play for Carson McCullers' "The Ballad of the Sad Cafe", a novel which was certainly in the "absurdist" tradition.Well, how about FACES?. The characters in this film seem to be "out of phase" with the rest of us. They are surely unhappy with their lives, but unable to formulate any real solutions. They don't really understand what is happening to them. They talk gibberish a good bit of the time. In fact, in some sequences, I was unable to make any sense of what was being said. I don't think this was accidental. Cassavetes was an "absurdist" author for sure. Now, that's not necessarily bad. I just don't think Cassavetes had the skill at this stage of his directing career to bring it off. His characters and dialog are too improvisational to be easily understood by the viewer. His editing is outrageously chaotic. Witness the scene when "Maria" appears to be dying of an overdose of something. The previous scene of "Maria" and "Chet" suggested nothing of this kind, and it is only later that an explanation of sorts is offered. If that is good film-making, you could fool me! Perhaps Cassavetes learned his trade better as time went on. I would like to see some of his post 1974 films to find out. Note that Becket, author of "Waiting for Godot", one of the best known "absurdist" dramas of all time, would have nothing to do with improvisation. In fact, directors who want to produce his plays are rigidly controlled by the executors of his estate and not allowed any deviation from dialog and stage directions as Becket wrote them. The "absurdist" authors were not sloppy! It may be that Becket was a true genius of the genre. I don't think Cassavetes was.The plusses of this flawed film all seem to come from the cast. Gena Rowlands and John Marley are magnificent in doing what they are asked to do. If it seems that what they are saying was made up as they went along, I suspect that's because it was. If they seem to be talking nonsense, they were talking nonsense and doing it very well. But it was still nonsense. In one scene, lasting a minute or two, I began to suspect I had maybe suffered a little "cerebral accident". I could see the scene perfectly, but understand not a word of what the sounds might mean. Then suddenly it all snapped back into the comprehensible again. Cassavetes may have intended this phenomenon, but it may just have been poor sound equipment or incompetent technicians. After all, we know he was short of funds and had to do everything on the cheap!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I understand what Cassevetes was after here, but I think this film is just awful. Bunch of drunken alcoholics talking 60% nonsense. Not listening each other. Basically-- it's terrible to be a lonely middle-aged drunk in the 1960's. In case you didn't know that. All in black and white, so you know it's "art." What makes it worse is the often over-the-top ACTING. Everybody YELLS A LOT because they are ACTING - trying to show us how drunk lonely people would be. Except that the dialog is often pompous and not at all how anyone talks, let alone very ordinary drunken folks. And they all LAUGH A LOT at nothing, presumably because they're DRUNK but it's really not at all how drunken people behave -- just a bad parody of it.To try to avoid some of the flamers, I will happily admit that after seeing a couple of his movies, I am REALLY not a Cassevetes fan and I'm not saying that others might not enjoy the film for some reason, nor that the film wasn't, in its own way, important and influential in it's day (and maybe even now). But, for me, it was mostly artless and self-important and I'd rather stick a pin in my hand than watch it again.</fullReview>

"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree"....Also, FYI: Steven Spielberg was an assistant director on this film (just a young punk), check his biog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, its sometimes hard to watch, slow, and oft times uneven, yet, this sensitive, and heavy film is probably the most important American film made in the last half century, as it started a whole generation of independent filmmakers, who adopted, like this film, an international, artistic quality, and put it onto screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rather inane study of a bunch of unsympathetic characters who live their lives pointlessly. It's hard to feel sorry for characters that act as silly as these ones do. Plus the scenes just drag and drag. Does art have to be so pretentious?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>powerful movie of the best director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very well produced picture of JOHN CASSAVETES . I want to thank him about this movie . I saw this movie twice and I want to see this with my husband again . I love this movie because John Cassavetes`s work was unforgettable and he was one of the best screenplayer at any times , and Gena Rowlands played very well as usually.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suffered through this movie thinking that, eventually, it was going to provide some insight into the characters and some real drama. That was the problem - you could not perceive anything about these characters other than gender and age. In short, you really didn't care about them much. Reminded me of one of those Andy Warhol movies....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a better movie if you watch it with Closed Captioned and the sound muted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I was a Sound Recordist for many years working at three major Motion Picture Studios, to me a film's soundtrack is just as important as the images being seen on the screen. It's been said that when the soundtrack of a movie is good, nobody notices. However, when the soundtrack is bad, it's the first thing EVERYBODY notices, and "Faces" is no exception. I think Cassavetes was so focused on the actors, the story, and the camera angles being used, he totally forgot about that pesky ol' thing called, "Sound Quality." I guess he just figured, you go down to Radio Shack, buy yourself an inexpensive microphone, place it in the corner of a room, and start shooting,...NOT! My God, I've heard better sound quality in home videos shot by amateurs. Since I can't get past the hollow-squeaky soundtrack of "Faces", I'm afraid any of it's good qualities are lost on me. That's why I'm giving it a big THUMBS DOWN!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What do people see in this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is shot in black and white, for no apparent reason. The dialog is unintelligible for the most part, and that's a good thing because the lines that we could hear were just plain bad. Like, for example, the seemingly random jokes that come out of nowhere. Why did the guy throw the clock out the window? He wanted to see time fly! That's just hilarious, no? It takes too long for anything to happen in this movie, the opening scene between the married guy, the woman, and the other guy is just painful in its pointlessness, and the dance scene went on for way too long. I really really don't understand how this is averaging a 7.6, although the fact that only 255 people have voted for it does say something about the movie despite its high rating. I, on the other had, was forced to watch it for a class, which I assume only has a small part to do with it as far as why I couldn't stand it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One word sums it up: boring! The dialog is too pretentious, i.e., people in real life don't talk like this. The scenes are incredibly long and trying; nothing happens. And the acting is shallow. During the entire film I had the impression I was watching actors act rather than identifying with the characters they were supposed to be portraying.Don't get me wrong. I love independent films - far more than your standard Hollywood productions, but his one was one big waste of time.</fullReview>
