		<shortDescription>Smart, intelligent, engaging and surprisingly witty Headhunters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I have to say I read the novel of which this movie is based upon, "Headhunters" by Jo Nesb?, two years ago. A thriller I liked quite a lot. Usually a novel is better than the film. Well, here Morten Tyldum (Acclaimed films as "Buddy" and a short in "Most people usually live in China"), succeeded in making a film just as interesting and exciting as the book.Nesb?'s writing is interesting. This is most probably why Jo Nesb?'s first movie adaption of his series of novels with Harry Hole will be directed by Martin Scorsese, on Nesb?'s demand - his favorite director.Actually I still kept being surprised as the movie went along. Not only because I can't remember all details in the book, but simply because the movie has a pace and also from time to time action-clipping which makes you feel poor Roger Brown's disasters. The handcraft is beautifully done. As simple as that. Actually this film was sold to more than 50 distributors in just as many countries before it even premiered in Norway. Probably both to the novel writers Jo Nesb?'s for the latter years has become world acclaimed and compared to Stieg Larsson, buy maybe also due to director Morten Tyldums merits so far. Of course also credit to the producers, managing to sell on a promise!?Mark Wahlberg has said he was stunned by the film, and is now to make an American remake of it, with himself as Roger. Which, of course, is not at all needed. The original is as good as it gets.Well, back to the story. Roger Brown is a self-obtained headhunter for big companies, which has to steal art on the side to keep his woman happy. Or at least he think he has to do so. He has all the right connections, until he starts stealing from the wrong guy, while headhunting him as a new boss to a successful company. A former mercenary, or different kind of headhunter, he's turning out to be. When he understands that his greed has gotten him into trouble, he really finds out what it is, being headhunted.Both Aksel Hennie and Nicolai Coaster-Waldau is perfectly casted for this movie. Synn?ve Macody Lund does a decent job in her debut-role, as do the rest of the cast. Fun also to see that real working police-chiefs in Oslo are attending the police press conference in the movie. Didn't know that even was possible for them to be allowed to do that. This actually makes both an in-joke as well as making the plot believable and "true" in our country.It will surprise me if this film doesn't get a remake in Hollywood in less than two years. Not that it'll be as good as this, or even necessary. But that's how the Hollywood-world is, nowadays.No doubt, the script is good. So is in all aspects the rest of the film as well. The film is smart, intelligent, surprising witty, and will engage you all the way through, both as a good story as well as a love story or a thriller. How much more do you want?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You rarely get a movie this good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. It has been a long time since I've seen a movie this good. The movie tells the story of Roger Brown, a headhunter who also has a side job as an art thief. His latest job goes wrong and things get out of control from there on. If I give any more of the plot, I will spoil the movie for you. And trust me, you don't want that. A big part of what I enjoyed about the movie is watching how crazy things go for Roger.Apart from the very intelligent story, what really makes the film standout is the character development, especially for the main character Roger Brown played excellently by Aksel Hennie. You start of seeing him one way, but by the end of the movie, your perception of him will definitely change. He goes through a lot (and I mean A LOT) in the movie. While watching the movie I kept thinking, "Man, give this guy a break". The intelligent story has a whole lot of heart as well.The acting was top notch from the 2 main actors, Aksel Hennie and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (who you may know as Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones). Synn?ve Macody Lund who play Roger's wife Diana is beautifully good too. I hope she gets more prominent roles after this.This is one movie you shouldn't miss. There's a Hollywood version in the making but it would be very hard top this original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen some plot holes mentioned by other reviewers, but to be honest it won't spoil your viewing of this movie and I could even say that most films ask you for some kind of suspension of disbelief, otherwise you'd never go to the movies.I really didn't like the protagonist at all at first, but then your sympathy for him grows as he ends up having to do things that he wouldn't dream of in a million years, just to stay alive.It's all handled very well and moves along at a nice pace. There some particularly black moments when you almost feel guilty about laughing. But this film got a reaction from me, and for me, that's what a well put together film should do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cut-throat world of Norwegian recruitment consultancy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Touted as the next Stieg Larsson (or if you prefer, Norway's answer to Sweden's other major literary export, Henning Mankell), Jo Nesbo's Headhunters had already been earmarked for a (no doubt inferior) US remake before it was even released overseas. Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is a 168cm recruitment consultant with a big house, a beautiful wife and an inferiority complex that drives him to moonlight as an art thief. The prosaically named protagonist is no Thomas Crown - he steals to keep a (wildly overleveraged) roof over his head and only pockets a measly 30% of the revenue from his ill-gotten gains. Even his appearance is counterintuitive - more bug eyed Steve Buscemi than suited and booted Bond. Even so, there's more going on here than meets the eye, but suffice to say that his real troubles start when he decides to go after The Big One - the retirement score that will put an end to his financial troubles and allow him to keep his ridiculously attractive wife in the style to which he's become accustomed.To say anything more about the plot would be superfluous, but I will take a moment to admire the confidence of the director Morten Tyldum. Headhunters is, in a sense, typically Scandinavian - stark, brooding and with as much silence as dialogue. The style here serves the substance - the camera is often completely immobile, forcing the audience to concentrate on what's going on, a complete contrast to the craftsmanship/gimmickry more typical of glossy mainstream thrillers coming out of the US. Rather than spoonfeeding the audience every single clue, Headhunters isn't afraid to lead the unwitting watcher on a merry dance. Naturally the whole enterprise rests on the small but perfectly formed cast, particularly Hennie, with whom we slowly come to empathise, and the more typically suave Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as the former exec with a murky past.If Headhunters has a particular weakness, it's that it spends most of its time descending into increasingly dark (and occasionally graphically violent) territory, while occasionally veering into light hearted caper. This does feel slightly bewildering, but to be honest, it's a relative minor criticism. Headhunters is definitely worth catching (particularly given the woefully slim pickings over the past few months), if not now, then 6 months from now when it premieres on Film Four in the middle of the night. Scandinavians (and cinéastes with a penchant for Northern European film) may be used to this kind of thing, but for the rest of us it's a wonderfully welcome arctic blast through the land's tat filled cinema screens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Twists and Turns than a Fjord-side Road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Brown has a pretty good life. By day, he's a corporate recruiter (headhunter) who goes home at night to a magnificent house and stunning wife. Unfortunately, Roger's insecurities (he's only 5'6") lead him to seek a lifestyle well beyond his means. How does he make up the difference between his income and expenses? High-priced art theft, of course.Such is the premise of "Headhunters," a terrific Norwegian film that follows up its run at the 55th San Francisco International Film Festival with a general release. The film garnered quite a lot of buzz at the Festival and, after a recent screening, it's easy to see why. A mixture of crime/heist drama, action/suspense thriller, and love story, it's what the 1999 version of "The Thomas Crown Affair" might have looked like if it had been directed by Sam Peckinpah.Brown, played by Aksel Hennie, is looking for one big score to settle him for life. Circumstances bring that possibility to him, but things are not what they seem. Things go wrong - very, very wrong - and Roger finds himself in deep, deep sh** (literally as well as figuratively.) To say much more would spoil the intricate plot (I'll leave that to the trailer,) but suffice it to say you should just sit back, buckle up, and enjoy the ride. This film has more twists and turns than a fjord-side road.Fast paced and extremely violent in spots, this film is not for the squeamish. If you can get through a little (well, a lot) of body mutilation, high impact body trauma and the occasional spearing, you'll find yourself enjoying (yes, I said it ? enjoying) a cinematic thrill ride that puts its American counterparts (see Ocean's Eleven/Twelve/Thirteen, etc.) to shame.Catch it before the typical half-assed American remake appears?www.worstshowontheweb.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Headhunters, based on Jo Nesbo's novel of the same, lived up to all my expectations - even though I am not very keen on thrillers in general. It all started out fairly interesting, although I quickly started to dislike the main character, Roger Brown. His snobbish, very self-confident attitude just put me off. However, to support his lavish lifestyle, he steals art to afford everything for his beloved wife and it all ends in a captivating battle of survival. Soon, he is chased by his rival, Clas Greve, and it seems to be an absolutely hopeless escape as Greve is always just a few steps behind. First, I attended the movie with close attention. But in the end, I didn't even dare to breath properly. A highly-recommended, although too bloody, high-quality thriller for everybody!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is how a thriller should be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im from Norway, and the last years Norwegians movies that are known has been horror movies. So this is a kind of movies we don't get from Norway so very often. That the main actor was good, is no surprise - and he is the actor in many other movies as well. But this is probably the movie i have liked him most. He plays a character that have many flaws, and that does not act like a hero. And the story is a bit twisted - and surprising. I saw it with a friend from Philippines and we both agree that this is one of the best thriller we have seen in 2011. So hurray for this Norwegians movie - and lets hope it will come more in the years that come in this quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty boy Aksel Hennie (ginger beauty on a par with Julian Rhind-Tutt), proves to be well cast in this frantic thriller. Starting as an arrogant self-important but clearly insecure (at just 5'6")office type, he soon shows his coolness in robbing job candidates of their fine art. The story is inventive and translates well to the screen in this version directed by Morten Tyldum. The action soon turns horrifying and Aksel Hennie has the perfect physiognomy to illustrate the change without recourse to words. You really do travel this terrible journey with him and it is truly terrifying. You begin to empathise with a man you have no reason to like, and that is saying something! Thank goodness there is no smell-o-vision as Roger Brown seeks refuge in a cesspool. There's nowhere for him to go and no way of hiding. You do feel he will never survive - and this takes you right to the penultimate scenes. A marvellous tour de force by all involved. Hurrah! A brilliant film at last!</fullReview>

Aksel Hennie gives a stunning performance as Roger Brown,a company's head-hunter that seeks to recruit the best with his unique strategy of negotiating and "reading" people. Except that job Roger also steals very expensive paintings with his partners aid.Everything goes bad when he steals a painting from a former mercenary that he approached to recruit.The movie has an incredible rhythm.Also very impressive and unforgettable scenes.The cast and the soundtrack are magnificent.Its a rock-solid story filled with deception and turnovers.

		<shortDescription>Norwegian crime thriller with twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dark Scandinavian crime movies being all the rage lately, this intelligent, action-packed thriller didn't disappoint. I went into the film without reading the book or indeed knowing a single thing about the film. I enjoyed it.I was drawn into this northern world with its interesting people and beautiful natural scenery. What also made this movie stand out was the fast-paced plot with many unusual and unexpected twists. It is the kind of film that has you glued to your seat to see what could possibly happen next to the main character. Roger Brown, the headhunter, becomes headhunted. (But what's the story with the English name??) No movie is perfect. There were a few plot problems and I have to admit I looked at my watch half way through, despite the fast pace.Perhaps the film could be faulted for showing only two types of Norwegians: rich sophisticates and yokels (all blond of course). Aren't there any ordinary middle-class people in Norway? Also, some of the scenes may be too difficult for the squeamish to watch. Not exessive, but just a little over the top.I'd give this film a higher score, but I am not a fan of the genre. Still, I did enjoy it for what it was and would recommend it to anyone. It's a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A headhunter works in a recruitment firm and also having penchant for precious works of art (Stealing and selling them). Unpredictably he engulfs himself in a twisted journey of the life which takes him to a farther length.The script is very distant from the Hollywood clichés and has its own essence of storytelling and sense of humor. It will keep you engaged until the mystery is unfolded. Having watched so many thrillers like this, it still gives you a different experience with all the set up and moments of surprise.Aksel Hennie(Roger) and Nicolai Coaster-Waldau(Clas Greve) are fantastic in their roles. Rest of the cast has done pure justice to their parts. All the characters are believable and developed wonderfully as the movie progresses.It's an awesome thriller with great weave and turn with every element of a good cinema.Highly Recommended 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came to this film looking forward to it immensely and came away from it a tad disappointed, granted there are some genuinely original moments but not enough to warrant the star rating that this has achieved....The plot is majorly contrived and relies on far too many coincidences, and the ending which was telegraphed so early on in the film relies on so many variables coming right at the same time that you really have to suspend belief to a ridiculous degree. I don't know how closely the script is to the book, but I'd heard great things of Jo Nesbo now I'm not so sure. This will no doubt be re-made for people who are too lazy to read subtitles and I can't imagine that the re-imagining will help anything....I enjoy foreign language films as a rule but can't help but wondering if this movie would have so many favourable reviews if it was a standard Hollywood production</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lost Opportunity, Warped Morality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unsightly abomination, which we are supposed to endure as the protagonist, has an awfully low self-esteem; he is embarrassed of his size; he is inept to comply with his gorgeous wife, Diana; and consequently equivocal to her desire for having children. As the narrative hurtles impressively, he is seen copulating with another woman, merely to quench his conjugally dysfunctional concupiscent desires.The interview wherein he talks about the importance of reputation is brilliant. But the initially promising set-up soon dissipates. We are supposed to root for this insecure, despicable weed that, despite being adulterous himself, gets in a moral rage when he stumbles upon his wife's infidelity. We are to cheer for this parasite that obdurately refuses to take its dying pal to hospital. Of course, Morten Tyldum expects us to embrace the "shades of grey", yet he gets moralistic with an utterly cheesy, saccharine sweet climax, ridiculously accentuated by Diana's pot-belly.In a miserable attempt to evince his "breed", this fecal sausage disguised as an actor, not only threatens to sack Clas Greve (played effortlessly by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) but also render him unemployable. His persona as an intimidating corporate magnate, who can make or break careers at whim, is a giggle. It gets downright laughable when the director tries to pass this rickety, emasculated eyesore as a John Rambo and a suave, charming James Bond-archetype, who wrestles out of every peril laid out for him.It doesn't help the fact that Aksel Hennie has neither the charisma nor the talent to play this character. How could someone so ineffectual, with the appeal of human excrement, be entrusted with this role: perhaps as an amulet to ward-off the evil eye? It's as baffling as to see a sophisticated beauty, Diana, feed on this coughed-up phlegm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what I'm talking about. 'Headhunters' is a rippingly good skandi crime thriller directed by Morten Tyldum from a novel by Jo Nesbo. Aksel Hennie is the protagonist who gets in over his head when an art theft goes wrong, 'Game of Thrones's Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Synn?ve Macody Lund and Eivind Sander provide the support in what is a highly enjoyable euro-thriller. Even though the cast is small, they are well used and the story rattles along at a pace that keeps the viewer involved at every turn. There are some satisfying developments that don't really qualify as twists, and there is nothing radical here, but it is done with style and panache, and Hennie's lead performance is so engaging that you will be happy to get dragged along for the ride. Another excellent example of why Scandinavian dramas are deservedly riding high.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the novel by Jo Nesbo, this one quickly sets up the main character Roger Brown as someone we neither trust nor necessarily even like. He is a smooth talking recruiter who steals valuable artwork to (barely) support his luxurious lifestyle which includes a near-super model girlfriend and modern mansion.The film is based in Norway and director Morten Tyldum seems to have a very wicked sense of humor as he really puts Roger (Aksel Hennie) through some things not even found in the worst fraternity or military hazing. While it can be classified as a very taut thriller, it is also a demented ride that would make the Coen Brothers proud. As a matter of fact, it would surprise me if this one doesn't get a U.S. remake very soon. The story and characters lend themselves very well to a star vehicle.However, I don't wish to sell this version short. It is well done and entertaining in a devilish way. When Roger meets Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the real fun begins. Many will recognize Coaster-Waldau from "Game of Thrones" and he proves to be a terrific adversary for Roger. Neither are what they seem, and both seem quite pleasant to everyone else. Roger's girlfriend Diana is played by the beautiful Synnove Macody Lund, and even she brings a nice element of doubt to the story. There is also a nice supporting turn from Julie Olgaard as Lotte.The tone and twists remind me a bit of Blood Simple, but this one is even a bit more outrageous and things spin out of control for the characters. Much of the film is a spent in chase mode and that leads to some drama, thrills and chuckles. That's a pretty nice compliment for any movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrived absurdity and convoluted plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you think the majority of films today are inane, tawdry, and without any lasting value, Norwegian director Morten Tydlum's Headhunters is a step up, but not by much. The film makes an effort to be clever, intelligent, maybe even a well-orchestrated black comedy, but for me, it falls short of warranting a Hollywood remake, scheduled for 2014. Based on a novel by crime writer Jo Nesbo with a screenplay by Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg, Headhunters' chief protagonist Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is a diminutive corporate recruiter who interviews prospective talent during the day. At night, he has a second job - stealing expensive paintings and selling them on the black market to make sure his taller wife, Diana (Synn?ve Macody Lund), does not want for any of the "good things" in life.Roger contributes heavily to the Oslo Art Gallery that Diana runs and their house reflects their pretend social status. This is presumably an indictment of the greedy capitalist who makes tons of money and shows it off to the neighborhood without anyone realizing it is gained by sleazy, corrupt, and blatantly criminal methods, but its lack of nuance only suggests caricatures, not real people. Interviewing prospective management hires, Roger, in his good-natured way, probes the candidates for information on their possible possession of valuable art, and then, with the assistance of his cohort Ove Kjikerud (Eivind Sander), breaks into their home to steal their treasures.The film is bright and breezy up until the point that Roger meets his match in the person of Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), himself a former CEO and a trained special-forces operator who has even less scruples than Roger. Being interviewed for the head of an Oslo conglomerate named Pathfinder, Clas reveals himself to be the owner of a priceless Rubens painting worth millions, fair game for Rogers' grubby hands. Clas is mainly after the CEO job, however, and will stop at nothing (including seducing Roger's wife) to get Roger's recommendation or make sure that he is out of the "picture".Unfortunately, after the successful theft of the Rubens, the film falls apart in a convoluted series of chase sequences in which poor old Roger is attacked by a not-too-friendly dog who ends up impaled on the front of a truck, is buried deep in a pile of excrement, becomes bloodied and trapped in a vehicle slammed off the cliff by a onrushing truck, is stabbed by Lotte (Julie ?lgaard), his duplicitous extra-marital girlfriend who plants transmitters in his hair so Clas can always keep him in his sights, and much more.Roger is so set-upon that we begin to pull for him, forgetting his cutesy habit of robbing people of their most prized possessions to feed his wife's ambitions. While the film has its share of fun (if you don't take it seriously), its contrived absurdity and convoluted plot, which has more twists and turns than Mulholland Drive, soon wears out its welcome and is not redeemed by a silly and unconvincing ending. The fact that Hollywood has signed on to do a remake, however, indicates that, worthwhile or not, the industry takes its marketing potential very seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Headhunters is visually and technically wonderful. But the story seemed, to me, to be a protracted adolescent escape fantasy played by grownups, with convolutions and complexity that sat like cold lard on my tongue.It sort of reminds me of early Tintin comics, which were pretty much that; a rapid-fire litany of narrow escapes. I'm also sort of reminded of The Spanish Prisoner, which I didn't like for roughly the same reasons; complexity with no believable redemptive angle.Speaking of which, there was a conspicuous absence of a true mythic dimension. I have to tread lightly here, as it's hard to justify this judgment call without spoilers. In a nutshell, we're supposed to believe that all our hero's bloody threads get tidied up neat and clean, and our hero is redeemed by love, and is able to return to pretty much his old life, except with his priorities arranged in a healthier way, and with a new commitment to fulfilling his wife's lifestyle expectations. But the whole exposition seemed very earthbound and tepid. Sorry, it just don't fly.By way of comparison, I found Kill Bill did a better job of winning me over to the redemption of the blood-spattered hero. What does Kill Bill do better that Headhunters fails to do?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fast moving intelligent and at times comical thriller.Roger Brown is an Oslo headhunter for big corporations looking for CEOs. He also steals art in order to afford an expensive life style and gifts for his wife but the money gained is never enough. Looking for the big payoff is his only hope. It arrives in the form of a Danish businessman whose dead mother apparently has an original Rubens worth many millions of dollars.Unfortunately for Brown this Danish CEO has another agenda and in an earlier career was a special forces tracker of international terrorists and wanted criminals.I won't bore you with repeats of the plot. This movie is intelligent fast paced and full of surprises. The cinematography is excellent and there are humorous moments e.g. the rural Norwegian police. These humorous details are not incongruous with a good thriller and are things you have never seen before e.g. Roger has to submerge himself in the bottom of an outhouse.A lot happens in a short time so you may have to think it through or read the plot synopsis after watching it at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headhunters_(film)This will allow you to tie all the loose ends together.The Norwegian provenance of course adds to the fun of this movie. This movie was quite successful costing around $4 million and grossing about $14 million.Highly RECOMMEND</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A top-notch action-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Headhunters is the first in what I suspect will be a slew of Jo Nesb? film adaptations in the coming years and Morten Tyldum's cinematic rendering offers suspense, action and most notably intelligence, sometimes rare in the action-thriller genre. The film, based on the Edgar Award nominated Norwegian author's 2008 novel Hodejegerne (Headhunters), follows a highly successful corporate headhunter, who sidelines as an art thief, Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) as he tries to obtain an extremely rare and valuable Peter Paul Rubens painting, lost since World War II, from former elite solider Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau).Roger Brown has a borderline Napoleon complex that he is well aware of judging by the numerous times he mentions his height, 1.68m. The fact that his wife Diana (Synn?ve Macody Lund) is much taller than him and supposedly prefers a certain luxurious lifestyle, forces him, in his mind, to steal and sell valuable art pieces in order to buy his wife expensive gifts and a support their lavish lifestyle. The viewer quickly learns that all Diana wants in her life is a child, something Roger is hesitant to consider.Diana has recently opened a new art gallery in Oslo and it is here that Roger meets, not only the perfect target for his current corporate recruitment in Clas Greve, but also the answers to his financial woes when Clas mentions to Diana that he possesses a long-thought to be lost Reubens painting. Roger sets out to break into Clas's apartment with the help of his sleazy criminal partner Ove (Eivind Sander), but Roger finds a lot more than the painting and soon finds out that Clas is a headhunter in his own way.Ove's job is to disable security systems so Roger can infiltrate the building and obtain the targeted art pieces and Ove is also responsible for selling the stolen property. When Ove tries to retrieve the stolen Reubens from Roger's car things goes awry and Roger is suddenly thrust into a brutal game of cat and mouse. And by brutal, I mean Tyldum doesn't shy away from capturing the violence, neither the present violence nor the effects of said violence. In one scene, Tyldum presents what is probably the most uncomfortable and immensely painful head shaving sequence captured on film. The story also contains what has to be one of the greatest tests of trust and if you were to pass this test you should be forgiven for any and all past transgressions.Though the film does suffer from plot holes, as do most films in the thriller genre, they don't seem to be as egregious as others of its ilk. Aksel Hennie gives a great performance as the insecure art thief and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau does equally well as the ruthless hunter. Hollywood may have just found their newest fountain of secondhand ideas in 'Scandi-crime' adaptations, akin to the Japanese horror remakes of the early to mid 2000s, but Headhunters is a must-see, a tremendous and enjoyable addition to the action-thriller genre.Kevin FilmPulse.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very tasty thriller from Scandinavia. It starts off at a sedate pace then gradually gathers pace until it gains a fine momentum. In retrospect there may be one coincidence too many - after all, what are the chances of an art thief successfully 'lifting' a Rubens worth millions, calling his wife on her mobile, from the scene of the theft, only to find it ringing in the bedroom, where (presumably) she dropped it whilst sleeping with the victim. This is only the first of many plot twists as the perp becomes the target of the owner, who - highly trained in combat/surveillance - seeks revenge. None of the cast are known in this country but all acquit themselves well. An excellent effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is a top headhunter, working in Olso but he has a secret. He uses the information her gains from interviewing clients to break into their homes and steal expensive artwork which he then sells through back channels in Sweden. Brown thinks he has come across the heist of a lifetime when he learns that a long lost Rubens has been sitting in an Oslo apartment since the Second World War but he gets much more than he bargained for when it transpires that he picked the wrong target to mess with.With the success of the likes of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Borgen and The Killing in recent years, it was only a matter of time before a Jo Nesbo novel was adapted for the big screen. I am currently reading a different Nesbo novel as I write this (though not at this very second) and am really enjoying it. This film captures the tone and style of Nesbo which will delight his hordes of fans. I wouldn't be surprised to see his Harry Hole series adapted in the near future.The film is a true thriller which had me on the edge of my seat. The first half is mostly a tense heist type of story with the second half being mostly one huge chase with a few rest bites thrown in to give those sweaty palms a break. The story is complex and interesting and made the film feel longer to me that it actually was. This isn't a bad way however and I'd happily have watched for another half an hour. The film and its lead character are very clever and this should excite the audience and leave them thoroughly satisfied.The acting from Hennie is superb. He shows great depth and cunning as well as despair and heartbreak. It's a career performance from him. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, best known as Jamie Lanninster from Game of Thrones to English speaking audiences is also excellent opposite Hennie. The two have a real duel in terms of the action and the acting. Coaster-Waldau is impossibly cool and suits his role to a tee. Every main character is given a fair amount of back story which really helps to give them their identity and drive.Unsurprisingly a Hollywood remake is already in the works but I'd recommend seeing the original as I can't see how having Ryan Reynolds and Kiefer Sutherland or someone similar will improve the film. It's just an excuse for lazy people not to have to read and for Hollywood studios to make money without doing anything original.This film is smart, witty and original and even has a love story at its centre. I can't recommend it highly enough. It is only the second Norwegian film I've seen, with Troll Hunter being the first, but if they're all as good as these two, I can't wait to watch my third.www.attheback.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Headhunters" offers an exquisite thriller cocktail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If all of Norwegian crime writer Jo Nesb?'s novels are like "Headhunters," may they all grace the big screen. A cat-and-mouse thriller that unlike much of today's films doesn't drown itself in top-secret government ops and the consequent jargon, "Headhunters" blends suspense, violence, wit and top-flight acting into a superior nail-biter.Although the premise of a main character who steals famous works of art on the side contains a great deal of originality, it takes a deft hand to keep "Headhunters" so exciting. Director Morten Tyldum keeps what on paper is really a rather outlandish premise feeling real and tense.Aksel Hennie stars as Roger, a headhunter for some high-end clients who supports his lavish lifestyle and picturesque wife (Synn?ve Macody Lund) with a side business that involves multi-million-dollar art theft. Quite meticulous, Roger prides himself on a few rules and beliefs that have gotten him this far, and Hennie radiates a bold and confident exterior that clearly masks Roger's inner paranoia.When his wife opens her art gallery, he meets Clas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), who he learns is in possession of a painting that could net Roger and his partner Ove (Eivind Sander) enough to quit the theft game forever. Consider that Clas' job in both the military and in business is complex GPS nanotechnology and tracking systems and you can guess what the plot has in store.The first half hour of "Headhunters" isn't exactly quick, but it's a juicy set-up as we become intrigued by Roger's operation as well as some adulterous twists that make the stakes of the cat-and-mouse acts all the higher. Roger is kind of smug and unlikable too, which brings an added range of emotions into the picture. As Roger starts to slowly unravel in his confidence and sanity, Hennie and his piercing blue eyes perfectly capture the sense of panic that we need to identify with him.As we endure the second-act adrenaline rush, the story calls for a few outlandish and extreme twists and turns with a black comedic edge. They wouldn't work in a drama like this under most circumstances, but the pure intensity leading up to and immediately following these odder moments has an amplifying effect on them, one that can best be described as gleefully entertaining in spite of the subject matter.Tyldum's balancing of the dark humor and clever, almost caper-like elements of "Headhunters" with the true drama and suspense gets a little exposed toward the end of the movie. Granted the story reveals itself to be an absolutely wild ride late in the game with a neat and tidy ending to things, but the tone in the ending moments didn't have to reflect that to a T. Wrapping with a wink and smile somewhat undermined the well-developed character drama, as if the writers who adapted the book were unaware that it would be as well-acted as it was.That said, the rare combination of depth of drama and suspense along with a creative, easy- to-follow story is a lot of what makes "Headhunters" such a joy to watch, even if it can be attributed to its few flaws. There's just the right amount of spice thrown in, which can't be said of most of today's thrillers, most of which tend to stick to the book or lean heavily toward comedy or gritty and violent rather than walking the line.Also laudable in "Headhunters" is how technology plays an integral role in the plot as opposed to being the gimmick that keeps us engaged. No character has a suitcase full of doodads that conveniently move the plot along in an exciting manner. The only thing you'll have trouble believing is how Roger lives sustaining some of the injuries he accrues in the second half of the film, but it proves to be worth it.After "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" and the rest of Stieg Larsson's "Millennium Trilogy," it could be said the best thrillers these days are coming out of Scandinavia, so connoisseurs of the genre would be wise to keep an eye on foreign cinema. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<fullReview>I haven't seen anything this ridiculous for a long time. The whole plot was laughable and none of the characters had any depth. It irritated me so much that I didn't pay any attention to the photography or direction, but I did notice some of the incidental music was quite good.Most of the huge plot holes have been addressed by other IMDb reviewers. Anyone who watches the many crime series coming out of the States will be nagged by the feeling that there's a lot of contradictory and forensic evidence left hanging around to raise the suspicions of any competent police department.If it hadn't been for the subtitles I'd have fast-forwarded through much of this film - but then I might have missed some of the incredible plot. It bears some resemblance to a Carry On film, but without the laughs (though I did giggle to myself quite a lot).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cracking crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scandinavia seems to be quite prominent in the crime genre nowadays; there are numerous TV shows, such 'Borgen', 'The Bridge' and 'The Killing' and ever-popular books, the most notable example being Stieg Larsson's 'Millennium' trilogy, which was made into a series of films in his native Sweden, while the trilogy's first instalment was also made in a U.S. production. All of which brings me to 'Headhunters', a cracking thriller adapted from Jo Nesb?'s novel of the same name.Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is a corporate recruiter, albeit one with a Napoleon complex. His real source of income comes from his dealings as an art thief, which helps him to afford his wealthy lifestyle and ensure that his statuesque wife doesn't leave him. After discovering that one of his job prospects, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster Waldau) owns one of the most valuable paintings around, Roger plans to steal it, however he is unaware of exactly who he is dealing with. Aksel Hennie is terrific as Roger Brown; he's an unlikable and selfish chap, who utilises his smarts throughout the movie to ingeniously escape a number of crazy predicaments as the hunter becomes the hunted and Roger is truly put through the wringer. As Clas Greve, Nikolaj Coaster Waldau (ever-brilliant as Jaime Lannister in 'Game of Thrones') is essentially everything that Roger isn't ? tall, suave and handsome. The Danish actor uses this to his advantage and proves to be an excellent foil to Hennie.There are rumours of a American remake starring Mark Wahlberg, presumably as Roger Brown, however, but let's hope it doesn't happen, because it's highly unlikely that it could be a patch on 'Headhunters'. It's a thoroughly entertaining, blackly comic and intelligently-written cat-and-mouse thriller that moves at a great pace, with a couple of breathless setpieces and an excellent cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine Nordic crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Headhunters, a less known Norwegian crime thriller that has a lot going for it. The film is packed with realistic action, entertainment and has a interesting story with non-mainstream characters, so what is there not to like? Firstly the novel based script is compelling with a story revolving around Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie), a egoistic upper class snob who happens to be one of Norway's most accomplished headhunters. Not exactly easy to relate to main character, but things turn considerably more interesting when Roger's undercover career is revealed. In order to support his lavish life style, Roger resolves to art thievery which by chance puts him in path of his greatest peril, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Clas being a former mercenary distinguished in the field of intelligence gathering is looking to work for a surveillance company Pathfinder for which Roger is managing recruitment process. Without revealing too much of the story, from here on Roger and Clas are entangled in a high paced deathly duel where they try to outsmart each other with mortal consequences.I liked Headhunters, it is a terrific example of skilled Nordic filmcraft at its best which combines good directing, credible acting, dark realism and intelligent story which all together make it overall a very enjoyable package. There were some script quirks and the pace of the film at times was breathtaking, but nothing major to gripe about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Norway goes Hollywood...with thrilling results.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering it's about as Hollywoodised as a foreign film can be, speculation regarding an American remake of gripping thriller Headhunters should come as no surprise. The story keys on corporate bigwig Roger (Aksel Hennie), who feeds his extravagant tastes by moonlighting as an art thief. But when one job goes awry and he gets the wrong man (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) offside, all hell threatens to break loose.The film conveys a consistent tone of threat and paranoia, for which the entire cast deserves credit. Headhunters essentially plays out like two films in one, and in so doing satisfies the ancient cliché of providing 'something for everyone'. The first half is an absorbing character study in which character interplay dominates, while the second clears the way for stimulating, sensory action sequences as Roger seemingly travels to the ends of the earth in the deadliest game of cat and mouse.The film closes with a poignant ending, showing that the hell Roger has just been through is in fact a metaphor for the life he has been living and what needs to change. Although his epiphany during the epilogue is uncharacteristically neat and a little Scrooge-esque, it does little to dispel the film's message; one that is expertly disguised as mainstream entertainment.The lone extra on the DVD is a 'making of' featurette that possesses all the clichés of the format: discussions about unexpected challenges in shooting, brief profiles of the director and main cast and a round of perennial backslapping. While it offers no further insight into the motivations of Coaster-Waldau's villain, which is arguably the only setback worth mentioning, it does fill out Hennie's character that little bit more while justifying the film's underlying motives.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good crime-drama from Norway.A man, Roger Brown (played by Aksel Hennie), leads a dual life. On the one hand he is a highly-respected recruitment headhunter. On the other hand, and known to only one other person, he is a highly- accomplished art thief. Then one day he robs someone and finds his life in danger...Clever, well-paced thriller, with solid direction from Morten Tyldum (whose next movie was The Imitation Game). The tension builds well and is maintained well. There's also a certain amount of intrigue and twists, as you don't know what the other party's motives are.Not perfect though. It gets a bit far-fetched towards the end, especially once you discover why everything is happening. Plus it gets to be more of an action movie than a thriller after a while.Good performance by Aksel Hennie in the lead role. Good support from Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (of Game of Thrones fame) and Synn?ve Macody Lund.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very well done, but truly evil. I'm 65 and if films are reflections of our society and culture then I'm thrilled about global warming and the end of the planet. This little cinematic wonder is about the younger generations who feel the ends always justify the means. They believe in the Trump vision--you only get there by being nasty and grabbing things away from people who are perceived weaker than you are. It's dog eat dog only in this film the dog gets eaten although it's a horrid animal anyway so you don't mind. Everyone of the characters are killers and fakes. They scam each other and everyone else. The most evil really is the main character (a short guy with the typical Napoleon complex) who ends up 'getting away with it.' The moral of this little drama is crime pays as long as nobody finds out about it and you get rid of all the evidence and if you have a baby it solves all your marital problems. Sick heterosexual fantasy. It's one redeeming factor is that it's fast moving like a Bond film--lots of cliffhangers. Good Saturday night fun if you can trick yourself into believing that the real world isn't like this. It is, of course, and we who watch the news know better. Personally, at my age it's just easier to keep the doors locked and stay inside. Humanity isn't all that interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Headhunters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A slick Norwegian thriller from director Morten Tyldum, HEADHUNTERS is a thoroughly gripping and spanking high-octane cat-mouse game (magnificent suspense enhancer), which is goodly on a par with any of its qualified Hollywood counterparts (a US remake is already on the process). An obnoxiously cocksure premise always forebodes something ominous is looming in the air, a vertically challenged headhunter (the same height as mine, I feel so blessed I'm not living in Scandinavian region) whose clandestine identity is a painting thieve, lives an (almost) perfect life, the ostensible glitch is the reluctance to have a baby with his tall and sultry wife (who is a gallery owner), so what is the purpose to find a towering wife if he doesn't want any offspring to offset his genetic shortcoming? The prompt reason is fertility malfunction, which actually is not the case at all. In fact, a probable financial quandary is the latent menace which will overturn his plush lifestyle so when an opportunity arrives unwittingly, he decides to make his final job, which could set him free of his past and guarantee an opulent future, against an intimidating alpha-male (ex marine and tracking expert), then of course things will slide down to a nightmare he has never imagined, after the travails of narrow escapes from death, remarkably he is able to shift from the victim to a plotter and eventually defeats his enemy, gets away with the law and revitalize his relationship with his wife, an overtly optimistic happy-ending. The film consistently registers the fast-paced rhythm running around an over-manipulated plot, including many shock-value stunts which craftily exerted (an unexpected come-back- from-the-dead upset, the cesspit hiding, and the gruesome aftermath of a police vehicle careening off the cliff, etc.), but in order to pull off a thorny come-clean turnabout, if giving a considerable amount of time to muse on after the viewing, many plot-holes will betray (not everything can be pigeonholed as a fluke in the spiderweb of meticulous criminal activities), and unexplained loopholes are glaring enough to an extent which would categorically diminish the frisson which one could apprehend first-hand. Leading man Aksel Hennie delivers a dynamic momentum in his physically-racked bullet- avoiding incubus, and confidently evokes an anti-hero aura which would otherwise be running against the audience's conscience. The Hollywood-struggling Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (from GAME OF THRONES series and Jessica Chastain-vehicled horror feature MAMA 2013) is ill-starred as the villain, largely sidelined except his virile extravaganza (the final face-off is a major let-down). Two female characters are ambivalently written here, one is to keep the scheme as misty as possible and another is simply garnished as an additional action gadget to the main course.So, although the film may feel tainted after a second viewing (which I may politely bypass), there is some genuine novelty and sufficient workmanship in the making, and inasmuch as there are two things we cannot defy, one is the gravity and another is a writer's block, let's overlook the elephant in the room and cherish an adrenalin-driven adventure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Headhunters is like a roller-coaster ride. Once it gets going, it never stops. On the way, it leads you from one thrill to another. And once in a while, it even turns the whole world upside down. Fast-paced, intelligent and a little bit over the top: that's what makes Headhunters a good movie. The story is interesting enough: high-flying headhunter uses information from his clients to steal valuable art, which he needs to maintain his luxurious life-style and his beautiful trophy wife. But everything goes wrong when he starts the search for a new ceo for a mysterious technology company, and soon his arrogant yuppie behaviour makes way for a struggle for life. Not all the story elements are believable, and some are quite preposterous. But this is the sort of movie that gets away with it, because it's all about style, plot twists and excitement. A bit like a Bond movie, but far better. Of course, this is not a film that raises important questions or comments on problems in society. It doesn't pretend to be more than it is: a stylish, well-made and very exciting thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Hodejegerne" or "Headunters" is a Norwegian film directed by Morten Tyldum who you might know for the last year's Oscar contender "The Imitation Game". Despite knowing the praise that this film received, I didn't know it would be this good.I watched it yesterday and the characters are still in my head, specially the main one, Roger Brown, played by Aksel Hennie whose first film I saw was "Last Knights" and the difference in the acting is day from night. He is so good in this one, playing a insecure man who makes his money by stealing art paintings. On the other side we have the menacing Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, the Jaime Lannister of Game of Thrones who is probably becoming one of my favourite performers in the industry. He commits himself to any role and he is quite amazing. He has the looks and the acting chops and I believe we'll see more of him in the future. I must also make a nod to the two feminine characters in this one : Diana Brown, Roger's wife, played by Synn?ve Macody Lund, who is surprisingly good, one of that kind of actress who deserves a place in the spotlight and Lotte, played by Julie R. ?lgaard, another actress who is just amazing. "Headhunters" is certainly the proof that foreign films can be brilliant! An American remake is on the plans but I'm sure it won't surpass the original. This one is clearly overlooked. Watch it!</fullReview>

That's why an unusual plot like this automatically scores a few extra points in my book, regardless of its other merits (or demerits, for that matter).Now, I don't want to give anything away here, but this movie gets pretty bloody and grim around halfway through, and I never thought it could be tied up in a neat fashion, but I was very wrong. It's slowly developing, but ultimately really original, gripping and twisty (twisted?). Definitely another hidden gem in the foreign thriller category--make it through the slow build-up and the brutality and violence that follows, and you will be well-rewarded at the end.

Do not sleep on this film. After you watch you'll go, "I bet some US company is going to remake this film." (I've come to know that Mark Wahlberg was blown away by it and wants to remake it with him as the lead). The script is sharp and quick and keeps things moving. It has a sort of Usual Suspects appeal in that you try to figure out who's on what side. But my strong suggestion is if you like thrillers this is for you. Also, beware that there are some excruciating scenes. But this is one you WANT TO SEE. See the Original. One thing I like about these Scandinavian films is that it's always dark and cold.

		<shortDescription>Headhunters is a simple tale that whips about like a snake on coke.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest gem from the Scandinavian treasure trove, Headhunters (or Jo Nesbo's Headhunters if you want the clunky title some are billing it as) is as valuable an addition to the trove as The Girl? trilogy and the myriad televisual offerings Wallander, The Killing, Borgen, The Bridge? It's close to being excellent, is exciting, flows rapidly and is utterly entertaining and destined for a stateside reimagining.The inevitable American remake (why???) is to be helmed by Sacha Gervasi, whose only previous outing as director was the wonderful Spinal Tap-esque documentary, Anvil: The Story of Anvil, though he has two very exciting prospects in post-production in Hitchcock and My Dinner With Herve.There is every possibility a director of his ability can produce a crowd pleasing, blockbusting masterpiece that doesn't ostracize the devotees of the original, but for every Insomnia (adapted from the Swedish Insomnia), there's a Let Me In (Let the Right One In) AND a Quarantine (REC). It's far too early to call it but I'm wary. Fortunately, regardless of what he produces, it cannot diminish the impact or quality of the original. Just don't watch it and judge Morten Tyldum's original by it.Headhunters is a simple tale that whips about like a snake on coke. What should be a straightforward and, but for an early error of judgment from the protagonist, short event in his life turns into a bloody, violent farcical series of events from which no-one is guaranteed to emerge unscathed or even alive.Roger Brown is a seriously powerful headhunter in Norway with a fantastic reputation, a beautiful wife with very expensive tastes and a mistress with her own issues. To support his extravagant lifestyle, he has a sideline career as an art thief, replacing originals with forgeries. One fine, unremarkable day a new client enters his life and so begins the end? Aksel Hennie (as Brown) is wonderfully colourful as a man drowning in a quagmire of his own making. There's no stereotypical performance here, rather an intriguing portrayal of a desperate man reacting instinctively and tragically to the missiles of his crumbling world. And though Hennie stands out, he is just one of an outstanding cast. Nikolai Coaster-Waldau as his perceived nemesis is charmingly sinister, Synn?ve Macody Lund as Brown's wife gradually unfurls her character into a person neither we nor Brown thought possible and Julie R. ?lgaard is a mistress that is far more than a giggly girl on an arm.Tyldum has clearly taken the time to surround himself with an accomplished cast that fulfills the potential of his film and ignites the combustible screenplay so it fizzes along to a mesmerizing, jaw-droppingly good explosion that starts in the second act and doesn't end until the fat lady lies bleeding as her final notes fade.It's still showing in a few cinemas, having had a very limited release, but you're most likely to find it as a download. Just don't let anyone tell you anything more about it and don't, please, wait for the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action Thriller Through a Norwegian Lense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Headhunters is an action thriller set in Norway, which has gorgeous scenery, winding roads and stunning blonds. I can't comment on the dialogue because I watched the film in Norwegian with English subtitles. Fascinating language with lilting inflection, like the Irish speak English. Anyway since the subtitles flashed by so fast it tested my multi-tasking abilities (following the action while reading the text) Enough of the intro, here's what you need to know about the film (assuming you have read the plot a dozen times or more already) The first thing that struck me was the pacing which is fast. Add to that the photography which is clean and brooding like something's going to happen, and you get cinematic suspense. Also, even though I relied on subtitles I found the actors body language clued me into much of what was taking place and say what you will that shows a mastery of the art. I mean I went from anxious to laughing without ever feeling let down.The plot has been criticized for some gaping holes and lapses into the improbable. That's fair, as long as you bear in mind that many of the action blockbusters coming out of Hollywood you could sail the 6th Fleet through. You have to decide whether it's an Agatha Christie or an action thriller you want to watch. How much artistic licence are you prepared to allow. In the case of Headhunters I found it acceptable.I guess what's really different about this film is its perspective. You are watching an action thriller through a Norwegian lens. Its fresh, alive and scripted for acting rather than CGI. I should add this film has its share of gore, there's nudity but no gratuitous sex scenes or dependency on four letter words (maybe the Norwegians have six or twelve letter words instead - I don't know). Whatever, may there be more!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this film was from the United States, it could be easily an Oscar candidate and probable winner. It's simply a great movie. I hope that, at least, will be nominated for foreign Best Movie. The actors are very good and the film is beautifully directed. The story is intense and has lots of unexpected turning points. Clichés are not present. The action effects are very convincing and the actor even sacrifices his own hair for the added merit of the movie. Aksel Hennie does an impressive acting and probably the best role I saw from him so far. It's a very very good thriller and has all to be an hit. It's a pity that, by not being an American movie from a big studio, will probably not make into mainstream. I consider this the best Thriller movie I saw so far this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Bad As It Gets</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So often in America we see a film so awful and we ask "How did they make this?" The Norwegian film "Headhunters" is just such a waste. You will think that it is a promising thriller but it goes so far off the rails again and again that you wonder if the Director suffered from a head injury. Imagine "The Thomas Crowne Affair" crossed with "Friday the 13th" and you'll see the inspiration in making this messy and ridiculous disaster. It is hard to choose the most revolting or ludicrous moments in this mess but instead of spoiling this rotten carcass of a film I'll just urge you to save 2 hours unless a ridiculous plot, flagrant gore and perhaps the most disgusting non-bloody scene in cinematic history appeals to you. I love bad movies but "Headhunters" takes itself so seriously that its' not even worthy of camp or irony. I have not disliked a film this much in years and ache for 2 hours back in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Happened to see this Norwegian thriller couple of days ago and was very much impressed mainly because of the story, development, thrills and execution. Headhunters is based on the novel written by Jo Nesbo.Roger which tells the story of a Recruiter in Norway. He lives a luxurious life and to maintain the same, he used to steal the paintings and is very professional in that. His life goes upside down when he tries to steal a painting from his wife's friend's house. There it starts the thriller with convincing twists and turns.The major advantage of the movie is the story and screenplay with excellent performances of the antagonist and protagonist. The movie has its own moments and will give you definitely offers a treat to the thriller movie fans. An edge of the seat thriller. The background score did a crucial role in the whole one which made very interesting. All the supporting actors did a wonderful job to make this a nice one.Go for it..!!!

		<fullReview>Due the popularity of Games Of Thrones the flicks were actors from the series were in are now hunted down. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones)is in this as the bad guy. Naturally being hyped this flick is already being classified as a Hollywood remake coming out soon. Is it all worth the hype, yes and no. The story I didn't found that original. You could see some things coming but it is the way it was filmed and the nastiness of some shots that makes it worth watching. And the use of some gory shots made it even worth watching for the horror buffs. For so far I could see there's no use of CGI what makes it even more gruesome. The acting on the other hand was sublime and again it is shown that even not that popular or unknown cast can make a classic. It clocks in under 80 minutes what is weird for that kind of brutal action flicks. I guess the remake will be a lot tamer. Of course having an actor from Games Of Thrones gave it a world wide release but I must say that I have seen other Norwegian/Swedish flicks and so far they never disappointed me.And for the geeks out there, remember Nattevagten (1994) well, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was in that cult classic too. And even that one got a tame remake. Gore 2,5/5 Nudity 1,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the other reviewers described Headhunters as implausible but excellent and that sums up my opinion as well.The story is about a corporate recruitment "headhunter" who has a sideline as an art thief to finance the expensive lifestyle he has with his gorgeous wife. He is deeply insecure about his wife's affections for him, convinced that she is only with him for the lifestyle he provides for them.He hears of a piece of art that, if he can steal and sell, will mean he will never have to worry about money again. However, as soon as he starts to put this plan into effect things go wrong in a big way, and he ends up fighting for his life. This results in some great scenes and a few gruesome ones also. There is also plenty of black humour.There are plenty if twists and turns in the plot, some quite implausible but the fast moving pace means you don't get much time to think about them. The ending is tied up a bit too neatly for my liking also.Still, "Headhunters" is a very enjoyable thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Headhunter Roger Brown is very good at deception. He's so good that prospective employees think he's just being inquisitive during interviews when he's actually trying to discover if they own any artwork worth stealing. Of course there's a downside to everything and Roger naturally attributes similar feelings to his beautiful wife, Diana. He reasons she only remains with him so long as he can provide her with an expensive home he can't possibly afford on his legit income. When Roger meets job seeker Clas Greve who possesses a Rubens masterpiece he believes he has at last found the ticket to prosperity and Diana's heart. If you've had your fill of comic book superheroes and want to see some intelligent, adult entertainment "Headhunters" is a good choice. The script has some nice twists and turns to keep you curious about what's coming next. Aksel Hennie is excellent as Brown. He brings the right amount of sophistication with a hint of sleaziness appropriate for a white collar criminal. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is the charming, mysterious Clas Greve and Synnove Macody Lund is the beautiful Diana who receives everything from Roger but the one thing she desires the most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>HEADHUNTERS is a typically dark Scandi-thriller that is so entertaining that you don't spot the many plot holes until after the film has finished. The slightly unbelievable plot sees the hero - a corporate headhunter with an inferiority complex about his short height - use his job to case the homes of people who have expensive artworks. He then steals them and sells them via a criminal contact in order to fund the rich lifestyle of his (much taller) wife, who wants to open an art gallery. All goes wrong however when he picks an ex-Dutch (but of Scandi origin) soldier, who he suspects is having an affair with his wife, as his next target. Next thing you know, he's covered in feces and driving a tractor with a dog impaled on on the front of it, in fear for his life. If you can forgive the coincidences and the use of some near science-fictional technology, this is a gripping thriller. The women are gorgeous, the modern glass houses sleek, the direction spot-on, the action wince- inducingly real and the characters are sympathetically human. It even has a happy ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jo Nesb?'s Headhunters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Norwegian film has an unlikely protagonist; Roger Brown, a corporate headhunter who also works as an art thief to give his wife the life she wants, he also has a mistress. She works in the art world but doesn't know about his illegal activities so doesn't realise what will happen when she tells him about somebody who's late grandmother had a Rubens painting. This could be 'the one big job' that could set him up for life. The robbery goes so well he calls his wife and is shocked that her phone is in the house with him? under the bed. Furious with her infidelity he ensures her lover, the painting's owner, doesn't get a job he was after. That man is a former Special Forces soldier who had worked for a company making tracking equipment and when he comes after Roger he clearly has the upper hand.I can't think of a Hollywood film like this; the protagonist is initially unlikable; a two-timing thief with an inferiority complex due to his shortness but as the film progresses he shows himself to be funny and as things get worse for him the funnier it gets; Aksel Hennie does a fine job in the role. It helps that bad guy Clas is even less likable. The humour is very dark and very funny; as an example at one point Roger flees on a tractor with a dead dog impaled on the front while covered in the contents of a cesspit? as hilarious as it was disgusting! Those put off by the sight of blood might not be too keen on this as there are a few gory moments; most notably a car crash which Roger survives, thanks to being seated between two large twins, but ends up covered in their blood. It is of course all rather far-fetched but that doesn't matter as it so much fun; overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you like your humour dark and aren't put off by the more gross moments.These comments are based on watching the film in Norwegian with English subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An accomplished headhunter risks everything to obtain a valuable painting owned by a former mercenary.Following "Buddy", viewers might not have expected too much from Morten Tyldum. But he quickly came into his own and created this, a film that could be considered his masterpiece. That is, except for the fact he continued to make great films. In almost no time at all, he went fro ma low budget independent to a top Oscar contender. Well played.Roger Ebert praised the movie as "an argument for the kinds of thrillers I miss. It entertains with story elements, in which the scares evolve from human behavior... Unlike too many thrillers that depend on stunts, special effects and the Queasy-Cam, this one devises a plot where it matters what happens. It's not all kinetic energy." This may be a slam on films such as the "Bourne" series. And, indeed, Ebert is right; what good is a thriller if the thrills mean nothing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jo Nesbo's Headhunters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting caught in a headlock by the first 2 astonishing Swedish adaptation's of Steig Larsson's "Millennium" trilogy,I was please to discover that Jo Nesbo's wonderfully weird,Black Comedy,Neo-Noir novel Headhunters had been chosen as the next novel to be adapted for the New Wave of Nordic Noir movement.The plot:Having always felt that he does not deserve to be with his stunning wife Diane,Norway's leading business adviser/headhunter Roger Brown has done everything to give Diane all the material possession that she can dream of,with the only thing that Roger will not allow his wife to have,to be a child,due to being secretly disgusted at the through of another human getting the same "glaring" flaws which he has to keep hidden from his wife.Wanting to give his extremely professional life a sense of excitement,Roger starts to spend time with a prostitute called Lotte,whilst also becoming Norway's most infamous art thief,partly to help him fund the lavish life style that he wants to give his wife,and also due to the rush of danger he gets of the possibility that he and his art thief friend Ove could be caught at any given time.Being entrusted with the task of finding a suitable candidate for an up and coming top Swedish surveillance company called Pathfinder,Roger is left near speechless.When, attending Diane's latest gallery opening,his wife introduces him to a guest called Clas Greve's,who just happens to be the former CEO of a small,rival surveillance company called Hote. Unsettled by Greve's unexpected headhunter like manner,Brown soon forgets about the job that he has been hired to do,when Clas tells him that he got given by his grandmother one of the rarest paintings in the world.Desperate to get his hands on this "treasure",Roger sorts out what he hopes will be a suitable fogey,and pushes Ove to quickly gather his things so that they can steal the painting right away.Finding Greve's (who Roger has decided to recommend for the new CEO position at Paithfinder) house completely empty,Brown carefully enters the house and gets the painting.Wanting to celebrate this remarkable heist,Roger decides to ring his wife,to give her the news that he has at last become comfortable with the idea of them having a child.Shortly after he has begun to ring Diane,Roger hears a strange noise coming from Clas's bedroom.Slowly entering the bedroom,Roger feels a sudden chill go down his spine that Greve's may be a candidate who is too perfect,when he find's Diane's phone laying on the side of Clas Greve's bed.View on the film:For their expertly handled,faithful adaptation ,writer's Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg make the films's lean'n' mean 90 minute running time move at an unbelievably fast pace.Smartly limiting the use of Nesbo's first-person,Bret Easton Ellis goes Nordic Noir narrated approach to the opening section as a way that allows the audience to enter the deeply self-entered mind of Roger Brown.Gudmestad and Ryberg use Roger's discovery of his wife's phone as the starting pistol for Roger Brown to have his "greed is good" lifestyle ripped apart and slowly pulled deep into a Noir universe where he will be totally covered in poo (litery!).Along with the murky Noir waters,the writer's also give the film a tremendous Black Comedy streak,which,with the exception of the last 15 minutes, (that feature Roger Brown being given a moral compass- boo!) gives the movies thrilling twist and turns a real sharp sting,from Roger Brown finding himself almost crushed to death by two over-weight cops,to realising that the only way he can stay hidden from the cunning Clas,is to go "deeper underground" than Greve's could ever guess.Displaying the slickness of Roger's cooperate world right from the start,with Brown entering the shower to give Diane (played by the beautiful,debuting actress Synnove Macody Lund) a passionate kiss.Director Morten Tyldum smartly makes the corporate world of Roger Brown be filled with icy cold metallic colours to create a sense of something being artificial about his life.Contrasting Brown's business life,Tyldum gives the moments where Roger "feels" reality a tremendously "gritty"appearance which helps to give Brown and Ove's art thieving a real nail biting feel,and also give a vicious,wake-up punch to Roger Brown of Clas Greve's declaration that Norway's leading headhunter,has now become the hunted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Short Art Thief in Deep You-Know-What</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is not satisfied with his stature as a skilled headhunter for his company. Standing at only 1.68 meters tall, which translates in U.S. figures to around 5'5", he needlessly suffers from an inferiority complex, one that drives him to spend money he doesn't have on lavish gifts for his wife, Diana (Synn?ve Macody Lund), who's not only indisputably beautiful but also taller than he is. It might appear as if she appreciates what he's doing, but deep down, she isn't as swayed by material things. All she really wants is to have a baby. Roger stubbornly avoids the issue, although it isn't immediately made clear why. To finance the lifestyle he believes is making his wife happy, he lives a double life as an art thief. He has a very precise set of rules, and he uses them every time he breaks into someone's home, removes the art from its frame, and replaces it with a very convincing imitation.On the night Diana opens her new art gallery in the middle of Oslo, she introduces Roger to Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), a Danish-Dutchman who was once an elite soldier and a mercenary. Now the senior manager for an advanced electronics company, he seems to be the ideal candidate for a position in Roger's company. Roger soon learns that Clas is in possession of a painting by Rubens, one so valuable that it's easily worth tens of millions. If Roger could steal it, it would solve his mounting financial problems and enable him to continue his expensive lifestyle. With the help of his sex-addicted friend, a security guard named Ove (Eivind Sander), he breaks into Clas' apartment, which he claimed was an inheritance from his grandmother. Things take an unexpected turn when Roger finds Diana's cell phone on the bedroom floor."Headhunters," adapted from the novel by Jo Nesb?, is a taut and strangely engrossing crime thriller. Just when you think you know where it's heading, it veers into an entirely new direction and gives us a whole new set of circumstances to feel tense over. Don't be fooled by its seemingly random sequence of events; this story has some surprises in store, ones that may not be remotely plausible but are so cleverly written that we can willingly overlook the technicalities. Here is a film that doesn't pressure us into suspending disbelief. The pacing, structure, and characterization are such that we find ourselves swept into the narrative. I didn't know where it would go, but I knew I wanted to stay and find out. And even if the epilogue is merely a tying up of loose ends, you have to marvel at the intricacy of the knotting.Although not a horror movie, the film does occasionally indulge in morbid imagery. I did mention it was a crime thriller, right? The genre comes affixed with certain hallmarks, not the least of which is blood. "Headhunters" has its fair share of blood, but it doesn't end there. After a car accident, for example, we must endure two revealing shots of a body with the face smashed into an unrecognizable pulp. And then there's the moment when Roger must save himself by immersing his entire body, head and all, in a pit full of human excrement. In a way, this is kind of funny; Roger is literally and figuratively in deep you-know-what. Indeed, the filmmakers do dabble in moments of perverse humor, as evidenced when Ove and his beloved Russian prostitute playfully shoot at each other completely naked.We're often challenged to determine where Diana's loyalties lie, as it seems she has been having an affair with Clas. True enough, he is charming and incredibly handsome. But behind his rugged good looks and devilish smile lies a lethal killing machine, something Roger finds out the hard way. This isn't to suggest that Roger is innocent. He too has been having an affair with a woman named Lotte (Julie ?lgaard). It's obvious that it's purely physical, and in all likelihood, it's yet another extension of Roger's inferiority complex. When he decides to end their relationship, Lotte becomes curiously clingy. What more could she possibly want with him? Why does she insist on talking with him in his car just as he exits a parking garage?The word "edgy" is thrown around all too often, but there most certainly is an edge to "Headhunters." I can't help but wonder how much will be rounded off when and if the planned Hollywood remake comes to fruition. It doesn't surprise me that such a thing is being considered; the story has international appeal, not just because of its marketability as a crime thriller, but also because of its intriguing plot and characters. Perhaps we're looking at this year's answer to "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo." In any case, the original Norwegian film deserves to be seen, for it's a well-crafted work of suspense. It's also a fairly decent character study, Roger being surprisingly sympathetic in spite of his distorted body image and misplaced faith in material wealth. We want him to see that he has everything he needs and that there's no shame in being only 1.68 meters tall.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Head-hunter becomes the hunted in this 'Scandi crime' sizzler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about movie art thieves which I find alluring. They always seem to know exactly what to spend their money on and their victims aren't really victims. They're usually people whom we don't care for; people who know the price of everything but the value of nothing. I won't BS you. Cinematic offerings will be hit and miss now until about November/December time, when Oscar season comes round again. However, this Norwegian film, an adaptation of Jo Nesb?'s book, surprised me with its sleekness, smart dialogue and balanced smattering of sex and violence. Corporate head-hunter Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) sustains his lavish lifestyle by moonlighting as an art thief. He does this not for himself, but his trophy wife, who he doubts would stay with him if he did not shower her with her priceless possessions. (She's not with him for being 1.68m tall - 5 feet, 6 inches ? he rues.) Hennie, who looks like a less emaciated Christopher Walken, gives a spirited lead performance, expressing several states of emotion with equal panache.It's ingenious how he establishes his targets. He interviews egotistical recruits for his reputable company, Pathfinder. They have no clue why he's asking them if they have a maid or dog. Brown 'earns' a lot from his heists but not enough. His dream job - a Rubens worth enough for him to permanently retire - comes unexpectedly.When the twists come halfway through, the lights dim, a savage dog appears and an intractable enemy - an ex-soldier - looms: 'Headhunters' becomes a kind of horror film. Our emotions are toyed with as we choose how to view Brown, a man who we at first stereotyped as manipulative conman. I could give more detail about the plot, but that would compromise your enjoyment. Suffice to say, this film has excellent character and story development and is necessary viewing. There's speculation that this will soon be turned into a Hollywood remake (as if we couldn't have guessed). No matter, 'Hodejegerne' knows it came first.www.moseleyb13.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Headhunters kicks up a snowstorm in the Movie business.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's get straight to the point, we have an affluent entrepreneur, (Roger Brown, an every-man's name) who, like so many lead characters, finds themselves dissatisfied with their lifestyle and make the crucial error of reaching for the forbidden unreachable.How does it happen? - Art theft. What makes it even better? The film is all about lead characters 'framing' one another, so off that premise I can certainly confirm something witty, something original and something fleshed out, that manages to not compromise itself with the oft visited action genre/scene that has been tainted heavily by ruinous releases from Hollywood - I could list them for eternity, but I won't. Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) the 'headhunter' or 'corporate recruiter' finds himself messing with the wrong guy, an ex-mercenary, Clas Greve that is exquisitely acted by the now renowned Game of Thrones actor, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. From this, the film goes from strength to strength as we see Shakespearean-esque deception take the plot with both hands, and drive a previously 'secure' businessman into the ground as the theme of survival in rebirth is widely presented throughout. Themes of love, death, trust and religion are also in the mix and do come to capitalise in the latter scenes of the film, where the ultimate bond of trust through love is tested. It is all bound together in a good range of scenery, quality actors and a sound budget that doesn't make the film seem pretentious or "trying too hard" to be what it isn't. Overall I wasn't swayed by the subtitles, if anything it made the film seem so much more genuine to me. The acting delivered an above par thrill ride and the violence was just about right to quench any person's thirst for a very decent action flick. They rarely make them like this anymore... 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Headhunters" is a strong mix of a thriller, dark comedy and a heist film with just a touch of a touching love story. It's a very smart movie that doesn't slow down to repeat itself so if you're not ready to pay attention, take a nap and then go see it once you're wide awake. It's a Norwegian film about Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie), a headhunter. No, not some barbarian that goes around cutting heads, a man whose job is to find the right candidate for big companies looking for CEOs and that sort of thing. What people don't know is that he supplements his income by stealing rare art from the wealthy people he interviews. He finds out all about their tastes, sets them up for a long interview out of town and while they're away, he breaks in, replaces the real paintings with elaborate forgeries and sells them off to shower his wife Diana (Synn?ve Macody Lund) with gifts. She has no idea, which means when he steals from the wrong guy, he's out on his own.The protagonist is an original, compelling character that's a lot of fun to follow as he gets in way over his head. This poor guy bites off so much more than he can chew that it becomes the source of a lot of laughs, but there is a genuine threat that he is not going to make it out alive, so you're always on edge. There are a lot of surprises and some good twists mixed in with the black humour. I don't know what it is about the foreign films I happen to catch, but they always seem to take so many more chances than the North American films I'm used to seeing. There is a car crash in this movie that is extremely intense and followed by a moment that is more frightening than a lot of horror films I've witnessed. The fact that it's subtitled might turn you off but you would be missing out on an incredibly entertaining film so give it a shot. My one criticism is that towards the end there are a few of the elements that seem to come up a little bit too conveniently but it will get your heart pumping and you'll be thoroughly pleased.

It's not just an action thriller. Main character Roger is a recruiter who steals pieces of artwork to maintain his lavish lifestyle, aided by a friend who disables the houses' security systems. When Roger meets an executive who he learns owns a rare Rubens, he naturally can't resist. But that's where the real part of the plot begins. And let's just say that Roger has some experiences that he'll never forget.My dad has read some of Jo Nesb?'s books. It sounds as though they're just as intense as "Headhunters". To put it lightly, I'll say that this is NOT a movie for the squeamish (and not just because of the violence). The irony to this is that Norway is always thought of as one of the safest, most peaceful countries in the world. You wouldn't think so by watching this movie. I'm sure that if I ever go to Norway, I won't share Roger's harrowing experiences, but I won't forget what I saw in "Headhunters", and you won't either. You'll probably like it...if you can handle it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent film from Norway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Headhunters" from Norway is a film with lots of twists and turns. It starts out as one thing, becomes something else and then, as far as I'm concerned, ends up as something else entirely. And these twists give the title a double meaning.Directed by Morten Tyldum and based on a novel by Jo Nesbo, the film concerns Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie), a short man who lives way, way beyond his means. He does this because he thinks it's the only way to keep his beautiful wife, who owns an art gallery, happy. On the face of it, Roger works as a headhunter, and he's very successful at it. But his real job is stealing expensive artwork in cahoots with his friend Owe. Owe, in his job, can not only turn off alarms, but erase their logs as well.When Roger meets Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), he thinks he has a perfect prospect to place with a firm and steal his valuable artwork. However, things don't go as planned and soon, Roger is running for his life.Really absorbing film with some substantial holes. When it's a good, involving script, it's best, in my opinion anyway, to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. I really don't have an answer for those who rip apart scenes as being unrealistic. I can only do that if it's a badly done movie. This isn't one. It has good acting, good pace, and a strong story. Nowadays I take what I can get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A riveting dark thriller that will keep you watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the enormous success of the Millennium trilogy I anxiously awaited to see this latest Norwegian thriller and I was not disappointed. Words like stylistic, captivating, exciting and action packed all come to mind. Its dark and incredibly gritty with a well paced story that is very reminiscent of the aforementioned Millennium films. There really is no hero of the film, rather a grey area of morality throughout all the characters. It is so well acted and the cinematography is well done. The film makers don't hesitate to unfold the story at a bit of a slower pace in the beginning, they want you to understand the character of Roger Brown inside and out before the thrills really begin. They also want to introduce and make you understand the supporting characters so they you are just truly invested in the story. Its a heist movie, murder mystery, spy thriller, with such a unique style. The dark feel of the movie is broken up with obscure but brilliantly shot little gems in the movie...like two 300 pound twin cops guarding Roger, his eventual bizarre appearance by the end of the movie and a high speed tractor chase.Norwegian star Askel Hennie is perfect in the film. He's unassuming and looks like a regular joe albeit very Norwegian regular joe. But the dark side of him is just awesome to watch unfold. He's not what you would consider your typical A-lister but he's so easy to watch. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau does a good job as the violent and mysterious Clas Greve. My only complaint in his performance is that we don't see more of him. He's an excellent villain and the scenes with him and Hennie are so well done, a definitive cat and mouse game of brawn and brains. Synn?ve Macody Lund is decent as Hennie's wife and a major part in the conspiracy, although you'll never know what side she falls on at any given time adding to the mystery. Eivind Sander and Julie R. ?lgaard round out the supporting cast and they both are good. Sander is definitely part of that obscure but brilliant twists to the story. He's so eccentric and strange but important to the story.Director Morten Tyldum tells such a tightly woven, well paced, perfectly plotted story with his direction. Its gritty and bleak and yet full of action and intensity. You can see in the IMDb trivia that they made a couple of homage nods to the Millennium trilogy and as much as I keep referencing that Headhunters is not as overall dark as the Millennium trilogy. Any way you slice it this was a great thriller. It has something for everyone and holds nothing back in its quest to tell a great thrilling story. Well done! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Norway is hot in books and film these days, no doubt about that. Writer Jo Nesbo's later book The Snowman is also in the works. He is a good substitute for the late Stieg Larssen of "The Girl.." trilogy, but not quite as polished yet. This fast-paced crime thriller was a good story that was at times riveting, but it was a bit jumbled in continuity and details and stretched credulity at times for a realistic, i.e., no CGI, film. But, it held together fairly well and ended well and included some interesting and unusual touches....the dog on the tractor, and the outhouse. Ugh. Anyone for a shower and some mouthwash?Roger Brown is a top level headhunter who steals applicant's fine art when he knows they are away after finding out about their valuables in their interviews. One of those thefts turned bad, and that is the crux of this fast-paced and violent story that featured possibly the most gorgeous woman in films today, Macody Lund as Mrs. Brown. Wow! A very professional and slick film, with effective, realistic, and under-control acting throughout. No scenery chewing here but still lots of action.America has trouble making this type of action film today, and has since the 90's after Scorsese made most of the good ones, as it is now all about CGI everything and do whatever sells the most tickets to kids instead of making quality art. Sure glad someplace is making this kind of realistic crime story besides the French, as it seems to be gone forever in the money-over-everything-else America of today. "Get those butts in the seats, and do it the cheapest way possible!" Thanks, Norway, for showing us the only reason to make a movie.... a quality story well told.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Brown (Askel Hennie) is a successful corporate headhunter who has wife that is way out of his league. Roger believes that the only way he is ever going to keep her is by spoiling her with lavish and expensive gifts. Unfortunately for Roger, he can't actually afford any of these things, so in order augment his income he steals works of art and replaces them with forgeries. Roger knows that his time in art stealing business is limited and that it is only a question of time before he gets caught, so he always on the look out for one big score.Roger's wife owns an art gallery and she meets Clas (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldu)a retired CEO that claims to have a very expensive and rare painting that he is looking to sell. Roger sees this as his big chance to do one final job and get out of the business.Things go smoothly and Roger makes off with the painting without a hitch. Unfortunately for Roger though, Clas was the CEO of a very high tech security company that manufactures microscopic GPS trackers. Clas quickly locates Roger and confronts him but Roger is able to escape. What follows is a frenetic game of cat and mouse as Roger tries to get away from Clas and figure out how he is being tracked.This was a great little thriller. Tons of plot twists and there will definitely be some things that you won't see coming. There is plenty of action and a nice mixture of comedy. If you are fan of Hitchcock you will most likely enjoy this movie. Askel Hennie is excellent as the diminutive anti-hero and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldo breaths the same kind of menace into his character that you have come to expect from his role as Jaime Lannister on Game of Thrones.Is it perfect? No. It does have a few flaws. There is a little bit of suspension of disbelief that you may have to warm up to. Towards the end, the movie seems to be trying to be a little bit too clever, and at the end, they try and tie things up with too nice of a bow. Despite these minor gripes, Headhunters is fun movie and one of the better thrillers that I have seen so far this year. If you can find it playing around you somewhere, it is not to be missed. check out our site at 3guys1movie.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Norwegian Elmore Leonard adaptation-a-like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the strength of the trailer I thought I might be going to see an art thief flick with a twist. Naturally this isn't the half of it but I really wasn't prepared for what did pop up. This is often a grotesquely gory film and also a funny one. What's bizarre is that these things almost always occur simultaneously.As a result this is a funny pulp noir, a modern version of those Elmore Leonard adaptations that we're used to now, but done in Norwegian accents and with modern trappings (GPRS, demanding Russian prostitutes etc.). It's well plotted, which I suppose one must ascribe to Nesbo, though the director Tyldum must take credit for this too. The acting is actually rather average but the story and it's construction make up for the shortfall. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not at all what I expected. The shorts made me think there was going to be lots of blood and guts but there wasn't that much really.Norwegian with subtitles somewhat like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but less violence and more twists and turns. While it does leave with a few holes in the plot that is fine as it sort of gives itself a final grin at the end. The main guy is a bit of an off character complete with flaws and I like that - it isn't the sort of black and white stuff you see in American movies. I have read The Leopard by the same person who wrote this story and I find the books incredibly readable and quite addictive. If this movie and that book are anything to go by I look forward to seeing a lot more of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good and witty action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The start is calm (but not protracted), but then the events begin running and tensions are high up to the very end. Several chases and fights, dead bodies, double-crosses, multiple crime-levels, deliberated characters make this film catchy to follow. And it is not a typical Scandinavian crime film where focus is on an egoistic detective, the guilty one is revealed in the end and intermediary events are slow and full of reasoning.The cast is rather unknown to me, but I liked both the main and supporting actors, primarily Aksel Hennie as Roger and Eivind Sander as Ove. Female characters are more trivial, but still not "arid". Highly recommended! I give 9 points, as it is a Norwegian film; if it were UK/US, I would give 8 (anyway, I hope no remake is made, they are usually worse). Hodejegerne should definitely deserve wider attention and acclaim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a dramatic response to "How was your day"? No matter how much contempt we feel for the protagonist in this film, nothing he has done can be weighed against the circumstances he encounters. While the film is pretty far fetched, the pain and anguish he endures hits a note with anyone who has ever tried to cover up a transgression. We have someone who in his thievery finds himself in over his head in a series of demeaning, disturbing, and disgusting settings (ever wonder about the contents of an outhouse?). Like so many villains, it's one cover up after another. There are also a group of baddies whom he has made angry. He would like to start over, but circumstances become complicated. The law, of course, is also after him and that doesn't help. I was captivated by this contortionist as he bends to meet each challenge. While it would be easy to say, "That could never happen," suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 Million Bucks Well Spent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually stunning. Well-acted. Exciting. Grotesque. Crazy. Fun.I don't know if the whole thing makes sense. I may need a 2nd viewing to see how it covered some bases, but for a guy who has seen his share of movies, "Headhunters" is the kind of thing you shuffle through a lot of crap for...(you'll have to see the film to get the joke)5 Million bucks invested, and a thriller that makes recent American thrillers look, well, less-thrilling.The key here is in the direction, and with what's sitting, cut on the editing floor. I often use the term "somebody cared about that one" when referring to movies, and somebody definitely cared about "Headhunters".I would probably score this an 8 under most circumstances. BUT, this flick is really, really good given the budget, and I want to watch it again, and soon.It looks like a 20 million-dollar film. Every key moment of the film has great visual detail.The characters in the film all have their own development, and the casting is pitch-perfect. I had to watch the director's commentary to find out the wife had never acted in a film before. That fact blew me away - much like it did after watching the tall beauty in "Angel-A" - as a matter of fact, there's a film for the "If You Liked list"\/ I highly recommend Headhunters. I'm not even sure if the last 15 minutes makes any sense whatsoever. Great movie though. Like it or not - you'll be talking about it the next day and you'll appreciate the quality of the film-making.You'll like this if you liked:Angel-A(equally as good), The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo(orig vers/also about equal), The Italian Job('03/not as good), The Grifters(about equal), The American(nearly as good), The Chaser(about equal and Headhunters is more like this in terms of violence on the list),The Man From Nowhere(equally as good), Kontroll(equally as good), and the last, "The Hit" from Stephen Frears.. For once, I think I can recommend every flick I'm comparing this too...This film will keep good company in my head.84.5/100 It's been a while since my last 9/10 rating, but this movie was a blast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Scandinavian thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolutely gripping little thriller that completely destroys anything similar to come out of Hollywood in the last year or so, and the best part of it is that you start watching it with little idea of what's about to unfold. HEADHUNTERS is a Norwegian film, an adaptation of a bestselling book by Jo Nesbo, and it involved me in the thrilling, complex storyline to a level of immersement that I rarely reach in cinema. It's easily as good as other, recent film highlights such as the South Korean film THE YELLOW SEA.The movie starts out in the corporate world of headhunting, where, as we quickly learn, it's all about reputation. Things soon shift entirely and the film becomes a chase movie. It's at this point I realised I was watching a modern masterpiece; a film in which I was glued to the screen, unable to take my eyes off what would surely unfold.The film is extremely densely plotted ? there's no lazy writing here, every scene (and every word of dialogue in that scene) is relevant to and adds to the plot in some way. The pace is lightning fast and there are few moments to breathe. There's excitement, danger and extreme violence. Even better, the movie revels in its moments of the bizarre, garnering laughs together with the gasps along the way.Aksel Hennie, an unknown-to-me actor, blew me away with his performance as this movie's hapless protagonist. He takes you on a journey through one man's despair and far beyond, often utilising those startling blue eyes to great effect. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau trades on his GAME OF THRONES persona (as a character you love to hate) as the suave businessman who comes into Hennie's life and invariably changes it. Add to this some absolutely fantastic direction from Morten Tyldum and you have what I would call a modern day classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hodejegerne ? Headhunters ? CATCH IT (A) Norwegian thriller Hodejegerne is one of those memorable thrillers which get better by minute. The minute you understand where it's heading, it takes a U-turn and leaves you tangling in your thought. It's been a while since I saw a thriller which pushed the envelope so high that it's almost unimaginable at times. The movie is great till the final act which looked pretty clichéd and too easy. Headhunters stars the talented Aksel Hennie (Max Manus) as Roger, a charming scoundrel and Norway's most accomplished headhunter. Roger is living a life of luxury well beyond his means and stealing art to subsidize his expensive lifestyle. When his beautiful gallery owner wife introduces him to a former mercenary in the possession of an extremely valuable painting, he decides to risk it all to get his hands on it, and in doing so discovers something which makes him a hunted man. Aksel Hennie maybe short in height but he is far too talented to be ignored or judged on his height. I have not seen Max Menus yet but from Hodejegerne I can only imagine the best out of him. There are several moments like when he hides in sh*t or when he chops his hairs etc that shows his utmost potential. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is best known as incestuous brother Jaime Lannister on "Game of Thrones". Here he plays a modern suited intelligent mercenary with due diligence. He is charismatic and sharp as required for the role. Synn?ve Macody Lund is stunning and very tall. Julie R. ?lgaard fight sequence gave me chills. Overall, Hodejegerne is one of the best thrillers I have seen in recent years which solely stands upon strong screenplay and brave performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A captivating Scandinavian cat-and-mouse thriller that makes for a tight, incredibly entertaining ride. Director Morten Tyldum's cinematic rendering offers palpable suspense, plenty of action, and a clever story line that's hard to come by in the action-thriller genre. Tyldum succeeds by ignoring the particulars of common sense, darting full speed ahead, heaping on the twists with little regard for realism. Tyldum makes this tactic work for the film, constructing a series of imaginatively designed set pieces that are as tense as they are farcical. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, clearly made with an awareness of the silliness of it all, which strengthens the enjoyment of the viewing experience and overall resolution. Aksel Hennie, who stars as the protagonist Roger Brown, is the go-to person anyone would need as a job reference. The ambitious headhunter is one of the best in his industry with arrogance to spare. His opening monologue about reputation is so seductive it will have you hanging on to his every word. But Jo Nesb?'s novel is more than meets the eye, and Mr. Brown has a separate occupation. With his contacts and hundreds of interviews set up with potential candidates for C-level jobs, opportunity comes in setting up the meetings, and then robbing them blind of valuable art, with counterfeits in their place. Roger readily admits he's overspending, with almost all expenses going into impressing his wife Diana (Synn?ve Macody Lund), who is high maintenance, and out of his league.What seems to be just another mark with his latest job seeker, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), backfires on Roger, as the film kicks into high gear. Roger suspects his wife is having an affair with Clas, a one time mercenary soldier who has found better fortune now as a CEO of a technology company, and who has a long lost painting stored in his Norwegian home. Jo Nesb?'s story throws us a line, and hooks us line and sinker, into what turns out to be an extremely engaging, cat and mouse game of battle and wits between these two men.Director Morten Tylan does a masterful job keeping the suspense in high gear and cohesive narrative throughout. Tylan impressively infuses the films action-oriented moments with a visceral, white-knuckle feel that proves impossible to resist. The inclusion of a few astoundingly tense moments perpetuates the movie's shift into a seriously engrossing piece of cinema. Although the climax isn't quite up to the level of that which preceded it, "Headhunters" has already established itself as one of the most exciting, flat-out captivating thrillers to come around in quite some time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the cover of this movie, I thought it was a movie about guys who are hired to kill. This movie is anything but that. Aksel Hennie is a business man who also steals art from rich people. One robbery doesn't work out the way he planned and after the robbery the movie is one big roller-coaster.If I would have to describe this movie with a few words I must use the words awesome, unpredictable, original, exciting. The biggest strength of the movie is that you don't know what is coming. When you look at most movies, you can predict how the movie will take it's lead and sometimes how it ends. This movie isn't like that. I had this rare feeling of being surprised and entertained like I had twenty six years ago, when I saw "The Hitcher" with Rutger Hauer. That good was this movie too. Maybe this movie will be remade in a Hollywood style and they can add Nikolaj's colleague of Games of thrones Sean Bean to the cast Like they did with "The Hitcher".Aksel Hennie acts terrific. I don't watch foreign movies quickly, but then again, I did not know this movie was foreign. I am glad that I didn't knew, this is not a movie I wanted to miss. I have seen Nikolaj "Prince charming" Coaster-Waldau in Game of thrones, a great opponent for Aksel. Both men played very well. What I did not like was the ending, where the character of Aksel had to explain the plot of the movie. That was a pity. In my opinion a better end was to have left that away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a lot of excellent thrillers coming out of Scandinavia at the moment, whether its Stieg Larrson's Millennium Trilogy and its film adaptations or the Danish series The Killing being a hit on television. Jo Nesb? is a respected crime novelist in his native Norway and his books are international best sellers. His stand-alone novel Headhunters has been given a cinematic treatment that has just arrived on DVD and Blu-ray. A Hollywood remake is already in the works.Harry Brown (Aksel Hennie) is a corporate headhunter and a talented art thief. He has a beautiful wife, Diana (Synn?ve Macody Lund), but he lives way beyond his means and is on the edge of bankruptcy. In a chance meeting, Harry is introduced to Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau of Game of Thrones fame), a successful electronics businessman and former NATO solider, the perfect candidate to become a senior manager of a company he has the contract for. Sweetening the deal, Greve has a lost Peter Rubens masterpiece that could solve Harry's money problems, but he has crossed the wrong man Greve hunts him down with more determination than The Terminator.Director Morten Tyldum delivers a very entertaining thriller filled with intense moments and action sequences when required. It even has a surprisingly humorous and cheeky tone at times. Like an Alfred Hitchcock movie, it features an ordinary man who is thrown into an extraordinary situation, and Tyldum gives this proved formula some extra energy. Headhunters also shares some plot elements with No Country For Old Men and Enemy of the State. At a brisk 100 minutes, it's fast-paced and wastes not a single frame.Harry starts off as a real scumbag, but because of the strength of the script, the direction and Hennie's excellent performance, we can slowly warm to him and his plight. Hennie has range as an actor; you can believe he is a man with no training and skill who must take on a Special Forces soldier. Coaster-Waldau shows real cunning and menace as he hunts Harry with ferocity. Eivind Sander as Harry's mole in the security company, Ove, was a very funny creation and really deserves a comedy spin-off of some sort.If it was not for the art theft at the very beginning, Headhunters starts as a quirky Euro film, but Tyldum blends the different tones to great effect, with neither the humour nor the brutal moments distracting from each other. There are some outlandish ideas, but it's not hard to suspend disbelief because it's so entertaining.Even with the strong pacing, there are a some small bridging scenes that have gone missing that will leave audiences with a few minor questions. It would have added a minute at most to the running time and given Headhunters just an extra boost in quality.This well-thought out, intelligent thriller really proves it is a golden age for the Scandinavian crime genre.Please visit www.playeraffinity.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Brown is a high powered recruitment specialist. He is also a fairly short man, married to a tall, high maintenance beautiful blonde and scared he is going to lose her (notwithstanding that he is himself having an affair): to offer her what he thinks she needs, he is living well beyond his means, and bridging the gap with well-planned art thefts. Into their lives comes Clas Greve, ideally suited to the position Roger is trying to fill, but also the sort of man to whom Roger fears his wife may be attracted. And, indeed, this appears to come to pass..This subtitled Norwegian crime thriller is a very slick and glossy piece of work, blessed with an exceptionally good script. The dialogue, even subtitled, is sharp, and the story spins about all over the place. I was kept guessing to the very end, and in a good way - it never went in the direction I expected.The performances are excellent, it is photographed very well, and I recommend it highly.I'm guessing that a Hollywood remake in English will follow within a year or so, because it is that good.</fullReview>

However it provides so many open points, I have to list them as questions.-----------------SPOILER BEYOND THIS POINT DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE MOVIE ---------------Why would a company with "a billion dollar deal" get only his CEO and a strangely weak woman to handle its murder business? -How can this CEO work as a special ops commando up until a few years ago? -Why would he investigate a silly headhunter for some position? -Why would he sleep with the headhunters wife? -Why and how would he learn that the headhunter is an art thief? -Why would he lure him into his apartment to steal a painting (fake or not)? -Why would he try to poison or kill the headhunter? -Why does the headhunter art thief choose his own garage to transfer the painting to his partner? -...I cant go on. I watch movies, I read novels, I like both. But I have never seen a script this shallow even in most Hollywood movies. This was really bad at some point we were wishing it stopped soon because this silly action story laced with horrendous love undertones was getting too ridiculous. It scares me that this movie has such high reviews because to me, nothing makes sense in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is interesting how priorities can always change when we lose control of the situation. The idea in this Norwegian action thriller is not so bad, mixing the skillfulness of a professional thief and the talent of a cunning murderer. However, after the initial plot, the rest is all about the persecution of the character, followed by some violent and bloody scenes. "Headhunters" is pure entertainment and the few attempts to focus on a weakened relationship leave margin for some disappointment. The main characters are underdeveloped and the bits and pieces that come together aren't enough to give the audience that sense of connection. It is hard to empathize with them and after the whole thing is done, nothing is left behind. Just a strange feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Brown is a brash corporate headhunter in Norway. He spends more money than he has on his statuette wife Diana with her model looks who runs an art gallery. He's trying to compensate for his short statue but the one thing she really wants is a child. He cheats on her with Lotte and is also an art thief to support his extravagant spending. He and his unstable partner-in-crime Ove Kjikerud replace the originals with forgeries to buy time. Diana introduces Roger to a wealthy former-businessman Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau).I love this character with his inferiority complex. He's a Napolean figure and I like his marital relationship. He's a fresh take on the art thief. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is a great threatening presence. The chase thriller is great. However there are a couple of unreal twists at the end. The ending should be more interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger is a headhunter by day and an art thief by night. Neurotic about his lack of physical stature, he steals art to pay for the lavish lifestyle of his trophy wife Diana. When Diana introduces him to Clas, Roger sees a chance to get a payday in both his day and night jobs. But Clas is not what he seems... Headhunters is high-octane plot that kicks into gear about 20 minutes in and never slackens the pace. Roger finds out his marriage is not what it seems, his partner in crime appears to be dead in his garage, and his mistress has more secrets than he suspected. The film combines action and comedy in the manner of Grosse Point Blank, which is does very well. It also attempts to explore themes of reputation and true love, which it does less convincingly. The schlock violence is well executed, and as long as you keep your incredulity in check, this is a very good action-comedy-thriller that entertains rather than informs. Pure plot, and mostly in a good way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the people would be septic when they hear it's a Norwegian movie but Hodejegerne (or Headhunters) will prove them wrong. It's an excellent crime thriller with a lot of twists that keep you in suspense and entertained until the last second. I wish they would make more movies of this quality. Much better then most of the American high budget movies in this genre. Aksel Hennie plays Roger Brown, the headhunter and art thief, and does it brilliantly. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Clas Greve might be better known as Jamie Lannister in Game of Thrones but here he proves he can act in whatever movie. In fact all actors did a great job. The movie might start slow but after a while you get sucked into the story and can't wait to see what's coming. I really enjoyed this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The tone set in the beginning of the movie borders on Guy Ritchie brand of comedy and settles down to your average crime thriller before it resumes back by the end. Though it doesn't makes much sense at times but it makes up with the relentless pace of the screenplay.Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) is a white color thief and a recruiter for big organizations. He is ambitious, insecure and has a loving and innocent wife Diana (Synn?ve Macody Lund). Only this time he picked up the wrong target Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), who discloses he has an infamous priceless painting in his possession and looking for a job. What he didn't know was Clas was part of the secret service specialized in tracking people and also has a vested interest in disclosing the information.Extremely stylized, intelligent and fast. The actors just had to look cute and the screenplay took care of the rest. I wouldn't say it is innovative or thought provoking, but at least it was smart. Only problem was I could not root for the "protagonist" though they through a number of excuses and justifications at you to do it. I have been a fan of Nikolaj from his portrayal of Jamie Lannister in the hit series Game of Thrones and he brings in a lot of vigor and brute to this character too which gets a little muddled because of the writing towards the end. Synn?ve just had to look pretty and she was a lot more than pretty. In the end, I just could not dig into its crime plot but what kept me going was its presentation.Classic example of style over content that actually works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Headhunters is the type of writing-focused espionage thriller that Hollywood has been incapable of making recently. The plot is consistent and keeps you guessing and we care about the characters. Sure it's not completely realistic, but what thriller is? The cast is good especially Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones) as the terrifying villain. My only complaint would be that I found the ending a little cheesy, but I did appreciate the Ocean's 11 type montage of how the protagonist won. This film also brought international attention to director Morten Tyldum, who recently directed the winner of the people's choice award at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival, The Imitation Game.</fullReview>

The story should have stayed with the first thirty minutes plot line, as it was really interesting. A con man who is able to steal valuable paintings while substituting copies was promising, and had me hoping for more of the same. Unfortunately, the writers decided to add several twists and turns which just did not work for me. The acting is good and some of the action scenes o.k. but the lead character ventures through too many far fetched scenarios to be believable. Headhunters had excellent potential, but in the end score a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fine Scandinavian crime thriller than shuns banal high-tech</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not to be outdone by Sweden, Norway shows the world that to look for quality crime thrillers, Hollywood is no longer the place, where too much special effect high tech has stifled not just movie makers' creativity, but even their basic craft. "Headhunters" amply demonstrates that meticulous attention to plot, characters, shooting and details is still the key to making a satisfying crime thriller. One critic even goes to the extent of remarking that this is the kind of movie that Hitchcock would direct if he were alive today ? an ultimate compliment, but not unreasonable.Starting with a first person POV VO of protagonist Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie), the story unfolds as he shares his world, hopes and fear with the audience ? a high-flying elite corporate headhunter; a thief of expensive art-work; an unremarkable 5-foot-6 man with an inferior complex because of a gorgeous wife who can pass for a fashion model any day. The thief business is actually to provide financial resources to shower his wife with all kinds of material luxury which he believes is the only way of keeping her, But what she really wants most is to have a baby with him. The poor chap does not understand women, least of all his own wife.The plot, which I am not going into in any level of detail, thickens when the wife introduces him to dashingly handsome Clas Greve, who soon becomes a high-potential candidate in that he would like to lure away from a rival firm. Two complications shortly follow: Clas is stealing his wife while he is stealing Clas's expensive painting. It's actually a little more complicated than I make it sound but it's nowhere near being convoluted. Suffices to say that our protagonist soon finds himself basically going through Infernal, in a series of happenings the visual depiction of which is sufficient to make you throw up a few meals.Yes, there are trying challenges in watching this movie, but intelligent challenges rather than mindless assault of the senses. You will admire the meticulous attention and masterful skill with which this movie has been crafted. You'll also enjoy the excellent acting and captivating photography.It's entirely unsurprising that Hollywood is again going for a remake. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara were well cast for "Girl with a dragon tattoo". For "Headhunters", it just occurred to me, particularly in the opening scenes, that Aksel Hennie has an uncanny resemblance of Billy Crystal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my first review. Well not exactly a review but I just had to chime in. I agree with one of the previous reviewers. Watch this version before Hollywood screws it up with a poor remake. Yes it is subtitled for us English only viewers but believe me you will soon forget that you are reading subtitles. I watch a tremendous amount of movies. I can't help myself commenting as movies unfold. How many times have you watched a movie where there were unnecessary scenes to fill time or dialogue that didn't make sense or incongruous actions that drive you crazy...well I'm happy to say, at least from my perspective, this movie had none of that.Headhunters is a thrill ride. Once you start watching it you will find yourself pulled in as the plot builds, expands and mesmerizes you. The twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll. Excellent, excellent movie. Kudos to the cast and director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No fancy Tony Scott editing or post-production, no massive explosions, no air-land-sea chases with M-60's and RPG's blazing away, in fact none of the gimmicks we're accustomed to from writer-block- and teenage-viewer-afflicted Hollywood.What we have instead is a diabolically-well-written thriller and a script that squeezes it for every last ounce of suspense, shock, surprise, and towards the end, even empathy. The protagonists turn out to be completely different and much nicer people than we thought they were (except the ones we thought were nice, in which case they turn out bad).The high-tech criminality isn't the silly Hollywood version with chrome-plated gizmos flashing brightly-colored LEDs instead of LCDs (not infantile enough), all controlled by people who do graphics and 3D with only a keyboard. The tech here is low-key and entirely real, but no less intrusively threatening (in an NSA-big-brother-black-ops way).We even get a couple of good automatic-weapon gunfights - good because they are short, destructive and end quickly with someone getting fatally shot, as in real life. Not like Hollywood gunfights that go on for half an hour where supposedly crack shots empty clip after clip without anyone getting hit.In the end Roger Brown scores one for petty criminal yuppie pricks and an even bigger one against Hollywood's action-movie hegemony. Turns out American action movies are to Nordic action flicks what American cars are to German ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wasn't bothered about seeing this film, it's was one of those movies that was getting too many plaudits and accolades. It sounds silly, but when this was released, it overshadowed many other films that were released at the same time. It's the middle class equivalent of a Summer Blockbuster, and all the hipsters were jumping on the bandwagon. It offended me a little.I was wrong.This has to be one of the most satisfying movies I've seen in a while, and I was literally smiling at all the plot twists and the rich narrative, while the film ran.It's basically about a recruitment consultant who makes ends meet by stealing expensive works of art. He meets a guy who has an extremely rare piece of art and steals it, but this chap has ulterior motives and goes on his own little headhunt.The first half of the film is what you would expect from this type of thriller. We meet all the key characters and are treated to an excellent montage of how the paintings are stolen. Its simple stuff, but you need to take heed, because there are lots of intricate plot devices that are pivotal later on.Soon after, we find a man passed out, presumed dead in scar, the film goes bonkers, absolutely edge of the seat stuff, and with every red herring thrown our way, we have a brilliant and clever plot twist or new development.As I've said before, I usually dislike these sort of 'big movies, from other countries' because they attract hipster, and they really know nothing about cinema, but this movie is worth every moment of your time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie, what a story! Roger works as a top notch headhunter. Currently he's looking for a CEO for some security company. Interviewing rich executives gives him the opportunity to know about the lives, habits and riches of the wealthy, information which comes in handy for his side-gig--stealing art.He needs to steal art because he lives way beyond his means. And he thinks he's got to do that to keep his gorgeous tall wife by his side. He's short and nothing special and yet he's the one who cheats on his wife.When his accountant tells him that he's about to go bankrupt just as he's about to buy his wife some expensive earrings to keep her from bugging him about having children, he knows he has to do something. Fortunately for him, a former Dutch executive just arrived in Norway and he inherited an expensive work of art. Roger will try to convince him to work again. But things get complicated and Roger will have to steal the painting in a hurry. On his way out he finds his wife's phone on the guy's bed! All his fears are confirmed. The next day he finds his partner in crime dead in his car. Roger has to dispose of the body, and hide the painting before the owner who is also a special ops guy who specializes in tracking people finds him.What follows is a wild chase. He doesn't know who to trust. The special ops guy and the police are after him but Roger is also lucky and is able to escape thanks to some surprising turn of events. As he tries to find out who he can trust, we learn that things aren't quite what they seem, in any way.Headhunters is an exhilaration action thriller. There are twists at every turn. The direction is perfect, the acting excellent, but the story is spectacular. If the movie is this good, one can only imagine how amazing the book must be. This is the kind of movie Lars von Trier could have written/directed on a good day. In other words, this director has a very bright future. The same goes for the author of the novel. Even though the producers sought to make a movie at the level of Hollywood, they've surpassed anything Hollywood comes up with and they did so without aping Hollywood's bad habits- loud sounds, explosions, over the top yelling, screaming, crying, danceclub lighting. This movie is movie is top notch while keeping a Scandinavian style and subdued performances. If anything, Hollywood can learn a lot from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie by coincidence and gave it a shot just to have a sense on what a Norwegian film was gonna look like. It turned out as a great thriller that keeps you guessing what's gonna happen next. The introduction of the film is interesting: a high end recruiter guy that has a job on the side (stealing paintings from his top candidates houses so he can sell them and make good money). The guy has a very expensive life style and his main job can't afford it. But even with a good script, movies can fail if the acting, the direction and the whole rhythm of the film don't fit. This is not the case with this one.The direction was superb and the acting, specially the main character, looks very real in his role. The movie has some of the script twists as other action movies but they're worthy because you don't want the character to die before going to the bottom and see how everything is broken down.In short, this is a great thriller and you'll have a good time watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Headhunters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the time this film reaches its conclusion, you can just about tell that Hollywood would have knocked on the producer's doors, and extended a contract for rights to a remake. With the success of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Hollywood is probably now turning its sights to Scandinavia, and this Norwegian film has all the ingredients that is set to thrill audiences ready for a nice mystery that will leave you guessing just how the protagonist will be reeling out of the troubles that he had committed.The bulk of the credit goes to Aksel Hennie, who stars as the protagonist Roger Brown, the go-to person should anyone need a job reference. The top dog headhunter in his industry, with arrogance and swagger to boot, his opening monologue about Reputation is so seductive that you'll hang on to his every word. But Jo Nesb?'novel is more than meets the eye, and Brown has a separate occupation. With his contacts and multitudes of interviews set up with potential candidates for C-level jobs, opportunity comes in setting up meetings, and then robbing them blind of valuable art, with counterfeits in their place so that his handiwork won't go detected for some time. Brown readily admits he's overspending, with expenses all going into impressing his wife Diana (Synn?ve Macody Lund), who is extremely high maintenance.What would seem a routine open and shut attempt with his latest job seeker, Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), turned out to be quite the nightmare, and the film kicks into high gear when Brown suspects his wife having an affair with this strapping man, a one time mercenary soldier who had found better fortune as a now-retrenched CEO of a technology company, and who has a long lost painting stored in his Norwegian home. Again, Nesb?'s story throws us a line, and hooks us into what would turn out to be an extremely engaging, in-your-seat cat and mouse game and battle of wits between these two men, which brings to mind the definition of the title.It's clearly segregated into three acts, as it explores the pride before the downfall, brought about by underestimating one's enemy, and not taking precautions to finish any job, thanks to complacency. Horror fans would like to take note of the middle act, as director Morten Tyldum surely adapted the techniques from understanding the technicalities and workings in keeping suspense on an all time high, never letting up in pace, and keeping the narrative moving at breakneck speed. It plays on our fears of being hunted, and cornered, with desperate measures being called upon for survival, and all these while trying to piece together just who, and more importantly, why, are developments being much against the favour of the protagonist, and to witness how anyone can wriggle their way out of the fix presented.Headhunters is plenty of fun, in a dark and bleak sort of way, that dwells into the deep recesses of the twisted. Surprises pop up when you think you got a grip on what's going to happen next, and catches you offguard. And what's really appreciated is that you'd never feel like you're being strung along conveniently throughout the story, with clues and setups being established properly, together with a taut finale that will leave you breathless, but satisfied and rewarded. Headhunters is as close to the perfect thriller as you can get. A definite recommendation, and inclusion to anyone's shortlist of the year's best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but falls short of the Cohen brothers mark it was going for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What with The Killing and The Bridge on TV and Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in cinemas, it seems that Scandinavian products are the hot property at the moment. This was certainly the tone of what I heard about this film, because it seemed hardly a review could be written for it that didn't mention other things simply because they came from roughly the same part of the world. My reason for mentioning this is because I do feel like the film got a little over-hyped as a result and perhaps others will be coming to it expecting more than they will get. For me I didn't even really know what type of film it was, just that it was supposed to be good.As a result I was fairly open to whatever it did and didn't have any preconceptions about plot etc, just the hope that it would entertain. Mostly it does ? the plot is excessive with plenty of twists and turns as things spiral out of control as the main character tries to understand and rectify the situation he has found himself in. It isn't quite as smart as you have heard and at times it seems badly fragmented, with the events all sort of fitting within the overall narrative but not really working in terms of sitting next to one another. The very tidy conclusion may annoy some but for me there was a certain pleasure to it ? especially considering that by this point any idea of logic and realism was long gone! The tone of the film is aiming for a bloody dark comedy like the Cohen brothers are famous for and, although it is a decent stab, it does fall short of this mark because of issues in the telling and it perhaps not infusing the excesses with the humour in a way that makes them easier to buy into.One area where it doesn't miss the mark though is in Hennie; he is really good here and he sells the tone and content. Speaking of the Cohen's, Hennie frequently reminded me of Steve Buscemi in Fargo which is praise from my point of view. Coaster-Waldau is not quite as good but he is a smooth presence and provides a threat by virtue of this manly presence playing opposite Hennie's, erm, "lesser" frame. Support is decent beyond these two but the film is the two of them ? albeit mostly Hennie's.Overall Headhunters is a good film that is a bloody dark comedy with decent twists in the mould of the Cohen brothers. Unfortunately, because this comparison will be in your head during the film, it does tend to mean you notice that it isn't as good as they would have done and that, while entertaining, it is certainly not as good as you have heard or s good as it could have been. It is rare that I watch a foreign film and want a remake ? but in this case I would love to see what the Cohen's or Sam Rami would do with this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first movie from Norway I have seen, and I thought it was well done enough that I'm curious about sampling other movies from the country. It is interesting in a number of aspects. Unlike most Hollywood movies, the central character here is not totally likable, though even at his worst he is an intriguing character that you can't help but want to follow down his dark path. Speaking of dark paths, the movie goes through some pretty bleak territory. While it starts off fairly light, the movie slowly starts to get violent and brutal; there are a few moments that will make you cringe. Actually, some of this dark material is presented in a way that's not without humor, if you can appreciate black comedy. The wrappings around this package are solid as well; the production values are pretty good, giving the movie a slick look, albeit one that doesn't look Hollywood (you don't see any sunshine in this movie, just dark skies.) The movie is at times casually paced, but it's never so casual that it gets boring. If you think foreign films are nothing but arty and pretentious bores, give this movie a try - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

In the end, I decided that to gain a 10, a film either had to have made such an impact that you recall it as one of your all time favourites, or that it's the best of its genre you have ever seen. This film scores on both counts. I watched the BluRay twice on Lovefilm a few years ago, once on broadcast television and yesterday on the BBC iplayer. It's definitely the best heist film I can remember watching. Bizarrely, I also watched The Martian yesterday too, in which Aksel Hennie has a bit part. I suspect the experience was ruined by having the excitement of Headhunters in such close (in terms of time) comparison. The Martian all felt a bit bland.

		<shortDescription>Doesn't deliver on its premises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's half of an interesting idea in Morten Tyldum's film 'Headhunters'; that a man may be so cynical as to undermine himself, through his belief that the rest of the world is as twisted as himself. But the movie's protagonist is so selfish and unlikeable that it's hard to sympathise with him, even as he discovers the meaning of love; and the plot depends on there being someone out there who justifies his cynicism in every possible way. That plot, incidentally, is a standard over-the-top thriller, with wild chases, implausible twists and imaginary technology to give a supporting injection each time the story is in danger of running out of steam. Ultimately, the film is both immoral and essentially juvenile, and insufficiently intelligent to exploit its premises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definition of a thriller movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Headhunters" is a really great Nordisch movie which has to do with a headhunter who risks everything to obtain a valuable painting. In this movie we have many good interpretations and I think that all the plot of this movie was so nice that the actors of the cast must did the proportionate interpretations and I believe that they did a really great job.I liked this movie because of the interpretations of Aksel Hennie who plays as Roger Brown and Synn?ve Macody Lund who plays as Diana Brown. I also think that Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau who played as Clas Greve made a great interpretation. In the direction Morten Tyldum did an outstanding work and I think that it was obvious in whole movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death imitating art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With humour as black as congealed blood (of which there is plenty on show), this eventful and then some, lightning-paced caper/body-count/chase/revenge movie outrageously subverts the recently established perception of the voguish Nordic noir style of slow- burning procedural thrillers like TV's "The Bridge" and "The Killing" as well, of course as Steigg Larssen's celebrated "The Girl..." trilogy.This, by contrast, takes a far-fetched plot and wrings it dry of all plausibility, as high-living vertically-challenged corporate recruitment executive Roger Brown attempts to keep his beautiful, taller wife accustomed to the lifestyle etc etc with ingenious art-thefts on wealthy candidates who innocently reveal to him their prize possessions as well as their accessibility for him and his gun-toting confederate Ove to do the old switcheroo on their art treasures. As well as a predilection for guns, Ove's penchant for filming his encounters with procured young Russian prostitutes for the delectation of his gawping live-feed chums later proves invaluable to Roger for his final escape.By then, Roger has bitten off more than he can chew when another apparently easy mark comes into view via his wife's conveniently staged art exhibition with a particularly valuable prize at stake, only for things to start spiralling out of control even as he's carrying out the robbery.From there on, we're subjected to a frenetic series of unfortunate and very bloody literally hair-raising events which will bring your fingers to your eyes (and nose, in one especially repugnant scene) until via further twists and turns, our anti-hero comes out the other end (no pun intended) more or less in one piece, with girl and goods intact.While the pacing of the direction sometimes outpaces plausibility and continuity and some of the killings are perhaps too over-the-top (including that of an unfortunate dog and a double-go at Ove), this haphazard adventure just about survives its own weight and makes for an entertaining if incredulous and often squeamish watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast, expert, funny/violent, crime and chase film...Swedish style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Headhunters (2011)An inventive, fast, sometimes very funny and sometimes very violent movie that probably owes something to Americans Joel and Ethan Coen and even Tarantino. That is, it's a crime movie where you identify with one of the dubious characters in the middle of it all. It gets bloody and twisty and very very interesting.And it does feel European (or Scandinavian, officially), too, with a kind of dry, precise, elegant filmmaking throughout. I recommend it.You do eventually come to wonder about the title (which makes sense only later into the film) and to the slight improbability that underlies the whole shebang. The people here (there are about four major characters) are driven to really excessive extremes by what seems at first to be a personal vendetta (in which case anything goes) but what later is a corporate arrangement (in which case, not really).Luckily you don't know this at first and just follow the extraordinary hunter and prey dynamic that is most of the movie. The art stealing part? Not a big aspect in it all, but a good way to hook us in. It's mostly about our gradually identifying with the main character as he goes through really extraordinary steps to survive. You'll see!Intense, and weirdly fun, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Killer Job</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Headhunters" offers an interesting premise: "How far are you willing to go for what you want?" It is hard to reduce this thriller to one sentence; it's easy to call it another story of a man on the run. It's truly neither. Instead, it's a multifaceted treat for those of us who enjoy action, scheming, flawed characters who like to push the limits.Be prepared to follow our anti-hero along through a series of ordeals that might have no apparent solution. For much of the film, we try to change our perspective since there is not much to like about the main character, a conniving and manipulating business man by day, and a sophisticated robber by night. In a flash, things go truly bad for him, and this is where the film could have run into trouble because we are suddenly a bit disoriented. Yet, things things begin to unravel in a very interesting manner, and everything is beautifully explained.Soon, there are car chases, accidents, and things begin to smell pretty bad for our hero. One thing you won't find is a boring moment. We should be grateful for a rather nasty villain, a couple of very interesting female leads, and some snappy editing. To reveal more would be a sin.Sit down and enjoy the ride... it does get quite bumpy and will never let you down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Norwegian take on THE KILLING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This piece of quality tosh had a Brighton audience chuckling, though I'm not sure if it's meant to be funny. The story stretches credulity in the manner of television's CSI (take your pick: the Miami series is usually the daftest of them!) with its Oslo security company executive who moonlights as an art thief to keep his trophy wife cocooned in luxury. Stealing a priceless artwork from a hunky new recruit, Roger discovers that all is not well on the domestic front. (This scene takes coincidence to a new high or possibly a new low.)Soon Roger is on the run from a psychopath and caught up in a trail of murder and mayhem. One very yucky scene is blatantly lifted from SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, although for the most part this lusciously filmed, well-acted movie has a 'sheen' reminiscent of the films of Pedro Almodovar which often resemble a soap opera run amok. There are a few echoes of Denmark's THE KILLING but Norway (for once!) gets higher points for pace and action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this a lot. Mum and I chose this quickly, as we had time to kill....what a great choice. We usually love the films from this part of the world. We laughed ourselves sick, most of the way through - if you think '' The Worst Week of My Life'', meets '' American Psycho'', with a sprinkle of ''The Bourne Identity'', you might get some idea of what this is like.The film isn't original, by any means. It really doesn't need to be, it's so much fun. All the actors are beautifully cast. Poor Roger Brown (Hennie), you just despise him so much, but you despise everyone else more, so you sort of want him to win through anyway. The two cops, whom I mentally dubbed ''tweedledum and tweedledee'', made me crack up when I first saw them, let alone when anything happened... then when they ended up as ''bookends'' so to speak, in the morgue... classic! I enjoyed the sub-plot about Industrial espionage.... a nice little contrivance to make the main plot go.A real belly laugh, and we've been making quips about the importance of reputation all week. I'll rush out and buy it as soon as it's available, and I'll watch it fairly often, there are so few comedies that I find really funny- this is one of them.</fullReview>

Fast, smart, unflinching in it's violence yet not gratuitous. Just when you think you have it all figured out, a quick turn in the plot takes you in another direction.

Hollywood may have dropped the ball on creating movies with true substance, but thankfully, the Swedes (Dragon Tattoo), Danes (Headhunters), Iranians (A Separation), Israelis (Footnote), Canadians (Monsieur Lazhar) and others have the guts to make a movie that isn't bloated, tells a great story, and allows actors to provide honest, authentic performances. Hopefully this movie will get enough publicity from word of mouth because I have seen very little in the way of publicity in print or TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preposterous Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morten Tyldum's film is a very strange piece of work. Its premise is highly engaging: a successful headhunter Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) runs a criminal sideline together with accomplice Ove (Eivind Sander) in stealing valuable paintings. They are generally successful at it, but meet their match when they try to steal a valuable Rubens from early-retired business person Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Roger becomes embroiled in a complex part where Clas is out to kill him, enlisting the help of Roger's wife Diana (Synn?ve Macody Lund) and girlfriend Lotte (Julie R. ?lgaard) in the process.From here onwards the story becomes something of a picaresque adventure, where Roger is pursued up hill and down dale by the vindictive Clas., Roger shows an astonishing ability to recover from the most terrible indignities, which include having to hide himself in a a pile of excreta, with only a breathing-tube to keep him alive; being pushed off a high cliff while being strapped into a car: being attacked by a wild dog: and returning to Lotte's house only to find himself being attacked by his knife-wielding girlfriend. The plot is full of implausibilities, mostly centering around Clas's apparent myopia, despite having the advantage of developing sophisticated tracking technology.Eventually the story comes to a happy ending, but by then viewers have lost interest in what might be most charitably described as a preposterous thriller. John Andreas Andersen's photography creates a gray world full of menace and pouring rain, but even this seems wasted.</fullReview>

Here, the story is the brunt and everything else revolves around it. Add proficient direction, excellent performances of the cast (especially Mr. Hennie), "familiar" camera angles and shots, fine choice of music and everything else that makes a really good movie to watch, and you'll get something like this one. And it comes from Norway, the country that really knows how to produce an excellent movie (comedies, dramas, crime ... anything). This movie does start rather slow but very soon catches up speed and with all of the twists and turns keeps your attention every second, sort of drowning you into the story, characters, taking sides and expectations. It leaves you with a certain satisfaction that you've just watched it and that is what makes a movie good. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Headhunters revolves around a short man who has a side passion of stealing art. This unique hobby of his has thus far allowed him to maintain a luxurious lifestyle but is about to take him for the ride of his life when a new lucrative mark suddenly surfaced.The movie is a thrilling ride that sees the protagonist going through the lowest points of his life. There are graphic scenes although this is balanced by the comic undertones that are present in some of these scenes. Connecting all these string of events is a love line that is not immediately obvious but is ever present. Overall, the pacing is excellent and the twists are well utilised. The barrage of revelations at the end might be overwhelming for some though as you have to bend your mind to understand the protagonist's machinations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-heavy and darkly comic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Headhunters is one in a long line of recent sophisticated Scandinavian noirs, offering a more thoughtful alternative to some of Hollywood's more mainstream thrillers. Based on the novel Hodejegerne by Jo Nesbo, Headhunters is high on the chase but low on plot, which is sad given the network of corporate sleaze that seems so high on possibilities during the film's opening scenes. It's set-pieces are streaked with wickedness and black comedy, but as they go on and on, and its lead character is dunking himself in human waste to escape an angry dog or surviving a fifty-foot drop off a cliff, it pushes its plausibility to, well, implausible levels.Aksel Hennie plays Roger Brown, a smug, vertically-challenged corporate headhunter that moonlights as an art thief to fund the lavish lifestyle he believes his supermodel wife (Synnove Macody Lund) wants. He is approached by former military tracker Clas Greve (Games of Thrones' Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), who wants to be chosen by Brown to be the new CEO of Pathfinder, a technologies company. Hennie discovers that Greve has an ultra-rare Rubens painting, and steals it, only to find his wife's mobile phone in Greve's home. After stalling on the job offer, Brown finds himself being hunted by Greve and betrayed by those he believed cared about him.With his preening demeanour and pale eyes, director Morten Tyldum is asking a lot for the audience to be rooting for Roger Brown's survival. Clas Greve is the one-dimensional bad guy - sneering, chiselled, glowing with self-satisfaction - but there were times I found myself cheering him on. Tyldum wisely portrays Brown's suffering with a tongue locked in cheek, and the situation he finds himself in are suitably amusing, even when they are particularly gruesome. But when his redemption finally comes, it's in favour of an extended collection of set-pieces and little resembling plot, glossing over what could have been a smart corporate thriller.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very captivating storyline but could have been done better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original story is really very interesting and it is nicely shot with a good cast and overall fine production values, but I think it deserved a better director. It is exactly what I thought after watching the first Millennium movie - and I just didn't care for the other two after that: they had a great original story but a lack of talent behind the camera that didn't succeed in bringing the final result above the book.Headhunter suffers mainly from editing spirit weakness. Too many sequences are just shot as stand-alone scenes as if the director was only able to process one idea at the time. Visually it is great, but narratively the continuity, the suspense that builds up is far from the heights it could reach. At first the main character just appears as another despicable sociopath and you don't start to really root for him before he is way up in his ordeal.The character development is excellent though, it's only that Robert Brown should have been more deeply insecure in the exposition than just bragging about all he does to compensate for his short 1.68m (5'6") stature. Storytelling is not just about bringing ideas forward and switching to the next, and the trap in using voice-over narration is to do just that: telling stuff you know about your character without letting him really express what he feels.Now I hope there will be a fine remake, or simply another version just like when David Fincher made The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.</fullReview>

All excellent.However, what's very confusing is the irrational behavior from rational characters. You'll leave the sofa wondering, why the heck did the character do that to obtain this when he could just have done something else and it would have been so much more believable. It would have been fine if the movie had characters that were impulsive and irrational. However, these weren't.For spoilers: What I meant with the above text was that the character Clas Greve (played by Coaster-Waldau) had obtained hes objective almost instantly in the movie, but he went ahead and slept with Roger's wife and completely fubar'ed the entire situation for himself. For me it is impossible to believe that a CEO of a large company in hes 40s can't keep hes dick in hes pants when there's a billion dollar deal on the line. You don't get to that position by being irrational.The second half of the movie is a dark farce where Roger gets into more trouble for each minute. And the movie does it magnificently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just the way I like my thrillers: slick, smart, sexy, and improbable. The Norwegian Headhunters might remind you of Girl with the Dragon Tattoo if you count the bloody business of crime unbound. Headhunters is unlike it because the characters are less dynamic and the plot more accessible.But both have convoluted crime profiles; in the case of Headhunters it's about Roger Brown (Askel Hennie), a European superstar headhunter who moonlights stealing fabulous works of art in heists that are a work of art themselves. In some ways he's compensating for his height, 5 '6," as he intimates from the opening narration. It looks as if he is successful pleasing his tall, blond wife, Diana (Synnove Macody Lund) until he meets Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), who has a painting worth stealing.As Roger becomes mired in theft gone wrong, he gets a chance to show his real artistry in extricating himself from rather crappy circumstances (my word choice purposeful). The pace is Indianapolis speedy as angels and demons change fortunes and misfortunes.The intelligence of the details is what most pleases me, and they are not without their absurdity, also a virtue as it seems plausible anyway. It's a nice turn for the cops, as well, who are not stupid but just a bit behind the brilliant criminals.In the end the darkly humorous plot has a Coen brothers ring to it as it mixes black humor and downright disgusting graphics to deliver a thriller that just doesn't take a breath. In other words, it's a breathless success.</fullReview>

Specifically, it makes fun of the violence seen in so many Hollywood films and, even more, makes fun of the ambitious young businessmen who are so eager to make themselves rich.As with most satires, the story goes too far to show how ridiculous is the subject it is satirising. So, for example, the main character, the headhunter, is a part-time burglar to make enough money to impress his wife. How many professional headhunters do you think are part-time burglars? The violence comes when the headhunter turns down a candidate for a job. The candidate then tries to kill him. As the headhunter himself says (I am writing this from memory, so it is not exact): "I just turned him down for the job, I don't understand why he is trying to kill me!" There is a lot of humour in this film, so don't take it too seriously. If you only focus on the violence, you will miss enjoying the amusing story. There is no reason that you can't enjoy both.</fullReview>

I am all right not asking for an air tight plot, but this one was just way way out there in making utterly no sense. Now it could be that the film was edited so much that these plot holes didn't exist in the original script but I have to review the film as shown.***************Major Spoilers***********************There is no way the bad guy from Denmark could know that the main character was an art thief so the major plot of the movie, that the thief was set up by being lured by a Rubens is impossible.The idea that something which is so small that it cannot be seen, even if present in the thousands, as the trackers supposedly are, can transmit with enough power to be detected by satellites and then picked up by a GPS unit is hilarious. Why not just have these guys riding horses which can gallop faster than the speed of light? Either choice is equally absurd. How can the farmer not know who Ove was, mistaking another for him, but know what car he drives so he mistakes the main character for Ove by seeing him drive the car? Why would the main evil guy separate from his nasty dog long enough for the good guy and the dog to get into a protracted fight without the bad guy nearby to put paid to the fight?The good guy is overwhelmed by desire for his wife yet can be lured into an affair within a few hours. The wife is famously in love with the good guy but just for the heck of it goes for a casual roll in the hay with the bad guy. The bad guy is so stupid as to jeopardize a multi-billion euro dead by banging some chick who happens to be married to the art thief. ****************************I can go on but gee, isn't that enough? It was one thing after another with a nasty ending where the 'good' guy lives happily ever after and we're supposed to just ignore his multi-year past as thief. Production values are excellent but the rest....oh gosh.</fullReview>

I could not possibly see how the later scenes followed from the earlier scenes, they seemed completely incongruous. The characters began to behave completely irrationally, I guess motivated by some background that we were never told about or something, I was lost.There were many extremely graphic scenes, I guess you can't really get away from the graphic violence these days in any suspenseful movie but I thought they were just way over the top and took me out of the story.I began to lose interest about 2/3 through but did manage to finish, and the ending tied up the story in such wildly implausible tying-of-knots that I literally laughed out loud.I'll definitely watch for the actors again and look forward to seeing other Nordic themed movies.

Because otherwise it is highly entertaining, well played and riveting. Certainly one of the best thriller of the year. As a bonus the character of the wife is surprising and refreshing.</fullReview>

Clas Greves was nice to look at and the film was visually appealing. While I would recommend this movie, there are two major issues with the plot. ******Spoilers********These spoilers are minor. However, Greves wants the job at Pathfinder so he meets Brown to convince him to give him the position. Alright. Greves also have a supposedly multi-million dollar painting, which Brown steals. Fine, the film establishes that Brown is an art thief because of his expensive lifestyle. However, the scene in Lotte's apartment when she explains Greves real motivation was a little confusing, mostly because it then did not make sense for Greves to desperately want to kill Brown. I guess because with Brown dead he could interview with someone else to ensure he gets the position? I guess...Also the ending is so over-the-top positive it's a little too much. Even if Brown does not live in hiding or go to jail. The fact is he's still in debt and he still can't afford his house. Both him and his wife still committed adultery. It seems odd that at the end everything is perfectly alright. Especially when the police blame Olev for Brown's action, even though they know Olev was dead for most of it. The head detective isn't the only one on the case, does no one at the police station question that there clearly has to be someone else involved? Olev hasn't been dead for just a few hours, but days by the time the film concludes. Again this movie is an entertaining pop-corn film. It's more entertaining then I'd thought it would be and it didn't film long.It's better to ignore these two confusing plot holes and just enjoy the game of cat and mouse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Static dialogic acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visually very good movie with well combined clipping and choice of music, a movie about an art thief with twists in the story, this movie has very good dynamics at times. The main character dramatic play is at times extremely good! Unfortunately, this is yet again a Norwegian movie where the dialogic acting is way to static and pretentious, this is especially true for the main character who also at certain times acts weirdly mad. Choosing of the main characters name may also have been different. The quality of the twists varies and as the movie progresses the solution to problems in the manuscript are poorly solved. The police depiction goes from natural to almost cartoonlike, which does not fit well to the at times high dramatic happenings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was..OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Norwegian film about a headhunter for prolific corporate job-openings who abuses his position to steal artwork from the wealthy guys he sets up interviews for. Although the approach is certainly fresh and humorous, the movie derails completely after one and half hour into it, when it becomes way too predictable and when plot holes start to emerge at a 1 per minute rate. Other than that, I would certainly recommend the film to people who are into a twisted sense of humor and like a mix of the Michael Haneke and Coen brothers style of film making. The acting is fine but the film itself is too episodic even though the action and pace makes up a lot for these and other flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one honest, among 12 other phony, reviews...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reviewers paid by producers and/or distributors are just ruining IMDb. When I read the majority of the per now 12 reviews of this film, I just lose all faith in this site. IMDb should do something to get rid of these Shi...heads that pose as regular movie buffs when they are in fact just doing a sneaky bit of marketing on behalf of producers/distributors. I'm a Norwegian national, understand all cultural connotations and whatnot's of this 2 hour tripe, love thrillers/crime flicks like "Heat", "The Usual Suspects", "Michael Clayton", etc, and that taken into account, compared to movies like that, in my opinion, you know what I'm getting at, this movie really stinks big time. If "Heat" is a thriller benchmark 10, then this is maybe a 2-3. I gave it a 1 to level out all the 11 phony 8-10 reviews...</fullReview>
