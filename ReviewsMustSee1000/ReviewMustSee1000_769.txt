		<shortDescription>An excellent, charming, moving film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you really never seen Brief Encounter? What have you been doing all these years? You have a treat in store.I have a great love for British films of the 1940s. There seems to have been a great flowering of creative talent then, and the films of the period look beautiful, and have such wonderful characters in them. David Lean is more famous for his huge Technicolor epics, like Lawrence of Arabia, or A Passage to India, but Brief Encounter is his most moving film. It is shot in atmospheric black and white, and tells the story of two people who fall in love, in mundane little England.Celia Johnston plays Laura, a middle class woman who lives a happy but predictable life, who meets Dr. Alec Harvey, played by craggy Trevor Howard. There starts a doomed love affair, set to the sweeping romantic sounds of Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto. This single piece of music plays throughout the film, and stirs up exactly the right emotions. The film will make you want to own a recording of the music.Such is the power and influence of this film, that it has been remade a few times, and spoofed on countless occasions. It created the archetype for the romantic farewell on a station platform, with steam hissing from trains, and an orchestra playing in the background. Though this has been copied often, it has never been bettered. The film involves a few scenes on railway platforms, and some of these are mundane, others joyous, or despairing, wretched. The director uses many deft tricks to heighten the emotion all along the way. A simple tilt of the camera, or contrasting mood of another character, serves to add tremendous power to the emotion of the scenes.Times were different then. People were brasher, accents were stronger, and social attitudes to affairs quite different. The period of the film gives it much of its charm. It does not make it a cold study of a different culture, however. The film is very personal. The character of Laura's husband is hardly seen in the entire film, which means that we identify more with Laura's feelings. We see the affair and next to nothing else.Celia Johnson brings a great deal to the film. She is so likeable, and so able to express the misery that her new love brings her. Her manner of speaking is quite alien to a modern ear. In the 1940s, it was quite normal to add a Y sound to many words. "Hat" became "hyat". The accents are not forced, though - they come across as quite natural, and very likeable.This film would not be made this way today. The modern audience would demand younger stars, and nudity. See this film to witness how it was once possible to make films about love without bedroom scenes. Brief Encounter is very much stronger for lack of these. Stoicism and restraint are under-rated traits in modern cinema. Modern directors and writers would do well to remind themselves with this film, that a story can be given tremendous emotional power by techniques which seem to have been lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore That First Review. This Is A Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The person who wrote the first review of this movie must be either a complete moron or has an acute lack of appreciation for what constitutes great moviemaking."Brief Encounter" is the perfect encapsulation of a very specific time in both women's and British history. The immediate post-WW 2 era in the UK was a period that saw Brits struggling with the disppearance of traditional social mores that had endured for over a century and the new world order that came about at the conclusion of the war. (For another, beautifully crafted cinematic example, see Neil Jordan's exquisite movie "The End of the Affair.")Food rationing was still in place in postwar Britain. Women were having to deal with getting to know their menfolk again, after their years of absence at war. Like their American "Rosie the Riveter" counterparts, British women had enjoyed newfound and unfamiliar independence during wartime, working for the war effort. And, like their US "sisters", they were expected to relinquish those jobs to returning men."Brief Encounter" is, in many ways, a metaphor for the struggle that men and women were going through, stuck with having to conform to social expectations while bursting to escape to the greater independence glimpsed fleetingly and pleasurably during the war, when everything and everyone were turned upside down.Being the work of Noel Coward, that master observer of and commentator on English manners, "Brief Encounter" frames this struggle as a torrid love story bubbling under the surface of British reserve, which demands maintaining appearances at all costs, regardless of the personal pain involved.This passionate pair, who never even exchange a kiss, are constrained and ultimately kept apart by expectations--of their families, of their social positions, of Great Britain.When Alec puts his hand on Laura's shoulder at their final, unexpectedly truncated meeting in the station snack bar/waiting room, it's as erotic and far more touching than just about every sex scene you'll see in movies.The first reviewer completely missed the point and the relevance of this movie in film history and, especially, in British cinema history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certain songs, or melodies, associated with films one has seen, stay in our sub conscience forever. This is the case with the Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto for this viewer. Any time we hear it, or parts of the main themes are played, it immediately evokes this romantic film of 1945. It's a tribute to its director, David Lean, that after more than sixty years, it still is one of the most cherished movie experiences for a lot of people that saw it, or that are just getting acquainted with it."Brief Encounter" owes it all to one of the best talent in the English speaking world of the last century: Noel Coward. As part of his "Tonight at Eight" theater work, this one act play, "Still Life" was turned by its author and David Lean into what we know as "Brief Encounter", a bittersweet account of two lovers, doomed from the start.The film works because the exquisite chemistry between its two stars, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard. Both these actors make Laura Jesson and Alec Harvey come alive and stay with us every time we view this timeless film. The story is not far fetched and is made real by the two stars that elevate it to one of the best films of all times. The movie is done with an impeccable sense of decorum and style, yet it has such a sexy subtext. That was a time when a film didn't have to "bare it all" in order to catch the viewer's imagination. In fact, Laura and Alec let us know, without being specific, about the passion that both feel for one another.Celia Johnson was not a great beauty. Neither was Trevor Howard the epitome of handsomeness, yet, their scenes together project such a heat, as the one that their characters are feeling at any given moment. The fact the two illicit lovers are played by people one could relate to, is what makes the film resonate the way it does every time we watch it. Of course, we realize this situation had no future from the start, yet, one keeps hoping their love will end well.The supporting cast is excellent. Stanley Holloway is seen as the station master Albert. Joyce Carey is perfect as the woman in charge of the refreshment area of the station where Laura and Alec spend some of their time together. Cyril Raymond makes Fred Jesson, a man who perhaps understand much more than what he lets know. Everly Gregg is seen as the chattering Dolly Messiter."Brief Encounter" is one of the best films directed by David Lean, a man who was able to give the film the right tone and made it the classic that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Briefly, a great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not a lot to say. Like many classics this film is simply constructed with all the elements in balance so that none stands out. Everything in it contributes something essential; the lighting, the unromantic railway station sets, the minor characters and of course the music, the ultra-romantic Rachmaninov Piano Concerto no 2. The emotional rollercoaster of the illicit affair has seldom been better portrayed. Perhaps it is a little understated for transatlantic tastes but no-one viewing this movie would not appreciate that the English can be as passionate as the rest of us.Celia Johnson as Laura and Trevor Howard as Alec are perfect together. It being 1945, they do not get to bed ? that would have ruined the audience's sympathy for them in those rather more censorious times. It's all in their minds but their faces give the game away ? to each other and to the bystanders. Nothing happens to drag anyone near the awful divorce courts, but you are left wondering whether Celia will ever feel quite the same about her dull, comfortable, patronising and boring husband. As for Alec, he professes he will love her forever but then, he's a man.Noel Coward produced this film from a short play of his from 1935 (the war and post-war shortages are absent), and his dulcet tones may be recognised in the railway station announcements. David Lean directed, and it is a remarkable collaboration. The action is opened out a little ? a row on the lake, a drive in the country - but the scenes from the play set entirely in the railway refreshment rooms still remain the centre of the story. The parallel relationship between Albert the station guard (Stanley Holloway), and Myrtle the refreshment room attendant (Joyce Carey), is an interesting counterpoint to the angst-ridden middle class would-be adulterers. Surely Noel old boy you weren't suggesting that the working class handles this sort of thing better? We see things largely from Laura's point of view and perhaps Alec didn't feel quite so guilty, but their consciences are going to make them pay. A gem of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple film with complex emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brief Encounter is probably one of the finest romances made by the English film industry. The story line is simple, of a married woman who meets a stranger and falls in love, belies the complexity of the emotions involved. It ends poignantly, as both parties realise that their feelings have been overshadowed by the social impossibility of their situation.The film is particularly good at reflecting the post-war austerity and morality of England. It may change your view of railway stations forever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't think I'd write this comment till I saw the 2 previous ones criticizing 'BE'. I don't know how much this movie would appeal to camp-followers of an in-your-face go-getting culture. Some of the frequent adjectives describing this movie is 'civilised', 'restrained', 'noble'. To those who call this movie dated, I'll say that these are indeed qualities which are hardly followed &amp; upheld today, especially in movies. However movies do reflect contemporary social mores, &amp; maybe the story of two illicit lovers sacrificing their love for something as obvious as home &amp; family does not find to many buyers today.For those who think a movie can convey some of the most intimate emotions, conflicts &amp; visions known to us, those who believe 2 art forms (Rachmaninoff's 2nd, Lean's 4th) can coexist brilliantly, &amp; finally for those who believed David Lean got body-snatched in mid-career to make over-blown nonsense like 'Dr. Zhivago' this is one of the best ways to spend 86 minutes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, an affair, but really a tribute to committed married love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YOU CAN SAFELY READ MY INTRO - NO SPOILERS TO STARTI adore this movie, more every time I watch it.First, just a brief introductory summary to whet your appetite for this great picture (my all time favorite), a vintage black and white film set in Britain during the 1940's... During one of her weekly Thursday shopping excursions in a neighboring town, a rather plain (though earnest and engaging), contentedly married, middle aged housewife named Laura encounters an affable and kind (also married) doctor, Alec, at the train station refreshment counter. Circumstances force a brief interaction and thus begins a series of Thursday meetings between the pair, with casual chance acquaintance quickly replaced by growing and consuming attraction. Most of the scenes revolve around the station tea shop which serves as a sort of "home base" to the affair. It is Laura's tale; thus the events and emotions are related totally from her point of view, all to the romantic strains of Rachmaninof's Piano Concerto. Read all the other rave reviews about the superb acting / character portrayals, the atmospheric enhancement of the whizzing and hissing trains, and so on. They're all true...plot, character, setting, and atmosphere are all done to perfection in this film. BEWARE - SPOILERS AHEADHowever, if you want a little serious insight into this movie, consider my unique "take"....Yes, it's dramatically moving and intense, that farewell touch of Alec's hand on Laura's shoulder. However, I'm probably one of the only viewers who regards this movie as a tribute to married love, as opposed to the middle aged affair between two ordinary people which is its obvious theme. True, the drama revolves around Laura and Alec, their encounters at the train station, their thwarted passions, and their guilt ridden emotions (especially Laura's). But, let's remember, Laura is narrating the tale as she wishes she could tell it to her husband, Fred, obviously her best friend and "the only one who would understand".Well, isn't a new romance exciting, the more so if forbidden? Champagne lunches, boat excursions out in the countryside, daydreams of Paris and Venice, hanging on each other's every word. Don't we all sort of yearn for it every now and then? However, if Laura and Alec had remained together, before long they would have resembled...Laura and Fred! The Grand Romance seldom lasts, at least not in its original form; it takes on a more meaningful form. (Failure to realize this of course fills modern divorce courts.) Poor dull Fred! He's my favorite character...I absolutely adore him! He often gets a bad rap from the other reviewers. Don't buy it! Really, there's nothing wrong with him. He probably reminds many a wife of her husband, engrossed with his crossword or whatever. Steady and predictable...the most desirable quality, longterm, in a spouse!Everyone wonders why the movie shows Laura's husband but not Alec's wife, nor does it give us much information about her, other than the fact that she's "delicate". That's because Brief Encounter is really the story of Laura and FRED. Even though he's not present in that many scenes, his character is well drawn.Fred may not currently be "sweeping Laura off her feet" but he's actually very kind to her. In the end, he realizes she's been having an affair and is grateful she's chosen him. I categorically disagree with those who claim that Laura returns to her husband only because of society's expectations, not out of love for him.What happens after the movie closes? Well, maybe Fred pays her a tiny bit more attention and, hopefully, some spark of romance might be rekindled. As for Laura, I think she'll be extremely relieved that her affair WASN'T consummated, occasionally scold herself for her brief period of insanity, realize the depth of Fred's love, and try to make it up to him for her "emotional disloyalty". I doubt Laura will spend too much energy bemoaning what she might have had with Alec; the affair has made clearer to her what she DOES have with Fred.It's "boring" (?), stable, committed love versus brief romance and passion. No movie portrays the contrast better than Brief Encounter. Pity more people today don't make the choice Laura and Alec did. The world might be a better place.This movie puts to shame modern cinema where the main characters are generally in bed within the first five minutes. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, Honest, and Unforgettable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It really pleases me to see the very positive responses here to this gem of a movie. I recently read Kevin Brownlow's epic, detailed biography of David Lean, and I'm less mystified as to how Lean went from intimate character dramas such as this one, and even GREAT EXPECTATIONS and OLIVER TWIST, to the big-screen epics which placed far more emphasis on scenery and very little on character. Lean had great problems with intimacy, and much preferred grandeur (he virtually abandoned his son, and didn't meet one of his grandchildren until she was about 30). I'm not knocking the epics, because I've enjoyed them as well, but at the end of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA one knows about as much about Lawrence as one did about 3-1/2 hours earlier. ..unlike Alec and Laura in this film, whom we know very well after 1-1/2 hours, or Pip and Miss Havisham in EXPECTATIONS, characters who leapt off the screen and endeared themselves to us (it also helped that some really gifted actors &amp; actresses played these roles).I never tire of BRIEF ENCOUNTER - it's one of the screen's great romances, perhaps because it doesn't quite end "happily ever after". It remains simple, honest, and unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Huge Cloudy Symbols Of A High Romance"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steam ... cut-glass accents ... Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto ... the refreshment room at Milford Junction ... "the shame of the whole thing - the guiltiness, the fear ..." - it all adds up to David Lean's famous film treatment of the Noel Coward tale of love blossoming and withering at a suburban railway station. Laura Jesson is a complacent middle-class housewife who gets a piece of grit in her eye one day and is helped by Doctor Alec Harvey, and the romance begins. Coward's screenplay is characteristic of his oeuvre. There is the neat precision of the circular plot, beginning and ending with the brainless intrusion of Dolly Messiter, and the matching sub-plot of the Albert-Mrs. Bagot courtship. There are tongue-in-cheek self-references (on the cinema screen, "Flames Of Passion" coming shortly) and the trademark Cowardian grounding in exaggerated Englishness ("One has one's roots, after all"). Most typical of all is that overwrought cascade of middle-class vocabulary (" ...so utterly humiliated and defeated, and so dreadfully, dreadfully ashamed"). Coward patronises working-class people abominably. Albert and Mrs. Bagot amble effortlessly through their romance because, bless them, they are simple folk. Alec and Laura suffer torments, having so much more sensitivity, and, you see, they have reputations to lose ("the furtiveness and the lying outweigh the happiness"). Having made the transition from editor to director in 1942, Lean was at the helm for the fourth time for "Brief Encounter", all four films being Coward projects - and a highly creditable job he made of this one. The scene in which Alec explains coal-dust inhalation and Laura falls in love is a model of sensitive direction. Reflections of Laura's face in the train window and the make-up mirror suggest in visual terms the existence of her 'other self', the id to her ego. Thundering steam trains and Rachmaninov stand for the irrepressible sexual urge. Stephen Lynn's flat, with its bachelor urbanity, contrasts cleverly with Laura's safe, staid home and safe, staid husband Fred ("I don't understand!") Alec's silent hand on Laura's shoulder is wonderfully poignant, the suppressed emotion eclipsed by stupid Dolly Messiter, her face filling the screen and 'wiping out' the great moment. Sex has to be dealt with obliquely, but it is very much the driving-force of the film. "If we control ourselves, and behave like sensible human beings ..." offers Laura hopefully but hollowly. Neither man nor woman is capable of restraint, at least until after the climax in Stephen's flat. The boathouse and the little bridge hint furtively at sexual union. Other reviewers have declared the liaison to be 'unrequited' or 'unconsummated', but I am not so sure. In the grammar of 1940's cinema, the return to the love-nest of tousle-haired, hatless Laura is the equivalent, I would suggest, of our modern bedroom scene. Isn't that why Alec suddenly decides to take the job offer?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me,a film addicted"Brief Encounter" is a polished diamond.It's the most perfect romance:You don't see lovers climbing balconys or dying in each others hand.What you see in "Brief Encounter"is two ordinary people in love.Only two normal people who stumble on one another in a railroad station and discover that they have more things in common,then meets the eye.So they started to see each other once a week,but their love are doomed,because they are both married and have very good lives.Celia Johnson is a sparklling gem as a house wife repressed who finds a man so repressed as she.That leads us to Trevor Howard.I know the reason of Celia's anguish.A normal woman simply could not resist to those eyes and the perfect face of Trevor,who embodies every english man in a simple wave,or just laughing in the theater.David Lean's soberb direction and Noel Coward's perfect story give space to show that you don't need to be Romeo And Juliet to tell that love's a good cause to fight,even when the fight is lost</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Noel Coward's short play Still Life was an unusual stepping off point for his full-length screenplay for Brief Encounter, which had some changes (notably in the relationship of our hero and heroine, or how far it gets) and gave Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson excellent roles in this very British mega-weepie. Rachmaninov's 2nd helps considerably, but the housewife and the doctor and their doomed romance, however improbable, manages to be both funny and touching, and Johnson in particular manages to put across the helplessness of a happily married woman who lets a new window open, just for a moment, in the realisation that it will be her only chance. David Lean's direction is atmospheric and sympathetic, and there are a number of choice smaller parts for the likes of Joyce Carey and Valentine Dyall. Perhaps the best of the Coward-Lean collaborations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matters of the Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lean's 'Brief Encounter' was criticized when it was first released for being 'more like a French film'. Yes, that statement rings true, but 'Brief Encounter' is all the better for it's low-key, minimalist approach. It feels REAL.The subject matter was scandalous for a film made in the 40's; primarily because the two parties involved in the affair were portrayed so sympathetically. Of course, this tale of illicit love will barely raise an eyebrow of outrage from modern film-goers, we've 'Been there, seen that'. Although no longer shocking in content, this film is still very powerful because of the deeply felt emotional states of the two characters, Alec and Laura.Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard are perfectly cast as the ordinary housewife and married doctor. Johnson has more share of the action, as it is through her character that we view the pair's infidelity (achieved through flashback &amp; voice-over). The pair are not glamorous or showy stars, so they are utterly believable in their roles as the ordinary, lovestruck Britons. Johnson's soulful eyes and capacity for displaying emotion is brilliantly used here; we, the viewer, feel her repulsion and disgust at what she has allowed to happen- 'I felt like a criminal'- but feel her torment, too. Howard is occasionally stiff, but still very, very good as the doctor who meets Johnson after she gets a piece of grit stuck in her eye. Alec, like Laura, is painfully aware of their situation, yet he is much more boyish and romantic- Indeed, when Alec talks about his desires to further himself in the field of medicine, Laura remarks 'You looked like a little boy, just then'.Every 'brief encounter' between the pair has that sense of urgency, desperation. The constant use of trains and the Rachmaninoff music is symbolic of their restrained inner desires, as are the films playing when the two meet together (every Thursday) to attend the cinema. The use of shadows and lighting (exemplified when Howard kisses Johnson passionately in the shadows at the train station as an engine blows)are terrific. Lean's direction is wonderful, every scene is beautifully handled.Amazing film.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, classic love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two people meet in a train station and have a "Brief Encounter" in the 1946 film directed by David Lean, based on Noel Coward's beautiful story of love found and love lost. There is much talk of a negative first review on this site; I confess I didn't read it.Celia Johnson plays a married woman, Laura, who once a week goes into town to shop and see a movie; Trevor Howard is a married doctor, Alec, who helps a friend out one day at a week at a nearby clinic. The two meet while waiting for their trains, the assignations becoming more and more important to each, until they realize they've fallen in love. This is the 1940s in Britain, and there's no decision to be made.This is a very famous movie, and I can still remember the scene in "Touch of Class" as Glenda Jackson and George Segal cry over it. That's far from the only film in which "Brief Encounter" is referenced: there's also 84 Charing Cross Road, Truly Madly Deeply, The Heidi Chronicles, The Care and Handling of Roses, The Mirror Has Two Faces, and many others. And with good reason. It's a tender love story about two good people who have probably never hurt anyone in their lives and find themselves in a precarious situation.The story begins at the end, before the audience realizes what is going on when a chattering friend of Laura's (Johnson) joins her and Dr. Alec Harvey (Howard) in the café. Just then Harvey's train is called and he rushes off. Laura looks stunned. Her narration begins, continuing on the train and once at home as she, in her mind, tells her husband the story of her relationship with Alex, how they met quite by chance. Then he went with her to the movies. Before long, she was meeting him on Thursdays outside the hospital. Laura is riddled with guilt and finds herself lying to her husband (Cyril Raymond). We don't get the impression that Harvey is feeling equally guilty; in fact, one gets the impression that he would do anything to be with Laura. However, in the end, he takes drastic measures not to be with her.Was the affair consummated or not? Nowadays, with email relationships going on, we know there's such a thing as emotional infidelity, and these two are definitely guilty of that. Physical? I have to agree that it's unclear. They have their special places - the bridge, the boathouse...it's up to the viewer. But Alec's decision certainly hints that something went on.Johnson and Howard weren't beautiful Hollywood stars, which lends realism to the film. They were both attractive, Johnson with her huge eyes and Howard with his chiseled features. (Johnson, by the way, was the sister-in-law of Ian Fleming, and her children purchased the rights to his books.) Laura's marriage is conveyed realistically as well - not unhappy, but not really exciting either. Yet she knows her husband is a good man. He gets the last line in the film, and it's one of its most beautiful moments. Perhaps they will come together as they once did and appreciate one another all the more.The film is scored with the music of Rachmaninoff - maybe it's a little too much at times, but at other times, it's achingly beautiful. The moment when Alec places his hand on Laura's shoulder as he leaves is one of the great moments in film, and a testament to the fact that love doesn't have to be shown using obvious sexual scenes, only with the use of some imagination.Despite "Brief Encounter" being dated today, it serves as a strong metaphor for post-war Britain. During the war, both men and women experienced more freedom from class and social restrictions than they ever had, but afterward, things returned to their conventional ways. It was a hard adjustment for many. "Brief Encounter" shows what happened to two people bound by the mores of the times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brief Encounter is simply one of the best character studies you will ever see on the screen. Nearly every viewer will be reminded of similarities from their own life story. Who among us hasn't had strong feelings for someone they can never have? Trevor Howard delivers stoic but believable lines. Celia Johnson conveys her inner conflicts with amazing realism. What really surprised me how Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto was so welcome to me as a viewer. Many times, especially in the older classics, I find the music a distraction. In Brief Encounter, each time the Concerto came on, it was a stirring moment.Love is such a strange emotion. It is silly when we see it in others, and how it causes them to behave. On the other hand, it is very real to us when it hits home. This movie lets us inside the heads of two respectable people as they struggle with self-control and social boundaries.I couldn't help thinking about how, were this movie made in today's Hollywood (maybe it has been remade???), we would have been treated to a bedroom scene or two. In my opinion, that would have cheapened the film and taken away from the intense romantic mood. Watch for Howard's hand on Johnson's shoulder in their final scene together. If it does not give you goosebumps, then you have been officially desensitized and should stick to modern, R-rated "romances!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, moody and highly irresistible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lean's small masterpiece about forbidden love and failed relationships set amidst the atmospheric sects of suburban London is one of those movies that certainly stays with you and not for all the happy reasons. Cella Johnson and Trevor Howard perfectly portray two people in rather normal marriages and lives, yet feel unfulfilled and begin a simple yet passionate romance that lasts for weeks and changes them both, especially the woman, whom we see from her point of view. As the story progresses, we see the dullness and melancholy she goes through and the one chance at excitement and change she has when going out every Thursday. It is here she meets a handsome doctor and they obviously have feelings for each other. This story has been done many times, but in director Lean's hands, the film is centered on the two lovers and their tumultuous relationship. The film is very brief at only 86 minutes, but I think it is a testimony to the relationship of these two people and how it will impact their future. As mentioned before, the acting is strong especially in some small supporting parts with Stanley Holloway as a flirtatious stage conductor. The photography is moody and perfectly captures that dark, eerie feeling of post-war England. All elements come together in this terribly tragic but ultimately moving story about men, women, and everything that can happen between them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** Meeting quite by accident at the Milford train station British housewife Laura Jesson, Celi Johnson, got a speck of grit stuck in her eye that fellow passenger Dr. Alec Harvey,Trevor Howard, quickly came to her aid and washed out. Alec then slowly starts to get these strong feeling about the sweet and somewhat shy, as well as married, middle-age woman that in no time at all turns into an uncontrollable, by both Laura as well as Alec, love affair that in the end if not checked my well break up both of their marriage's.Even though both Alec and Laura are married, not to each other, we only get to see Laura's husband and family in the movie which is shown in a long flashback, that takes up almost the entire film, from only Laura's point of view. After that innocent meeting at the train station the two always end up meeting on a Thursday when Laura travels to Milford to buy groceries and Alec has the afternoon off from work. Alec a doctor at the Milford hospital has a wife and family who we never get to see but sense are very much in love with him. Alec's life starts to take a sudden turn away from them as he starts to slowly fall in love with Laura.You never once get the impression that Alec and Laura are willing to leave their wife and husband so that they can get married to each other. The two star-struck lovers only want to keep their affair secret and live double-lives but the guilt of the affair consumes Laura. For the first time in her marriage Laura lied to her husband Fred, Cyril Raymond, about her being in love with another man. Even though she admitted it to Fred in an almost whimsical way, that Fred took as a joke, Laura also realized that no matter how much she was in love with Alec, and he with her, in the end it would only lead to nothing but heartbreak for her as well as everyone, Alec together with her and his families, involved. It was later when Alec got a job at his brothers new hospital in Johannesburg South Africa that both he and Laura could finally break up their affair by the two never having to as much as cross their paths again. Even saying goodbye to each other for the last time was never to happen when the two were interrupted at the train station by Laura's chatter-house friend Dolly Mesitter, Everly Gregg. Dolly's non-stop talking prevented the two from having the last few minutes together with each other but at the same time also prevented Laura from throwing herself on the tracks, by momentarily keeping her mind off the fact that Alec was about to leave her, as Alec's train left the station. Extremely moving adult drama about two persons who find out only too late in life that they were meant for each other but missed the boat, or train, when it came into the station and have to do with what they have: try to forget they ever met no matter how much sorrow and grief it would bring them. Both Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard were touchingly effective as the star-struck lovers Laura and Alec who knew that their affair was doomed from the start and just had to accept what fate had handed them: try to forget that brief encounter they had one fateful evening in the railroad station outside of Milford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very difficult to add another comment when so many have been done and many of them so masterfully written. I will not analyze the film because it was already done from all perspectives, with a fantastic mastering of the English language --which I don't have-- and with better knowledge of movies that also, I don't have. I just want to say that among my favorite films ever, this one must be number one (maybe two). Why is this picture so attractive and goes so deep into our subconscious? Is it the nostalgic black and white photography? Is it the Rachmaninoff music? Is it the old fashioned characters and their old fashioned clothes and utterly civilized manners? Is it the fantastic English accents that make us regret the deplorable deliveries of our contemporary actors? I couldn't tell. I just know that this film will stay forever in my mind, giving me a delightful and cozy feeling of gentler past eras I never knew but resentfully miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sir David Lean has left a genuine mark on cinema; he remains one of the most renowned and most celebrated directors in cinema. Some argue that he is the finest British director of all-time. He is a director who has made some of the finest classics ever, including the likes of, Bridge on the River Kwai, Great Expectations, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago and Oliver Twist. That is just to name a few, yet people always forget the outstanding and underrated delight, Brief Encounter.Brief Encounter is a momentary story, however a film of which generations of film aficionados and the average film-viewer hold dear to their hearts. It was one of David Lean's first films and remains one of the most "British" films of all-time. It follows the story of Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) who by chance meets Dr. Alec Harvey (legendary British actor Trevor Howard) and it quickly becomes obvious that they have fallen in love, which swiftly develops into a full-blown affair. The film remains sympathetic towards the two main characters, both actors wonderfully act out the guilt they feel for deceiving their marriages. Yet, the both of them can not retain from showing their love for one another; the film revolves around the infamous set-piece of a train station and tea-room.Brief Encounter was a highly controversial film upon release, even becoming banned in Ireland. Some may wonder why a film like Brief Encounter was controversial, there's no questionable content whatsoever and there is not one single explicit scene in film. Yet, the film does hold a beautiful sexual tension and shows sums up the "guilt-ridden love" which the protagonists feel for one another.Brief Encounter is beautifully shot, evenly paced and forcefully depressing, while remaining beautifully layered in charm and wit. The characters are splendidly scripted and then crafted with elegance. Brief Encounter is a film that has prowess; a classic piece of film-making and a film that has "classic" written all over it. Brief Encounter is heart wrenchingly honest when showing emotion and being open on the phrase "love is a force beyond the power of nature". Brief Encounter is bittersweet and poignant, without being soppy, sloppy or over-sentimental.Brief Encounter is a film that even today gets hailed as a classic of British cinema. It is also certainly a film in which the British Film Institute and British public hold dear to their classic cinema traditions. A highly recommended film and a romance that beats the cheesy, modern-day blockbuster romances, of which the market is horribly cluttered with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing mix of the timelessness of the theme with the utterly time-specific weirdness of 'received British' voices and mores.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spoiler can't apply here, as the title gives the show away. Viewing this film in 2005 is an experience. Firstly, to be reminded that 'class' Brits really did speak (then) like these main characters (the sheer speed of that RB speech for a start) against the pervasive time warp for this viewer raised in far away New Zealand. Decades rolled back and I recall how many older acquaintances 'way out here' simply LIVED for these British treasures, just loving the sheer clipped classiness of them all. Against that is the still relevant timelessness of an unsought, unexpected event of two people already married falling headlong into a 'true love' but which in today's 'freedoms', would be relatively OK to go along with, and never mind the fall-out of 'broken homes' etc.As historical evidence it is almost surreal to be reminded that middle-class women really did lead such challenge-less lives of 'duty' in this case to a suit-wearing but always kindly husband and a child, and the train trip to town to shop, have lunch, and go (alone usually) to a movie was the uplifting event of the week.Despite the uncomfortable reminder that this really was how dutiful middle-class Brits (and others) expected to live their lives, David Lean with Noel Coward's material transcends the unbearably mundane to an absorbing viewer engagement that lasts many hours after. Despite the inevitability of the outcome being signalled through the technique of voice-over protagonist recall, I couldn't help being drawn into the minutiae of the life-changing encounter, nurturing an empathy right through that something good just might happen to bring around a happy ending.I learnt later that this was filmed whilst World WarII was still going on, but the war forms no part of the narrative, and the location was a single railway centre in a small township apart from London and any possible sounds of war.Absorbing, engaging and memorable. Celia Johnson is the stand out star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*This review may contain minor spoilers*Brief Encounter (1945) is something I'd like to call a near masterpiece, if not simply a masterpiece. It's well made to every single detail; The acting by the leading actress (Celia Johnson) is remarkable, the direction surprised me in a good way, this certainly doesn't follow the basic scheme of a love story. A very capturing film indeed, it's a good proof of its great screenplay.This movie feels like a film-noir picture, but there's no criminality or murders. Instead there's a love affair, between a man and a woman who both are married. They start having secret (brief) encounters at a railway station. The trains that lead to the station become symbols of getting away and letting go.The station is the place where they can escape the dull reality. It's the place where they can love each other without thinking of their spouses. When they're together they forget the outside world. But: "Nothing lasts really. Neither happiness nor despair. Not even life lasts very long." As Laura Jensson said.A surprisingly sad romantic film, something I wasn't expecting, but something I was very pleased with. I just wanted to find something entertaining for the Saturday afternoon and ended up watching a cinematic gem. All of us know David Lean as the director of the Lawrence of Arabia (1962) the epic spectacle film. So if you've seen that, this is something completely different. A small film, you might say, but sometimes small is better.The film-noir feeling, that I mentioned before, is captured in the storytelling, camera-work and lighting. And all of those worked brilliantly. As we know film-noirs were dark and this also is a dark story. A survey of misery, about letting go.9/10 Near masterpiece by David Lean, film-noir of love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant camera-work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen "Brief Encounter" for the first time and was not only moved by it but also struck by the brilliance of how the cinematography helped tell the story of how hemmed in Laura &amp; Alec are. It's not just how the train station--the refreshments room, the underground passage, and the platform in the opening shot--is used to create the sense of confinement but also the way that the whole film is shot in closeup. Even when Laura &amp; Alec make their escapes to the country, the camera never pulls back to give you a panorama that might suggest that, at least for a few brief moments, they are free. Another effect of this technique is that not only do you feel how crowded Laura is by people like the silly acquaintance she runs into at the train station but you also virtually never see Laura &amp; Fred in the same frame (until the very last shot, of course), which helps to portray her feeling of isolation. Then there are the shadows in the underground passage in the train station!--well, one could go on and on. Great cinematic storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of fantasy love, not the real thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent and very true film, with a masterfully nuanced and real performance by Celia Johnson. The emotions the woman goes through, her decisions and why she makes them, all ring true. I wouldn't change a thing in the film, but I do think that viewers misread the situation if they think that the feelings between the man and the woman are the love of two soul-mates for each other, or that these two could have had a happy life together if only they had met before they'd married other people, or if only society would let them divorce their current spouses. The time-constraints of most movies (other than specifically "here's how they fell in love" movies) typically make it necessary for characters to fall in love so quickly, that the only source of love presented in movies typically is 'love at first sight' or the immediate recognition of soul-mates. But that is not the kind of emotion that is going on in this movie. To understand the emotion these two feel for each other it is important to recall one of Jane Austen's greatest insights into the sources of feelings of love: the feeling of gratitude one feels upon discovering that some worthy person of the opposite sex appears to feel esteem and love for you. What we have here are two people who, like most of us who are over 40, have gone a good many years without having sparked in the heart of some new person special feelings of regard and admiration. Thus each one is particularly ready to feel grateful and appreciative of someone who does appear to feel that way. Through their chance encounter, the man and the woman here each get the impression that the other finds them quite pleasant and admirable; and each feels such gratitude for this that the warmest feelings arise for the other. Thus the love each feels for the other doesn't spring from any deep knowledge of the other person's character or qualities or interests, it springs from a response to the other's perceived feelings. And thus, to use an analogy from sound amplifiers and microphones, an emotional feedback loop comes into play, where the emotion expressed by one instigates a stronger emotion in the other, which in turn instigates a stronger emotion, etc. Jane Austen explores this dynamic in Pride &amp; Prejudice, chapters 6, 44, and 46, where her characters note that there is "so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment," and how it is Elizabeth's feelings of gratitude for Darcy's admiration of her that leads to Elizabeth's love for Darcy, and how the 'love at first sight' alternative was a much more untrustworthy basis for feeling love, because that was how her love for the rake Wickham developed. Austen also explores this in Northanger Abbey, ch. 30, where Henry Tilney's love for the heroine Catherine is founded on no quality of hers, but springs from his gratitude for her love for him. Thus I agree with commenter "roghache" (March, 2006), about Laura's husband Fred, and who said that if the man and woman here did leave their spouses and marry, very soon their marriage would look like the woman's current marriage with her husband (I have more comments on Fred in the "did her husband know she was carrying on" message board). There is simply no good reason to think that the doctor is so much different a man than her current husband. Indeed, there is good reason to think he is worse: for the doctor is a married man who takes the initiative to cheat on his wife and to persuade a married mother of young children to cheat on her husband and risk her children's happiness. The doctor's friend, who surprises them in the flat, quite properly feels contempt for the doctor (in the one scene in the film that gives us information that Celia's character did not have) (I have more comments on this in the "what if Stephen hadn't returned" message board). Were Celia Johnson's character not the woman who was the object of the doctor's affection, but instead a woman looking on as he directed his attentions to one of her friends, I think she would see quite quickly that he is not an admirable man. Lastly, I note that it is not 'society' that is keeping these two from marrying, it is the commitments they have made in the past, by which they obtained spouses, children, and places in society that they obviously value, that hold them back. There is no more reason why 'society' ought to be reformed so as to allow them to end those commitments and yet keep their reputations for honor, than for 'society' to be reformed so as to allow them to stop making payments on their mortgages yet keep their houses, if they are tired of the jobs they have to do in order to get the money to pay the mortgages. Dramatists and filmmakers too often treat sexual and family commitments with a level of unimportance that perhaps reflects their own desire that such commitments not be very binding in their own lives. If, however, the commitments in question were commitments by film producers to pay contractually- promised fees and royalties to writers and directors, I think our movies would be filled with expressions of the high inviolability and importance of keeping promises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Doomed Love Affair, Beautifully Restored With a Soaring Johnson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before he made his grand widescreen epics, master director David Lean made small, intimate films about normal people who find themselves outside of their comfort zones. His most famous of these early works - and arguably the gold standard by which all ill-fated love stories are compared - is this 86-minute treasure from 1946. It is the rather simple story of a chance meeting between housewife Laura Jesson and Dr. Alec Harvey in the refreshment room of a suburban London train station. The plot starts innocently enough when Alec removes some smut from Laura's eye, but then they inevitable become drawn to each other and fall in love.Lean employs a flashback technique to tell the story (penned by Noel Coward along with Lean and Anthony Havelock-Allan) and actually begins with the quiet farewell between Laura and Alec. From there, Laura recalls the entire story, narrating in a breathless and at times frantic voice-over. Watching the events unfold in her memory and listening to her narration, we are drawn completely into her mind as Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto floods the soundtrack. Despite their respective marital statuses, the two begin to fall in love and soon enough, romance and even lust (at least in typically stiff upper-lip British form) have shown up on the scene. After a while, they start to meet on a very regular basis and though both know it will never work, they still spend time together.Leave it to Lean to transcend the tendency to produce a predictably romantic and masochistic wallow and come up with a more complex set of conflicting emotions. Probably because Laura's narration is so honest and involving, this movie resonates far more than a more Baroque "chick flick" like Irving Rapper's "Now, Voyager" or Jean Negulesco's "Humoresque". Granite-jawed Trevor Howard portrays Alec with sympathy and unapologetic yearning, but it's Celia Johnson who galvanizes the film with a multi-layered performance as she makes Laura's desperation palpable but never off-putting. With her saucer eyes and emotionally pinched demeanor, she truly brings a genuine soul to this vulnerable, emotionally closeted woman who is unable to come to terms with her unconsummated affair. Providing just the right amount of comic relief are Joyce Carey as the haughty refreshment room hostess and Stanley Holloway (well before his ne'er-do-well Alfred Doolittle in "My Fair Lady") as the persistent train station attendant who constantly flirts with her.Criterion has once again done a superb job in bringing this movie to life as the pristine print really brings out Robert Krasker's crisp cinematography. Film historian Bruce Eder provides informative audio commentary on an alternate track and goes in-depth into not only the production but also the careers of Lean, Coward and all the actors with speaking parts. Beyond that, there is the original trailer and an interesting demonstration of the restoration process. If you have seen Claude Lelouch's "A Man and a Woman" (with Anouk Aimée and Jean-Louis Trintignant) or Ulu Grosbard's "Falling in Love" (with Robert DeNiro and Meryl Streep) or Richard Linklater's "Before Sunrise" (with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy) or Sofia Coppola's "Lost in Translation" (with Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson)....you owe yourself to see the original inspiration.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been already many well written reviews of this classic film. And yes, it is a classic! I guess I just wish that viewers that have no appreciation of exceptional films would stick to watching crappy in-your-face garbage that currently masquerades as films and not bother trashing great films such as this. While I'm not at all offended by eroticism in films, it is an incredible change of pace to see love portrayed in such a subtle and gentle way. And depending on your sensibilities, you can see it as romantic in terms of Laura's short tortured relationship with the dashing Alex or her deep friendship with somewhat dull husband, Fred. The story wonderfully explores the idea that sometimes it is easier to feel close and understood by someone you meet by chance as opposed to those who are close to us. People may not like the truism, but it's human nature. It may be trite to describe this wonderful as poignant, but it is the perfect adjective. Don't miss this film if you actually appreciate exceptional storytelling.</fullReview>

Brief Encounter is not only a classic, but a smart, modern, unabashedly romantic and extremely intelligent film. The script by Noel Coward is peerless, but then the elegant and empathetic touch of David Lean brings it all home. The premise is an illicit love affair between a married woman and a married doctor. And to me, for all of the lovely Celia Johnson's protestations, there is no way you can say no to Trevor Howard. No way. You might as well surrender without the slightest and, if or but.

		<fullReview>Brief Encounter is the story of a forbidden romance, an affair between a married woman and a man who meet at a train station. Their relationship is expressed in detail from the female character's conscious dialog reflecting on the affair, the lovesick girlish way she behaves around the young man (and before meeting him), and in speaking lies to her husband and friends in an attempt to hide the affair. This is an excellent observational film, and it really gets into the psychology of the characters who have the affair. The romance is so forbidden and sweet that it feels like the romance should go on and they should be together, but morals prevail and the couple soon learns that they must part ways. And they do part, in the most memorable fashion, with wonderful pacing that makes one think that they will, indeed, rush back into each other's arms.Brief Encounter is a wonderful English film which romanticized the train station. A good observation of characters and a detailed look at social history and marriage during the 1940s, Brief Encounter is to be enjoyed and admired as much as it is to be looked at from a historical and moral standpoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many film buffs, I am often surprised when a film director wins the "Best Director" award at the Oscars or some other ceremony and yet the film itself is denied "Best Picture". Re-watching "Brief Encounter" recently helped me to understand how such a thing might be possible. There is no doubt that it is a superbly directed film and that David Lean's "Best Director" Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Nevertheless, I have never been convinced by the arguments of those who would claim the film as a great classic of the British cinema.This was Lean's fourth film, and like his first three ("In Which We Serve", "This Happy Breed" and "Blithe Spirit") was based upon a work by Noël Coward, who adapted the screenplay from his one-act play "Still Life". It tells the story of the relationship (the "brief encounter" of the title) between Laura Jesson, a middle-class housewife, and Alec Harvey, a doctor. The two meet at a railway station while she is returning from a shopping excursion to a nearby town, and arrange to meet again. They quickly become friends and then fall in love. Although their relationship is never consummated (the censors were insistent on this point), they come to care deeply for one another and make plans for a life together. Both, however, are married with two children, and although divorce was legally possible in the Britain of the forties, it was very much frowned upon by social convention. The story is narrated by Laura in the first person, imagining that she is confessing her affair to her husband Fred.Many people assume that the action takes place in Home Counties suburbia, and certainly the accents (either Received Pronunciation or Cockney) are suggestive of south-east England. Only one character, a policeman who appears briefly, has a northern accent. Other factors, however, do suggest a northern location, notably Alec's reference to coal mines in the vicinity, the initials LMS (London, Midland and Scottish Railway) on the railway carriages and the rugged scenery in the countryside scenes. Finally, the matter is settled when we see references to cities such as Leeds, Bradford and Lancaster on the destination boards on the station platform. (These scenes were actually shot at Carnforth station in Lancashire).The whole of Coward's play is set in the station refreshment room. Although Lean does open the film up by introducing other settings, such as Laura's home or a cinema, many of the key scenes still take place at the station, and it is in these scenes that Lean shows his gifts as a director to their best advantage. The black-and-white photography of the steam trains is particularly striking and takes on a symbolic quality; constantly in motion, rapidly arriving and departing, they seem to stand for the rapidity of change in human affairs, and in particular the rapidity with which the romance of Laura and Alec develops and then come to an end. These scenes have become even more evocative ever since the steam locomotive ceased to be an everyday means of transport and became a potent symbol of nostalgia."Brief Encounter " may have been beautifully photographed, but I was less enthusiastic about either the writing or the acting, both of which are characterised by a deadening emotional reticence which does not sit well with either Lean's dramatic direction or the use on the soundtrack of that supremely romantic piece of music, Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2. This is supposed to be the story of an all-consuming, albeit unconsummated, passion, but one would not think so to judge from Coward's script. Coward's greatest gift as a writer was his mordant wit, which he could put to good use in his comedies, but his attempts to write serious drama could often seem artificial and mannered, the sort of drawing-room theatre which in the next decade was to be so angrily rejected by the Angry Young Men.Nor would one think so from the well-mannered gentility with which Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard mouth their lines. For all their talk of love and desire, I was never convinced that either of them really felt the emotions they were talking about. Even during her lifetime Johnson was regarded as something of a national treasure by an older generation of film-lovers, but I always found her cut-glass accent grating, an early case of Irritating Vowel Syndrome. In this film she sounds more like an aristocrat than any Lancashire housewife (or even London housewife) I have ever heard.We never see Mrs Harvey, so never learn why Alec was dissatisfied with his existing marriage, but in Laura's case we are supposed to infer that she finds Fred dull, although he is caring and affectionate. Unfortunately, Alec, although idealistic, does not come across as being any more exciting than Cyril Raymond's Fred. Trevor Howard never suggests that if Laura were to leave her husband for him she would be doing any more than exchanging one stolid bourgeois suburbanite for another. (It does not help that, although Howard was only 32 at the time, he looked considerably older). Howard was to give some great performances in films like "The Third Man", but this is not one of them.One criticism made of the film is that it is "dated", by which is normally meant that attitudes towards sex have changed since the forties. It is certainly true that divorce does not carry the stigma that it did seventy years ago, but there is still a widely held view that adultery is immoral and many modern viewers will still sympathise with Laura and Alec's decision to put their families and their marriages before their love for one another. The problem is that neither Coward, Johnson nor Howard are able to persuade us that this decision really involved any great sacrifice. Lean does his best, but steam trains and Rachmaninoff can only take you so far. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great actors, great direction, a gem of a romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lean, one of the greatest British film directors, made "Brief Encounter" (1945) long before he became world famous for celebrated epics like "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), "Doctor Zhivago" (1965) or "The Bridge on the River Kwai" (1957). Does the mastery of these later works show in this early flic already? You bet! And what's even more impressive is that a romance as we experience it here is far removed from Lean's later works, and it nevertheless succeeds in its own right. Sure, in comparison to the later monumental films "Brief Encounter" might look like a small, rather unimpressive black and white affair at first glance - well, at least that's the impression you might have before you've actually seen it. To put the record straight: "Brief Encounter" is a gem, a true classic. Despite the plot appears to be based on a cliché taken from a dime novel. For dealing with a fleeting relationship against all norms has rarely been shown in such a deeply moving way that can tackle walking the fine line between tear-jerking sentimentality and heartfelt sincerity. Time and characters might be dated, the film's impact clearly is not.The tale of "Brief Encounter" is simple: A middle aged housewife who is securely married with children makes the acquaintance of a doctor, whose situation isn't much different. It's perfectly clear from the beginning that whatever might develop between these two cannot succeed under the restraints of the society they're living in. So how can the liaison continue? Where can it lead? Well, to a brilliant psychological study and a breathtaking film. David Lean explores this forbidden relationship in such a suspenseful and gripping way that his inventive cinematography succeeds in making one feel dizzy when reality finally begins to tilt... Of course it's primarily David Lean who knows how to tell a story (see e.g. also his Dickens adaptations "Oliver Twist" or "Great Expectations"), but the two leads, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, play so well off each other that they completely make the film their own. And by the way: It's refreshing to see someone like Celia Johnson in the lead, an actress that lacks the otherwise common great looks for a change and thus alongside her talent helps to make the film work. High recommendation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an ordinary journey to the city</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie directed in 1945 by David Lean tells the story of a woman called Laura Jesson (starring Celia Johnson) who is apparently happily married to a man ? Fred Jesson ? and has with him a son and a daughter. The Jesson family lives in a small village near a larger town called Milford. As a housewife she goes off to this town every Thursday in order to buy some house staff and also goes to the cinema and has lunch at a restaurant. By hazard, one of the days when she is waiting for the train back to the village where she lives she encounters a doctor called Alec Harvey who helps her get a speck of dust from within her eye. Since then they will be tangled into crazy love story which could be characterized as gradual but really quick. The movie starts in media res since we are presented at the couple of new lovers in the bar of the railway station. After that, it is told that the man is leaving to Africa and then there is a very sad, short and emotionless though deep farewell. The uses of the camera are really helpful in order to watch the development of the story. Besides, the spectator is the one who knows almost everything within the plot since even Laura's feelings, emotions and thoughts are told using a very important tool in cinema, I mean the voice-over. Furthermore, we are told every step of the love relationship and the family daily life, the lies Laura ends up telling to her husband. The whole story is told because the woman sits on the sofa after one of her weekly journeys from Milford and is willing to tell her husband everything that has happened to her from the moment when she meets Doctor Alec for the first time. We are conducted to the images by means of some ambiance music Laura herself turns on at her sitting room. This same music returns the woman to reality and puts us back to the story of the two lovers and back to reality again. This very music also marks the end of the movie and is a very important element in the film. The characters in the story do not evolve a lot except for both lovers; Laura and Alec are turned into very introspective characters who are even able to lie to the people they love the most and willing to hide from everybody else. Nevertheless, Laura seems more conscious of the dangers of such love story while Doctor Alec is less prudent. On the other hand, Laura's husband ? Fred ? is a flat character who shows a tremendous love and a great and admirable respect for his wife and his children. The spectator may find that this one of the best love-sad stories ever told or seen on a film since, from my point of view, it gather of the elements for it those mainly being a married woman in what turns to be a happy but dull and monotonous marriage who finds a man who silently comes to be very important in her life, even crucial and a sad ending with what I interpreted as a suicide attempt. In the story the feelings of the spectator move from fear, to joy and to sadness at it happens with Laura's own character and we become a silent witness of the whole story since we know that the woman is cheating on her husband but we cannot tell anybody. I highly recommend that you watch this movie since it is very interesting to know the inner feelings of the main character and it is something that could happen to anyone in real life. Besides, the mechanisms are very well used and it seems a very real story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this David Lean version of BRIEF ENCOUNTER to be a simply enchanting and entrancing film. Part of the enjoyment was the style of writing and acting that is purposely theatrical in order for the 1940s British subject matter to be handled in the fairly explicit way that it was. For those who 'don't get it' or find it boring well what can those who do 'get it' say? How sad perhaps that something so lovely and so humane and so complex in its dialogue and beautifully formal in its British tone cannot be enjoyed by a few who demand ..DEMAND.. it suit them in 2009. Hilarious! Maybe the multiplex mind thought BRIEF ENCOUNTER was about colliding underpants, which just might be right for them. CLASH OF THE TIGHT'UNS anyone? Maybe a remake with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore called HERE/NOW might be the right update. This gloriously stuffy and furtive Noel Coward play is transformed in this film to be the black and white smoky British damp equivalent of HUMORESQUE or NOW VOYAGER.. and if you love those films (so easy!) you will love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The struggle between love and feelings of guilt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A love story between a man and woman married may seem a dash very common, but David Lean in this movie transforms it into a masterpiece, in which shows the difficulties of a loving relationship extra matrimonial in the 1940 in England. The love that profess comes into conflict with feelings of guilt and awareness of social problems that should face in the framework of a puritanical society that condemns the divorce. What a principle must generate happiness, ending brought pain and anxiety because of the tension that bear the protagonists. Are scenes highlighted the "Laura" wandering aimlessly around the city, the interruption of the farewell final and the departure of Laura to the platform with Purpose suicidal. The film has a magnificent photography of Robert Krasker showing cold environments and devastated around the station. The script is a frame simple full of nuances, suggestions and insinuations. The scene that bears the signature of the entire film is in the "Alec" puts his hand on the shoulder of "Laura". Who view the film what means.. It is a magnificent film of David Lean</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding 1945 Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film held my interest throughout the entire film because it deals with two people who are both married with children and they meet in a train station. Laura Jesson, (Celia Johnson) and Dr. Alex Harvey, (Trevor Howard) are the couple who meet every Thursday afternoon and begin to fall in love simply because Laura Jesson gets some dirt in her eye on a train station and Dr. Alex is able to help her out and looks into her large eyes and falls madly in love. These two actors gave an outstanding performance and especially Celia Johnson who shows how her guilt of being in love with a married man begins to haunt her and upset her entire life. This is a very down to earth film which will effect anyone who has had the same experience and has been in the same situation in life. The ending of this picture is very interesting and it all turned out fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Engaging drama.Romantic dramas are second only to horror movies in terms of formulaic plot and lack of originality. Brief Encounter is reasonably original, especially for its time, in that both the man and woman in the relationship are married, and not to each other.The movie starts well, showing how they first meet, how they start to see more of each other, some amusing incidents along the way, and how they fall in love. But they're married, so you know this can't be a simple relationship. You think all along: can this have a happy ending, and what is a happy ending in this context? Do you even approve of the relationship?All this told with some wonderful old English settings, 1940s sensibilities and charm.Unfortunately, after this intriguing dilemma, the movie then drifts for a period and then we have a conclusion that is a damp squib. Writer Noel Coward and director David Lean pull their punches and the ending feels like a cop-out. Very disappointing, especially after all that went before it.Good performances by Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson in the lead roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Glimpse at the Forbidden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie relies on a complicated situation between two married people. Both are in a boring relationship and they find emotion for lives outside of their marriage the. I've chosen this title because the leading actor and actress share few moments and, despite knowing their love is wrong, they continue loving each other. Thus, the relationship which is established between both of them is forbidden. The director of this film is Sir David Lean. He made a lot of famous and hugely successful films. For example:Great Expectations or Oliver Twist, and many more. However, Brief Encounter isn't his best film. Although I don't like this movie, it has been adapted to the theater, opera and, even, to the radio. Nevertheless, there are a few details which I like. One of them is the set. I think the director didn't resort to unreal sets. Moreover, this movie has a great moral content. The woman doesn't want to hurt her husband but she loves the doctor; at the same time she wants to get old together with her husband but she feels alive with her lover.In general, I can say that I didn't like this movie a lot. If you are bored and you don't have anything more interesting to do or see, you could see it. I think there are more interesting and famous film to see. For instance, Psycho, Titanic, Jaws, etc. Even David Lean has directed much more interesting and amazingly entertaining movies. In conclusion, it's excruciatingly tedious. Maybe I don't like this movie because of the leading actress indecision. But, as I've said, if you want to see something this movie could be OK. Glenda Bello Burguet</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brief Encounter is a film from the director David Lean released in 1945. The production is starred by Cecilia Johnson ( Laura) and Trevor Howard (Alec) and it is an adaptation of a play written by Noël Coward (Still Life) The film itself has also been adapted later for theatre plays, opera and radio programmes, receiving always positive critics. The movie is set in a train station from Lancashire and some of the kernel events in the story are developed in that particular place. The soundtrack is repeated in almost the whole film and it is the Piano Concerto No. 2, composed by Sergei Rachmaninoff. The film tells the story of Laura Jesson and Alec Harvey, both married , who accidentally meet in a train station and quickly fall in love. The film presents then, their love story in a dramatic way, because, as mentioned before, both are married. Love, cheating and moral values are some of the main themes that this production explores and, in my opinion, it is the duty of the spectator to condemn or support the couple, to judge whether they are acting wrong or just following the instincts of two people in love. However, the film also presents some mysteries that the spectators must find out by their own. There are also some technical aspects which are important to mention in this story. First of all, it is essential to highlight the "role" of the voice over, which is as important as any of the characters. Thanks to this voice, the spectator knows what is happening during the whole story and it makes impossible then, to miss the main events in the film. Secondly, the story ends in the same moment that it starts but, almost the rest of the film is a flashback from Laura's mind, which permits also to see what the voice over tells. There is also a fictitious flashforward, again from Laura's perspective, when she imagines how would be her future life with Alec. Finally, there are also some fadings (not complete) which make way to other subsequent scenes ( in time). Places are also important: the train station plays a crucial role in this story and there are specific spaces within the station which are recurrent as the cafeteria, the tunnel for going from one platform to the other... The clocks in the station are also repeated motifs as they are the indicators and limits of the couple: they indicate they time left. In my opinion, the film is good in the sense that leaves the spectator thinking for possible solutions to those mysteries previously mentioned. However, I did not enjoy very much Laura's character, as she transmit a continuous feeling of anxiety and also that it is not very clear the director's point of view or the message he wants to express. In spite of these minute details, I liked the film, and I think that the plot is also innovative and original and got to attract me and that is something I appreciate while watching a film.

		<fullReview>Directed by David Lean,Brief Encounter is a poignant and well acted love story set just after the Second World War.Based on a play called Still Life by Noel Coward(who is one of the films producers)and shot in black and white this transports the viewer back to a bygone era. It tells the story of British housewife Laura Jesson(Celia Johnson)who gets some grit in her eye from a passing steam train at a train station which is removed by Dr Alec Harvey(Trevor Howard).The two think nothing more of their encounter until the following week when they run into each other again.They become friends and meet up on Thursday's,they come to realise that they are falling in love and the rest of the film is really about how they cope with this realisation and looks at Laura's guilt about betraying her loving husband Fred Jesson(Cyril Raymond). Possibly the greatest romantic film of all time with Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto number 2 as the films well known score.In this film a shared smile or look are more moving and romantic than a kiss or a hug with superb performances especially from Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard also a small appearance by Stanley Holloway as a station guard this is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lean's final collaboration with Noel Coward stands head and shoulders above his previous efforts. It is also one of the greatest achievements in British cinema of the 1940s, which is saying something.Firstly, this is quite simply a brilliant piece of writing from Coward. Much has been made of how daring it was in its acceptance of an extra-marital affair, but perhaps the real breakthrough was the frankness and realism with which it dealt with the universal experiences of love and heartbreak. It's beautifully simple and perfectly constructed. The idea of opening with the end of the affair, when we the audience know nothing about what has gone on, gives the final scenes such greater resonance when they come round again. The use of language is also inspired. Take for example Laura's daydream on the train, as she imagines dancing and dining with Alec in various exotic locations. As reality sets in again her monologue trails off into flat, everyday sounding words, taking us from the Caribbean to Ketchworth in a single sentence.All through the picture Lean's direction matches pace with the screenplay. I've mentioned in other comments how much Lean has in common with Hitchcock, even though they made very different films. Brief Encounter shows the kind of thing Hitchcock could have turned out had he wanted to make a romantic drama. The use of jarring sound effects, emotional close-ups and voice-overs to convey the intense psychological states is perfectly suited to this kind of thing. More than once Hitchcock used whistling trains to mimic a nightmarish scream. Lean uses them to symbolise the soaring emotions of his protagonists.This is a wonderfully rhythmic picture, right from the start, with the two trains perfectly timed to fly past at the beginning and end of the opening credits. The Rachmaninov piano concerto is ideal ? just like Coward's play it runs the gamut of emotional tones, and there is enough in there to score a whole picture.The decision to return to black and white after the uninspired use of Technicolor in This Happy Breed and Blithe Spirit was an essential one. From start to finish the film is packed with atmosphere, with drifting smoke, light and shadow. The tone would simply be unachievable were in not in monochrome.As in The Happy Breed, Celia Johnson gives an amazing performance. Her delivery and her emoting are so natural and believable she helps prevent the film getting bogged down in staginess or melodrama.For those that like to think of directorial careers in that way, this could be considered David Lean's graduation picture. It's also his masterpiece (yes, I'd say it's better than Lawrence of Arabia). Brief Encounter is a timeless and monumental piece of film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lean's great masterpiece has slipped in and out of fashion over the years and since it deals with so much that is mundane and is so terribly, terribly British it was inevitable that it would be lampooned mercilessly. Yet few films have struck the kind of emotional chord with audiences as this one has. Although it deals with a milieu that is regimentally insular and with characters whose very ordinariness strikes you as somewhat peculiar, it has a universal appeal. Who isn't susceptible to a chance encounter with someone who, perhaps only for an instant, appears more handsome, more exciting than anyone or anything else in our lives. Innocence isn't an excuse and feelings are everything.Laura Jesson's idyll with the handsome doctor she meets on a station platform is hopelessly romantic because it is so innocent and so inconsequential. What Laura and Alec feel for each other transcends the drabness of their lives and their surroundings and creates possibilities that in the everyday we can only dream of. Of course, one reading is that of gay wish-fulfillment; the impossibility of the central conceit and as Laura says 'the shame of the whole thing, the deceit, the fear', something Coward would have been well aware of as a gay man in the 1940's, dreaming of the perfect partner outside of the constraints of society. It's only one reading, naturally but it can't explain the film's universal popularity. Love, not sex, has no boundaries.It's magnificently made. Lean uses only a few sets and locations. It's as if Laura and Alec are caged in by their surroundings and their emotions and can never escape the shabby tea-rooms and cinemas where they meet. Yet Robert Kraser's luminous black-and-white cinematography keeps adding a dimension to proceedings as if the shadows thrown up only serve to heighten the protagonist's guilt. And as Laura and Alec, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard were never better. Indeed Johnson gives one of the cinema's great performances; the simple mundane words and actions stand in complete contrast to the naked emotionality on display. If the film is heartbreaking it is Johnson who breaks your heart. Today we may feel smugly sophisticated and think of films like "Brief Encounter" as 'old-fashioned'. If we do, then the loss is ours. "Brief Encounter" may never again make the lists of time best films yet it will always remain a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll admit, watching films from the 40's can sometimes be a trial in order to mentally attempt to dismiss the melodrama, theatrics and the staid cinematography. There's a very fine reason this film endures. Even though the film IS dated, it exists in such a way that it seems quite natural. It does always amaze me when I see criticism for ambitious art work from an early medium and hear it dismissed rather coldly, as some initial reviews for "Brief Encounter" have done here on IMDb. I've had friends give a miss to "Citizen Kane" because they found it drab. Naturally, the failed to understand that just about every film convention that they are so used to being exposed to 60 years on darn-near originated in that film!Similarly, in "Brief Encounter" the reflections of post war English society in the behavior of the characters are incredibly genuine. This in of itself is a departure from typical film-making of that era. Hell, it's still atypical to loads of Hollywood films. The glamour in this film is almost nonexistent except when it's deserved in the fantasy sequences, so I can wholly accept the players in this story as very true to life mid-20th century. The very fact alone that the characters have visible physical flaws illustrates the ordinariness of the situation in its place and time. I love it for that. I don't like voice over, but I respect the need for it in a film such as this.If you can't relate or accept the historic nuances of this engaging movie then I'd suggest you're probably unable to relate to art outside of your own prejudices, and I'd recommend giving this film a pass. However, if you're willing to view numerous contexts within this movie, then you'll be richly rewarded.</fullReview>

It is both precise and emotional; refined, sophisticated and at same time painfully honest. It zooms some of the most hidden and unspoken depths of human soul. Who can explain what turns a plain, prosaic story about two prosaic people in real drama of love, passion, betrayal and sacrifice? The outline is excessively simple: a man and a woman fall in a forbidden love.Plain and rough canvas, but what a brilliant director's work and actor's play. This classic English piece deserves its place between the greatest movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AS film review.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The meeting of a stranger at a railway station, a woman becomes entangled and falls in love whilst being tempted to cheat on her husband. This could be a storyline for a film written in modern times, although Brief Encounter is set in 1945, not sporting flashy lighting, effects or glamorous costly film locations, just a select few rather unromantic settings. But with all this combined it made for a nice change from the sexualised love affairs portrayed and consumed in present times.Celia Johnston plays Laura, a married middle class woman who leads a repressed yet comfortable life. A chance meeting as she is going about her weekly shopping trip leads her to fall in love with Dc. Alec Harvey, played by Trevor Howard; this sparks a secret love affair which runs over a 7 week period.Through Laura narrating the film she conveys a personal, yet biased viewpoint to the audience. Allowing us to sympathise and identify with her character, delving into the emotional depths of her mind of a love lost forever.The lack of sexual activities between the couple makes for a refreshing change, modern directors should certainly take a leaf out of this films book. David Lean has managed to convey love's meaning without the need for bedroom scenes, replacing this with other passions the characters possess, such as dining out or visiting the cinema.The simplicity of the plot conveys metaphorical meaning regarding the struggle that both women and men were going through during war time, having to conform to their given social classes whilst longing for freedom.Maintaining appearances, even in front of friends, played a major role in the lives of those living in the 1940's. Brief Encounter presents that idea in a sympathetic light, highlighting the pain caused from these given expectations.The audience are moved by Laura's farewell, where Alec bids her goodbye by touching her shoulder, this contact makes for a far more explosive and heart wrenching scene than many a passionate kiss in modern films can provide.Laura choosing to stay with her husband again allows audiences to identify with her character; she has chosen this path in favour of moral and family values, maintaining both the sanctity of marriage and her reputation reflected by her social class. The story is conveyed through a daydream, a reminiscent Laura returns to her predictable life once more having lived out a fantasy woman of the time could only dream of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing film; that's all I have to say. Brief encounter is a study of human behaviour showing convincingly how trivialities can change our lives.One woman who thought she was happily married one man who was under that illusion too, a meeting in complete chance and how it forever changed them. The hesitation to express their feelings followed by an equally overwhelming hesitation to let go. An affair very brief, doomed from the start but this brief doomed affair was the highlight of the lives on two very ordinary people.To the above add the fact that the ill fated lovers (who never were) never even had the chance to say goodbye out of fear of their affair being realised, only made their torture as well as the audience's even greater.A note should be made of how societies and attitudes change. I cannot help noticing how the protagonists of this story although they are involved in an illicit affair they maintain their dignity and class at all times. If that were the case in today's England chances are these two would take a bottle of vodka get drunk, have sex only to regret it the day after; a Bridget Jones kind of story in other words. It seems people in the UK today have inability to express their emotions in the absence of substances a condition that worsens all the time.Brief Encounter is a very simple film but far from plain. I wish film were made like this today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple of years ago I would rather have stuck pins in my eyes than watch a black &amp; white movie. That all changed as soon as I was encouraged to watch this wonderful film.Yes it's dated and portrays the English as being terribly repressed, yet it manages to move me to tears every time I watch it. Attitudes have changed enormously in the 60 years since Brief Encounter was made and therefore you have to put yourself into the mindset of Britain in the 1940's and not judge the characters as being cold and formal. It was just not the done thing to have an affair back then - how times change!! Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard are perfectly cast as the strangers who fall in love after a chance meeting in a station tearoom. Their affair is tame and innocent by modern standards, yet at no time do you doubt their true and passionate love for one another.This is without doubt my favourite film of all time and I could watch it every day and not tire of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I liked the film and the performances of Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, what a treat it might have been if Noel Coward and Gertrude Lawrence had done this film. To have their performances for posterity.Brief Encounter was an expanded version of a small one act play that takes place entirely within a railroad station. Two middle-aged people meet quite by chance in a railway station, he a doctor, she a homemaker and without either intending it, fall in love.Because the whole thing is narrated in flashback from Celia Johnson's point of view we get a whole lot more of her in it. But Trevor Howard does get his innings in. My favorite scene in the film is how he describes his wish to go to Africa and teach preventive medicine for various tropical ailments. His voice filled with idealism and I think it's right then and there that Celia falls for him. You can see it in her reactions shots.We don't see Trevor's wife. My guess is that she's not terribly supportive. We do see Celia's husband, a nice man, kind, but terribly dull. My favorite of the supporting performances is Valentine Dyall who plays Howard's friend who's a real creep, but allows his apartment to be used for their trysts.Brief Encounter made both the leads international stars. Celia got an Oscar nomination for 1946 which was when Brief Encounter made it to American cinema, but lost to Olivia DeHavilland. Laurence Olivier's Henry V was also making its American debut that year which was why he was up as well in the male player category.As good as the leads are, and as good as the film David Lean directed is, Noel Coward wrote this for himself and Gertrude Lawrence and what a treat it would have been to see them.</fullReview>

Told in the first person, of Laura Jesson(Celia Johnson), a country housewife burdened with the boredom of the security of her husband(Cyril Raymond)and family. Laura goes on weekly shopping trips and a movie matinée. An accidental meeting with Dr. Alec Harvey(Trevor Howard)at a railway station turns a casual relationship into a rapid developing love affair. Albeit brief and bittersweet these secret encounters in WWII England is intensely romantic.Wide-eyed Johnson is excellent as a woman knowing she is wrong, but letting her heart's desires rule her actions. Howard is cool and in control. Also in the cast: Stanley Holloway, Joyce Carey and Marjorie Mars. BRIEF ENCOUNTER is filmed in glorious black &amp; white and dares your heart to get involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Brief for this Memorable Encounter ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>British actress Celia Johnson lost the Oscar for best actress in this wonderful film to Olivia De Havilland for "To Each His Own." Yet, the remarkable Miss Johnson was able to garner the N.Y.C. film critics award for her amazing performance as a British housewife, who accidentally meets a man and in a short time, they both have a memorable romance.The wonderful Trevor Howard was that man. The two were absolutely ideal together on the screen. The love they found and shared so briefly was memorably drawn into our minds by the strengths of their respective performances.Remember their parting scene? Remember when it appeared that Johnson would commit suicide? Remember, when she returns to her husband how he says, "You came back to me!" While the film may have been too talky as Johnson relates the encounter, it is a memorable one. Viewed by gossips, friends and colleagues by mistake, this was certainly a memorable film celebrating 2 top talents. It's as if the affair were ill-fated with Johnson and Howard meeting up with people they knew along the way as well as when Johnson returns home to find that her son has been hit by a car. Were these 2 people essentially bored with life, their spouses or with their intimate selves? The film deftly brings out that this could happen to any of us.A wonderful film especially for romantics of any age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I discover this film as a refreshing view of our every day world. It seemed to me so real and so currently true. Of course, trains, pubs, clothes are from another time but feelings are still vivid. The whole film is about love, which is great and for people who have already been, some beautiful views of Regents Park in London make the film even more true. I liked also the very moral side of the end, but one cannot say if it is a happy or an unhappy end. One could think again that such an end could not be the choice made today. I do not think so ; I know people that have lived exactly the same situation and decided to privilege their family over themselves. Actors are great too and you are never bored by the fact that only two main characters are in play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unaffected by modern standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from just being a superb film, there's a reason that I find watching these old movies so much more enjoyable than their modern counterparts - their intellectual honesty.Could you imagine Brief Encounter re-made today, there would have to be an overt social message that would constantly get in the way of the story, ultimately destroying the movie.Alec would have to be a member of a minority, or Laura would have AIDS (and Alec would of course love her anyway), or Laura would be killed with a firearm (gun control debate), and die because she didn't have health insurance and had to go onto a hospital waiting list (healthcare debate), and so on and so forth.It portrays an England of a different and wonderful era, with smokey railway stations, leafy lanes, and picturesque cottages, it makes you want to step into the screen and immerse yourself in such a pleasant, idyllic version of 1945 life.Watching the original is like a breath of fresh air, a UK version of the equally stunning (and intellectually honest) "Now, Voyager" - perhaps Bette Davis' best ever movie.If I were ever stranded on a desert island, these 2 films would both be on my list - you can watch them over, and over, and over again - they never get old, they never cease to involve you, they never cease to deliver a punch to your emotions, you always find yourself murmuring "wow....." as the credits roll.Brief Encounter is simply timeless and magnificent, it will live on to ensnare many future generations in its magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Power of Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genius of Noel Coward is combining fluent dialogue with a complete acknowledgement of the characters and their feelings: he takes them seriously. The witty remarks are there to uncover a deeper, thoroughly unwitty truth. He shows us the morals, but never becomes a moralist.In this beautifully crafted script, there is no wit. The woman in the bar at the train station and her admirer have the snappy dialogue to juxtapose the tender, almost sentimental conversations of the heroine and her hero. But they mirror the troubled love of Laura and Alec: they can have a relationship starting any minute if they only would acknowledge their love. Alec and Laura utter their love, but can't have a relationship: there is simply too much at stake.Anyone who has been in love, fiercely, relentlessly, knows what Laura and Alec are going through. Their falling in love is not the bored housewife with the flirty doctor. It's finding something you didn't know were looking for, and as you find it you don't understand how you ever could do without it. They don't fall in love because they are unhappy in their present lives. They fall in love because they understand each other perfectly, and more important, feel understood by the other person. It is beautiful irony that the aspects of their personalities that make it impossible to continue the affair are the ones that they appreciate the most. The fact that Laura is so haunted by the affair is why Alec loves her. The gallantry of leaving for Africa to give them both their freedom back, is why Laura is so attracted to Alec. For modern audiences the thought might rise: just leave both your spouses and get on with it. But their moral standard, not to throw away something good for something better, not making five or six people unhappy for your own careless happiness, is something to strive for, even now.The fact that their affair is presented as something that imprisons them instead of a liberation maybe the only moralistic point in this movie. They kiss, multiple times, and probably would have gone further had Alec's friend not returned too early.The techniques that director David Lean uses are highly symbolic but they're realistic at the same time. It keeps par with Coward dialogue, equally symbolic. As with the last lines of Laura's husband who says: you were far off in that dream, but I'm glad you came back. That sentence sums up the movie, the affair, the relationship with her husband. But for him it's something he says to comfort his wife. Love is never easy, but as hard as it's presented here with such a tender pen, makes you realise why it's the most important thing in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving and Warm Showcase of a Process of Falling In Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of David Lean's Brief Encounter as a love story is its unprecedented and natural showcase of the process by which Celia Johnson actually falls in love with Trevor Howard. And it fits her character so deeply, as she is the critical type, an unassumingly feminine vessel of healing and servility, on whose shoulder you want to rest your head. She is a suburban English housewife who tells her story in voice over in the first person while at home with her husband, imagining that she is coming clean about her affair to him. The story begins as she hazards into the neighboring town for shopping and to the cinema for a matinée, by herself and generally content with that. Coming back from one of these weekly outings, at the station she gets a speck of gravel in her eye which is dabbed away by another passenger. Both are middle-aged, married, and have children. The other passenger, a doctor played by Trevor Howard, eventually divulges his enthusiasm for preventive medicine. Taking pleasure in each another's companionship, the two plan to meet again. They are soon worried to find their blameless and relaxed rapport swiftly growing into love.Most love stories, especially now, portray the characters' falling in love as an incident that has propelled the story. Brief Encounter, one of the few love stories to march to a different tune, is only about the spark and deepening and situational turmoil of love, laying bare the definition of it, its lack of any commonsense safety net, its random context, its power to make two people feel idealistic about themselves and ultimately about the two extreme extents of emotion in which it can leave you. And for this, a film must draw out the most personal familiarity with it all of each actor, the writer and the director. It is an emboldening task.Rachmaninoff's music emphasizes the uncontrollable feelings that put at risk the trustworthy tedium of the couple's otherwise normal romantic lives. The black-and-white cinematography, discernible by both stylishness and uncommon realism augments the story gradually with the most beautifully realistic tones and atmospheric Englishness.Brief Encounter carries Noel Coward's tenderly and sensitively in depth and perceptive script to radiant life, extracting lyricism and poetry from the most, to all appearances, ordinary doing. Trevor Howard gives a distinct performance, and Dame Commander of the British Empire Celia Johnson realizes a heartbreakingly wise, even moving portrayal of complete self- possession.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hands down, David Lean's best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is so old now that to criticize it for being dated seems redundant. It's obviously of a time and place that vanished long ago. But it's precisely those old-fashioned qualities that make it so charming when viewed today. You wish people still had the moral compass to do the right thing, not hurt others, forgo instant gratification, comport themselves with dignity, and look before leaping (into bed and elsewhere). It must seem like another planet to young viewers who never knew a world like that. This is easily the best David Lean film ? concise, intimate, romantic ? quite unlike his overblown epics (Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, A Passage to India) that are a true test of endurance despite all their fine qualities. And has there ever been a more compelling marriage of classical music and film than evidenced here with Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto? What a great way to lose yourself for 86 minutes on a rainy day. "Brief Encounter" is simply magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerfully Romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply, the most intensely romantic movie ever made. Plain Jane Celia Johnson meets dashing rogue Trevor Howard in a train station cafe. She has a loving husband but is obviously bored with a life that doesn't fill her time. He's a successful doctor having marital problems. They reach out to one another and make increasingly forward overtures at starting up an affair.With none of the melodramatic trappings that were the bread and butter of swoony romances up to that point in time, "Brief Encounter" is a love story for a more cynical, jaded audience. It exists in a world forever altered by a horrible world war, and it's a very realistic and adult portrait of adultery. We get swept up in the passion these two strangers feel for one another, but we are never allowed to forget that the indulgence of their urges could very well come at the expense of those they love. And, one also suspects that they likewise are not going to find the satisfaction they're looking for in one another; if they have the affair, how long before the forbidden glow wears off and they're faced again with the cold reality of their lives.Celia Johnson gives an astonishing performance as the heart and soul of this film. Her acting is wonderfully understated and intelligent, and she creates a wholly believable heroine. I don't understand how she didn't go on to have a more robust film career, unless her less glamorous looks held her back.My wife and I got a copy of this movie from our library, and with about half an hour to go, the DVD crapped out on us and we couldn't finish it. None of our local video stores had it, so we bought it just so we could see the end. Now we watch it regularly. So I guess that's my review in a nutshell: it's good enough to buy so that you can see how it ends.And I can never hear that Rachmaninoff theme without instantly thinking of this movie.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this film countless times yet it is always new and fresh whenever I see it. I love the images of fading English orderliness and organised life, social classes and seemly behaviour. Everybody knew their place in the society of the time and did nothing to change it. Outwardly seeming a very comfortable period with people travelling on regular comfortable trains to their regular comfortable jobs in their regular comfortable lives. An age that was dealt a mortal blow in World War One then the Coup De Grace was delivered by the next World War.A wonderfully atmospheric film full of poignant moments and vistas of Britain coming to the end of yet another hard hard war. Everything in the film looks worn and tired , rather like the heroine herself. The films high spot for me was her panic stricken run through the gloomy station hoping for one last glimpse of her lover! But its most tear-jerking moment is right at the end when her husband welcomes her back after her "daydream".Wonderful wonderful wonderful. I can never tire of watching it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief Encounter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lean, along with Akira Kurosawa, is my favorite Director of all time. When I rented this I had only seen Lean's later movies, from Summertime on. I wasn't expecting that he had all the same brilliance this early on. Brief Encounter is a respectable and intelligent drama about a serious subject matter, especially for it's time period. As far on movies with the subject of infidelity, this was much better than Unfaithful, which was good but more of a Hollywood dramatization. Brief Encounter is a realistic portrayal of the guilt behind infidelity. The script makes it realistic by making Laura paranoid in the right way. When she feels guilty and paranoid, it's irrational. She'll think that people she doesn't even know can tell she's having an affair just by looking at her. She'll refuse to make eye contact with them. And she'll come up with elaborate alibis when it's not even necessary. It's the narration that's used to hear Laura's thoughts that really sells the paranoia. And there's no huge twist. Just a woman dealing with the guilt of cheating on her husband. I really liked that the movie never gives an excuse for her actions. Her husband is a perfectly normal guy. There are no marital problems between them. He's not an idiot or a jerk. I wouldn't have wanted to see this if the movie was about her reasons for having an affair. The movie's not about her justifying her actions, just dealing with them. An absolutely astonishing early film for David Lean.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brief Encounter is a true masterpiece. It is a film that renders irrelevant the time period in which it is set, despite depicting superbly a world gone by. The casting of Johnson and Howard was a masterpiece in itself, never mind the brilliant direction and of course writing. Pace is something many films get wrong; in this one it's as exquisite as the cinematography.For me, Brief Encounter is about being trapped, imprisoned, inside a warm, comfortable and safe place that you only saw for what it is because you looked outside one day and found something new, unfamiliar, powerful and overwhelmingly beautiful.Having seen the film many times, I am moved to tears most by the tea room sequence at the beginning, because of course the significance of the tragedy unfolding is all too familiar already. Her husband welcoming her back at the end is merely the icing on a jewel of a terribly British (nay English) cake.If your heart beats, and your blood runs hot through your veins, and you still have life left in your soul and a soul in your life, treasure this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many reaons why, since I first saw this film at 16, I have always found it leaping to the forefront of my mind when someone asks me my favourite film. It is so simply and perfectly written. Such wonderful performances from everyone, even the comedic parts (that Noel Coward thought dated so badly) really just make getting a feel for life in 1946 all the easier. The different ways of reading this film are plentiful too. A gay love story made acceptable by transferring the male/male relationship to a male/female one. The images of the trains going through tunnels, the progress of Alec and Laura on the boat being stopped by a bridge etc. It's all semi-plausible and always such a pleasure to watch. This film just gets better with age, and I'm a straight 26 year old male who's other favourite film is Goodfellas. I can't reccommend it highly enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT: DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM.If reading this, you've seen the film and know the plot. I should like to comment on two lines of dialogue and perhaps address young Americans right at the start.I am an American, thirty-eight year-old man living in Maryland and to any American under the age of forty a brief note: I am tired of hearing, "what's the big deal?" Now, you have as much right to your opinions as I have mine. Still, what you may have missed was the warmth of each significant character; even Beryl pours a drink for a visibly shaken Laura. The impeccable tact of the major characters, the discretion evinced, or the unpredictable nature of timing (a major theme in "Brief Encounter")and perhaps you didn't quite soak in enough of the warmth which pervades the film. View "Brief Encounter" twenty years from now and see if your opinion has changed."It's awfully easy to lie when you're trusted implicitly" says Laura in voice-over. That line is a bodkin to the soul. ALL of us know what the line means, ALL of us know how shatteringly true the line is. And thank God the line is not spoken by Laura in a didactic way.Much has been made about the cast selection. Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard, both inspired choices, are credible as soon as we see them. They are not Madeline Carroll and Errol Flynn. Big deal. (Of course, Flynn and Carroll would have failed in these roles).Here are the boldest pieces of the film; the fact that Laura was going to willingly make love with Alec and was thwarted by the return of Alec's room mate; Laura in voice-over, "I'd like to say it was the thought of you and the children that stopped me (from jumping in front of a rapidly moving express train) but it wasn't!" and a few others. "I felt like a criminal," says Laura in voice-over. She's no criminal but we know what she means.The film, intended or not, is about Laura. Whether she's tipping the barrel organist for playing, "Let the Great Big World Keep Turning," or telling Alec "Self-respect matters and decency matters..." this is Laura's film."Thank you for coming back to me." Laura's husband ends the film. As far as tears go, that line does me in every time. Did he somehow know about Laura and Alec? Many say he did. I say, "does it really make any difference?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've never known 'bittersweet' 'til you've seen 'Brief Encounter'...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't very much to the story of BRIEF ENCOUNTER--two strangers, with their own families and lives, meet from two different walks of life. Over the course of a few Thursdays, Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) meet by accident, become friends, and fall deeply, desperately in love. Their encounter, however, is brief for a reason--when apart, they can't wait to be together again; but when together, they (especially Laura) are wracked with guilt at betraying their respective spouses. The tale is told through Laura's eyes, and most of the film shows the lovers as they struggle to deal with the guilt brought about by betrayal, mixed with the heady rush of true, deep love.That's all there is to the tale--one would imagine it'd be a storyline better fitted for a short story, since only the written word could do such a scenario justice. But BRIEF ENCOUNTER, benefitting from the simple, unadorned writing of Noel Coward and the voiceovers given to the character of Laura, is supremely successful in creating the atmosphere needed for this story to work on screen--one of furtive intimacy. In the brief kisses stolen, on bridges and in a stranger's apartment, you feel always that Laura and Alec are both truly happy but desperately worried at the same time. Their final parting is heartbreaking in its simplicity; the lack of fanfare somehow fitting a relationship that was doomed from the beginning. It's a farewell ruined by a chatty, gossipy acquaintance, and the end of a love ultimately not recognised and therefore, by some measure, unreal.The actors who fill the roles of Laura and Alec are pivotal because it is necessary to make the love story one that is believable, and most importantly, sympathetic to the audience. Both Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard rise to the occasion--Johnson in particular is a brilliant choice. Her large, expressive eyes easily register the emotions--the pain and loneliness and desperation--that cannot be put into words, however effective the voice-over.A film that is at once heartbreakingly simple, and yet simply heartbreaking. Delightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Breath of Fresh Air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a breath of fresh air this film is!!I watched this film as part of a David Lean double-header with "The Bridge on the River Kwai". You'd think you could hardly find two less similar films, but I was surprised exactly how much they had in common. I saw each of them as a kind lovesong to a mythologized past. "Kwai" romanticizes the war, the soldiers, the prison, the bridge, whereas the reality was far more brutal. "Brief Encounter" romanticizes pre-war Britain.The performances in the film are case studies in understatement. Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard do little to overtly establish the emotional turmoil their characters are experiencing, yet the message comes across very well indeed. Compare to "Casablanca", for instance. With no disrespect to that magnificent film, "Brief Encounter" manages to convey the same level of emotional intensity without resorting to the sort of grand dramatic scenes that Hollywood specialized in at this time."Brief Encounter" is a thoroughly English film. I love all things English, so I have complaint about that. But it is unusual to American audiences, which makes it a barrier especially to modern viewers. Some people call the film dated, and this is partly what they mean. I don't think it is dated at all, not really. The attitude of the characters toward their relationship is unusual. It's been very much en vogue for a long time now to treat adultery very casually in films. This film treats it very seriously. But there's nothing dated about that. It's not as though adultery used to be a moral issue and isn't now. It's that we're unaccustomed to seeing a film portray it so sensitively.I've noticed a lot of people really digging into this film and throwing up all sorts of interesting conjectures. From the sexual orientation of Alec's friend to Alec's real agenda in all this, it's fascinating to speculate about what else might be going on. But I think it's important to remember that this story is told from Laura's point of view. This is deliberate, and it's important. The film is not so much about Alec and Laura as it is about Laura. If Alec is a womanizer, a psychotic, or a con man, it makes no difference to the film, because Laura believes him, and she believes that he loves her. This film is about how she responds to this sudden and unexpected tumult in her life.I've heard others refer to Laura's husband as the villain of the piece. In a sense, I suppose he is. In a sense, he stands in conflict to the heroine's desire. But not really. The really troubling thing about Laura's "affair" (be it consumated or not... it doesn't matter in the least) is how utterly irrelevant her husband is. Her pangs of guilt seem to have less to do with her family than they do with simply obeying a pre-existing moral code. Adultery isn't wrong because of the pain it inflicts loved ones, it's wrong because society says it is. Laura is intellectually aware that thoughts of her family should make her feel guilty, and sometimes they do, but other times they don't. Her family is, in the grand scheme of things, only a very minor complication. The main complication, the real barrier to Laura's happiness, is society's mores. That's the villain.But even that is too simple. That's the beauty of this picture. The idea isn't that society's rules are wrong, or repressive. It's that society's rules are simple, while life can get very complicated. It's about the conflict between those simple rules and this simple love, and the complicated web of guilt, self-loathing, confusion, and despair they create. What's the answer? Free love? Open marriages? No, that would create other problems, obviously.But then, this film isn't about finding answers.One last comment: for such a great director, I noticed that the directing was nothing very special in this film. I mean, the cinematography was gorgeous, but it was shot in a very simple, straightforward, unimpressively effective manner. Until the end, when Laura runs out on to the platform, after Alec leaves. That sequences... the angled shot of her face, the sense of claustrophobia, despair, and blind panic. It's an incredible moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BRIEF ENCOUNTERA deserved classic of the silver screen, with the phrase `Its only something in mai eigh' almost as famous as `Play it again........'. Milford Station, beautifully portrayed by Carnforth Station in Lancashire, is the setting for this wartime love story.A wonderful examination of middle class English manners, and morals, and yes, we were like that one time, and we still drink tea, though happily the railway buffets are a thing of the past. Stanley Holloway, the station master gives, as usual, a fine performance.The real station, originally part of the a L.M.S., London Midland and Scottish line was taken over by British Railways, and after several years of decay, and threats of demolition, has, in part, been saved by a group of local enthusiasts to commemorate the film. I have the film on tape, English Pal, VHS, and would be happy to make a copy if needed.Celia Johnson has quite protruding eyes in several scenes, and if Trevor Howard was anything of a doctor perhaps he would have diagnosed an over active thyroid!Remembered also for the musical score which used Rachmaninoff's 2nd Concerto in G to such popular effect.A lovely film, worthy of any collection.</fullReview>

The ongoing narrative of Celia Johnson has you caring about her from the very beginning and the 'main stage' of 'Melford Station' is a wondrous post war setting which really draws you into the period of the film. Trevor Howard as the male lead gives a straight forward rendition of a man torn between two women but few actors could replace him in this role.

Despite the insanely aristo accents, Johnson and Howard turn in wonderful performances, brimming with restrained English passion, and they do it all under the impeccable gaze of Robert Krasker's beautiful cinematography, managing to transform an old Northern train station into an embodiment of mystery, passion and danger. The fact that 'Brief Encounter' was running against 'Henry V', 'The Best Years of Our Lives' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' in the 1947 Academy Awards suggests that there may be some truth in the notion that they don't make 'em like they used to. A dazzling, monochrome gem of a movie: very English, and a deserved classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WORTH A LIFELONG RELATIONSHIP</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am no doubt biased in writing about this film, because it is my all time favourite, and has been for many years. But I only recently had the chance to see it on the big screen for the first time, and the experience has left me dazed ..again. Previously, when I had seen the film on television or on video I had marvelled at the precision of David Lean's direction, the complex simplicity of the story, the mastery of Noël Coward's fairness to his characters and the marvllous use of music in unfolding and reflecting the narrative. Seeing Brief Encounter in a cinema made me far more aware of the subtleness of the acting than before, and of course Robert Krasker's brilliant cinemaphotography. I cannot praise Celia Johnsen's performance enough -the truth in her eyes at every moment of the story becomes so much more impressive when experienced on the big screen. Both her performance, and that of Trevor Howard are wonderfully contained -searching, unsure, and above all vulnerable. It is, for me at least, the vulnerability of their relationship that is the core of the film's appeal and longevity. It is their reasoning and attempt to resolve their dilemma which intrigues us, but it is as much the telling of the story that fascinates as the story itself. Big screen viewing allows appreciation of detail. Note the many signs that adorn the background throughout the film -signs displaying names of places far away, which seem to heighten the theme of transition; of the constant attraction towards other places to everywhere but where we happen to be. Note the word 'Room' displayed back to front in the cafe window as Laura at the height of her despair wonders whether to og back to Alec's borrowed flat. The word reads as; MOOR, and conjectually 'more room' is precisely what Laura needs at that moment. Other details that help weld the theme of transition and change are the frequent uses of clocks to denote anxiety. Clocks and watches represent the inevitablity of life -Time cannot, alas, be frozen at moments of happiness. Each shot of a clock or timepiece heightens this. Most revealing is the choice of present Laura makes for her husband -a desk clock with a barometer (another signal of change). The clock plays a part in the deception she creates -telling a story about having to travel some way in order to buy it, while actually spending time with Alec, and is also a persistent metaphor for the urgency of making the best use of time while one can. The obvious symbols of trains traveling in opposite directions as separate destinies and the railway station as the crossing point have been well documented, but manage to grip our attention and imagination every time. The railway station itself, though not glamourised in any way, manages to evoke incredibly romantic images in it's ordinariness. And the sounds of trains moving, continuously, and the other noises of the station -bells, clanks, the rattle of coffee-cups etc all intrude upon the attempts the two protagonists have of being alone in quiet. In sum there is no film I know that manages so well to marry the various elements of film making with film aesthetics, is more successful in marryings narrative, theme and sub-text in technical use of sound, lighting, editing, photography and music. It is a total film experience, where appreciation of the whole never ends, and where -upon each new viewing- new insight is given into it's myriad of parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film as excellent as it is misunderstood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beware spoilers!In intention, it was, I believe, Coward's presentation of pre-War England to a post-War generation. He'd tried something of the sort in 'This Happy Breed', with results that were far from happy - a sort of poor man's 'Cavalcade'.In the meantime, Olivier had made his patriotic statement in 'Henry V'. Professional jealousy would be understandable.In 'Brief Encounter', we have an altogether sparer piece, in timescale and characters. For all the impact of the music - 'Rach 2' is essentially a co-star - and rather expressionistic photography of Krasker (foreshadowing his work in 'The Third Man'), it is ostensibly a domestic tale worthy of a writer such as Kate O'Brien, whose 'latest' ('Pray for the Wanderer') Laura so coveted: a rather old-fashioned story of a woman denied the belated chance of happiness by the rigid dictates of a hypocritical society. Almost a throwback to the Victorian melodrama of the 'East Lynne' type.But the quality of the film itself is calculated to excite curiosity about the characters and their society. A cascade of questions naturally ensues.What exactly is Alec doing in Milford every Thursday? For a hospital consultant to let a 'humble GP' 'take over' his patients for a day seems a rather peculiar arrangement, even for those pre-litigation-mania days. Is Laura the first woman he's picked up? After all, a doctor can always make himself useful with little domestic emergencies...How are Alec and Stephen really connected? Could it be that, in those fondly remembered days at medical school, a soigné, slightly older, student had picked up a pretty grammar school boy from the North? And been dumped in favour of a girl - Madeleine, say? (Stephen really is a thoroughly poisonous portrait of a homosexual - perhaps based on some acquaintance of Coward's?)And what of Madeleine, the only concerned party we don't see? Laura jumps eagerly on Alec's description of her as 'delicate' to suppose her to be some sort of invalid - a wonderfully catty moment! - by implication, unable to satisfy him sexually. But isn't it likely that he has painted a self-servingly unflattering portrait? Is she quite the doormat he makes her out to be - so subservient as to jump on a liner to South Africa at the snap of his fingers? The South African story also deserves some thought. Isn't it all too convenient - that a new hospital in Jo'burg should be starting up - AND his brother is in a position to give him a job - just at the time he needs a funk-hole into which to escape? (The sort of over-convenient coincidence of Harry Lime's 'accident' in 'The Third Man').(Incidentally, Alec shows his true colours over the South African job - when he offers not to take it if (a thoroughly distraught) Laura says she doesn't want him to.)More practical questions also arise - divorce and separation, the legal and social effects, especially on a doctor's career. Had Laura run away with Alec, in 1939, she would have had to count on losing her children. Deception on an industrial scale would probably have been necessary to preserve his career - not to mention the threat of needing to move every time their past caught up with them. And we see how much she hates the minor deceptions she practices on Fred. Fred. Spouse-as-obstacle-to-love. Surely, he is the true villain of the piece, a barrier both to romance and female liberation...Look at the two males side by side - Fred is older, first of all: at least 40. Unlike Alec, he will most likely have seen service in the First World War, probably on the Western Front. To this may be attributed his desire for domestic tranquillity. (Not for nothing is his catchphrase 'Have it your own way'.) Alec may have seen more gore, in his professional capacity; but to pick up one's mug of tea and find floating in it the brains of someone one was just talking to - and to observe, take part in, the casual rutting in which soldier and officer alike sought, when in rest, to blot out the horrors of war - all that would have given Fred a sense of proportion about sexual passion that Alec clearly did not share.The truth is, Fred more than likely has contemplated his wife's possible infidelity long before Alec comes on the scene. She is pretty enough, for all her dowdy clothes (and silly hats). We see her flirting very winningly in the Kardomah - Fred will have witnessed similar incidents. And he probably has long concluded that it wouldn't matter - he would be hurt, he couldn't help that - but nothing would be worth breaking up the home, certainly not something as worthless as a cuckold's pride.At the end, whether the affair has been consummated or not is a matter of indifference to him. He clearly assumes it has. He has only waited to say something for fear of appearing to make her choose, whilst she is still under the influence of her passion. (A New Man of his time, indeed!)And what of that passion? Some reverse discrimination here, surely? In the case of a man in Laura's situation, wouldn't we just say he was 'thinking with his unit'?These questions are no more than examples. The railway, cinema, shops, streets are all fertile areas; comparison with 'Still Lives' is instructive; and so on.But this is no museum piece, viewable - like so much British cinema, unfortunately - only as visual archaeology. Its triumph is essentially artistic: to integrate the social document and narrative into a seamless whole, as satisfying as entertainment as it is rich as research material.</fullReview>

Brief Encounter is a superbly crafted film with some of the most convincing performances that I've ever seen.Unlike many older films, Brief Encounter does not feel dated at all. The film's story, pace, acting and use of narration are wonderfully timeless.The DVD transfer is pristine. It really is a miracle that a film made so long ago can be so perfectly preserved.Hats off to Criterion, David Lean and all of the wonderful actors in Brief Encounter!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enormously Timeless Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have had the pleasure to see this movie today in an afternoon session at my local arthouse, and I was astonished at the freshness and sincerity of this movie. Even after 55 odd years this movie is still as fresh as other movies of the sort made nowadays, possibly even better.What is it about: A woman who is waiting for her train has a BRIEF ENCOUNTER with a gentleman at a train station as she is waiting for her train to arrive. After a few days she meets him again in the streets of a small town. She then meets him again in a diner in the same town and a spark flies. This is all pretty standard only the fact they are both married and have children dramatizes the relationship to a certain extent that they both know this a love affair running for certain doom unless they give up they usual lives. We follow them through a series of flashbacks in which the wife (Laura) apologizes to her husband in her head, and in the end... you'll have to see for yourself.This movie was so well scripted that it blew me away. The performances made the beginning and the ending flow over in each other seamlessly and without a glitch. It was absolutely heartrending to see Laura's face when Alec leaves.Celia Johnson is the Meg Ryan of that time. If this movie were to be remade than she would play the lead (and I am not referring to the dreadful 1974 version). Trevor Howard plays a very lovesick doctor, credible to anyone who has ever been in love.The art direction and photography are exquisite. The sets have been kept small and intimate to give a more lovable feeling to it all. The lighting has been kept low to provide more shadows than one would expect in a movie with a theme like this.The subject must have been controversial at that time. It still is to a certain degree nowadays in 2000. Absolutely brilliant movie that has to be cherished for all time. I am going to check if it is out on DVD right now.10/10CU, Quin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The right love at the wrong time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very discreet affair between a married woman and a handsome stranger is transformed by director David Lean and writer Noel Coward into something emotionally fulfilling and, ultimately, heart-breaking. Celia Johnson gives a masterful performance as a decent, veddy British and proper lady who is swept away by a man she doesn't know; within four weeks, they profess their love for each other. But since this was 1945, there can't be much more than stolen kisses between the two amidst highly dramatic surroundings (tunnels, bridges, train platforms), yet Lean and Coward allow you to feel the intricacy of this relationship, the guilt but also the guilty pleasure. The movie is indeed as decent as the wife, but that doesn't make the "illicit" clinches any the less important, for this woman blossoms and matures in the course of the film, and the director is careful to let us sympathize...and swoon right along with her. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to surprise by degree no matter how small is my first thought of this tight well made film. tragic because of and made more so by the naivety of the two main characters makes this a sobering yet inspiring story.this is one of my top 20 romantic films of all time. few people have heard of this film which is a shame. a little dated and regional in terms of the British overtones should not put the viewer off. all the actors are spot on and give the feeling of a three dimensional air.if you could watch through a black and white key hole this would be the movie to watch. modern film makers would do well to remember the importance of music scores in a romance story. from the beginning theme of rachmoninoffs piano concerto with the passing train in the night leaves a lasting image of pathos and separation to come. simple elegant like love itself that steals upon lovers unaware is thread all through this plot. the plot a housewife meets a doctor on a train platform when she gets soot in her eye from the train i would suggest that the debris is the fate and or representation of her common life being swept away in a tender moment of embrace with a stranger but that would be impetuous. watch her dotting husband see the charming affection of the train conductor and the snack bar lady and the nosy neighbor of Celia Johnson and you will want to tear the claustrophobic fog of daily illusion with a tear or a smile with another wayward souls embrace. thats just what happens with all the trepidation and misgivings that adults face when faced with my definition of romance something that never was could not be or ever fully become and you'll understand why life and fantasy need each other like water and sunlight to a rose. watch as two lives are made better while destroying everything they have yet none are the wiser in the end what real tragedy... its a glance of a lost life left at a station door</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left me a little cold but still worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a chance encounter at a railway station, Laura Jesson and Dr Harvey meet and strike up a friendship while waiting for their trains. From this seed grows a friendship despite both of the pair already being married. Despite the odds, they continue their secret meetings even though they know that it cannot continue and must come to an end at some point.I watched this as I was curious how a film from this period would treat a relationship that was essentially adulterous. I was unsurprised to see that the love affair was never actually consummated and that the nature of their relationship was very restrained and controlled despite the longing they both had. How moved you are by the story depends on your view point I suppose. I found it very hard to feel for these people as neither seemed to try and solve the problems in their marriages - I didn't support their relationship and it left me a little cold. At times the emotion came through well, but for me personally I found the manner of their relationship to have a smothering effect on this.The look and feel of the film is still admirable though; it is in black and white and has a real atmospheric feel to it. The claustrophobic nature of the sets and colours portrays the siege mentality of the lovers' relationship and feels almost like a noir so well is the atmosphere presented. The cast do well but they are prevented from really letting their passion show in acts or words or looks due to the rules of the time in cinema. Johnson delivers a good performance nonetheless; she is the one who demonstrates her inner turmoil the best. I felt that Howard overdid the stiff-upper-lip thing and he never really convinced me as a man who was tearing himself away from the most important thing in his life.Overall, I am very aware that this film is often seen as a classic among critics and the wider populace, but I must say I didn't buy into it. Visually and atmospherically it really works, but as a love story I was left cold and disapproving of it. I could understand what they were feeling but my inability to support them meant I was uncaring and unable to really sympathise with what they must have been feeling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mature depiction of an extra-marital affair !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Brief Encounter' is a film from the initial part of David Lean's career as a filmmaker when he was majorly known for being the most skilled director at interpreting Noel Coward's plays on celluloid. The screenplay of 'Brief Encounter' written by Lean himself along with Ronald Neame and Anthony Havelock-Allan is based on Coward's play 'Still Life'. The film spreads out the play and expands on it. Unlike Lean's more popular works like 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'The Bridge on the River Kwai', 'Brief Encounter' is a much more contained film with a smaller scope. But for me the film is as special as Lean's more grander works due to its intimate storytelling and mature depiction of an extra-marital affair.I think there are a few hints in the film about how suffocating the uptight nature of British middle/upper class society could be at the time. But to be honest, the social commentary is very nuanced and the major aspect that Lean is interested in is the exploration of the characters, especially Laura. The film is interested in focusing on the struggle that Laura goes through while balancing a sense of guilt along with desire. Most generic films that deal with extra- marital affairs resort a little too much to steamy sexual scenes for depicting the passion between the participants which invariably ends up being nothing but a source of the audience's titillation without saying anything about the characters. 'Brief Encounter' on the other hand is based solely on the characters' inner struggles. David Lean never judges them for their actions. There is a humane sense with which Laura and Alec get treated. These characters know that what they are getting into has no future, but the circumstances and tender nature in which they treat each other makes it impossible for them to resist each other's company.Lean also beautifully shows the difference between the grander scheme of things and the individual problems and struggles. A person can be going through the most traumatic experience, but it might not be of any significance in the bigger picture. This theme is brilliantly depicted in the first scene. We enter the railway station tea stall. We see the ancillary characters in the story talking to each other. Suddenly the camera pans away from them and moves to a table where Laura and Alec are sitting. We don't know them yet. We don't even hear what they are saying to each other, their conversation gets drowned by the other conversations being held in the room. It's only when we enter the psyche of Laura which happens later in the film that we truly get to understand the gravity of that first scene. Lean's direction from a basic technical standpoint has to be admired too along with the way he handles the theme of the story and his actors. He remains nuanced in his way of using the camera. Whenever Lean wants us to know what Laura is thinking, he approaches Laura ever so gently with the camera along with the dimming of the lights in the shot. There is a scene where a sudden change in mood makes the camera tilt to the right, as the tension settles, the camera tilts back to its normal straight position. Lean also does something that I love, he stages one particular scene twice, but from different perspectives. It always impresses me when a director is able to pull this storytelling technique off properly and Lean does so with flying colours.From an acting sense, the film has good performances all round, but the only actor that deserves a special mention is Celia Johnson. She is the one who drives this film forward. She is very subtle, very expressive and brilliantly portrays the struggle of Laura. She makes it impossible for the audience to not feel for Laura. Her voice-over is also brilliant.If I have to nit-pick, I'll say that maybe the voice-over in some scenes could have been more discreetly used. In certain scenes I thought, the emotional effect would have been more powerful if what Laura is thinking wasn't completely told to the audience, but it really is a very minor complaint.I'll end this review by reaffirming my appreciation for 'Brief Encounter'. This is an example of a mature piece of filmmaking where the director fleshes out the central character completely in front of you. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't get the raves for this movie. Maybe from a technical or acting viewpoint it might be good but the story is ridiculous. True love is formed by shared experiences, deep bonds and understanding of the other person. This supposed great love is formed over a few hours of brief, superficial, polite, flirtatious banter. Anything else is lust, which I also can't fathom as neither one is particularly attractive, physically or emotionally. The scene in the pub between the owner and the 2 men is pointless. The scene where she almost commits suicide but doesn't and then admits no thoughts of her children or husband made her stop is weird. I don't have children but from my understanding that is certainly not typical of mothers. The most baffling aspect is why she would go home and confess all this to her husband, which is the epitome of cruel and selfish behaviour. No wait, the most baffling aspect is probably her husbands reaction. Many people state the music it what makes this movie so good. Go by the soundtrack. The film itself is WAY over-hyped.</fullReview>

It is the ultra-controlled, almost emotionless, clipped dialogue with just the right sort of - what appears to Americans as - upper-class accents. Declarations of love that are always completely controlled. NO ONE loses control This movie is probably enjoyable for English audiences.

		<fullReview>The gloomy and impersonal atmosphere, which somewhat reminiscent of "still life", gave birth to a sincere and strong love. I can not say it's perfect, but it works damn true. BRIEF ENCOUNTER is an honest film about the revival of the love that in the social conventions, stratifications and circumstances act unreal. An intimate drama about a brief, touching and romantic relationship between a married woman and a married man. In the post-war years the people were generally captured in lethargy and monotony. Short-term awakening of love meant saving a marriage and life. In the film, two ordinary family people are shocked and shaken by the situation in which they are located. However, their love grows and matures. Through romance meet overjoyed and extremely severe pain when they discover that their relationship has no future.The story is pretty honest with some minor flaws and discrepancies. Romance is developing too fast. The story almost "live" from Thursday to Thursday. The lady's husband was full of understanding and mild obtuse. I think it would be interesting to know the doctor's family.Celia Johnson as Laura Jesson leaves a great impression as emotionally troubled woman. Some cynics would say that it seems a little impersonal. I think that the effect corresponding to the conditions and the grayness of postwar life. Her expressions of love and sad look at the end saying enough. Trevor Howard as Dr Alec Harvey is paired with Laura was very good. Character is somewhat contradictory. Maybe even pathetic. I try not to overdo it. He simply does not transmit strong emotions.I would not use the term "affair married people." About morality or validity of ordinary people is too say. The change in character is obvious. Love has changed the atmosphere of the film. At the train station all starts at the same place it all ends. This is a break between two train life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make This More Than a Brief Encounter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brief Encounter (1945): Dir: David Lean / Cast: Celia Johnson, Trevor Howard, Cyril Raymond, Everley Gregg, Valentine Dyall: Dark romance that regards that peak moment when sin emerges and the gradual path to its growth. Celia Johnson plays Laura Jesson, a house wife who is dissatisfied with her marriage. Trevor Howard plays doctor Alec Harvey whom she encounters at a coffee shop while awaiting her train. She is transfixed by his charms after he assists her in dealing with a speck in her eye, and soon they are off to the movies. A romance blossoms and she soon becomes paranoid to the thoughts of those around her and the fear of being found out. Cyril Howard plays her husband who is supportive in his role as husband and father but his routines of cross-word puzzles and such lead Laura to boredom. There is a host of colourful supporting characters including Everley Gregg as Laura's very talkative friend. Valentine Dyall plays a doctor acquaintance of Alec's who learns of the forbidden romance and makes his opinion known. Directed by David Lean with a clever screenplay that is insightful despite being, at times, corny. It contains the so-called innocence and passion of sin that eventually catches up with us and turns our brief encounter into a lifetime mistake. That is, unless those whom can be damaged most reverse the pain with understanding. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A groundbreaking exploration of love and changing social attitudes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people think of "Brief Encounter" as a comment on stuffy middle-class suburban culture and its restrained attitudes towards love. While I'd be a complete douche not to see this, I think that such a narrow view takes away from what is actually a touching story about two people who fall in love and have to make the difficult choice of whether or not to stay with their respective spouses.I think the film was quite controversial for its time as it dealt not only with the taboo subject of extramarital affairs but did so from a woman's perspective. On top of this both the main characters, Laura Jesson and Alec Harvey, are middle-aged. Indeed, there's an interesting contrast between their measured response to attraction (which occasionally spills over into something more passionate) and that of the young couple who both work at the train station and can be seen, carefree and frolicking around, in a scene near the end of the film. The fact that Laura and Alec mostly meet at a train station also adds further poignancy to their doomed affair as it suggests impermanence and anonymity.Both Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard are fantastic in their lead roles but it's Johnson who really shines as the film's protagonist. Laura is simultaneously reserved and impulsive, and we're left with the constant feeling that she could do something drastic at any minute (demonstrated by her almost throwing herself in front of a train when Alec says his final goodbye). This sense of tension and struggle within her character keeps us guessing right up until the end as to whether she will actually leave her good-natured but dull husband, Fred, and is ultimately what makes the film so watchable."Brief Encounter" does, undoubtedly, throw up some interesting points about class and culture, but the reason it's so powerful is because all that restraint and control is stripped away when Laura and Alec are together, liberated and happy in their love. They know it's impossible and can't last, but watching their relationship blossom and witnessing their mad moments of indecision we're reminded of how fragile our morals and values really are in the face of something so powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>maybe THE bittersweet love story of all time? One of them anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not difficult to see why one who only really knows David Lean from 1957 onward - from River Kwai onward he seemed to only make lush, epic films of romance and adventure, only four to be exact - to come to a film like Brief Encounter. Of course Lean made other films, like Dickens adaptations, but this is so very intimate, mostly about two characters (maybe two other ones are supporting, but that's it) and the relationship they have, an emotional affair that never really, far as we can see, develop into sex. But Lean was at his best when he made his epics intimate, when it was just about two characters in a room or a place trying to figure things out - those are the scenes that made Kwai and Lawrence so compelling, was taking the high stakes of human beings amid the large vistas. Here, the locations are set in gloomy old England, immediately post-war, and is simply about two adults - Celia Johnson as Laura and Trevor Howard as Alex - who know they've made a connection, and know they have to move on. How can they? One of those tremendously dramatic scenes in films, the kind that one may take for granted, happens not too soon after the film begins. We see the couple together about to separate - for good, it seems - as the sort of "End at the beginning" style of non-linear storytelling. At a café one of Laura's friends, played by Everly Gregg, comes in and won't.. stop.. talking. A stream of words, perfectly friendly, but without any shred of a sense of what's going on in front of her unless it's spelled out. The two women get on the train after the couple separates, and she continues to talk. Laura narrates, but it's more about the immediate thoughts in her head, as Lean cuts between close-ups of Gregg's non-stop mouth, and Johnson's face, sullen, distant, and her thoughts shift between "I wish you were dead. No, that is wrong, I didn't mean that. But I wish you would stop talking." It's one of those moments that made me sit up and take notice. Brief Encounter isn't about to make these characters, just because they're in their 30's (verging on 40's) with marriages and kids, not have thoughts and feelings that drift into how people think and feel. But so much of what this film is about is repression, how one must stuff real feelings underneath for responsibility. Of course, Laura loves her kids and, to a large extent even, her husband, who also talks and talks, though isn't as unpleasant to listen to as the chatterbox Dolly. But she still has thoughts - more narration, but the kind that is a rarity in intelligent movies, that reveals about character instead of spelling things out - and we feel for her even as she is doing something "wrong" in the eyes of many.The theme of Brief Encounter is universal, love that cannot be, going back to Shakespeare. But somehow this story spoke more to me - maybe as I'm an adult and not a teenager anymore - than, say, Romeo &amp; Juliet. Laura and Alec, and as played by these two magnificent actors, mostly due to their restraint, but also in how warm and kind and generous they are as actors for their characters, are people who become so raw and moving that they become embedded in the audience's consciousness long after it's all over. There's also a nice contrast with a working class couple, who we see from time to time at the café the middle class couple regularly meets at. It's interesting to see how their relationship develops in contrast to the main couple (perhaps obviously so, the only nitpick about the movie). But it makes Coward's play richer too; not all hope is lost for everyone, and, as usual, life goes on - until it doesn't.This is a small triumph about love in the face of all odds, and how mature people deal with it. Few tales of infidelity have ever been this rich, and though it may be aped by others it's hard to come close to its purity. And amid the ultimate sadness, there are still many moments of happiness between this couple. Hell, we even get a scene where they go to a Donald Duck cartoon! Perhaps today it might not work as well due to modern audiences expecting more passion, more sex. That might be fine for today. For 1945, its sense of showing love develop like this is never less than touching, and it holds up due to its sharp dialog, class distinctions, and the richness of Johnson's character and performance (Howard, too, is quite good, though is in a way kind of a supporting character too despite the length of screen time: it's Laura's story, ultimately). Along with Allen's Manhattan (which name-checked Coward at one point by the way), this is maybe the most simple but incisive film about love-loss in the 20th century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best romance film of all time... period.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brief encounter is the best film of the romance genre and anyone who disagrees with this statement it's because he/she hasn't seen it. The first time I saw BE, I was at a loss of words... speechless. I was moved -and trust me, I'm not one to be moved by romantic films-. The acting, direction, soundtrack, were superb. But in the end I thought: "maybe I'm a bit influenced, and I can't be objective enough", so I had a second view of the film. Trust me: it gets better on a second view.MINOR SPOILERS (nothing key revealed)The first time you don't know what's going on, especially the first scene at the coffee house, the pat on her shoulder given by Alec, and the next one when Laura's riding the train. Those things you don't get in the beginning. You can guess or speculate, but it's better not to; let the film drive you through Laura's story. This first time, you create empathy with the characters... right until the endOn the second viewing you know EXACTLY what happened... and the speculation you had during the first viewing is not there anymore. You correctly note that the movie begins paying no attention to Alec and Laura AT ALL while they're sitting on the corner and the lousy lady keeps talking, but YOU KNOW they are there and YOU KNOW what are they talking about. Simply put, YOU KNOW what they are going through. This first scene, which the first time you saw it meant nothing to you, now means A WHOLE LOT ! The second scene, which the first time you saw it had you wondering why Laura wished that lady to die or shut up, now makes sense.This applies for the rest of the film.Of course, I still had doubts and days later, I watched BE a third time.MAJOR SPOILERS (you shouldn't read)The third time you can objectively pay attention to the characters, the scenery, the music, and every single detail. Key moments from the film that really got me:1) When Alec misses meeting Laura that second Thursday and they rush to the train station. While he's on the train he yells at her "Thursday?" (as in, see you next Thursday), and she says "yes"2) When they are driving on the rented car, she says "I lit cigarettes for him"... (as in, it felt pointless and hurtful)3) The "farewell" (the one at the end), when he just puts his hand on her shoulder and just walks away. Gosh, the look on her face, she's so devastated.4) Seconds later, when she dreams of Alec not getting on his train and coming back. Again, her expression is so hopeless.5) When Alec says "I know that this is the beginning of the end"6) When Laura says "I had no thoughts at all, only an overwhelming desire not to feel anything ever again"I could go on, as I think I'm missing a few more. My point is, it is moments like these the ones that weigh favorably for the film.END SPOILERSMost people say Casablanca or Gone with the wind are the most romantic films ever. I was one of them, until I saw BE. While Casablanca and GWTW are legendary films, they have been degraded to a second position in my book. You see... when you watch Casablanca, yes, the plot is great, the acting is great, the music, the feel, but in the end, I still have the feeling that I'm watching Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in a Morroco based film. Same for GWTW; I can't help but relate to Clark Gable and Vivian Leigh. I feel that Casablanca and GWTW are kind of more "Hollywood-ish" films, with the happy or nostalgic ending. I'm still left with the taste in my mouth that I had just watched a movie. This doesn't happen with BE.With BE, the first thing that pops in your mind should be: "who are these guys? are they even actors?" It just so happens they are. In fact, they are so good, you forget you're watching a film, and instead you start thinking you are watching a story. Trevor Howard is just phenomenal and terrific as Alec, but hands down Celia Johnson is the one who nails Laura to perfection. I mean she looks so frail and fragile when she has to, and so happy and authentic when she needs to. You are completely satisfied that it is Laura narrating the story and you understand why the film works so well with her telling the story and not Alec. One thing you have to consider when watching BE: forget that you live in 2015; try to put things into context and perspective as most as you can. This is no "we met through Facebook and chatted for two months on WhatsApp Tom Hanks + Meg Ryan's You've got mail" kind of story. This is a real story, about characters who look so real as the Sun and the ocean, and weren't able toMAJOR SPOILERsee each other, talk to each other, in essence... have any contact whatsoever, for one week. They could only be together just for a few hours every Thursday for five Thursdays.END MAJOR SPOILERThat's the beauty of this film and that's why it's better than Casablanca or GWTW. Gosh, the few times they are together, you just want them to be together for the rest of their lives. You can see how happy they are with each other and how unhappy they will end. When Laura says "I paid no attention to the eye thing, I thought it meant nothing"... man... THAT's the way women fall in love with a man.TEN OUT OF TEN.</fullReview>

She is flustered when a talkative acquaintance runs into them. It's been only a few weeks ago since she met him at the train station. Their friendship turns into longing and finally obsession.Celia Johnson gives a haunted look that speaks to her internal conflict. That is the central issue of the movie. She cannot walk that final step. One can argue about her reason but there is no denying Celia's performance. The black and white looks beautiful especially the trains and the station.

		<fullReview>Brief Encounter is a superbly written and acted drama about attraction, in fact one of the best studies of it I have ever seen. The plot is so simple, two strangers meet have a connection and continue to meet every week. Both are married and so know that nothing can come of their obvious attraction to each other. As well as the interactions between the two strangers, we get to see the life of the woman Celia Johnson and an insight into why she may be tempted into an affair. The two leads the doe eyed Celia Johnson and the charming Trevor Howard are brilliant exuding a great chemistry that really does convince you they are in love. Even the back up characters are great and add extra charm to an already charming film. This is very much a film of it's time full of lovely plummy old English accents that hark back to a seemingly gentler period. It all builds to a wonderfully poignant climax which leaves the viewer in a moral quandary. Brief Encounter is undoubtedly a classic and even though it's nearly 70 years old the subject matter is timeless. A fantastic film that remains eminently watchable even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Romantic Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Brief Encounter" is one of the best examples of 1940s British film and just about the best romantic movie ever made. It is very intense and the ending is heartbreaking, but the story will keep you enraptured from start to finish.Laura (Celia Johnson) is a housewife who travels by train once a week to shop in a nearby town. Alec (Trevor Howard) is a married physician who works in a local clinic on the same day of the week. They meet by chance when Laura has a cinder in her eye, which Alec helps remove. Their romance starts innocently enough, but quickly blossoms into a passionate love affair. Alec sees that the relationship will only cause heartache, so he takes a job in South Africa. The story of the couple's last day together is sadly romantic and very moving, culminating in a poignant final sequence at a train station where they met."Brief Encounter" is beautifully filmed in B&amp;W. Johnson and Howard are both excellent, portraying two people in a relationship that cannot continue. The film is a perfect departure from most today's movies, as it deals maturely with adult themes and has no filthy language, no toilet humor, and no violence.I've watched "Brief Encounter" numerous times and it actually seems to improve with each viewing. I think you'll like it unless you hate B&amp;W film or you prefer today's mostly sophomoric movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very fine, melancholy and bitter-sweet movie with old-world morals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie yesterday night, and I still have that bitter-sweet, melancholy feeling in my heart. This was a very beautiful movie! It makes me think, that maybe it is we - in our time - that are cheated, when it comes to love and life. We can get a divorce very easily, even with children in the marriage, without anybody rising an eye-brow. We can have causal sexual relationships. Unfaithfulness is still seen as bad by most people, but not by far so bad as in the 1940:s. It is almost more common that children grow up with single mums or in step-families, than in nuclear families. And so on.We think we are modern, mature and realistic, but I think we miss out on what these people in the movie had. They had a strong feeling of responsibility, decency, and self-respect. And I wonder, if a sacrifice like theirs would not still make you feel better about yourself in the long run, than any however so exciting sexual adventures - even if you do not realize this at the time. I think there is much to say for old-world morals..! Despite of the above, I think it was refreshing to see a middle-aged and not very physically attractive love couple for once. This was very innovative and modern I think - not even in our time they make many movies, in which a middle-aged, and a little worn and haggard mother can still kindle strong feelings in a man. I liked that! :-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The Magnolia Theatre in Dallas included this one in its Summer Classic series and it drew a decent sized audience, even though the one-night-only showing was on the same evening as many of the local fireworks shows for Independence Day. If you are unfamiliar with this film, you should know that it garnered director David Lean his first of seven Oscar nominations. In contrast to this "little" film, Lean went on to direct such epics as The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, and Doctor Zhivago.Marital infidelity has long been a favorite topic in Hollywood ... umm ... I mean on screen. Rarely is it treated with such respect as it is here. The story is based on a short play from the great Noel Coward. With numerous scenes added for the film version, it never feels forced or over-written. What really makes this one standout is that the two lead characters are basically happily married people who just stumble into each other and a bond forms ... despite their level-headed acknowledgments that it's not a good idea.Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) are just going about their daily routines when circumstances bring them together at the hectic train station. We learn this in the opening scene through the internal-dialogue (narration) coming from Laura. See, the bulk of the movie is a flashback as we are really starting at the end. This opening scene is brilliant as we can all relate to the frustration Laura feels as her yappy, but well-meaning friend, unwittingly crashes the going-away party. We see the torture on the faces of Laura and Alec, but it takes the rest of the movie for us to get the full story.The setting of a train station adds a time-sensitive element to the rushed time together. While they bond through tea, food and movies, the train whistle is the reminder that the precious moments are at the mercy of a schedule that won't allow for flexibility. This is no Meet-Cute of which films today seem to think is a required element. No, these are two real adults who have not before noticed an element missing in their lives. Perhaps Coward is saying that nothing must be missing for two kindred spirits to connect, but that the real choice continues to lie within each of us ... loyalty, fidelity and judgment are on constant alert.It should be noted that Celia Johnson's performance really carries the film. She was nominated for an Oscar and is just brilliant in her emotional roller coaster ride. Trevor Howard, a strong character actor, makes a terrific partner for her. They strike us as real people, not movie stars, caught in a real life dilemma. To prevent an over-wrought emotional wringing, we get the comedic balance of conductor Stanley Holloway and his flirtatious ways with prim and proper shopkeeper Joyce Carey. Their playful (yet similar) relationship counteracts the upper-crust complexity of Laura and Alec.The film and its players offer up a few interesting side notes. Celia Johnson was not a fan of acting. She was seduced into playing the role after her friend Noel Coward personally read the script to her. Celia was married to Peter Fleming, older brother of Ian Fleming - he of James Bond fame. Noel Coward had a multi-layered career that included playwright, actor, songwriter and singer, novelist and even director. Mr. Coward personally selected the Rachmaninoff piano concerto that so wonderfully accompanies the movie's happenings. The bookstore shown in the film was later spun off from Boots Pharmacy, which only this year was purchased by Walgreens. Lastly, the film was originally banned in Ireland for showing marital infidelity in such a positive light. Though released in 1945, it wasn't shown in the United States until 1946, thereby pushing the Oscar nominations to 1947.</fullReview>

This minimalistic, actor-driven drama is very much a British film by nature, and with its sense of frustration and unsatisfying ending, it's more daring and more realistic than almost everything made in Hollywood in this period, excluding immigrants like Billy Wilder and odd birds like Orson Welles.Brief Encounter may not be easily appreciated by those not used to the pacing and theatrical delivery that often characterizes the films of the 30's and 40's, but for film-history lovers it's an important piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Brief Encounter is a romantic drama directed by David Lean in 1945 and starring by Celia Johnson, Trevor Howard, Stanley Holloway. Tells the story of Laura Jesson and Alec Harvey, two people who do not know each other and had not ever seen and that, due to a series of chance meetings at a cafe in the train station, where they go every Thursday, rendered to a fall common unbridled passion and strong feelings arise between them. "Alec Harvey, a Doctor, and Laura Jesson who is a housewife, is married but cannot help falling in love with Alec, as they happen these meetings in the cafeteria of the season already mentioned, although she is married. -Laura, goes through a time of life marked by monotony and lack of motivation and it's not the best moment of his marriage, however, Alec made she feel joy, excitement, enthusiasm. Ultimately he awakens in her feelings that had and are forgotten and it is these events that are happening that reinforce the new feelings in the heart of Laura. "As a main topic will highlight the original chance of many of the guidelines that takes the lives of people and the flash that makes transporting us back to the scenes of the film. The flash is misplaced back to the viewer, to catch him later to provide the answers. "We could also distinguish the importance of friendship, a feeling of friendship that gradually and with the passage of time is transformed into love, reaching one of the most important themes of the film. As I have said, love is one of the key issues to highlight, you could define love in this film as a liberating process or way to break the chains of monotony, frustration and boredom. That bind the protagonists and return to enjoy and experience feelings and emotions that he felt had long since forgotten or thought. If I must choose a side issue I would choose passion, The secondary theme I want to emphasize is the passion. It is a feeling very close to love. Prohibition in the relationship and life habits and monotony of the characters, create the intensity in their love story. The scenes in the country are rediscovering the characters sexual desire and attraction, but instead the scenes at the train station, the subway or the wet streets remind us of the society in which the film is developed a repressive social system. Finally I think it is correct to say the issue "feeling of guilt", a guilt that arises after unleashing strong and intense passion. The film shows how two normal people cannot cope with experiences that exceed their lives and ultimately and unavoidably end up falling in love. - We emphasize the importance that Rachmaninoff's music in this film, because it provides the film with an immense force. Manages to convey to the viewer all the emotional charge and dominates every scene of "flash- back." "It's a film characterized by a cold atmosphere, which along with the action of black and white, get a dramatic overall effect. As a main symbols I could highlight the clocks because there is nothing more invincible than the passage of time, we cannot do anything against it, it passes and passes. The sound of the train that makes us think that the train leaving at that time will never return and we must take it or leave it. -Alba Caro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last Train to Catch: Brief Encounter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout our lives we have to face temptations of all sorts and it sometimes can make us struggle. It is undeniable that love might get very difficult sometimes and that we may suffer as a consequence of it. David Lean's Brief Encounter depicts the struggling of a housewife who is not content with her marriage and has to face temptation. The series of 'brief encounters' between her and a doctor make her reconsider her present situation. A typical black and white movie, this is a perfect choice for a rainy Sunday afternoon at home. Imagine yourself enjoying a cup of hot chocolate, watching a black and white film, covered with a blanket and laying in your couch; Just perfect. The plot of the film is not very complex but the disposition of the events is quite novel. Without making things too obvious, David Lean shows enough in the film for us to imagine what is happening in the lives of the two main characters. We have access to the mind of Laura Jesson (starring Celia Johnson) by an important 'voice in over' and there is an intelligent use of flashbacks. Perhaps (and this is a personal opinion) Celia Johnson's performance was not the best one I have ever seen (as it seemed that she did not expressed feelings as well as we could have expected) but the relationship between her and Trevor Horward (playing the role of Dr. Alec Harvey) was harmonious. It is perhaps the totality of both performances that makes this movie so good, but not each of them in an isolated way. The film is not famous for the variety of spaces shown as there are only a few specific scenarios that appear thorough the 86 min of the film (basically being these the platforms, the station's cafeteria, a room of Laura's house and the street in front of the hospital). Therefore, spectators should not expect big special effects or changes in the scenes because instead of trying to impress the audience by means of visual effects, the aim is to display a true and real story (something that could happen to anyone). There are certain private affairs that are trying to be shown and what better way to do it than by explaining them in the form of a character's thoughts? This allows the director to make the audience participant of certain private feelings. The film is based on a play (Still Life) and it was released in 1945. It was very well accepted by the audience and David Lean achieved his first Oscar nomination with it. It has received several prizes since it was created and it has become a classic in cinema history. The most remarkable aspect perhaps is the intimacy achieved and also, the incredible dialogues (all written in a very meticulous and carefully way). David Lean did a very good job with Brief Encounter and I would definitely advise you to see it if you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brief Encounter (1945) is a British romantic drama directed by David Lean. Nöel Coward was in charge of the screenplay, which was based on the play Still Life. Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard are the protagonists of the film, who perfectly moved the audience's feelings until the very end. The cover shows a close-up of the protagonists, Laura (Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard), on the left side of it. At the bottom, there are two photos, one of them has to do with the couple of the coffee shop, and the other has to do with the protagonists. In the middle there are the names of the actors, the director and at the top, the screenwriter's name, Nöel Coward. The film is considered a romantic film, which represents the British society of the moment (1940s); it touches several themes such as family, duties, the importance of appearance, etc, although the main one is love. According to style, the whole film is narrated by the protagonist in a voice-over style. Laura, the protagonist, let the audience seem she is telling her story to her husband, so we do not know what would happen until the end. The film is black and white. Most of the music is made by a piano or Pianola, a very romantic sound which helps the spectator follows the plot and feels in a more internal or subjective manner what the characters are feeling or suffering. The sound of the trains is also relevant in the story and gives traces of romanticism and melancholy to the plot. Concerning the plot, it is the story of two married strangers who meet every Thursday at a railway station, an interesting place for arrangements and farewells. We know the whole story thanks to Laura, the protagonist, who narrates all of it. We also perceive a lover's behavior, who mainly acts through impulse, unconsciously, and who is capable of making us feel as we were in love. Brief Encounter presents us a moving love story which leads us to experience the same feelings as the protagonists thanks to the well-done performance of the actors and the perfect shots and miss-en-scene. I recommend Brief Encounter to people who like love stories, mystery and classical films.NEREA GARCIA DOMINGO</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Betrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Brief Encounter' is a movie about two people who have an elicit love affair.Released in 1945, at the end of WW2, it's quite surprising how stifled and censorious an attitude it brings to the subject. During the war years of 1939-45, so many men - including husbands - got sent off to fight, that the female population left behind were literally sex-starved. Many would open their legs for no greater price that a pair of stockings. In fact, during the build-up towards D-Day, with hundreds of thousands of comparatively rich, handsome Yanks supplanted over-here, over paid, and over-sexed; the issue became one of genuine political concern. By the time hostilities ended, almost 60,000 British women had found American husbands. And that could only have been the tiniest tip of a hanky-panky iceberg.How such judgemental Victorian prudery managed to almost instantly re-emerge with peacetime is therefore all the more inexplicable.Nevertheless; that's how it was. And Coward's movie encapsulates those social attitudes wonderfully well. Most of what we see entails the desperate longings, the romantic assertions and the hastily contrived liaisons. It's all very chaste. They do, in fact, get it together at least once. The only clue we see of this is when the hero is caught dressing himself in a friend's apartment (our heroine has already left). The friend has given him carte-blanche freedom of access in his own absence should he ever need it, but clearly not for the purpose of seducing married women. We see his embarrassed shame at discovery. He, after all, is single; but he has still managed to betray the trust of his best friend.Our heroine, on the other hand, is a married women, and her betrayal is of the profoundest. The adulterous relationship is a passing thing, but now she must reconcile herself to its guilt for the rest of her life.Their whole experience is largely played-out against a backdrop of railway stations and roaring trains. Moments of tenderness are as temporary as any meetings at a station, Passion surges like the powerful but anonymous locomotives. The noirish lighting is beautifully realised, frequent gloom lingers over their encounters like doomed hope. Love and loss, desire and guilt, the bittersweet paradoxes of physical joy.Towards the end of the movie, after they have parted for ever, we see the heroine at home with her husband. It's a comfortable middle-class lounge. She is half lost in her lost dream. The husband in kindly and solicitous. Perhaps he doesn't know the extent of her betrayal, but it's clear that he knows there was something and spares her feelings from undue questions.In this day and age it's almost impossible to imagine those stifling social mores of half a century ago.</fullReview>

Its craftsmanship is sublime, and its sense of place inspired. Carnforth railway station has become an unlikely Mecca for the film's fans.

		<fullReview>tragedy in which trevor doesn't get any on account of silly woman.Wow! how the boundaries have shifted! This brilliant film presents an exquisite peephole into 1940s mores, and with utter conviction shows an archetypal temptation presented to two people and which she, for reasons never explicit but nevertheless alluded to more than sufficiently, resists and ultimately declines. He parts from her, sadder, wiser, unutterably frustrated and disappointed but groaningly acknowledging 'yup, that'how things are.' A remake today? same conclusion perhaps, but after a LOT more intellectual and physical testing of the parameters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Comment on the Accent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the second time last night. This time I was startled by how very much "Laura's" voice and accent sounded like the late Princess Diana, and conveyed much of the same sadness she did when her love for Prince Charles was dead.Here we have an ordinary upper class housewife enjoying her Thursday routine and by allowing herself to get swept up in fantasy risks losing everything. As things progressed (rather quickly) both parties knew there were too many people (spouses and children) in the picture for things to ever have worked out. Going away "for a new job" made the ending of their affair much easier on them both and they both knew it.Good acting all around and a movie whose message will linger.....while the grass may seem greener on the other side, there's no place like home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indiscretion of a British Housewife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A housewife has an affair with a doctor she encounters at a railway station. Lean started his directing career with four films written and produced by Coward. This is the last and most celebrated of the four, a simple love story marked with the visual elegance that would be the trademark of the director. Howard is fine as the doctor while Johnson's performance as the woman is rather uneven. The score consists solely of Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto, and while it adds a wistful quality to the film, it is somewhat overused. Based on a play by Coward, the dialog is at times a bit trite, more apt for a teen romance than an adult drama. The narration is at times superfluous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice little drama, ahead of its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie handles a pretty delicate matter, at least for 1945 movie standards, when a middle aged married woman gets tempted to cheat on her husband when she falls for another married man whom she met at the train station.The theme of adultery of course wasn't too popular in the '40's but the movie in now way feels as if its deliberately trying to be controversial or groundbreaking. It's a movie that simply tells the story of average normal people, with real-life feelings and emotions.I call this movie a little drama since it's a British movie, made without a big budget or any big stars in it, though Trevor Howard became a well known name later in his career. It's also a movie set at limited locations and it of course is mostly set at the train station and its small café.Kind of ironic that this movie got directed by David Lean, who would later make many great big epics, such as "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "Doctor Zhivago" and "Lawrence of Arabia".It's a nicely directed movie, that keeps things going, without ever getting sentimental or over-the-top with any of its emotions. Also the story itself is kept simple, without ever heading into any sidetracks. Here is the story and this is how it is. Nothing more, nothing less. With this movie Lean also earned his first Oscar nomination and it was one of the first movies to win at the Cannes Film Festival.A real great little humble drama from David Lean!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! Full of wonderful tensions and middle class hang ups</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderful black and white film works so well because it is about what was then a terrible taboo. The friendship of the couple develops into a deep and unrequited love. A need. An ache. An itch that cannot be scratched. A love that can never be admitted to those around them. Yet it is true nevertheless and its denial does not make it any the less. The intensity of finding love in this way is violent, shocking and disturbing - made all the more powerful for the fact that both of them are in committed relationships. The painful sexual tension and frustration make this a delicious treat. A wonderful score and atmospheric location make this a visual, musical and emotional roller coaster. This film is an admission, a revelation, a vindication, a solace and testament.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passion with a British twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a timelessness that shines more than sixty years after the film was released. There is a torrid love affair going on between two strangers who meet secretly at a train station. The viewerw can understand the depth of the feeling and the agony of unrequited love.Their love is hidden from family and friends and no one must ever know their real feelings, because that was the accepted convention. Thus, raging passion seems all the more engulfing because the couple accept the limits that this affair can never be intimate. The rousing music of Rachmaninoff is wonderful and rather unrestrained; however, it is somewhat strange given the understated role of the two leading characters. I was very impressed by the acting of Celia Johnson. This is a actress who performed mainly on stage and who was known to the public in few movie roles, e.g. In Which We Serve and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (she was outstanding in both). She is the sweet and passionate housewife whose life becomes unhinged by the presence of a caring medical doctor in the person of Trevor Howard, who steps in to give routine medical aid. From that point on,the romance becomes impossible to escape without breaking their hearts.The time and place are not at all clear because it could be set in suburban London or another English suburb in the 1930's or 40's; I found this lapse somewhat glaring but since it was made in 1946, I took that as the actual time. A beautiful film in black and white, this is a story of falling in love, breaking it off, then going on with the pain of what might have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The experience of the film is more than a mere encounter, while the emotions there-after are anything but brief.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may not have seen any of David Lean's work from prior to this 1945, suburban drama, but it would seem before he was taking on the broad and war themed epics he is more commonly known for in Laurence of Arabia and The Bridge Over the River Kwai, he was taking on much more smaller, but equally epic in their own right, projects like Brief Encounter. Films like Brief Encounter get across a sense of the grand or of the 'epic' through facial expressions and reactions on the character's behalf. They are driven by emotion, feeling and action; a sense of danger but a sense of excitement. Films like Brief Encounter can turn a relatively mundane event like a train passing through a station, and make it dramatic or visually exciting; through sheer horror or otherwise.Brief Encounter might be one of the films others refer to when attempting to label Lean with an auteur status of some sort. The film is, essentially, a relatively routine story about a female meeting a male and becoming rather fond of one another. What Lean does is make it seem as anything but familiar or 'routine', through a series of conventions and ideas including, but by no means limited to, telling the film through a female perspective and encompassing a certain taboo feel to the film by having both characters married, but continuing with this affair of sorts anyway.The film begins with a certain Laura Jesson (Johnson) sitting in a train station café with a man, a doctor, named Alec Harvey (Howard). Another woman comes over and sits down with them, happily nattering away and ruining what we will later discover to be quite an important moment for both individuals. The individual talking away like she does acts as an immediate distraction for the audience, perhaps forcing us into listening to what she is saying rather than observing what the other two are expressing: a certain angst on their faces. We feel there might have been something between them and this is confirmed later on when, on the train home, Laura provides a voice-over detailing she wants her immediate 'feelings' to 'pass'.The film is, primarily, narrated to the audience as a would-be confession to Fred Jesson (Raymond), Laura's husband whom she sits opposite in the evening upon getting home and 'speaks' to. This seems to suggest what a woman's (for the time) behaviour should reflect, but demonstrates Laura as an oppositionalist to this ideation. Someone that should not have indulged in the near-affair activity she has been for the past few weeks, plus, when the time comes that it ends, she does not even confess to the husband who should, as the man of the house and dominant figure, have the right to know. Rather, she keeps it to herself and us the audience, blurring the lines between what is essentially a confession to us but also a placing of us within he female perspective ? a forcing, for the males in the audience, to see things from a woman's point of view and the problems that arise in being labelled the 'lesser' of the two genders. Laura does, at one point, even offer an apology for loving this other man.The scenes in which the love blooms mostly carry that very sweet and soft natured tone. If the two go to the cinema, it's as if what's showing and how good it was is immaterial to the fact they are out together and actually there. Additionally, if they row off course on the lake and into a low bridge, getting a bit dirty as they try to get back on course comes with the territory. The point of all this amounts to the distinct change in mood Lean applies to this text, his daytime and very upbeat scenes of the pair twinned with dark, gloomy and nighttime set scenes of both danger and guilt; two examples of which might be Laura around at Alec's apartment before one of Alec's acquaintances arrives and comes close to seeing them both there as well as the following scene in which Laura 'feels like a criminal' for having to 'escape' Alec's apartment.The prior writings on this film seem to allude to a new found identification for women, specifically following The Second World War. Perhaps the film is an anti-thesis of sorts to the ideation, if one is a woman, one must find a partner and settle down as soon as possible while systematically focus on raising two children (as Laura does in this film, one boy and one girl); keeping a neat and tidy house (as Laura does, thanks to lingering shots of their rather pristine living room) and making the dinner when required. In Brief Encounter, Laura goes through an experience following one of her many trips to a local town for supplies and so forth, that would have been of a far more pleasurable and less stressful nature had she not have subscribed to what she was 'required' to do as a young woman. It opens up some interesting issues to do with independence and individuality on the female's behalf, the kinds of which the text very much explores wonderfully well and is well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a complete masterpiece, but a classic indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BRIEF ENCOUNTER has three elements that insure it will always stay a classic: 1) the performances of Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard as lovers who, for dull and practical reasons, can not be together; 2) the memorable black and white imagery of steam trains rushing through the station in which much of the movie takes place; and 3) Sergei Rachmaninoff's excellent score (the composer, of course, died before the movie's production, but his concerto is edited to fit the movie so seamlessly that it could easily pass for an original score). The movie,however, also has one element that works against it, and that is the incessant voice over narration by Johnson's character. The movie does need the narration, but it needs much less of it. When the narration begins, it reveals an inner world that is hidden to the other characters, and establishes a dramatic contrast. But, as the movie continues, the narration more often than not merely restates what we see on screen and adds little to it. In fact, it sometimes ends up actually dulling what we see on screen rather than enhancing it. Despite the negative impact of Johnson's narration, the movie still has two powerful performances by actors playing somewhat passive characters. The stereotypical British reticence which is played for laughs so often is played here with a convincing, undeniable seriousness. And, since it is a David Lean movie after all, the setting of the film is a memorable character. The trains (which seem to make an appearance in every one of his good movies...) sweep people away, tempt suicide, and generally overpower the humans with their loud rumble and their giant clouds of smoke. When not around the train station, we are in various drab apartment interiors, and, in one dramatic break, on a stone bridge in a meadow. The characters would not be so intriguing if their lives did not play against such rich settings. BRIEF ENCOUNTER is especially interesting when played against BEFORE SUNRISE, another story of a brief encounter between two lovers on a train. While that film, made in 1995, is more true to how European and American lovers behave today, BRIEF ENCOUNTER is still perhaps more true to how we actually feel. BEFORE SUNRISE is a charming account of an encounter, but BRIEF ENCOUNTER really invites you to think about the choices that its characters make. Perhaps its greatest achievement is that it manages to dramatize its characters so intensely while still leaving the option of judgment to the viewer when the movie ends.The Criterion DVD, however, still leaves much to be desired. It does not even have a making of featurette. All it has is an old-fashioned commentary taken from the laserdisc, recorded at the time when audio commentaries were merely papers read out loud, rather than true commentaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never thought I would appreciate Rachmaninov's music until now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this last Christmas, and I was genuinely moved. This movie is so poignant and is a must-see, as it showcases the unique talent of David Lean. Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard as the "ordinary" lovers were perfect together, and Celia Johnson's monologues were so beautifully written, and flawlessly expressed. Also the depiction of the dull husband was very well done. This movie is important to many, because it tells the tale of doomed love, told beautifully here. There were some parts that I thought I was going to cry. Before I saw this movie, I never appreciated Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto as much as I do now. The perfect placement of it, was what made the movie what it is today. The music was the best element of this movie, and reminded me of the beautiful Vocalise by the same composer. You will be moved by this! 10/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic love that shows British cinema in proud light</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laura Jesson (Johnson) finds herself attracted to a married Doctor she meets at a train station and finds herself contemplating cheating on her husband.Comparing British cinema from the 40's to the 00's is like comparing a car and a motorbike. Both have means of getting places and where one is perfectly balanced, the other is harder to stabilize. If comparing Brief Encounter (1945) to Love Actually (2003), you know that the latter is the bike with an uncontrollable and unstable use of clichés which drives it into the predictable and poor section of British cinema whereas Brief Encounter takes a controversial concept and uses it in a comfortable manner to make for a film that reflects the true meaning of love, which arrives at an unpredictable destination.It's very sad to see British cinema has fallen away in the romance genre. Having viewed many British romances including Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love Actually, I find it amazing to think the same country produced this film, which contains the same ideology of facing love against all odds, but is handled in such a more delicate and consequential manner.Oscar nominated Celia Johnson steals each scene with a shy and analytical approach whereas Trevor Howard is that charming and likable symbol of hope, and not a cliché man with curly hair stereotype emerging from out of the blue.This film is all about the love story. Filmed just after the Second World War we see little evidence of the war in this setting as the film focuses upon social class. Made at a time when divorce was the last option for a married person we see drama and heart breaking moments because of Laura's social class. The posh voices, settings and dress codes will make you wonder what has happened to this country.Many may argue the film is now dated but how does the issue of betrayal and love really differ from modern cinema and significantly, real life? This ultimately feels different from the majority of current romances. There is inevitability about current films such as the ending. They are star driven clichés that do not have a point or purpose.Brief Encounter is a surprise. A shocking and riveting view, told in a dramatic flashback mode that questions betrayal and love. Composed with Sergei Rachmaninoff's beautiful score, we have arguably one of the finest British love stories.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Bridges of Madison County" of the 1940's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a hard time reviewing this movie. It causes many mixed emotions - but perhaps that was the intent of the writer and director. This tale reminds me somewhat of "Bridges Of Madison County", in that a bored housewife can so quickly find herself falling for a complete stranger. Also in both movies, the women had decent nice husbands, although a little on the boring, safe side - which makes the unfaithfulness all the more difficult to justify. Of course there is the huge difference in that BOMC results is a consummated adulterous affair, whereas BE does not - and of course that is probably due to a reflection in the times they were made (1945 vs.1995). But both movies are the same in that they ultimately do the right thing in the end and stay with their husbands. I'm still actually surprised that a 40's movie tackled the subject of an affair so openly. I guess it was considered okay provided the end result was the saving of the marriage...I don't know since that was way before my time.I found the cinematography quite beautiful and sweeping in the imagery conveyed - especially the train station scenes with the smoke were quite beautiful in black and white. I also loved that the music score was Rachmaninoff's Piano concerto No.2 - one of the most romantic pieces ever composed.My biggest downside is that I never really bought the chemistry between Johnson and Howard. I get that maybe they had purposely cast less-than attractive actors for the parts so ordinary folk could relate to them. But it made their relationship all the more unlikely in my opinion.I do think the redeeming part of the whole unfaithfulness is that she realizes ultimately that no good can come of the relationship - and is a statement for the preservation of a good, solid marriage. All marriages go through times of dull, stale, sameness - but if we all jumped ship for the first interesting bloke that comes along, where would our societies and families be? I have to say the writer and director write and present a very engaging tale. They are quite good at the melodrama and manipulating your feelings for the good or bad.I guess the bottom line is that this is perhaps viewed as a cautionary tale as something that could happen to anyone, as evidenced by Johsnon's character's own words:"I'm an ordinary woman. I didn't think such violent things could happen to ordinary people."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My fourth film from David Lean is yet further proof ? after the expressionistically atmospheric 'Oliver Twist (1948)' ? that the director is every bit as talented when he's not creating sweeping widescreen Technicolor epics. A glance at the brief plot outline for 'Brief Encounter (1945)' didn't exactly catch my interest, but the deceptively-simple story is handled so masterfully that my attention never waned. Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) is a happily-married housewife with two young children. For the duration of her marriage, she has remained dutifully loyal and absolutely content with her current situation; her husband, Fred (Cyril Raymond), is a plain and somewhat uninteresting man, but he loves her very much, and that's what matters most. Laura's tale unfolds in flashback, as she imagines recounting to her husband the emotional events of past weeks, as she came to fall in love with a charismatic married doctor, Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Following several chance meetings, as though fate were pushing them together, Laura and Alec begin their brief romantic liaison, despite the obvious immorality of their actions and the knowledge that their time together is devastatingly limited.In the early period of his directing career, Lean collaborated with producer/writer Noel Coward on four occasions, and 'Brief Encounter' is the result of their final partnership. The story was expanded from Coward's one-act place, "Still Life (1936)," and adapted by Anthony Havelock-Allan, Ronald Neame and Lean himself. In a refreshing change from most romantic pictures, 'Brief Encounter' depicts love as a frustrating, tormenting and even violent emotion; though Laura is at first enchanted by her affection for the handsome Alec, the guilt caused by her disloyalty threatens to destroy her emotionally, and the bitter fact that her love is ultimately doomed leads her almost to suicide. Robert Krasker's cinematography is beautifully moody, often using locomotive smoke {multiple pivotal scenes take place at a train station} as an effective aesthetic device. Some have noted the film's apparent ties to the film noir genre, with Lean choosing to shoot much of the film in rain-slicked streets, dimly-lit interiors and unglamorous industrialised train stations; the film's conclusion notes the futility of love, and its tragic, detrimental effect on comfortable family relationships.More than anything else, 'Brief Encounter' is an exploration of family morality. There's no doubt that Laura loves her husband, but her life with him is so tedious and unstimulating that her weekly shopping journeys into London are all that keep her functioning. Laura's romantic liaison with Alec fills her with an unbridled joy, an emotion that so overwhelms her that it is not until hours later that the ethical implications of her actions finally strike home. The devastating moment when she first finds herself lying to her husband, a minor but all-important detail, is one of the film's most powerful moments, more so when Laura later muses: "It's awfully easy to lie when you know you're trusted implicitly." With its sympathetic attitude towards marital infidelity, a film such as 'Brief Encounter' could never have been made in Hollywood. The Production Code {a.k.a. the Hays Code} strictly prohibited the portrayal of adulterous relationships that were "explicitly treated, or justified, or presented attractively." Nevertheless, the film was David Lean's greatest critical success to date, and his film was nominated for three Academy Awards {Best Actress, Best Director, Best Writing}, in addition to tying for the Grand Prize of the Cannes Film Festival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Brief encounter" (1945) directed by David Lean didn't worked from the same kind of feelings as from today than also at the time of its successful rehearsal. Namely, because the convoluted sentimentality concerning a lock frustration of this kind of human beings. In which those characters were at the mood, from a background installed before the war and whose intimacy was in the apparently shy approach. David Lean in this movie also had had as target two married people, whom after the war meet in a railway station and made love in a hotel nearby, during a short time before different trains arrive. At where after they go, but in opposed directions for the beginning of a more democratic open society and less asphyxiated for their common and illusory sensibility, as it was usual for other couples of the kind in a Europe with problems of reconstruction at the time. This movie symbolizes also the provincial middle class that took the opportunity to travel to the capital, should be for a little more of individual freedom than staying in family at countryside. Another point is the profession of the masculine character, a physician : it's more easy for the director at the time, when pressure out of the story was tremendous about prudery and boundary for mental strip-tease in private life as occasional adultery, cutting the tradition of the scarlet letter and interdiction or banning a woman from the community. No. It was an answer to the anxiety of all Mrs. Miniver of the time by the behavior of this dame here, but the medical exercise was also targeted as a kind of candidate to D.Juan, which it was not easy for the reputation of the gynecologists. The trend of this movie from that time just after the WWII finished, it was mainly the fact that most of its duration is plenty with the talks between two human beings, which was also somewhat forcing the traditional dramatic stand in such a motion pictures, about their common past failed because destiny and out of their own will for having another bid for the flashback of destroyed happiness. What does pretend David Lean with this kind of story, as a piece of lifetime, illustrated mainly by such a couple in tourism at the interior in this moment of the history ? Could be that the strength of the conflict between them became the lost opportunity of the past, it was also good as motivation for the explanatory agreement of their lives in the past, for this dramatic conception stepping up the feelings of such a carnality for their attractive skins and flesh desires for both - with the smell around them mixed in such a chemical magnetism of their eyes and noses -, compensation and too conciliation of the wounds from the two minds. Because the lack of self-esteem at the beginning of another cycle of affects, which put the physician alone and at the departure to South Africa ; and indifference for what the others are thinking about them, if they were next in the same kind of dilemma, as a situation concealed on the funny anonymous state of developing much more absence of prejudice and less irritating prude of themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmmaker David Lean is best remembered for the grandest of epic action adventure films such as Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai. Massive productions shot on location with casts of thousands, Lean was the master of the genre. Then there is Brief Encounter, an intimate tragic love story shot mostly in and around a train station. A polar opposite but every bit the polished masterpiece Lawrence is. For the most part it is a series of close-ups and two shots focusing on its two main characters played by Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson. Yet Lean is equally adept at achieving the same high level of powerful emotion found in the panoramic settings of his epics from two people sipping tea at a table in a train station. Trevor Howard is just right as the doctor whose innocent good samaritan act has him falling in love. His lack of movie star looks gives him an ordinary but sincere earnestness that allows you to sympathize with his infidelity. Celia Johnson as the everyday housewife is a wonder. Her guilt ridden narration coincides beautifully with her sad eyed visage of a woman struggling with her emotions. The scene where she finds herself falling in love with Howard registers perfectly on her face where, saying nothing you not only feel that love but also the melancholy of her situation. Touchingly subdued and understated it is the best female performance I have ever seen in a Lean film and one of the best in all of film, period.Contrasting the mannered performance of the leads are two station employees doing their own Cockney mating dance in a more earthy style. As the couple Joyce Carey and Stanley Holloway are absolute scene stealers, not only providing comic relief but giving the film a crucial balance that helps prevent it from becoming too maudlin or syrupy. Then there is the music score, Rachmaninoff's piano concerto #2. It is perfect background music for this romantic masterpiece that gets better with age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brief Encounter/1945/***1/2Main Stars: Celia Johnson Trevor HowardDavid Lean's Brief Encounter is a huge work of art. Yes, the story sounds unoriginal: When a married woman meets a man in a railway station and they both fall in love. But the process of it is what really stood out. The main character Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) is the dreadful looking, despondent wife who falls in love with Dr. Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) in a railway station. They first meet when she gets something in her eye and calls someone over because her eye is in deep pain. When they first meet, they don't seem to get involved that much but they sure do spot each other and go on their ways. Laura seems somewhat paranoid and crazy at times; talking to herself on the train and that starting to laugh for no reason too thinking badly about a woman who talks too much around her. She then goes home and notices she's been gone for a while now. She didn't want her husband to think suspiciously of her because she's been cheating on him. Then she starts to imagine back at the good times she and Alec had had together. This somewhat also reminds me of Vertigo because that's another story about a man and a woman that fall in love with each other and the woman is MARRIED! Or is she? The film is a bit more mysterious and suspenseful than I was envisioning it. I was envisioning just a dramatic love story but putting mystery and suspense in there makes the film even more enjoyable. May I add it was very well-acted too? This film also was fun to watch because of the quirky camera and the good music. This obviously wasn't as violent and involved as Wolfgang Petersen's surprising mystery thriller Shattered which was another dramatic love story which was actually pretty good. It had a pretty similar story to this film when it comes to the drama and the mystery even though this one is definitely tamer and didn't involve a murder of someone. Brief Encounter is obviously better than Shattered yet not as suspenseful. Yet Shattered will never be a classic and probably never was. It was just one of those pretty good violent/romance flicks that keep you watching. So this film is very enjoyable from beginning to end and waaaayyyy better than I expected which I didn't expect much from it even though I saw it got four stars in the TribTV TV guide. So I decided to flip to TCM to watch it and see if it was any good and it was great! Although it may have been great, the ending of the film was a bit over-dramatic. Laura was asked if she was okay by her REAL husband after she was done daydreaming and instead of replying with words, she started crying and that was it. Then you slowly see The End pop up on the screen and then the movie slowly fades away to black. Movie directed by David Lean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wonderful romantic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is is hauntingly romantic. It is so sexy. You can touch the sexual tension. Many of us have had similar relationships so passionate but never actually made love. This in itself makes it so special. Have you ever had such a passion? I have and the memory is still so hot in me many years later. Watch the film and place yourself in there. You will be so moved. You younger ones out there; watch it in candle light with your lover and a glass of wine. You will have a night to remember. If you get the chance go to Carnforth railway station and experience the place where it was filmed. The refreshment room is as it was in the film and there is a small museum to it and you can watch the film there. So if you have never seen it. Get it watch it you wont believe how moving it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lean's Early Romantic Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in 1944 while World War II was still raging and while London was barely recovering from bombings by German aircraft, director David Lean and writer Noel Coward's "Brief Encounter" remains a poignant film 60 years later. Recently, it was featured on cable's Turner Movie Classics and is also available on a fine DVD. It stars an all British cast- Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard head up the cast as Laura and Alec, would-be lovers who are married to other people but meet regularly to catch different trains in a train station. They naturally fall in love and are tempted to engage in an affair but the line of friendship is never truly crossed and they don't physically consummate their feelings. Now, of course, this is due to the powerful censorship in London at this time. Sex was a taboo subject even to married couples, even though Kinsey was at this time making his famous investigations and interviews on human sexuality. But also these are frigid, repressed British folk. Celia Johnson is not attractive (she is sickly thin and her eyes indicate she never got any sleep or something) and Trevor Howard is old looking and has haggard teeth (so does she) and their physicality is never really quite hot but it's a good film. It's moody, romantic and slow-moving. They watch films together, go boating together, and the structure is interesting. Laura narrates the tale of her "affair of the heart" as if she is recalling the past, writing it in her diary or even telling it to her husband. However, this can also get annoying. She's very talkative and a lot of times she is saying a lot of nothing. Her use of language was probably common or regional in parts of England. While men can still enjoy this classic movie, for it never really bores the audience, this film is clearly a woman's film. Celia Johnson is speaking on behalf of British women and she seems to be the incarnation of a romantic heroine from paperback romances that women read at the time. While there is no actual adultery, they have already "cheated" on each other's spouses in their hearts. Above all, this is an emotional affair. This quiet, intimate, reflective movie is a different animal from the huge, panoramic epics that director David Lean is most famous for - the 1962 classic Lawrence of Arabia and 1965's Doctor Zhivago. David Lean's early films were mostly films like this one. A great movie classic. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant Period Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lean's (1945) film Brief Encounter, based Noel Coward's play 'Still Life', is set somewhere South London in the late 1930's ? the late steam-age.We come into the genteel life of Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson), a comfortably off suburban housewife, as she moves into a personal crisis that we are privileged to share on a most intimate basis. Her true thoughts and feelings punctuate the external action as we hear a subversive and confidential commentary to which other characters are not privy.Mrs Jesson falls for a doctor (Trevor Howard) whom she meets by chance at the railway station during an afternoon shopping trip. Showing his professional credentials early on, by removing a piece of grit from her eye, he appears to be as much a gentleman of leisure as she is on weekday afternoons. They embark upon a fairly harmless romance that centres around visits to the cinema and the tea shop.No ordinary Tea-Shoppe this, though, boasting three quarters of a string quartet (exceptional performance by Irene Handl as an arthritic, provincial cellist) and fancying itself to be an outlying satellite of The Palm Court at The Ritz.With great supporting performances from the staff at the Station Buffet (particularly Joyce Carey and Stanley Holloway), Laura's loquacious friend Dolly Messiter (Everley Gregg) and her faithful, but not-so-sharp, husband Fred (Cyril Raymond) we are soon transported to a bygone era where we are quickly drawn into every aspect of their unusual preoccupations and neuroses.This film really captures the mood of the time and the underlying confusion and torment that besets these pretentious, stilted and unfulfilled individuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful romance, achingly heartfelt. It's almost impossible to remain unmoved.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lean's mastery of film technique is much in evidence in this quite remarkable film version of Noel Coward's play Still Life. In taking a short, stagebound piece of work and crafting it into an intriguingly non-linear, involving, deeply moving romantic drama, Lean serves up one of the very best British films of all-time; a masterclass of acting, mood, lighting, editing and photography. It would take a pretty strong heart not to get caught up by the love dilemma at the heart of the film; it's such a heartfelt piece of storytelling, so real, so honest, so easy to relate to. In the role that made him a star Trevor Howard is magnificent (he was never better in all his long career); and Celia Johnson conveys her emotions and inner turmoil quite brilliantly.Neglected housewife Laura (Celia Johnson) habitually frequents the nearby town of Milford every Thursday. She rides in by train, does her shopping, goes to see a movie, then has a drink at the station before returning home. One Thursday, quite by chance, she meets a young and enthusiastic doctor named Alec (Trevor Howard) at Milford Station. As if fated, they cross paths several times more and it quickly becomes apparent there is much more than just a casual acquaintance between them. Despite both being already married, they fall in love with each other almost instantly; and must face the horrible fact they can never truly be together as they have made their beds elsewhere. The film charts their blossoming romance and the devastating realisation that they're trapped in a love affair which can never end in true happiness.The film is, at its core, a story of two ideally suited lovers who have already married and started families with someone else. It's such a simple, unsophisticated story it terms of plot? but the real sophistication comes into effect via the brilliant examination of their aching emotional turmoil, the internal moral tug-of-war they undergo as they try to make sense of the consequences of this life-changing brief encounter. By mixing up the story chronology ? starting almost at the end, then tracking back to the start of the affair ? Lean cannily draws us in to the heartbreaking plight of the distraught couple. The music (by Rachmaninov), plus Robert Krasker's evocative photography, are merely the icing on this most delectable of cakes. Brief Encounter is, quite simply, one of the true greats and absolutely MUST be seen by any serious movie lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When I want to have a good cry, this it the one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I first discovered "Brief Encounter" in the early 80's. Ever since then it is the movie I pull out when I need a good old fashioned sob fest. So many perfect elements:-The bittersweet music of Rachmaninoff -The breathtaking B&amp;W cinematography-Trains as a metaphor for limited time, carrying people in and out of our lives (and of course there's the sexual subtext).-The writing. All you have to say is "Noel Coward". One of the best examples of opening up a play for the big screen. -A little comic relief provided by Stanley Holloway and Joyce Carey. -Trevor Howard, so charming and polite yet quietly passionate. -Celia Johnson, whose luminous eyes perfectly project a refined manner one minute, then disabling shame the next. -David Lean's direction. He obviously knew exactly what to do with all this repressed emotion and guilt. -A perfectly ironic and tragic climax.I won't bother with a plot rehash, but I will point out a few of my favorite moments.-The "date" where they take the boat out. Begins on such a carefree note, then ends in the boathouse with the tortured declaration of doomed love.-Laura on the train, day-dreaming about going to romantic places with Alec. Haven't we all done exactly that, only to have the dreams fade into reality.-The scenes following the one in the friend's apartment. Our modern sensibilities are bewildered by Laura's shame, but it's a testament to Celia Johnson's performance that we still have such empathy for her.-The walk to the platform when Alec reveals his "solution" to their situation. The look on her face and the way she says "Oh Alec" strikes a very specific nerve for me. Then the dialog when she's leaning out of the train window, and the train pulls away ever-so-slowly . . . probably the best heartbreakingly romantic scene ever. That is, UNTIL . . .-The Dolly Messiter scene, and the brilliant way it is telegraphed earlier in the film. Of course by that time I'm on my second box of tissue.I don't give many 10's, but this one was easy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most modern viewers won't like this film. They've been raised on films in which adultery is no issue whatsoever and you need exercise no control over your lust so they may be confused as to why Alec and Laura are making such a big deal out of it. That says more about modern society than it does about the quality of the film.The film is beautiful- the ultimate romantic movie. Laura (Celia Johnson), a 'happily married' middle-aged housewife, meets Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) by chance at a train station- he helps get a piece of grit out of her eye. Laura thinks nothing of it but as they bump into each other on their daily routines, it escalates into full-blown love. But can love conquer all? What I love about the film is that it makes no moral judgements on the characters- Laura and Alec are not portrayed as evil and Laura's husband isn't portrayed as an idiot. Laura and Alec are simply normal people who want something more from their lives. There's nothing wrong with Laura's marriage- it's perfectly 'normal'- but the possibility of true romance is too attractive to resist.The film manages to be romantic without ignoring the realities of life. Yes, the social restrictions of the forties mean that Laura and Alec's anguish may come across as melodramatic to a modern viewer but there is no reason why modern viewers shouldn't be able to identify. We all live relatively ordinary lives which are for the most part satisfactory- or at least, not unhappy. But there's a little part of everyone that wonders whether they could be happier if their life was different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice small love drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brief Encounter is a romance film by David Lean that uses a common but rarely perfected formula: a married woman meets a man that she secretly falls in love with, and then struggles to make sense of it all. The interesting part is the conclusion, which could turn out in a myriad of ways. This premise reminds me of Lean's later epic, Dr. Zhivago (although the woman and men roles are reversed in it), but is much more centralized.The film's cast is very small, mainly focused on three characters. Laura Jesson is the woman in question, who is a completely typical person. The whole film is narrated by her and witnesses from her viewpoint. My favorite character is her husband, Fred Jesson. He is a trusting and laid back man, who is usually seen working on crossword puzzles. Laura realizes that she is not getting the satisfaction she wants from the marriage after meeting Dr. Alec Harvey at a train stop. He is a woman's man: caring, handsome, intelligent, and personal. Throughout the film, we get to see Laura frequently visit Dr. Harvey, which puts her loyalty to Fred into question.The film started off slowly, but became much more interesting after the first twenty minutes or so. It is very dialog and narration heavy, which is hard to understand at first but gets clearer along the way. To add some flavor, classical music is often used to accompany the scenes.I was unsure if I would like Brief Encounter before watching it (and even as I started watching it), but I ended up liking it very much. The story is rather simple, but is fluently put together and interesting. It also helps that the characters are easy to relate to. If you don't mind a little older black and white film, then I would encourage you to watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stanley Holloway remembered.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What fun to see a younger and slimmer Stanley Holloway as the stationmaster. Not too much of a stretch to imagine him aging, swelling up in girth, and transmogrifying into Alfred P. Doolittle. I could even hear that British music hall voice: "All I want is a place somewhere, far away from the midnight air..." Not to mention Trevor Howard. Was this suave British gentleman really going to show up 25 years later as the craggy, chisel-jawed juggernaut of a priest in David Lean's "Ryan's Daughter"?To fully grasp the mood and intent of the movie, one needs to understand Noel Coward, whose personality and works were a phenomenon of his time. Muted and laced with prickly repartee a bit beyond the threshold of real-world conversation, Coward struck a fine balance between the humor and gravity of emotions roiling just skin-deep under the constraints imposed by British politesse. In that light, the main disappointment in an otherwise moving work of art lies in the overly long, stultifying voice-overs.I first heard "Brief Encounter" on the radio at least 65 years ago. One memory has stuck with me from that broadcast, the dullish, nicey-nice husband, played by Nigel Bruce (then the preeminent Dr. Watson to Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes) and his warm-hearted lines addressed to his wife toward the end of the play. A potential spoiler, I'll not quote them here; suffice it to say, they weighed significantly on an 8-year-old boy in Los Angeles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief Encounter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film about how even the smallest meeting could uplift someone, and maybe find their new love, from producer Noël Coward, and director Sir David Lean (The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia). The film opens where the film will eventually end, with quiet housewife and mother Laura Jesson (Oscar nominated Celia Johnson) imagining that she is confessing an affair to her passionless husband Fred (Cyril Raymond). She spent most of her time shopping and to the pictures, that is until she meets Dr. Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) at the train station, after he helps get grit out of her eye. A simple and forgetful act, but she passes him quite often, and they finally sit together for lunch and a proper talk. They got on so well that they decide to meet each other every Thursday for lunch and maybe the pictures. Then it finally happens, he admits to loving her, and so does she, but she keeps thinking about her son and is a rather sad, but appropriate ending, what should have been a heartfelt goodbye was distracted by chatty and irritating Dolly Messiter (Everley Gregg), and the last thing he did before leaving was placing his hand on her shoulder. Also starring My Fair Lady's Stanley Holloway as Albert Godby, Joyce Carey as Myrtle Bagot, Marjorie Mars as Mary Norton and Margaret Barton as Beryl Walters, Tea Room Assistant. Johnson and Howard together deliver magnificent performances as the anybody in the world couple, I can agree with the critics, it is sheer ordinariness that makes them so memorable, including a great use of Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto, this is one of the greatest (classic) romantic drama stories of all time. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Director for Sir David Lean and Best Writing, Screenplay. It was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and it was number 72 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the saddest, most heartbreaking films I've ever seen (along with Dr. Zhivago and The English Patient)! I won't bother giving a short description of the film since most of the comments have already done so. I keep wondering how I would have reacted if I were in the same situation--would I have shown the same restraint? Imagine the last scene...the lovers are together in a cafeteria for the last time...The Doctor will be leaving for Johannesburg with his family for good and they spend the whole afternoon together, before his departure to Africa...(had it been produced today, it would have had the prerequisite sex scenes!)--they go out to the country, walk over a bridge they had visited once before and then drive back to the train station for their final goodbye and the lead actress has to suspend her emotions because a friend of hers walks in and joins them at their table and then he has to leave to catch his train! How painful that must have been! And she could not show her emotions but you could feel it palpably as you watch the movie.I don't think this film will excite young people today--nobody ever says "I love you" anymore--more so, "I will love you 'til I die." I just love this gem of a movie. Great acting--with that restrained, British stiff upper lip emoting so much unlike today's young people who yell and cuss! Ha-ha! I also hope to watch the 1974 version with Richard Burton and Sophia Loren again but they haven't made it into DVD format yet. Sigh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It really pleases me to see the very positive responses here to this gem of a movie. I recently read Kevin Brownlow's epic, detailed biography of David Lean, and I'm still mystified how Lean went from intimate character dramas such as this one, and even GREAT EXPECTATIONS and OLIVER TWIST, to the big-screen epics which placed far more emphasis on scenery and very little on character. I'm not knocking the epics, because I've enjoyed them as well, but at the end of LAWRENCE OF ARABIA one knows about as much about Lawrence as one did about 3-1/2 hours earlier. . .unlike Alec and Laura in this film, whom we know very well after 1-1/2 hours, or Pip and Miss Havisham in EXPECTATIONS, characters who leapt off the screen and endeared themselves to us (it also helped that some really gifted actors &amp; actresses played these roles).I never tire of BRIEF ENCOUNTER - it's one of the screen's great romances, perhaps because it doesn't quite end "happily ever after". It remains simple, honest, and unforgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hazy Nostalgia... time has changed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"As time goes by...", the theme song of Casablanca is lingering in my mind when I recall the scenes of this magnificent classic movie, those were the days. I don't remember I watched it on TV or in a small cine-art movie house. Anyway, not until today do I realize that `Blithe Spirit' is also a work by David Lean, a movie woke my spirit up when I was watching it definitely a late night at home on TV some years ago.What makes a master a master? Master is a veteran or a genius who is able to handle both blockbuster productions and decently budgeted works with panache, the films leave marks on people's memory, they make people remember them. Needless to doubt, David Lean is one. Master Lean is sacrosanct in the Brit film industry, who can forget the formidable A Passage to India, Doctor Zhivago, Hobson's Choice (the title has become an idiom in the English language, frighteningly powerful), Lawrence of Arabia, Ryan's Daughter, The Bridge on the River Kwai etc.Very likely Laura and Alec's romantic episode can take place in real life now so easily if a bored housewife commutes so routinely between two confined points meeting the same group of passengers and one day gets familiar with any one of them on any ordinary day. Unlike today, at that conservative time, any "unusual" acts of married women, especially middle-class women, were the delicious ingredients, the juicy titbits of the neighbours' gossipy recipes. The pain, the tension and the temptation come into sight when their seven weekly trysts at the refreshment room of the railway station are being scrutinized so closely by every eye around them in hot pursuit.Unattainable love is the most heartbreaking and the most unforgettable because it is a living fantasy. Fortunately and unfortunately movies offer such fantasies. When Laura and Alec's relationship starts, they are seeing a movie trailer "Flames of Passion". It somehow foretells that this relationship can only exist in movies. Lean has wonderfully and successfully captured the emotional nuances of Laura in form of narration. After Laura bade Alec farewell, viewers find her in the living room of her house with her husband, yet she is losing herself completely in her own imagination with two big blank eyes, envisioning the `happy journeys' with Alec in Paris, Venice. She is overwhelmed with memories and in a sudden, her suppressed emotions, despair and remorse erupt and she burst into tears in Fred, her reality, her husband's arms. That's the most impressive scene to me, she was flung out into realty from fantasy.Time has changed. If Laura and Alec lived in our time, their story or chaste romance or clandestine affair or `adultery' would be like brushing teeth or going to toilet, nothing special. Fate is merciful to their on-screen regret. Their unfinished business is finally completed by another pair a couple of generations later. The train takes departure from Carnforth Station, UK and passes through the invisible tunnel across the Atlantic to New York and New Jersey in the new world, the USA four decades later in the mid-80's, a more open era, a more opulent epoch. Who are they? Molly and Frank (Meryl Streep and Robert De Niro) in `Falling in Love'. They run into each other when doing shopping for Christmas and meet again on the train between NY and NJ and the story goes on. Again, it's the train, commuting time provides time for affair. Well, they are luckier to have a happier ending but please no sequel. Sequel may lead to break-up and make the entire `romance' a remorse. Perhaps we have to give a standing ovation to Doris and George in `Same Time, Next Year' because they have more self-control and patience with their yearly affair so they can keep it for more than 1/4 century.I have not read the original script by Noel Coward or attended any play on stage so it's hard to tell if the movie out-performs the theatrical production or not. I hope a local drama group will produce it one day. As for the movie, it is able to stand the tests of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of technical and narrative craftsmanship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BRIEF ENCOUNTER is Lean's last "small" picture, as well as being the last of his collaborations with the great Noel Coward, as Lean was determined to be known for something more than just being the best interpreter of Coward's work on the screen. The film is based on Coward's STILL LIFE, a one-act play about a middle-aged man and women -- both married with children, he a physician and she a suburban housewife -- who start an illicit affair that is doomed from the beginning. Though Lean expands the story in his adaptation, not a shot of film is wasted on the nonessential and not a single essential aspect of the original work is lost in the translation.The tragic lovers first meet inside a small deli at a train station located in Milford, England just before the start of W.W.II. Laura Jesson, the housewife (poignantly played by Celia Johnson), travels to Milford from her home by train every Thursday where she spends the day shopping, having lunch with friends, taking in movies, etc. Dr. Alec Harvey (played by Trevor Howard), a general practitioner, meets up with her sometime after he agrees to assist his friend Stephen (played by Valentine Dyall) at Stephen's practice in Milford. Alec travels to and from his home by train, which frees Stephen to service his other patients at a second practice in London a few days each week during which time Alec resides at Stephen's flat. Alec departs on a train that leaves just before Laura's in the early evening . .. every Thursday.Their first meeting occurs when Laura gets a bit of coal dust in her eye from the stack of a passing train just outside the deli. She hurries inside for help from the matron who runs the deli (Myrtle, played by Joyce Carey). Naturally, the good doctor, who is sitting at a nearby table awaiting his train, comes to her aid. This brief encounter sets up the logic for the more friendly and personal chance encounter that occurs the following Thursday in a small restaurant in Milford, which marks the beginning of the end of the affair, one that is never consummated by anything more than three kisses. Indeed, while they fall deeply in love and remain so to the end and beyond, they will meet only three more times, on Thursdays of course, in Milford. And these are the only times they will see or talk with one another throughout the film before their affair of three weeks ends. This is not so much a film about a doomed romance as much as it's a film about two people who come to fully appreciate the extent of the wretched emptiness and loneliness in their own hearts when they discover in each other the kind of companionship that is possible between kindred spirits. Though they share moments of the most exquisite joy, they are nonetheless constantly tormented by the guilt and the shame that comes with the little lies and evasions they play out to conceal their love from others, primarily from Laura's husband, Fred, a kind but self-absorbed man (played by Cyril Raymond), and her friends in Milford. These are two very decent people, and they are also tormented for the sake of their respective spouses and children. It is these dark feelings that doom the relationship, as they both agree that the pain of deceit is greater than the delight of their love and would utterly destroy them and the lives around them. Before they become more deeply involved, they decide that Alec must take the position in Johannesburg, South Africa that has been offered him and go their separate ways forever.Nothing is directly revealed about Alec's relationship with his wife and children. Indeed, they are never seen and are only mentioned twice in the film . . . just so we know that he has a family in another town. However, Alec's loneliness is evident from the beginning, and we see him come to life in Laura's company; the passion he has for his vocation as he reveals himself to her. We also see that Johnson's character is somewhat frivolous, but this aspect of her makeup is by design, a contrivance behind which she hides herself. Inside is a sensible and caring person, an adult, who comes out from behind her hiding place to meet with Alec and is about to endure the greatest heartache of her life. And herein lies the key as to why the film works so well, for Laura narrates the story. We are let into her psyche, and watch and listen as she undergoes a process of self-realization and discovery. It's a painful journey accented by the comings and the goings of the trains. Further, the story is told in flashback, an unspoken confessional to her husband in voiceover as they sit together at their home in the evening -- he reading, she knitting -- shortly after she has returned from Milford where she and Alec have just ended the affair. In addition to the visual and voiceover narratives, the notes of Rochmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 rise and fall just under and over the narratives as the mood demands. It plays briefly during the opening credits along with the attention-grabbing opening sequence and then is reintroduced to accompany the voiceover narrative just under the characters' dialogue. It swells up to support the drama's emotional tension at key moments or to rush the rails along with the passing trains. The music is ingeniously attached to the narrative, as it naturally flows in the background from the radio in Laura's and Fred's parlor! To reinforce this, Lean briefly breaks into the narrative at the mid-way point, and we are jerked back into the parlor, into the now, when Fred interrupts Laura's thoughts to reduce the volume on the radio. Naturally, the break in the narrative occurs at just the right moment . . . before it continues on again.Also, the film's larger story begins and ends with the scene of the couple's final breakup, which is interrupted by Dolly (played by Everley Gregg), a boorish twit and one of Laura's acquaintances who also travels to and from Milford by train. The interruption of the couple's final goodbye is balanced against the earlier interruption that occurs at the flat in Milford when the couple is in danger (?) of consummating the relationship just as Stephen arrives home early one night. Laura flees from the flat out the back door. If the film's narrative breaks down at all, it's at this point, for we are privy to the conversation that ensues between Alec and Stephen .. . after Laura's departure. Stephen discovers the decidedly feminine scarf that Laura inadvertently leaves behind and voices his disappointment in Alec rather harshly. Stephen of course has no idea who the fleeing woman is; he just knows it's not Alec's wife! I believe this violation of the point of view works, as it is brief, there is appropriately no voiceover and it is immediately followed by a sequence in which poor Laura is running through the pouring rain as if a hoard of demons were after her. We are to understand that the conversation is both real and accurately imagined by Laura at the same time. I suppose some critics would complain, but I think it's brilliant. In any event, it strikes me as the height of absurdity to believe that Lean, who was one of the industry's leading film editors before he took the director's chair, simply failed to notice it.As it is indispensable, there is at least one other aspect to the film that must be acknowledged. Through Laura's eyes, we watch the delightfully uninhibited exchanges between Albert (ticket inspector, played by Stanley Holloway) and Myrtle the matron, the working class lovers. These sequences smartly support the narrative and serve to underscore Alec's and Laura's repressed desperation and the flatness of their lonely middleclass existences.This is Lean's most masterfully constructed film, and all of the performances, especially Johnson's, are solid gold.The only weakness, and it is so minor as to make this complaint almost petty, is the unnecessary voiceover touching on Laura's brief moment of madness when she rushes out of the deli with the notion of throwing herself in front of an oncoming train just after Alec leaves the station for the last time. Aside from the action itself, the creative lighting (which briefly narrows around her, plunging everything else into darkness) and camera work (which tilts the frame and the world around her) that are employed here is all the narration needs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another accomplishment for David Lean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think about this film in retrospect, I wonder why I was so smitten with it. As a general rule, I only love romances if I have a crush on the actress; Celia Johnson is very pretty but she's not Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's." And this sort of peaon to bourgeoisie love made impossible by society is exactly what I find myself unable to finish in novel form. Yet it works so well, and I'm totally swept away by this movie. Its pinnacle for me is a brief sequence, where Johnson's character narrates her hopes of traveling to far-off lands with her new lover and we see dreamlike images of the two in Paris, Venice, the tropics...just hazy enough that our imagination carries us away. And ultimately the story is about dreams and yearning, not any specific middle-class love affair/society tale. I can only credit this universal dreamer's appeal to David Lean; I'm unfamiliar with Noel Coward's other work and while the story and dialogue are excellent it's really the direction that carries the viewer off, in my opinion. David Lean is at the top of my list of favorite directors, primarily on the basis of "Lawrence of Arabia" (which also hovers at the top of my list of favorite movies). He is able to use imagery and mood to tap into our deepest dreams and desires so that his stories take on a mythical quality all beyond preportion to their subject. Clearly the protagonist wants to escape her life in dreary England but a key to the film is that this England is romantically dreary, not dull but melancholy. That's all I can say, it's very hard to convey this film's appeal. Just see it and you will understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This story of an adulterous affair between Dr Alec Harvey (played charmingly by Trevor Howard) and Mrs Laura Jesson (a magnificent Celia Johnson) is one of the most poignant love stories I have ever seen. The tale is told from Laura's perspective, and to the credit of Celia Johnson for her extremely convincing performance, the story is very engaging and the audience can't help but sympathize with Laura. David Lean has done a brilliant job in portraying this tragic love story - the tragedy of meeting 'the One' too late in one's life.If watching this doesn't break your heart, you must have no heart. Shame that they don't make this kind of film any more these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me it's one of the most touching movies I've ever seen. A melodrama at its best. The two protagonists fall in love with each other, but their fear from the consequences prevents them from realizing their love. Without courage, sometimes there's no love and - well - happiness. It's a movie with a strong gay subtext (writer &amp; producer Noel Coward was gay himself): it's not a same-gender love, but the love between two orderly married people that is considered impossible - the movie is set in 1945. Everybody who has seen this movie will never forget it. And as a consequence Rachmaninov's Piano Concert No. 2 (the movie's leitmotiv) will always remind him/her of this marvellous picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although to today's audiences Laura and Alec must seem incredibly anachronistic we must remember this is England in 1945. It looks like another country populated by people who speak with extraordinary accents. But it probably seemed like that anyway to many cinema goers of the day! For all that David Lean and Noel Coward have conjured up an absolute masterpiece.The intensity of this love story, for me, is best displayed in the scene between Alec and Laura in the refreshment room at Milford station. Alec is trying to explain his work to Laura and she admits to not understanding - never the less he continues. As Trevor Howard makes each medical term he uses sound erotically charged Celia Johnson almost faints into her Banbury as she succumbs to his metaphorical ardour. It is one of the sexiest scenes in cinema with the actors keeping their clothes on - a hard act to try and follow today. David lean directs with great subtlety and shows us, exquisitely, two people falling deeply in love. And finally, without Rachmaninov's second piano concerto employed to such great effect this would have been a lesser film. If you have seen it you will know what I mean and if you haven't go and rent it NOW. It's life changing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We also did this in film studies and we felt it reflected the social differences between then and now. The stigma of divorce and infidelity was extremely severe then. Nowadays no one raises an eyelid at it. The wrestling with the feelings of guilt engendered by the liason probably haven't altered, by the way of expression has. Falling in love at unsuitable times and with unsuitable people, well that hasn't changed at all, but society's views about it have. Illegitimacy and single parents were frowned on, in fact probably the only single parent were widows and blue stockings. Bastard children became more common due to the number of irregular liaisons during the war but were seldom brought up by the blood mother. I know, I was one of them. All in all, this is a social classic. OK the dialogue is a bit stilted, but all the British films of that era suffered from the upper class accent syndrome. And I think that compared to today, people were a lot stuffier, both in their speech and general demeanour. This was the time when any lady of good reputation wouldn't be seen dead without her hat and gloves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest love stories of all time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brief EncounterReview By Joe Donohoe'Brief Encounter' is a Noel Coward film made in 1945. 'Brief Encounter' is a Romance/Drama. David Lean directed the film while Noel Coward, Ronald Neame and Anthony Havelock-Allan helped produce it.'Brief Encounter' is a very simple story in which Celia Johnson plays a housewife named 'Laura Jesson', who always goes shopping in the local town on a Thursday. She buys groceries, goes to the cinema and stops by the local teashop to have refreshments. Whilst she is in the teashop she meets a local town doctor named Alec Harvey (played by Trevor Howard). Although they are already married, they gradually fall in love with each other. They continue to meet every Thursday in the same café. But they both know that their love is impossible.I thought 'Brief Encounter' was a film I wouldn't enjoy. Usually black and white romances aren't my sort of genre, but after I finished watching 'Brief Encounter' I realised that this film is truly marvellous.The on-screen chemistry between Laura Jesson and Trevor Howard was superb not to mention the quality of the acting by the supporting cast. Celia Johnson acts superbly as 'Laura Jesson'. She was 100% convincing, and I'm surprised she didn't win any awards for her superb acting. Trevor Howard acts the role of Dr. Alec Harvey extremely well, totally convincing, great acting, and had a real presence on-screen. The direction by David Lean was great, you could see that he played a big part in making this film what it is. The lighting was also fantastic; another great aspect of this film.All I can say about this film is positive; I really think this is one of the greatest love stories ever in film history. If only film directors and producers could make memorable films like 'Brief Encounter' now.This film is a must-see, A true masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot in breath-taking black and white, "Brief Encounter" is a true gem of British Cinema. It is a simple story passionately told, we see an ordinary housewife step outside her mundane life and begin an affair with a dashing doctor. David Lean builds tension and gives us a glimpse of the psychology of these characters by the way in which he constructs his shots. A classic moment comes when Laura (Celia Johnson) contemplates suicide, Lean uses the sudden appearence of a train and scream of its whistle to convey her desperation. For me "Brief Encounter" is so great because it has such a downbeat feel to it. It is, in short, one of the truely honest films about love ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brief Encounter remains a classic simply because of the timeless integrity of its subject matter.Celia Johnson plays Laura, a morally upright woman contemplating an extra-marital affair with a charming doctor called Alec (Trevor Howard). What is remarkable is that you feel sympathy for Laura even though she is falling into the realms of adultery. The acting is so impressive simply because they are playing characters you are likely to meet in real life. Also, the reason why this romance works so much more than most commercialised Hollywood romances, is because the leads are not particularly attractive. They are normal, every day people, who meet by chance. It is something which could happen to anyone.The direction from Lean is educated and mature. He does not overplay any scenes, he simply lets to tension build within a likely situation like it would do in real life. There is no supernatural or extra-ordinary element to this film. It is effective because of its relation to reality.I recommend this British classic to anyone and everyone.</fullReview>

Modern remakes have not come close at all (Richard Burton was in one).The train station scene had my sister (she was 20, I was 10) in tears and she went out and bought the Rachmaninoff concerto (10 vynil discs, no LP yet).Compared to modern depictions of adultery (Fatal Attraction) it is virgin pure. Perhaps a much criticized De Niro/Streep film called "Falling in Love" comes close in the feeling it generates (in this film sex is not consummated either).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfairly forgotten movie of David Lean</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My title concerns rather the younger generation, too absorbed in watching "Sin City" and other dismaying commercial and violent flick to give a chance to anything in black&amp;white.Although, Brief Encounter has a stunning cinematography: the shots of the trains and the steam from the engines in the station, and the very inspired and very modern direction of Lean, considering the date (1946): particularly the close shot of Mrs Messiter when she never stops speaking, or the camera leaning slowly on the side as an effect of collapse to reinforce the drama when Laura feels overwhelmed by Alec's departure. Amazing.The soundtrack is using the gorgeous second concerto of Rachmaninov. Some critics may say that the over use of music hides the imperfections of a script or a direction: it may be true most of the time but not here. The film is an excellent example of a 20th century Romantic love story (Romantic with capital R as the movement of the 19th century). Thus, it may appear a little outdated here, as most of people may unfortunately not make such a big deal about cheating relationships nowadays. However the guilt still exists and the movie strikes a very modern chord in this point of view.The acting is excellent and I recommend the movie to anybody interested in the art of cinema. This is a much better love story than the later "Summertime" also by David Lean, with Katharine Hepburn (this one, extremely out of date).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I ever taught a class in film, this would be one of the films that I would teach. There were so many moments in this film that I felt that I was watching a modern day piece of cinema. The emotion behind the characters, the stages of their relationship, and even the background that represents their attraction to each other. If anything, I would teach this film as a amazing film of character study. Here we have two characters, both of which we know nothing about, and even one that we know less and less about. Laura is our narrator, so we see the film through her eyes. We see her daily routine, we see her children, we see her family, we see Laura's life. We never see Alec's life which somehow always left me to question the truth behind him. Celia Johnson does a beautiful job of playing the confused housewife. The woman that is comfortable with the life that she has, but somehow searches for more. She questions her life, wondering if there perhaps may not be something more behind an unexplored door. This door is Alec. She stumbles upon him randomly and opens the door to find that he is just as repressed as she is. Together they fall into each other's arms. In three weeks, meeting only three times, they are in love ... confessing it to each other. You don't see lovers climbing balconies or dying in each others hand. You see unbridled love. You witness the excitement from Laura of meeting someone new, the disappointment when she doesn't get to see him on one of her scheduled Thursdays, you see the shame on her face as she lies to her husband about her where-abouts that day, and you see the realization in her eyes that this romance will never last. They have their own lives, they have forged their own paths, and while they may dream about what life may have been like if the two of them had ever ended up together, they both know that it will never happen. One of my favorite scenes in this film is when both Laura and Alec are in the train station and they are talking about how their relationship will never work, how they must never see each other again. The train station represents their departure. It is symbolic of their carriage that will take them back to their "real" life. It is almost as if it is the crossroads of their life. In the city they are a happy couple, in the train station (especially in the deli) they must now watch their back, and be weary of who may be watching. Then they board the train and head back to their husband/wife respectively. In this scene, as they are talking about how they can no longer be together, we are taken back to the beginning of their romance when a young couple runs behind them to catch the train. Almost as if we were watching them together again, running ... arm-in-arm to catch the train. I was impressed with this film and I actually enjoyed it. I think film students in a classroom setting would appreciate it more for the film history value. This is the perfect cinematic example of two star-crossed lovers that can never be together!!

		<shortDescription>Brief Brief For Truth In Economy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lean, before he got the idea that he was a great director -and under the artistically economic supervision of Noel Coward, directs a post-war masterpiece. Coward's original brief encounter was homosexual, in Preston, Northern England whilst waiting for a connection in his theatrical days. It was indeed brief, but here transformed into something heterosexual, and unbriefly memorable. The reality of such an encounter between 1946 middle-class Britons would have been as unlikely as the movie's contradictory Southern English accents. But then, movies are not necessarily about the truth. They're about the truth in untruths; the 'ah- but if's? They stand or fall by their ability to storm and overwhelm critical scruples. Few movies we merely tolerate as just okay, or mildly annoying. Mostly we love them or hate them. It may be the ambience of middle-class correctness in austere 1940's Britain which makes this movie believable, but it's the profound aspirations to decency and loyalty it inspires which makes it great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a woman's story, told from her point of view and in her own narrative voice, about a passionate but Platonic affair between a married woman, Johnson, and a doctor, Howard, who meet accidentally at a railway station and begin to have dates every Thursday. They go to the movies, have lunch, spend afternoons in the countryside, gradually fall in love with each other, and then part.But it's an adult woman's story and younger people, who don't think much any longer about mores, may be bored with it because they don't understand what all the fuss is about. Never mind adultery and self respect. If they like each other, why don't they immediately go to bed? That's unfair of me, I know, but let me put it this way: for those who see "One Night In Paris" -- about Paris Hilton frolicking in the sack with her boy toy of the moment -- and think of it as a love story, "Brief Encounter" will seem pretty dull.Here, for instance, is the opening scene. I defy any normal debauched fifteen-year-old boy to find this in any way gripping.A gabby woman, all smiles and chatter, is in a tiny railway café and spots a friend, Johnson, seated at one of the tables with a stranger. She bustles over, invited herself to sit down, and blathers away. The stranger, Howard, is introduced as a doctor who is leaving England next week. He appears to be nothing more than a casual acquaintance of Johnson's.But it doesn't take much effort on the part of a viewer to see that something of import is going on between Johnson and Howard. They each look solemn, they cast furtive glances at one another while trying to be polite towards the intruder. The gabby woman has interrupted something -- but what? Well, she's just amputated the last few minutes that two mature people who are deeply in love are ever going to have together. The couple sit and listen silently, then Howard announces, "I must go," stands up and says his good-byes, and places his hand briefly on Johnson's shoulder before walking away.It's not a soap opera or a Harlequin romance, even though Howard is a doctor instead of, say, a humble book keeper. None of the characters is evil or even ill intentioned. Both Howard and Johnson act about as sensibly as any two people of maturity would act in 1945. They must be careful to preserve their own dignity and to avoid gossip. When they have a rather lavish lunch, they must lie to friends about the champagne.It was directed by crabby David Lean, who had made a spectacular "Great Expectations" and was to go on to the even more spectacular "Lawrence of Arabia." He's extremely skillful. There is, after all, no action in the film, no mystery, no spooky atmosphere. Yet he and his photographer have made the best possible use of stony night time settings among brick buildings, cobble stone streets, and deserted public squares. The lighting and shadows induce an atmosphere of drama without being at all menacing. Lean gets in some licks at Hollywood during the previews in the local movie theater. "COLOSSAL." "STUPENDOUS." "EPIC MAKING." "FLAMES OF PASSION."The acting is fine too. Trevor Howard has never been a volcano of expressiveness but the role calls for someone with passion who is unwilling to divulge what he feels. (He would be otherwise for Lean in "Ryan's Daughter.") Ditto for Celia Johnson. They're both of the right age as well. They're not yet middle aged, only on the cusp, and they have that sinking feeling that, after this, nothing truly dramatic is going to happen in their lives. Their personal niches are already established.Howard may seem a little wooden, but we certainly get our fill of Celia Johnson's buried impulses through the course of her narration. She's a handsome woman, married to the stereotypically reliable but dull mate. He's a nice guy, though, a decent provider, and he and Johnson love their two children. She has a thin, geometrically perfect nose that ends in a dull point, and over-sized calf-like eyes that radiate winsomeness and a fear of the dark. In some ways the most interesting character is the friend whose flat Howard uses for an abortive assignation with Johnson. That would be Valentine Dyall, who almost catches Johnson in the apartment and makes snide comments about her. The actor -- and the role as written -- leaves us wondering if he's gay.Anyway, given the simplicity of the story, it's not likely to get much better than this. Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto, which has since become almost a cliché, helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most famous romantic film of all time?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BRIEF ENCOUNTER is very much a product of its age. It's completely alien to somebody brought up on modern cinema. The costumes, photography, acting and script are all products of a bygone age. Yet it still has a special magic that makes it a timeless classic.In essence, the film's all about a doomed love affair. The movie works through subtlety, both in the subtlety of the performances and in the subtlety of the actors in the roles. Craggy Trevor Howard - not somebody you'd initially think of as a romantic lead - is fine as the ordinary Joe, but it's Celia Johnson who's the film's real delight, creating a character who comes across as one of the most believable women in film.It's not all perfect. I found myself disliking Laura in places, mainly because of the neglect of her family (and especially children). But overall, BRIEF ENCOUNTER works. It's a film that gets to you, speaks to anybody who's ever been in love and knows what a cruel emotion it is. The cyclical ending is devastatingly perfect, a fine example of how subtlety wins out over bluntness any day of the week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The apotheosis of Britishness, the utter realm of living your life in "quite desperation". Brief Encounter is, for many at least, the final word of cinema in the long unresolved issue of human love affairs. Calm and, at times, almost dispassionate, fragile and princely understating, this one is the triumph of the narrative cinema of emotions ? but never emotionalism. You can blame it endlessly ? for its high minded Britishness, for its dated nobility, for the pride of its characters before real love ? but you would be missing the point. Brief Encounter is the product of its times and accusing it of reserve would be as if condemning a Jane Austen novel for not including pages of oral intercourse. And, in any case, how many times in your "film life" will you find yourself before such sincerity of expression of unselfish love AND feel strangely unfulfilled similarly to the characters portrayed?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Music score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie very much! So many of you complemented the excellent use of Rachmaniniff's piano concerto 2. I agree with you absolutely and just want to point out that this music is associated with a male soul, in this case with Alec Harvey. This would explain why the husband wished to turn the music from the radio down and also why it dominates the whole story: because Laura is thinking actually of Alec Harvey, even talking in her thoughts to her husband. Why i make this link? Because that was Alec Harvey who spoke of the odd musician in the restaurant and also asked Laura whether she herself played the piano. I suppose we may assume that he was a very fine musician himself, not only a doctor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the 1960's Rebelled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece of proverbial British civility and restraint. Beneath those respectable exteriors-- the impeccable grammar, the gentile politeness-- passions catch fire and come to a boil with all the driving force of the steam engines that barrel through the dingy station where the lovers meet. Johnson and Howard are near perfect as bored spouses on the edge of adultery. But then they are thoroughly middle-class with family responsibilities, even as the romantic strains of Rachmaninoff insist otherwise. Rarely has social convention been confronted by personal passion more intensely than here. I get the feeling that were the movie made today, a satirical version would appear on Saturday Night Live the following week. Nonetheless, the results rise above standard soap suds thanks to the consummate skills of director Lean, cinematographer Krasker, and the cast principals. Note that opening scene in the seedy station with the gabby woman. Watch the nuanced and beautifully choreographed expressions from Johnson and Howard as they fall back on inbred civility to defuse a difficult intrusion. It's a minor masterpiece of repressed emotion.For all the attention to detail, the movie does cheat. Did they have to make Johnson's husband such a comfortable dullard, such that her straying passion seems more an act of personal survival than questionable infidelity. Note too, how the lovers are stopped short of genuine adultery by the inopportune arrival of Howard's friend, the insufferable Stephan, (who also provides insight into why Howard wants escape). Anyway, I expect mores of the time dictated that Johnson could be forgiven her intentions as long as there were no actual consummation. Thus her "punishment" need not go beyond an emotional defeat.All in all, the movie strikes me as rather threatening to the sedate middle-class, suggesting as it does that beneath calm appearance, lies unrequited passion waiting to break the bonds of societal repression into some unknown but more daring future. I doubt that some such theme will ever get more delicate treatment than here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>J.Slack's comments totally upstage anything I can say or add at this late date. I had forgotten it was a David Lean flick. Anything this man touched was magical in some way. And Celia Johnson must also always be remembered for "Love on the Dole" as well. Trevor Howard, also, has never been less than excellent, whatever the role. My original intent here, after more than a half-century, and having seen the flick only once, was to observe, no doubt unnecessarily, that at least "half" the impact could be traced to Rachmaninoff, and the other to the Johnson/Howard twain, by way of the director. My lesser, er, ah, "spoiler," observation was to deflate the Noel Coward writing credit. NC, for all his lifetime "success" and celebrity, was, to me, a pale and self-puffed shadow of the true English wit and snob, Oscar Wilde, whose mots and brilliance remain unsurpassed in the English language. To me, at any rate. Coward herein has supplied a one-note, and an overly sentimental one at that, insight. Rather like his one-note comic success in the wondrous personage of Margaret Rutherford madly bicycling her way through the countryside hedges in "Blithe Spirit." The rest of that flick, like everything else I ever witnessed of the Coiward oeuvre, well, his WWII salute milked a twinge or two, could be summarized, to me at least, by that deathless line, "Tennis, anyone?" But this brief encounter is, for sure, one to remember.</fullReview>

The first scene is one of high class,you see Alec(Trevor Howard)and Laura talking as an annoying friend of Laura joins them.The looks on the faces of both Alec and Laura tell something wicked but you don't get to know what it is until the end of the movie.The storytelling flashbacks are great.Laura is confessing to her husband in her mind and the flashbacks are so well done that at one point you're totally forgetting that it is a flashback.Both Howard and Johnson act great and the direction of Lean is first class.The musical score is provided by Rachmaninov. For a similar but lesser known romance film about born out of wedlock relationships watch DAMA S SOBACHKOJ(the lady with the little dog) by Iosif Khejfits that is based on a book written by Chekhov.Both films walk the same path although I have to say that BRIEF ENCOUNTER is more pleasant to watch.The music of DAMA S SOBACHKOJ is brilliant by the way.BRIEF ENCOUNTER is considered as a classic(which I can understand)and for a classic it is a very good movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fondness for the railway location</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always loved this film, and it also has a special place in my heart because of where it was filmed. I used to visit my grandparents in Silverdale, near Carnforth, and recently I went back to the area to see it all again. I am thrilled that the location used for the station scenes in Brief Encounter has been restored and is open for visitors (it is still a working station).The lovely thing about Carnforth station is that wide ramp coming up to the platform, up which Laura walked or ran to catch her train. The huge clock is important in the film, and there is a restored one there now. The place called "Milford Junction" in the film is fictitious and I am not sure where it's supposed to be, but judging by the accents of everyone in the film it must be in the Home Counties! So it seems charmingly weird that there are platform signs in plain view in the film showing that trains are going to Lancaster and Morecambe, Leeds and Bradford (as there really were at Carnforth and the trains still go to those places). Either David Lean didn't notice (which seems unlikely) or he had a sense of humour, or he wanted to confuse us about where this place was. It's a classic, obviously, and the issues raised are as relevant today as they were in 1946.The love story stands up even though the clipped accents can seem strange to us. Because of the time in which the story took place, the outcome was different from what it might be today. Nevertheless, the central tragedy of the story makes it memorable - the fact that 2 people couldn't be together for whatever reason (a completely believable one). The soundtrack is also perfect and as a David Lean fan, this is one of his best. Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard's performances were immense and pitched just right. It's a British classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not very found of black and white films but Brief Encounter is an exception. Brief Encounter is not your typical overly dramatic black and white film. This is a film you that you can relate to in real life. Even in today's generation. If you can't relate I am most positive that some one you know will.Laura Jesson (main character) meets Dr. Alec Harvey among her daily routines. Laura didn't think much of it really but shortly after meeting with Dr. Harvey a couple of times; Laura finds herself lying to her husband and often daydreaming about what kind of life she could have. We can all relate to that. Not lying to your husbands that is, but day dreaming of what you don't have. You will take on Laura's emotions as your own as she contemplates what to do with her new found desires she didn't know she had. Laura is not your typical adulteress, which makes you relate to her even better. I can't reveal anything more or I'll ruin it for you. I can tell you that there are a few comic moments along with romantic moments all throughout the film. Celia Johnson (Laura Jesson) narrates the film and she did an excellent job. Brief Encounter is an Academy award winner, which is well deserved. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meeting a stranger (Trevor Howard) in a railway station, a woman (Celia Johnson) is tempted to cheat on her husband (Cyril Raymond).This is the first film that David Lean was nominated for by the Academy, and it should therefore be seen as his first great work. And maybe it is. I found myself having trouble paying attention, and I really did not get as much out of it as I should have. Lean does good work, and there is no reason to believe this is not on that list.The one thing I will say is that it stands out as one of Lean's shorter films. Maybe more of his films are 90 minutes than over two hours, but he does seem to have an attraction to the epic storyline. I am pleased to say this is not one of those (not to say they are not good in their own right, but sometimes you just do not have a full afternoon or evening to invest in a film).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughable In Parts, But Has A Charm That Will Keep You Watching...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to films of today, Brief Encounter is incredibly old-fashioned in its subject matter, and its entire presentation.The idea of committing adultery with a "spiffingly charming man" is one that is relevant today, as it happens more often than it used to, however, the taboo nature of the subject matter at the time the film was released creates a guilt-laden tension that draws the audience in, and keeps them involved the the pair's little secret.One issue with the film, that made it laughable for a person from the 21st century watching this film was howincrediblyfasteverybodyseemedtotalk. It was as though, the director was running out of film, so they had to fit everything into a scene as quickly as possible. This is how people used to talk back then, or rather, how they used to act on screen.Trevor Howard is brilliant as the charming, conscientious, good-willed Doctor. The entire cast does a decent job of keeping the audience interested in the film, but I couldn't help thinking how attitudes have changed somewhat since the film's release, and I kept thinking what it would have been like to watch the film with someone from 1945 to gauge their reaction. Maybe they would have stormed out of the screening in disgust at the notion of married couples having affairs with other people.Brief Encounter is regarded as a classic, and who knows - maybe it was. But times change and so too do attitudes. This is a decent film, with often laughable dialogue, but it does not grip today's audience like it would have gripped the audiences of the forties. All it relies on now are its basic storyline contained within the social boundaries of its time, and half-decent acting, interrupted only by the fast-talking delivery of the cast.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, anyone who decides to watch this movie must not be ignorant to the British way of life in the 1940's, particularly in the case of the middle class. It focuses on a woman in her thirties who, being married to a dullard with children, finds a new, exciting, yet adulterous love with a doctor. Being set in the 1940's, the shamefulness of adultery is even greater in society, and seems almost as if it does not exist. This, therefore, is why the relationship is doomed from the start, and both lovers are unfree to let their passion and love overtake. A previous reviewer of this film appeared to detest the film for it's lead female star's performance, the dialogue and basic storyline, for reasons that suggested they did not understand, or were unaware of the behaviour of society, and different social classes during the period it was filmed and set. Although opinions vary, I think I can safely say that this film is fantastic, and beautifully acted, written (Noel Coward), shot and directed (David Lean). If you are oblivious to what you should expect from this film, at least give it a chance. So many people believe this to be one of the greatest films ever made, and certainly Britain's finest classic. The archaicness of the language, although very British and very proper, gives the film part of its superiority and integrity; and if you really can't get to grips with it, then just have a little giggle at it instead. Another contribution to the film's beauty is the location and how it is shot. Naturally a black and white film, it is set mainly at a railway station, where the unfortunate lovers first, and often, meet. Shots of the steam engines passing in and out and racing by, silhouettes of the characters on lamp lit streets and various camera angles representing the character's state of mind, make this film particularly unique.The diegetic music is that of the classical Rachmaninov concerto, which only makes the film more dramatic and poignant. Also, the occasional powerful sound effects of the trains, contribute to the feelings of the main female lead character, mostly when she is guilt ridden and fearful about the affair. This brings us to the performances. Trevor Howard plays Dr Alec Harvey, whilst Celia Johnson plays Laura Jesson. Howard acts to perfection, with a handsome charming look, and flawless gentlemanly qualities, adding slight sneakiness, which allows his character to persuade Laura into confessing her mutual love for him. Yet it is without a doubt a film dominated by the graceful screen presence of Celia Johnson. She is magnificent as the distraught lovelorn woman, who can make any female viewer completely relate to the feelings of loosing the man they truly love. The grief in her voice reveals her pain and a sense of drained, non feeling acquired after having to let go of Alec, and never seeing him again. She is a natural beauty with, what Alec mentions, her wide eyes, and despite the previous reviewer disagreeing, an outstanding, well pronouncing speaking voice, projected mainly(and most memorably)in narration throughout the film. You may more than likely find the idea of a man and woman, who know very little about each other, falling in love a bit far fetched, however you may also let that slip aside, as the love between them becomes tragic and heartachingly painful due to the circumstances, and because both characters are restricted from taking it too far, and have to learn to let go.Please give this film a chance, as I'm sure you won't find anything else quite like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of a beautifully constructed British drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely love this film! Everything about it is both memorable and wonderfully done. The cinematography and direction is superb (you'd expect nothing less from David Lean), the acting wonderful (despite an inclination to ham things up from the comic characters!) and of course the music - Rachmaninov might have written his second Piano Concerto especially for the film, it goes so beautifully with the various moods and drama that the script evokes.I was not alive in 1945, but I sense that "Brief Encounter" captures the zeitgeist perfectly. I just about remember steam trains and I'm sure that when I was about 5 years old the station buffet at Clapham Junction (and everywhere else at that time) strongly resembled the one used in the film (A visit to Carnforth station is a must for fans, by the way!) The glimpse into the comfortable, if bland, existence of the bourgeoisie of the time is revealing, and the tension of the restrained feelings is, at times, almost unbearable! Howard and Johnson capture this tension so well. The 'forbidden' love of these terribly British upper middle class people has been read as a metaphor for homosexual love, of course. However, in a rather drab post-war world, it must have been refreshing to observe such wild passion in the cinema!Finally, I love the almost perfect structure of this film - the opening scene which is the closing scene and the subsequent flashback works so well on a dramatic level. Above all, I suppose I love the very Britishness of "Brief Encounter" - the class divisions in post-war England are starkly revealed. What a unique glimpse into a particular moment in time, long since disappeared, and although the film is very specific in terms of time and place, it deals with universal feelings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my all-time favourite British film. It is a story of the heartbreak and despair caused when two strangers are brought together by chance and embark on a doomed relationship. Brief Encounter superbly captures the mundanity of suburban middle-class life and yet somehow manages to create more emotional intensity than any other romantic film I have seen. The backdrop of dullness and every-day tedium only seems to enhance the violent and overpowering passions of the two central characters. Lean's subtle direction and the use of black-and-white cinematography are impressive and preferable to his work in later overblown epics whilst Rachmanioff's Second Piano Concerto fits the story perfectly. Trevor Howard is also faultless in his film debut but it's Celia Johnson's understated performance as the tragic Laura that lives in the memory. Her portrayal of the trapped housewife is without equal in modern cinema. This is a film full of soul and emotion and gets better with every viewing.</fullReview>

Made at the end of the war it encapsulated many of the values for which the film's admirers believed the war had been fought - decency, kindness, quiet reserve and emotional restraint. Beautifully understated, the film serves unintentionally as an obituary on a now vanished age. For those who can appreciate its universality, it is a deeply moving work of art and an affirmation of the human spirit at a time in history when the most basic human values seemed threatened.

		<fullReview>Over and above any quality in the Writing, Directing and Acting departments this film is a must for Nostalgics. To anyone under 50 who lacks a degree in or a highly developed passion for Social History the social landscape against which the story plays out will appear all but incomprehensible, as remote from the world of today as Atlantis. Over 50s on the other hand will navigate effortlessly via such long forgotten landmarks as lunch at the Kardomah, tea at Fuller's and in between a trip to Boot's Lending Library. In common with Andy Hardy's Carvel the Milford Junction of Laura and Alec is an idealized concept that fits the real world where it touches. This leaves the story and the name of Noel Coward, who adapted his own one-act play 'Still Life' for the screen should tell us all we need to know. Coward, in common with Terence Rattigan and Arthur Miller, was above all a craftsman (not for nothing did Arthur Miller spend his spare time making furniture) and were this a piece of furniture and not a piece of celluloid it would be a Louis X1V commode - I speak as one whose own furniture goes back to Louis the fourteenth; I don't pay by the fourteenth it goes straight back to Louis, but that's another story. In many cases films that began life in the theater don't 'open out' well but this is at least one exception to the rule. Although Coward wrote an extremely 'tight' one-acter set entirely in the buffet of a railway station he has constructed skilfully 'extra' scenes set in a tea room, a boating lake, a hut by the lake, a cinema, a 'borrowed' flat and Laura's home to say nothing of creating extra characters, not least Laura's husband (Cyril Raymond and Alec's 'friend' (an uncredited Valentine Dyall). Howard, who actually began his career in comedy (Terence Rattigan's French Without Tears) is now much better known for his 'rugged' military types but though Celia Johnson was an equally accomplished actress and scored heavily as the cockney wife in Coward's own 'This Happy Breed' she scored equally highly as Coward's upper-class screen wife in 'In Which We Serve' and never really strayed far from Laura Jesson, solid, dependable, quietly attractive, perfect 'wife and mother' material. The acting throughout is almost beyond praise and it seems somehow anachronistic to watch it on DVD via a plasma screen with surround sound which makes Alec and Laura seem so far away they might as well be dwelling in caves as Mock-Tudor semis in a world full of Acacia Avenues. The real way to watch it is surely at the local Odeon where you could enter halfway through Reel #4 and leave at exactly the same place three and a half hours later having seen in the interim one 'B' picture, one newsreel, one cartoon, plus the 'trailer' for next week's film, possibly Basil Dearden's 'Frieda' (1947) set in an identical 'Neverland' in the Home Counties.

		<fullReview>As someone who was born in 1946 to a middle class family in England, when our society considered divorce and adultary shocking, even scandalous, I can empathise with the emotions felt by the central characters of Laura (Cynthia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard). I cannot quite relate to the parts of Stanley Holloway and Joyce Carey as the working class comic relief playing the parts of the station master and head station café attendant.I did mix with `council house kids' in the playground at my primary school in the early fifties and do not remember their adult parents speaking in `mockney'.As British drama schools of this era were run by fairly left wing intellectual middle class staff, they tended to drum out the local accents and vernacular of their drama students to a received English pronunciation - what I call the `Cholomdley-Warner' school of speaking, (which I now find rather appealing after the endless kitchen-sink type dramas from the early sixties onwards).The consequence was we had actors like Audrey Hepburn trying to affect a cockney accent (My Fair Lady (1964)) but sounding false.Note-one of the best contemporary and authentic cockney accents is spoken by the actress who plays `Nan' to the Slater family in `East-Enders' on the BBC soap.I also have a great love for the Rachmananov piano concerto no:2 in C minor, played here by Eileen Atkins and this seems to add perfectly to the emotional dimension and tone of the film, matching its general mood.Any film directed by David Lean should be seen alone for his breadth of vision, use of light and shade (e.g. effect on steam and smoke) and the high standard of editing.'Brief Encounter' is no exception.As previous reviewers have identified, this film should be viewed in the social context of when it was filmed and its subject matter.The censor certainly had no problems here and young discerning viewers can perhaps enjoy this film in the same way I can enjoy certain quality films of the 1930s.One of my interests is spotting the identity of bit part actors in different film roles, e.g a young Valentine Dyall (who was a foil of Spike Milligan in the 1960s).He comes back unexpectedly (as Alec's room mate) at the flat to where Alec takes Laura.Do we detect the frustrated homosexual predeliction of Coward here?If so, this could only be hinted at in 1945.The old type cinemas I remember when you saw a cartoon, Movietone News, a 'B' Feature and then the Main feature for continuous performances if you wanted, is certainly evocative, as well as the `Lyons Corner House' type tea shops where I went as a child and a teenager, as a chess tournament venue.`Thank you for coming back to me', the last line, is quintessentially full of British understatement and makes me suspect her husband,(a whizz at crosswords), was not so gullible as his character suggests.One regret, we do not see Alec's wife to judge for ourselves why he is considering leaving her. I rated it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Noel Coward is most famous for working in the theatre, but his fingerprints are all over two screen gems: In Which We Serve and today's subject, Brief Encounter.Although very different, two films that tell the tale of simple human values under trying circumstances.The story couldn't be simpler: Two strangers (played by Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard) meet (at a bleak railway station) and find they have feelings for one another. The problem is that one of them is married and is, therefore, on the horns of a dilemma.The plot and themes become weaker in the telling: We are supposed to worry about small problems that two members of the British middle classes are having? We are given no information that Celia Johnson's marriage is unhappy, so why is she even tempted to stray?Equally, why cannot the two of them become friends rather than lovers? Was this off-the-menu in 1945?Coward wrote this piece, not as a film, but as a short one act play. The lack of depth is still evident on the screen despite the excellent work of director David Lean and the rest of his team.There is also a touch of snobbishness along the way: The middle classes have a life - the working classes do nothing but rudely interrupt it!Brief Encounter is a solid little film that lingers in the mind, but lacks the depth needed to take on the love story films of the Twentieth Century. If this film was a song, it would be one played in a minor key...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>where this stands, and from where i see it now, this film seems to be about several displacements, and how we deal with that.this was 1945, but the canon is still pre-Kane, pre-war. For how it portrays love, and its impossibilities, it belongs with Casablanca, and what came before. The world, and the British, were reinventing themselves, after the war, and this world, of having to choose between passion or conventions was soon to be dead. But the play is from 1937, and was kept pretty much unchanged in what it depicted. So this film is as much in between worlds, in between conceptions of love, of cinema, of social conventions, as Rachmaninoff is a modern mind living in a Romantic world.To me this is a tragedy wearing a romance's clothing, but as a film, this one is dated. don't misunderstand me, that's not necessarily a bad thing. Simply new codes were invented, new (or simply different) demands were infused in the audiences. To our modern ability to see, the film is overly staged, the acting is overly dated. But we do have a great female interpretation by Celia Johnson, and that sure is a strong point, because the film depends a great deal on us buying our way into the world as seen by Laura. And we do, at least i did.But Lean is, or was to become at this point, a great director. I wouldn't see him going so far as he did if i'd seen this movie when it was new. He relies on the heritage from older days, from expressionism, and from more recent ones, from Toland/Welles and their than recent experimentation with composition and lighting. This cinematographer would shoot The Third Man, and that's tells us something. Still, and still considering Rachmaninoff, and Lean, i think these two mirror each other in how their work, at its best, builds images, extremely over the top, but incredibly pure and powerful. Landscapes. What Lean would give us, his Arabia, his grand vision that opposes desert to intimacy is not even hinted. Not here, where he still lives in a world of intimacies, of repressed feelings, of unachieved visions, like the visions of Paris and Venice that Laura imagines without ever getting them. Here, in this film, it's Coward's vision that overcomes every other vision, that's what we're kept with: the critic to hypocrisy, the contrast with the natural and pure flirtation of the "lower" class, the veiled hint of homosexuals in the character of Stephen.What will stay with me is the smoke and smell, and the refreshment room. This is a film about trains, passing each other, crossing, never ending, random lives submitted to useless moral and an outdated world, that exists no more. mismatching. memories.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It was just an ordinary day"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple romance--very British in style and directed with flair by David Lean, written sensitively by Noel Coward, and played to perfection by CELIA JOHNSON and TREVOR HOWARD, as two ordinary people who quite believably fall in love after a brief encounter.It all starts with a cinder in the eye and gradually leads to talk and idle conversation where both Johnson and Howard are revealed as two very compatible people, with she feeling a tinge of guilt about enjoying herself at the cinema with him--and he merely says, "You're a very nice person." From that point on, the romance deepens, to the strains of Rachmaninoff's concerto as the doctor and the housewife find themselves enjoying each other's company.Johnson is excellent at showing her conflicted feelings about the romance as she thinks of her own married life with two children, her voice-over narrating the story. And yet, it's almost a two-character film, with Johnson and Howard carrying most of the story with only an occasional turn from STANLEY HOLLOWAY for a touch of humor in some of the train station scenes and JOYCE CAREY as a gossipy train companion.It's almost a time capsule of a much simpler time--during postwar WWII--no television, no cellphones, just crossword puzzles and knitting for our two main characters--and, of course movies. During much of the narration, it occurred to me how much Celia Johnson sounds like Deborah Kerr--same pitch of voice, same intonation.Summing up: A simple love story with a bittersweet ending, nicely understated without any melodramatic outbursts of passion, with Johnson winning a Best Actress award from the N.Y. Film Critics, but losing the Oscar to Olivia de Havilland of TO EACH HIS OWN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was excellent (drama, lighting, atmosphere, tension, etc.) although it left some questions unanswered. Perhaps that was just to make us think on our own...I'm not sure if the husband ever knew what the heck was going on with her - he is portrayed as a self-involved, oblivious person who just "tut tuts" her and pats her on the head absentmindedly for most of the movie, and then at the last three seconds we're supposed to believe he's all wrapped up in her and grateful that she stayed. Oh, that's right - without her, his dinner would not be on the table at six every evening. He was a complete dork.They did a great job making those other women in the film come across as gibbering idiots - I never knew people could talk so fast and say absolutely nothing! Especially that one that interrupts Laura and Alec in the café at their farewell. Jeez, you just want to knock her one on the head with a baseball bat to get her to take a breath! I didn't see what was so special about the doctor, though, that she should go so nuts over him. He was nice to her, but I would have thought he would have been a little more dashing or better looking or something... I don't know, he seemed a little geeky to me. Not that Laura was all that, either - she sorta reminded me of an Edsel with the headlights set a little too far apart... those googly eyes! Goof: In the final café scene, the distance shot shows Laura sitting in her chair wearing just her suit and hat. But when they show the close-up shot of Alec putting his hand on her shoulder, she's wearing a fur around her shoulders.</fullReview>

I realised while i was watching that i would have been devastated! Beautiful, compelling film based on the play Still Life by Noel Coward (though it doesn't feel like a filmed stage play)and shot by David Lean (before he decided to make epics - there is a scene in this where he makes a joke about the epic genre which will be of interest to his fans). The best thing about it (and this is saying a lot) is the two lead performances, Trevor Howard and (particularly) Celia Johnson in her crowning role, the only role she is remembered for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two married people (Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard) have an accidental meeting at a train station. Then they keep bumping into each other in London...start a friendship...and fall in love. But they're married...Acclaimed early film from David Lean. It was a huge hit and Johnson was nominated for an Academy Award over here. It IS good--beautifully filmed and written and VERY nicely underplayed by Howard and Johnson. Also probably the only film to perfectly use classical music (Rachmanioff's Second Piano Concerto) to propel the story. Also it showed me a world I never knew (1940s London). I found it quite interesting that they allowed smoking IN movie theatres and restaurants. It's also quite interesting to see a David Lean film running so short. But I can only give this a 9.I'm a sucker for this kind of movie but this sort of left me cold. I wasn't really sad at the end (purportedly 1940s audiences were audibly sobbing at the end) and was always aware that I was watching two actors acting. Howard and Johnson are GREAT--but the subdued presentation and acting kept me at arms length. It is worth seeing but, to me, not emotionally involving enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly sentimental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brief Encounter is a 1945 British film about a love affair directed by David Lean (Dr. Zhivago, Lawrence of Arabia). Its based on Noël Coward's play "Still Life".Set in England before World War II, a shy married woman named Laura (Celia Johnson) meets a passenger, Alec (Trevor Howard), in the railway station, they both have a good time together and contemplate having an affair.I'm a fan of David Lean's "Dr. Zhivago", but the romance in this movie was just too boring and sentimental for me. Its a simple story about two innocent characters who fall in love, but feel shameful about having an affair. Its narrated from the woman's point of view, the story is melodramatic and bittersweet. I respect that it was filmed during the war though.I'm not saying its a bad film, I'm just saying its a chick flick, which is a genre I'm not a fan of.I'd recommend it to people who liked "The Notebook", "In The Mood for Love", or "Closer".</fullReview>

It was a good movie, but not a masterpiece by any standards. In terms of David Lean, if you want to see something truly wonderful and touching, watch Summertime with Katherine Hepburn. And to the user who remarked that this film had gay subtext I would like to point out that this is completely untrue and that Noel Coward being gay does not somehow make the movie about homosexuality, nor does a movie about two lovers who can't be together somehow mean it's really about homosexuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Surprise That This Is Compared To "Terminal Station"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a thin line between melancholy and mawkishness, and the best directors know that this gossamer thread must be handled with extreme delicacy. This movie played hopscotch across this boundary multiple times. Lean, like De Sica, is a man of capacious spirit and broad passions. As such, he is not especially good with nuances. The question to ask when you watch his films is: to which end of the spectrum does the film incline? What a polar director- good and bad range along opposite sides of the gulf. "Summertime", to my mind, is a far superior film, though much of that can be attributed to Lean's exuberant use of color and Hepburn's shattering fragility. This, in comparison, is a cloying, pseudo-Woolfian melodrama without Woolf's surfeit of ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two reasons I don't like this film: The two main characters are two of the most boring people imaginable: frankly, they deserve each other. Secondly, the dialogue is among the most banal I have ever heard. This has little to do with the time it was made. Didn't they have subtlety in 1945? Implied meaning? Good God woman, you don't have to tell us you sat down, we can see it on the screen. I think the direction is actually very good: excellent use of limited settings, some good lighting and camera angles. But the dialogue. Oh God. "I love you, with all my heart and soul", the good doctor says. "I wish I was dead", Laura sensitively replies. I was in audience with my Film colleagues and we just cracked up. Is this kind of dialogue "quaint" or "British" or "typical of the era it came from" or just plain bad? I'll go with the latter. I don't think there's much problem with the plot really, and I like the way it was told. But Celia Johnson was neither attractive (not her fault) or interesting (her fault) in anyway. She always had a self-pitying look on her face, and this was reflected in her dialogue. As someone else said, she didn't seem to care so much for her family, but more about personal risk in having an affair. Her decision is made for her in the end, which left me feeling that she was lumbered with a family that deserved her more than she deserved them. You know she would of carried on seeing the bloke if she could. So, to summarise, poor acting and poor dialogue. They're usually quite important to a film. David Lean's direction was fine, but I really couldn't give a toss about such silly, selfish and dull characters. The thought that this is considered one of the all-time great tearjerkers is enough to draw one from me, that it's considered one of the best British films ever made is downright depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>oh so overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a mixed bag for me--some things I REALLY liked, other things left me COLD and unmoved.First I'll address the good. The musical score by Rachmaninof is exquisite. Unless you just hate classical-style music, you'll really appreciate the beauty of the score and how it complements the film--not overwhelms it. Also, the cinematography is great--lots of great angles, shots and care. The writing was also very good--the story and dialog were well-crafted. And finally, it was very refreshing to see such ordinary (and perhaps unattractive in the case of Celia Johnson) people in a love story. I just can't imagine Hollywood casting Trevor Howard as a romantic lead! Now, what I didn't like. The basic story is glamorizing extramarital affairs, as the basic plot involves two married people falling for another. I COULD have accepted this is their spouses had been monsters. We don't know about Trevor's, but Celia's husband, though a little dull, loves her dearly and seems like a very decent guy. So this left me thinking much less of Celia as a character--she's looking outside her marriage with little apparent motivation other than possible selfishness. Secondly, although I am sure this film is adored by most women, I venture to guess many guys will be left cold--I know I was. This reminded me of the incredibly over-hyped An Affair To Remember, though Brief Encounter was a generally superior film.It would have been interesting to see how the film would have handled by anyone other than David Lean and Noel Coward. The French would have probably had some nudity and the characters NEVER would have struggled over the indecency of the affair. American studios, in the 1940s, would have probably drastically re-written the story or not attempted it at all. Ingmar Bergman would have had the characters either go mad or kill themselves!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The British invented the chick flick?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This an undynamic movie filled with trivial moments, but it's dramatically trivial also. A trivial heroine meets a trivial someone (trivially, on her commute), is given carte blanche to see him by a husband portrayed as a hopeless dolt. Most of their affair occurs in a train waiting room, where their last moments together are interrupted by the trivial matters of a trivial acquaintance. She confesses the affair to the dolt who regards it trivially, &amp; instantly takes her back. We are intended to value that; so much for conflict. The two lovers are ordinary dullards and extraordinarily unspecific. I find it disturbing that fans describe what we see as 'passion.' They have the dictionary definition of an affair, nothing more. The movie has been completely scrubbed of any unique details. The stakes are low. To hear anyone call it England's answer to Casablanca is horrifying. Casablanca has much more finely drawn characters, in an infinitely more satisfying/rousing/interesting plot. More importantly Casablanca has a structure. This does not. I was making my own impositions on the material as I watched. As Howard rowed her out in a boat, I had already rejected this as a romance and had jumped to "woman-in-danger" movie imposing, "...this is where he turns out to be psychotic, takes an oar and brains her... he's actually an ingenious killer who chose her as his next victim because she's such a dullard." What can I say? I was ready for any form of complication.The narration is extremely mundane. It's like some sort of unworldly completest wrote it. "... and then I blew my nose and disposed of the tissue!" is only slightly more uninteresting than the actions she notes. Our heroine remarks that an associate has an ugly hat, while wearing quite an unflattering choo-choo-Charlie cap for the whole movie. Actors range from the merely average in looks to the quite homely. Alec (Trevor Howard) is about as attractive as James Woods, but to Laura, he represents a fantasy figure.I got more out of this by seeing it as a tiny-goaled fantasy of escape from the suffocating bourgeois structure that trained her to be uptight, AND to imagine herself a suitable heroine for a love story. But she lacks the imagination for any dramatisable, feature-film-scaled rebellion. Not being part of the British class system, I lack any larger social codex to detect the merit in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will never understand the reverence awarded to this awful silly movie. The dialogue is absolutely unreal and unbelievable, even for the Forties. As for the plot...well is there one?...you could have fooled me. Maybe it was better on the stage as Noel Coward's "Still Life", but I doubt it. The love-play was cringingly stiff-upper-lippedly wooden, and any sexual undertones there were in this pathetic, laughable encounter, would have perhaps been better served in one of his proper effervescent comedies.Noel Coward, as probably everyone knows, was worthily called "The Master" for his quick-fire scathing wit. So I think he must have been surprised, as was probably everyone else involved, by the lasting success of this dourly adapted tear-jerker.I must agree that it was slightly better (thanks largely to David Lean's direction) than other similarly dreadful British movies prevalent at the time, but it's still one for my trash can, if not yours, and I'll leave the reverence for "Brief Encounter" to those who enjoy a good weep.

		<fullReview>A simple story, beautifully shot in glorious black and white, fabulous soundtrack, bankable stars. But wait, there's more. Based on a story written by a genius (Noel Coward), screenplay written and directed by another genius (David Lean). If ever we were predisposed to like a film, it would be this one. And so we have. If not for the relatively small number of votes this has received, this film would be about #20 in the top 250. Can that be?However, I approached my first viewing of this film with a critical eye, and here's what I saw: 1) Boring. After the first thirty minutes it was clear that the remainder would be more of the same (and so it was). I had to force myself to stay to the unquestionably predictable end. I just didn't care about these people and their childish infatuation with each other. 2) Unconvincing. People don't fall in love like that. Ever. These people had absolutely no reason to be in love with each other (and no, that ISN'T what makes this a great story). This kind of character and plot development is fine for cartoons; doesn't cut it for adult dramas, even melodramas. The female character did nothing but fret about the wrongfulness of her actions. It got to be quite annoying to this viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the most irritating movies I have seen in a long time. There are so many reasons why. But first let me state that I saw this in a film class and was not appreciative at all. It was for a women's film studies week. Second, I like some classics (including Gone With the Wind), but not this one. Third, I like voice-over movies, if it is well done.Where to start? First the plot. Don't try to stop me if you have heard this one. Married woman goes to town during day. Woman meets stranger. They go to pictures. They meet every week and fall in love. She turns him away. The End. This is a very stereotypical chick flick.Second, the voice over. My god, this was the worst voice-over I have ever heard. It had more presence and was more meticulous to detail than the voice-over in Stanley Kubrick's "The Killing." Any movie where the voice-over states in quick, matter-of-fact monotones "I was rather hot. So I sat down." as we get a picture of the speaker sitting down at a bench is bad in my book. Plus it is serious about it. For the most part it is like reading a book, only with no personality. Quick, no change in tone, except when imagining she is addressing her husband, and with a grate-your-nerves high-fallooting British (maybe I am wrong, but foreign) accent. I wanted to yank her voicebox out by the end of the first twenty minutes.Third, overly melodramatic. I mean this was a turn-on-the-waterworks, bring-out-your-hankies type of story. And it belittled me by not letting me feel this for myself, but my trying to forcefeed me my emotions. I can have my own feelings thank you. Either way, skip this movie. It is one of the worst of the bunch. If you want a good voice-over movie see "Election" (four voice-overs) or "The Opposite of Sex" (the voice over loses itself) or "The Killing" (it knows that it is almost mocking). 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing the film, I'd read some comments about the two main characters being in love, but being unable to do anything as they're married and middle-class in 1940's England.However, rather than being an outdated film, the situation they allow themselves to fall into is exactly the same today, and, for people around that class level, the morals and constraints are exactly the same. I found the two main characters very unsympathetic, selfish, and weak-minded, and found the prostitution of using Rachmaninov's Concerto totally inappropriate, from the moral and musical point of view.The only interest in the film is sociological and seeing how life was in Britain in the 1940's.I know the film is much-loved, but I found it rather immoral. Their problem is resolved, not by a return to moral conscientiousness, but by a need to emigrate.And Dr. Alec Harvey can't be much of a doctor either, judging by the number of cigarettes he smokes.</fullReview>

Not that the character played by Celia Johnson is any better: dull clothes, flat sensible shoes, thick stockings, dreadful hats, make-up applied with the palette knife. And that annoying cut-glass voice. "I'm a heppily merried woman." As an actress in silent films, she might be pretty good, but when she opens her mouth...Two nonentities meet in a railway tea room and fall in love. From then on you have to endure the most unreal dialogue. "I love you so." "No don't." Another commentator mentions the mutilation of a Rachmaninov piano concerto. I agree. I'd prefer to listen to the concerto than watch the film. The couple giggling at the chamber music in the tea shop shows the film makers' utter contempt for classical music.I cannot for the life of me understand how this film is regarded as a classic, or why it was remade. It might be all right as a stage play, but frankly as a film it is an utter disaster. Unlike that other pseudo-classic Citizen Kane, this film will not let you sleep: it winds you up as the two protagonists display the broken hearts they are wearing on their raincoat sleeves. Is Celia Johnson going to run off with the cardboard doctor, or is she going to stay at home with her Times crossword-filling husband, lie back and think of the Home Counties idyllic post-war England that this film portrays? Frankly, who cares? If you have managed to watch this film from start to finish and have not committed suicide or gone on a serial killing spree, pat yourself on the back for endurance. Go to one of those trophy shops and buy a little medal for yourself. You've deserved it.</fullReview>
