		<shortDescription>A Great Film - Highly Underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate is a great film and one of Roman Polanski's most underrated films. Twenty years from now people will give this film the respect it deserves and hail it to be the great film that it is. Fist of all The Ninth Gate is not an action film. It's a slow-paced psychological thriller very similar in tone and style to Polanski's earlier films Chinatown and Frantic. Johnny Depp and Frank Langella both give great performances. Darius Khondji's photography is amazing and it has an even more amazing score by Kilar. The majority of the film was shot on location and is like a guided tour through Europe.Ignore the negative reviews and comments from people who've been brainwashed and blinded by the current Hollywood fast-food style of film making with the intention of only appealing to the lowest common denominator. A review doesn't make a good film better or a bad film worse. A superb film. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The secret is in plain view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A SPOILERI was inspired to write this, my first film commentary ever, when I was reading through those already posted. It struck me that nobody seemed to have got who "the girl" (played by Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner) is! Everybody who mentions her -- and most do -- say she's in the film for no reason, she keeps appearing and disappearing to no effect, she's never explained, and that the film would've been much better if Polanski had only left her on the cutting room floor.I hope Polanski is getting a kick out of this: the fact that nobody has got the secret of this, his most recent (and I think brilliant) film. I hope he's reached the point in his life and career where he cares more about making the art he had in mind than he does about whether people are getting it.Darlings, "the girl" IS Lucifer!! It's right out there in plain view. And this is the beautiful irony of this movie: that s(he) IS right out there in plain view, to all these people who are seeking her, and doing all this stuff to summon her, and she's right there -- which is one of the oft-told truths about gods and deities throughout time, that they're right there, right next door to you, and you don't even notice them. This is the truth (one of them) that Polanski is putting on screen here. Witness the scene in the St. Martin Chateau where "the girl" crosses paths with Mrs. Telfer; look at the expression on the girl's face; it is ironic and absolutely amused. And there are more "clues" -- many more.The girl is the only person in the film with actual supernatural powers. She floats. She is always around whenever Lucifer is being discussed. Although she repeatedly rescues Corso, she has anything but an angelic face. Her beautiful face has a subtext of evil and corruption. She anoints Corso with her blood in an arcane symbol on his forehead! And -- the giveaway -- when she finally has sex with him, didn't you notice that her eyes turn into demon eyes? that she morphs into a devil?This is really a love story. It is about Lucifer finding a mate -- the person s(he) will accept to enter through the Ninth Gate into his/her kingdom. You can see how "the girl" is evaluating all the candidates throughout the film and how s(he) decides on Corso who is, after all, corrupt from the very beginning and therefore a likely candidate. Witness the scene when Corso is beating Pablo to death, pounding him repeatedly on the face. "The girl" says "Well, Mr. Corso, I didn't know you had it in you." She is obviously pleased with him; she is choosing her mate!!!! The reason she keeps rescuing him is because he is the one she's seriously considering.Watch the film again. See if I'm not right.Anyway, what probably has Polanski laughing is the fact that he managed to disguise all this so brilliantly simply by making Lucifer a girl. He's probably a bit surprised by how completely this simple gender-switch had the audience totally fooled! If "the girl" had been "the boy" -- an equally beautiful young man who follows Corso throughout the film -- I'm sure half the audience would've gotten it. But nobody, still, can imagine that the mythic figure of the devil could be female. But of course! The gods are androgynous; they have to be!And Polanski adds yet another layer of irony and humor by dressing "the girl" as a student with different color socks: the most innocent, innocuous, universal and asexual dress imaginable. Put yourself in Lucifer's shoes. Isn't this how you'd disguise yourself, if you were making a visit to earth? Obviously it is because, if the people who saw this movie are any sample, nobody would suspect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It keeps getting better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I like most about this movie, is that there are new things to be amazed by everytime one sees it. The first time I watch it, I was captivated by the music ( and Johnny Depp, gotta love him...) I also really liked the story and most of the actors' performances. The second time I watched it I started to pick up on the details, like the engravings, the real purpose of the mystery woman and the excellent work on the scenery and lightning. Now, I think I have watched it maybe 7 or 8 times, and it keeps getting better and better. This film is really has a life of it's on, and a life filled with passion, that is. It really has it's dark moments as well as uplifting ones. Everyone should see this movie. Unfortunately, I don't think everyone can't or won't take the time to just sit down and appreciate it. This isn't an action movie, the latest Hollywood production or one of those romantic comedies "everybody" love. Sometimes it's kinda slow, but that's part of it's charm. Great things doesn't have to be rushed, filled with explosions and have naked women running around with their breast flip-flopping all over the scene. This is, one brilliant film and those who doesn't agree just can't understand it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but not for everyone...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this brilliant masterpiece I came to the conclusion that Roman Polanski is one of the best directors in the history of the cinema. The people, who claim that "Ninth Gate" sucks probably don't know or don't understand his movies. You don't need tons of computer-generated special effects to make a good movie. "Ninth Gate" is so creatively made in every technical sense that it will stay in your mind forever. Wonderful music by Wojciech Kilar, outstanding sets(especially the castle at the end), nice cast, neat cinematography. OK,just go and enjoy this treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its all about the images!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a thriller, and that?s a good thing. Instead, this is an intellectual film about the relationship between the viewer and the filmmaker. Anyone who knows Polanski, and for that matter many of our best filmmakers, knows he wonders about what it means to make a real movie, one that works as art. Which is to say it does more than amaze and entertain.This movie is to Polanski as ?The Name of the Rose? was to Umberto Eco. That was a book about what books aren?t. This is a movie about what movies aren?t.Caution, spoilers ahead!The story is frail -- that?s the point, in fact a little too obvious for my taste. The book in question has been poured over for over 300 years, with everyone focused on the text. And that text is completely irrelevant, disposable, just as the story of the film is. The whole point of the film is in its images, the story is deliberately degraded to make the point. (The images are great: Polanksi working in partnership with LCR?)It?s all about abstraction. How could viewers not catch the layers of the inferno/hosts of angels references?--at the bottom level, you have the Frenchman who owns the book but isn't interested except for the beauty of the binding--then you have the Baroness who has spent her life writing about the devil and never even considering the pictures, even though she had the best clue--she SAW him.--at a higher level, you have Liana Tefler, who knows there?s some power in the artifact but is still focused on the text (and incidentally sex)--higher still you have Balkan who knows the text is worthless, and the pictures the real value but thinks the magic is in the pictures--then you have the two brothers who have the power to tinker with the power of the pictures--finally Corso who we see moving from the bottom of the list to this layer where he knows the power is not in the pictures themselves, but in the quest. (At the beginning, the value of the book to him is neither in its text, nor pictures, but in its binding and rarity.)--then we have ?the girl? who IS the pictures--and we have the viewer.This is a cross, four people stacked, the two brothers and then three more people stacked -- A layering actually used in early 17th century tracts on the nature of abstraction, which in retrospect are called occult. In fact it is the same layering of semiotics outlined by Eco, and much earlier used in the apprentice novels of Goethe (including Faust, which this story quotes).That?s nine players, eight levels of consciousness created by the filmmaker, each layer tossing aside something. Who is the ninth player, the final abstractionist? You.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See this one more than once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just got finished reading some of the other threads that discuss this movie. They ranged from the angst ridden youth spouting off about how there was no action, to those who truly loved this movie. I know that this movie is practically 5 years old, but this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am an avid horror fan. I love everything from slasher movies to the silent films from the 1920's. I admit, when I saw this movie in the theater, I was very disappointed. I think I was expecting some whiz-bang battle with the devil at the end, and for those of you who've seen this flick you know that this is not how it ends. Now, almost 5 years later, I own and watch this film very frequently. Now that I have seen this movie numerous times, I can appreciate the creepy atmosphere and the deep storyline. I have even said to myself "How could they have ended this movie differently in a way that I would be completely satisfied (other than the way they did)?" I couldn't answer that question. For those who have only seen this once, take the time to watch it again with different expectations. I know that there are some who will never like this movie, To each his/her own, but I am very glad that I took the time to see this one again because as it stands now, it will have a locked spot in my top 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Corso represents (a theory about the last engraving)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not so much a movie review (those are done well elsewhere), but a theory about the ending of the movie and who Corso really represents.SPOILER ALERT**** I too have enjoyed reading the posts and have come up with something that I just wanted to throw out there. Corso is a biblical figure--he is the serpent in the ninth engraving. After all Corso experiences each of the engravings on his quest, so logically he would have to experience the ninth engraving as well. Since the woman in the ninth engraving is "The Girl"--who presumably is the Whore of Bablyon (a case will be made later on that the whore=Lucifer), the only person that Corso could be is the beast---which is a subtle but powerful point of the film/book.The beast in the engraving has 7 heads which could conceivably represent the seven deadly sins--(i) pride (ii) envy (iii) gluttony (iv) lust (v) wrath (vi) greed (vii) sloth--throughout the film Corso commits each one of these sins, but it is done gradually. The point being that while everyone is on the lookout for a "beast" or other terrible creature it could actually just be humanity falling victim to the sins. When Corso kills the man in the cellar the girl exclaims "I didn't think you had it in you." This is what sealed his fate as her chosen one.Just like "The girl" Polanski puts Corso right out there in front of everyone to see, but we tend to ignore him and focus on the evils committed by Boris and Liana. But those people are not who the devil is interested in, the devil wants people who are consistent and gradual with their sinning. Corso is perfect as this "everyman." Incidentally this is why I think "The Girl" represents Lucifer, because she is out there for everyone to see. All the idiots are busy trying to summon the Devil but she is right there for everyone to see. (refer to diana 51's post somewhere here for more on this, she does a great job as do many others). Just like people are always looking for the sign of the beast or his return--and tend to lose the forest from the trees (i.e. their own sins) Incidentally the "whore of Babylon" symbolism is apt because, just as a whore is a servant, she can become a master. just like the girl in the movie--she "served" Corso at many points but she also made it clear who was boss (i.e. when she twisted his arm after he grabbed her in the hotel lobby and when she held him back from saving Liana from Boris).More generally Whores are there to offer immediate gratification, but many men have fallen victim to manipulation and have ruined their lives in pursuit of a whore. (This argument is not meant to limit whore to just male/female, a whore presumably offers immediate gratification, thus it is more beneficial to think of a whore as anyone who offers the quick fix--which is the Devil for all intents and purposes). However in order to obtain that quick fix how many of the seven deadly sins must a person commit?Chances are that a few transgressions would normally be in order.The reason that "The girl"/Lucifer picks Corso out of all the other evil people is because he doesn't commit the sins all at once for the quick fix. He starts out his quest purely for greed, and a long the way commits each sin as he sees fit or just for the hell of it (i.e. sleeping with Liana even though he had no intention of giving her the book; accepting another "zero" to the paycheck even though a friend of his was killed; not caring about getting paid by Boris at the end--he wants the engravings). Finally when he realizes the power that is at stake he is willing to make the ultimate jump to wrath (first he kills the guy in the cellar and then he kills Balkan when on fire). BUT both times he didn't need to kill those people, he could have left Liana's helper knocked out and he could have let Boris burn to death, but he just wanted to kill them out of anger (contrast this to Boris who killed for the pages in the book--and killed Liana so that she would stop bothering him). Gradual decent into evil and darkness is what endeared Corso to Lucifer/"The Girl" and that is why he came to Corso in the form of a woman and helped him along his path. Ultimately you become one with the devil when you commit all seven deadly sins because that is the power that humans have--to choose between good and evil. That is symbolized by the ninth engraving with the woman "riding" the seven deadly sins--and thus unlocking the gate into the Kingdom of Shadows.(Because the word limit is set at a 1000 for comments, this post is not able to discuss some other interesting points that are brought up by others. There are some who believe that Corso is not evil at all, or rather that he has no choice in his path (i.e. he attempted to save Liana and he shot Boris out of compassion). I attempt to give my take on that in a post located at http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142688/board/nest/41792586 (May 4, 2006 @ 11:04), but it's meant to be a complement to this post). Please forgive any repetitions. The variation in interpretations of this movie only reinforce the fact that it is a unique cinematic gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proves You Don't Need A Ton Of Action To Make A Good Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this movie rather unique in this day-and-age is to see a horror- occult movie that has very little action. That may turn off a lot of modern-day viewers and critics but I thought it was refreshing.....as long as the story could still keep one's attention, which it did. It also did it with a pretty long movie: 133 minutes. I have played this movie several times for friends and no one has gotten bored.The attraction is (1) decent acting; (2) some great sets; (3) an involving story; (4) interesting characters and (5) low profanity.What keeps most viewers interested is simply wondering what is going to happen next in "Dean Corso's" (Johnny Depp) quest to figure out the hidden message. Without giving anything away, this is a classy, solid thriller.....and more importantly, fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is perfect as an acerbic, bookish, cynical, morally corrupt book dealer. There is a great cast of occultist characters who are way over the top and enjoyable all the way. Frank Langella as a giant, power hungry cult leader and Lena Olin as an evil she-devil woman are superb. The script is perfect, and every line has meaning and resonance. The director does a good job at allowing the viewer to experience the mystery contained in those old books first-hand. I think the filmmaker had a vision, didn't compromise and made the exact film he wanted to make. It is a mature, ugly, interesting film with a lot of class but it probably won't be enjoyed by a lot of people out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Polanski in years...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted, I'm slightly biased since I happen to love Mr. Polanski's work, but this film was really good. It kind of built in a slow, very menacing way and had an intelligent plot, only fully concluded until you're out of the cinema. As usual with the demanding master, the performances are first class, specially Langella and Depp. Here comes a brief summary of the highlights in my opinion:Brilliant cinematography by the talented Darius Khondji (of Se7en fame).The most original title sequence I've seen this side of Bond.Also listen closely to Wojchiech Kilars (of Dracula fame) absolutely brilliant score. So light, and yet so heavy and menacing. Very un-Hollywood.It definetly puts Polanski back into the game again. Now if they'd only let him back into the states so we could geta new Chinatown.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie is a riddle too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's movies aren't about shooting and destruction like so many other movies these days, his movies are about people and their remarkable adventures. The Ninth Gate is supposed to be a thriller or horror movie but it is neither. The Ninth Gate is an occult movie and that is a whole different ballpark.spoilers ahead!'You have before you the mystery of which men have dreamed throughout the centuries. Thousands have died an agonizing death in hopes of just a glimpse of what you're about to see!' Those words are spoken by Boris Balkan, moments before he sets himself on fire in an attempt to raise the devil. The Ninth Gate is not only a movie about occultism, it is an occult movie by itself. First there is of course the obvious story that most people find quite disappointing BUT under the surface there is the real story that is only understood by those who are fairly familiar with symbolism and occultism. Although The Ninth gate is based on just a part of the book El Club Dumas, it is nevertheless a clever story of its own. The movie is about a riddle that is supposed to be hidden in three books, in the end that riddle is solved by Dean Corso. The movie itself contains a riddle and that riddle is to be solved by us. Besides the engravings, lots of symbolism and hints will help us understand the meaning of several strange events and eventually the meaning of what the story is all about and what happened to Balkan and Corso. The plot is created around a joke, a joke that is based on a misunderstanding. This makes a movie that one needs to see more than once, I bought the DVD and saw it over twenty times. The story gets better every time you watch it, pay attention to even the smallest details like the color of the mysterious girl's socks, there is a good reason why Corso has a shoulder bag and an overcoat he never seems to part from, until the 'notorious' very last scene; shoulder bag and overcoat are gone... Aren't you curious about the meaning of broken glasses in combination of a mark between the eyes? Search the internet for the answers to the questions you have. It's fun if you like to solve riddles, I had a great time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful contemporary thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with many of Polanski's films, "The Ninth Gate" includes beautiful settings, great orchestration, and intriguing characters. He was able to put together a talented cast, including several from the largely untapped European community. These include Jose Lopez Rodero, giving a short but humorous and witty performance, and the striking Emmanuelle Seigner, who plays her part with the perfect subtlety (no doubt due in part to Polanski's influence). Johnny Depp (playing the bibliophile anti-hero) gives another adept performance and the musical score is expertly composed. The only negatives I noticed were that the movie was at times too slow paced and that the ending left something to the imagination. But all-in-all Polanski has left us with an enduring thriller propelled by a (refreshingly) character-driven tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an expertly paced thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate is an expertly paced thriller that relies more on intrigue and subtlety than it does on gross out scenes. Johnny Depp plays a "book detective" who must authenticate a Satanic text that is reputed to conjure the devil. Early scenes feature a battle of sarcastic insults between Depp and Frank Langella's character, a multimillionare who hires Depp to authenticate the book. As Depp traverses Europe to acquire information, he is assisted by Emanuelle Seigner, who is coy when Depp interrogates her on her role in Depp's quest. Seigner's help is needed, as other forces jostle for possession of the book. The ending is not particularly explosive as a film involving the Devil would suggest, but there is enough intrigue and plot twisting to make The Ninth Gate an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragically under-appreciated work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSAt first, I thought it would be best not to say too much about this movie. It is so good that I didn't want to give any of it away. However, now that I've read the overwhelmingly negative reviews, I'd like to say a few things in the movie's defense.The Ninth Gate is not a horror movie, not a thriller, not a campy comedy, not a drama. If you force the movie in any of these categories and judge it by the category's standards, the movie will be doomed to fail. What is the Ninth Gate, then? I'd say it's a character-based exploration of good and evil that also entertains us by poking fun at the representation of good and evil in popular culture. At the same time that the film plays with and laughs at cinematic conventions related to Satanism, heros, and villains, it offers us a very serious view of the nature of evil in contemporary life. This view crystallises at the very end of the film, when the ninth gate explodes with light. Insane psychopaths who spend all their time and money trying to wake the devil are not what the devil wants, this film tells us. The devil wants those millions of lukewarm types--people who are centered around their own survival and comfort, without strong feelings of morality, love, or hatred. To win these people over to the side of hell by offering them knowledge, power, and pleasure would be to win a great battle against God.The charge that the movie is ambiguous is preposterous. Some say that the unnamed girl could be an angel, a demon, or a good but flawed person. Which should we choose? Well, anyone who watches the movie closely and sees how she reacts to various murders should have no trouble choosing. Others say that the ending is either heavenly or hellish and that it's impossible to say which. Again, anyone who pays attention and notices that the castle is the ninth gate, that there is a shadowy figure standing in the window when it fills with light, and that Depp is the very man depicted in the book that he reads should easily realise that the ending is utterly hellish. The film does leave open the question of whether hell is actually a reprehensible place, I think, but this is not ambiguity; this is a disturbingly open question that the film raises with intellectual mastery. Evil does have its attractions; that's why it's so prevalent throughout the world.There is so much more to say about this movie, so many little details that deserve praise. Take Depp's ride in a truck filled with sheep--this is the birth of an antichrist. This time the devil wins with his/her temptations. Take the resemblance of the figures in the film to the figures in the books--clear but not at first obvious. There's so much here, so much. This is an exceptional film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HUGE SPOILERS HERE--read me for clarification</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HUGE SPOILERS, DON'T READ IF YOU DON'T WANT 'EMI don't have time to read all 270 reviews right now, heh, though I have read several. One I saw that caught my eye mentioned something about the libraries and all of the "precious" books being burned, pages destroyed, ripped up, etc... My own take on this is that here all of these people are searching through the books, looking for the supposed wisdom inside, but that wisdom is never contained inside. I think the books are burned to symbolize the fact that the answer will never really be found in them.In this vein, many people have expressed a lot of confusion over The Girl, but they're missing the point of the film entirely. *She* is Lucifer. First of all, as it's been noted elsewhere, she is the only character that exhibits supernatural powers in the whole movie, in spite of the fact that there's more satanists than you could throw a rock at. Throughout the film she guides and assists Johnny Depp's character Corso, showing up at the most opportune moments, giving him information he'd never be able to get otherwise (like the girl's last name, St. Martin, and the location of the last page).But the most crucial element here, and one I haven't seen mentioned before, is that SHE is the "Ninth Gate". It's the mirror image of divine grace. Corso is chosen by Lucifer herself, tempted by her, and led to the final realization of what's been going on all this time. She tempted him and he accepted. He was already somewhat sleazy to begin with, his soul already tainted, which was symbolized by his indulgence in so many vices. This is not a guy you can count on to "do the right thing." Witness the way he bashed the satanist's head in with the butt of the gun and then didn't seem too upset about it. In fact he hardly registered it at all--The Girl was more moved by the murder than he was.Absolutely no one could have told Corso where the last page of the gate engravings was except Lucifer. Corso was hand-picked. I mean, would you give Ultimate Power to just any bozo? Of course not. That was the whole idea behind the puzzle of the nine pages in the first place. It weeded out idiots like Boris Balkan. He thought he could get power by figuring out the puzzle but he was as ridiculous as the robed and cowled satanists that he derided at the chateau.All in all, I think many people missed the entire point of this movie which is somewhat disheartening. When you see The Girl's picture on the last page it should all come together for you. If not, maybe something straightforward like The Omen series would be more your speed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Found a Few More clues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS - - - - - - -- I just watched this movie again and there are a few comments I would like to add to the general ideas. Firstly, my impression of THE GIRL was that she was like a Valkyrie of Norse Myth, she chose who would make it to Valhalla, or Hell in this case. But she could be the devil herself certainly. Although this movie was about choosing one person to be enlightened (as they said "Thus let the light shine" on the front engraving) or if you insist on being terribly judeo-Christian-Islamic about it, de-enlightened, this could have been only one of many through the ages as De Torquia himself must have been chosen, for example. Also, The actual 9th plate engraving shows a 7 headed beast which may be the 7 deadly sins, however, it shows the beast harnessed and being ridden by the girl reading a book, meaning she had overcome the pull of the sins and tamed them by education.Also, the 2nd time Corso visits the shop of the brothers Ceneza, the two guys there (workmen) were played by the same one guy who played both Cenesa brothers. I checked the credits to be sure. Plus, the same child's voice on both visits says, "Si, Si Mama!" suggesting that the shop exists outside of "real" time.To eat from the tree of the KNOWLEDGE of good and evil is to understand duality thus the serpent could be seen as the bringer of enlightenment not death. the first two times Corso sees dead bodies (Bernie and Vargas) he says Jesus Christ or God Almight, thus signaling the god as he is generally understood is the bringer of death, not life.The girl is overlooked because she appears poor, badly dressed and unwashed. Telfer and Balkan would never have spoken to her, even though she is the way to what they claim to seek. They can never "see" her. Balkan wears thick glasses and Corso's glasses get broken symbolizing that what is commonly accepted as a way to see really hinders actual "seeing".The Baroness "saw" the devil when she was 15 and sought him ever since but she also fell by the wayside by distraction. Balkan, by sending Corso to do the work (even though it was his idea to compare the books) shows he is not worthy. Corso did things he never thought he would do. He went through streams, begged rides, rode with animals and walked to get to the tower. He may have followed those who forged the way, but HE was willing to see her and personally do what it took. I think any of those people could have been chosen if they had "seen" and done the work themselves. Instead they all got rich and lazy while Corso is described as "lean and hungry". Just some ideas I got from this great great work of art. I'm going to read the nove on which it was based.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about books has never been so interesting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regrettably, I never saw this film at the theatre. I wish I had, though, as it is just my type of movie. I first saw it on TV, and after taping it and watching it numerous times, I realised this was a film that I simply HAD to buy on DVD. And so I did. I've watched it a few times since then, and it's still as good as the first time I watched it (if not better), which is why I regret not getting to see it at the cinema. So...what makes this film so great? Well, to put it bluntly...EVERYTHING. The story, the way it's told, the way the film looks, the characters and the actors, the MUSIC - it all combines to make what I think is a superb (yet sadly underrated) film. Okay, so it may not be for everyone. It's not mindless action, for one thing. It actually requires some *thought* and some may perceive it as "slow and boring", but for those who like a good psychological thriller filled with mystery, intrigue and supernatural elements, then this is the film for you.Johnny Depp adds yet another fine performance to his already extensive resumé. Dean Corso is a character who, in the hands of a lesser actor, may have come across as someone quite unlikeable. In fact, at the start of the film, Corso isn't a particularly likable guy. But Depp wastes no time in making you grow to like him, and pretty soon you're on his side, as he goes on this rather bizarre assignment of his. And what a journey it is, filled with an assortment of weird and wonderful characters - all brought to life by actors with varying degrees of experience (but all of whom give equally solid performances).Frank Langella as Boris Balkan is an ever-looming presence in the film. Although he doesn't share that many scenes with Depp (and is mostly just heard over the phone), Balkan's voice is more than enough to remind Corso of what he's gotten himself into. He's a scary guy, and Langella does scary more than adequately. Then there's Lena Olin. What can you say about her? She's - quite simply - awesome. She's sultry, sexy and deliciously evil. As Liana Telfer, Lena Olin gets to play low-key menacing, only to switch to over-the-top chest-biting/face-scratching psycho woman on a dime.Then there are other characters that Corso encounters, like the twin Ceniza brothers, Victor Fargas and Baroness Kessler (and her scary secretary), not to mention Telfer's ridiculously-haired bodyguard. All these characters have their quirks and every one of them makes for an interesting encounter with Corso. However, the best - hands down - has got to be The Girl (nicknamed "Green Eyes" by Corso), played to perfection by the mesmerising Emmanuelle Seigner. I had never seen her, nor heard of her prior to this film. I can safely say that I have been missing out in the BIGGEST way. What a find she is. Emmanuelle is everything this quite essential character needs to be: she's alluring, she's mysterious, she's wicked and most importantly, you can understand why Corso would be drawn to her. In her mismatching socks, dirty sneakers and baggy anorak, she is the most unassuming person Corso could meet...but there's this underlying sense of malice. With her otherworldly features (most notably, her brilliant green eyes - which cannot be anything but supernatural in nature, given the way they flare up occasionally), not to mention the way she seems to - on occasion - FLOAT, you can tell that she's bewitching Corso (in a sense) and aiding him on his journey towards what he seeks.All of their scenes together are great (and yet, she's not overused in the film. She only appears at key moments and her interaction with Corso is all the more effective *because* of the rather limited amount of scenes they share). It all culminates in a rather steamy scene outside an appropriately flaming castle. This scene is most memorable, due to the excellent use of effects. They're so subtle, and yet incredibly effective. Just watch her face (and yes, I realise that's probably not the thing your eyes would be immediately drawn to in the scene), keep an eye out for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it changes and how eerily effective they are. It's one of the creepier moments in the film (and quite possibly my favourite moment of all). The music also helps make the scene unforgettable. This movie is filled with great moments, though. It's all exquisitely shot, the music is perfect throughout, and it's evident how much precision and care has been put into the film (even the beginning and end credits are memorable/unsettling). And the moral of the story? Beware the blonde with the excessively hairy eyebrows. Don't have sex with the devil in disguise in front of a burning castle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film...Grossly misunderstood! Easily one of Polanski's finest!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the critics ratings and user ratings really surprise and shock me at times. "The Ninth Gate" is rated so low, even by the critics (and several movie buffs), I really did not have much expectations from this movie. However, it was after all, a supernatural thriller by Roman Polanski and that was reason enough for me to see it. This, along with some comment I read somewhere that it is similar to Angel Heart, heightened my curiosity and finally saw it! And boy.. am I glad I did!This is one of Polanski's finest films. There is no sense comparing it to Polanski's earlier classic based on the supernatural, Rosemary's Baby. That is, of course, a classic, but that does not render The Ninth Gate any lesser in terms of quality. The story revolves around a man called Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), who happens to be a dealer in rare books. He is hired by a wealthy book collector by the name of Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) to authenticate a rare and very special book in his possession, "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows". There are only three surviving copies and Balkan is convinced that only one is authentic and the others, forgeries. Corso takes up the job and then begin his investigations and a very mysterious odyssey full of twists and turns. To reveal anything more would be a crime. One should watch the movie to experience it completely.Polanski has incorporated all the elements that make for a great movie. An interesting plot (based on "El Club Dumas", by Arturo Pérez-Reverte), Darius Khondji's brilliant cinematography, Wojciech Kilar's killer background score, Polanski's masterful direction and the overall atmospheric nature of the movie make up for a great watch! Not to mention some great acting from Johnny Depp (always dependable) and Frank Langella. And let's not forget Mrs. Polanski herself, Emmanuelle Seigner in a very interesting role. As for the poor reviews this film generally got, I must say I am stumped. There is not a single weak moment; the proceedings glide by smoothly, and are more than intriguing. Suffice to say, it's a very well made film and a fascinating experience.Never mind, that some so-called critics have lambasted it for some unanswered questions and ambiguities in the story. They are probably the kind who like everything packaged in a neat order with ends all tied up, and are averse to enigma and ambiguity. My viewpoint is that there may be untied ends and unanswered questions...but it is nothing that can't be figured out.The Ninth Gate is the kind of movie that you would wanna watch again..and then discuss it with fellow-viewers..then watch it again. And am sure, every viewing will yield newer ideas and interpretations..</fullReview>

Excellent acting by Johnny Depp and Frank Langella.Roger Ebert gave it 2 stars, because he didn't like how vague the ending was.

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood, Underrated Work of a Genius..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a first rate film by a cinematic genius. There is nothing un-Polanski about this movie. If you persist in thinking that there is, then your understanding of his genius is limited! How many people actually understood this film??? Not many. And I don't think it is THAT difficult to figure out what occurs at the end. Even people who rated it high failed to grasp the ending, which suggests that they failed to grasp it at all! Most people don't know why they like a movie that they see. And those who do know why and can put it into words are usually giving the criteria for refined entertainment, not art!! Polanski is a true genius, and hence, his films are by definition not likely to be appreciated by very many. Which is not to say that his work is an exercise in intellectual acrobatics. Not at all. I would expect that someone who has seen his other films would understand (i.e., the fearless vampire killers is a good one to compare this one to..), but alas, people jump on the critical bandwagon and say 'this is not polanski's finest'...WHATEVER! You have to be approaching his genius in order to see what perfect art he produces EVERY time he makes a film (what other kind of craftsperson could you imagine wakes up one day and forgets their craft? None! So don't be a fool and underestimate the true film artist!) Okay, enough ranting. THe ending: THere are two parallel levels of meaning to be interpreted in this film. THere is the superficial storyline, which obviously most people didn't not care to delve beneath. And then there is what is really going on. Johnny is living out his destiny, with fate (the blonde) to guide him and ensure that he gets through all of the gates. Johnny becomes greedy and ultimately kills to get his hands on the engravings. Johnny 'consumates' his commitment to the darkside when he finally beds the blonde devil-incarnate/devil's helper/fate itself, and although Johnny doesn't realize it, she is the gateway, and he has just gone through, so to speak. The last engraving being a rip-off, and Johnny's being guided to the real one in such an obvious way should tell you that this is not the 'real story' of how Johnny gets through. Also notice that Satan's helper (blonde) is in the engraving. It was Johnny's destiny to actualize each engraving, and be the dark prince. WHy him? Because he is so utterly naive, committed, and greedily curious...he actually believes that he is doing the work of figuring everything out... This is not a film for the general public who were probably disappointed at the lack of special effects or something. Polanski's films are not 'artsy' or 'intellectual' but nevertheless they are not going to be appreciated by everyone. He is subtle...a true genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie with philosophical insights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie was very fabulous. I was fortunate enough to see without any kind of idea about movie beforehand. Didn't see the move from beginning or whole, basically just stayed watching after wandering front of TV. Had no idea what movie was about.Why this movie is fabulous is because it ambiguous. Reading many comments here, I got bit better insight what movie was about. I admit also missing few things, but fortunately got most parts right in first try.Movie has good mix of ominous events and old mysteries hidden in books that leave you wonder for a while.But I'm not totally convinced about the accuracy of many interpretations what I've read . What I do think is that Polankski made a movie, that actually imitated how mysteries work.He creates patterns us to see in interpret, but actually leaves us to figure out on ourselves what they mean. What they mean to us actually, not necessarily what he meant, if he even meant anything at all with them. Some patters lead to something, others to many things as they are vague or nowhere. Devilish stuff - or just normal mysteries worldwide.How movie ends is exactly like that.Most interesting question I find after watching movie was the idea of Devil in the movie. I actually didn't get the notion Devil was most evil person in the movie.Way Boris acted later on the movie when he address cultist, I think sort of crystallized what the movie was about.Devil can't make you do anything evil, if you don't want to. And then you probable would do it anyway without Devil. So why worship something for it, if target is anyway selfish not caring about you and you do what you do anyway? And why would Devil care about then do you worship him or not?I think that was the main joke in the movie. Corso in the movie differs rest of characters in way the he doesn't actually believe in Devil. He is just motivated by self interest and probable by intrigue. Thats why he is main character and sort of picked above other persons in the movie. That also means he also actually has something to offer for Devil, as his self interest connects to Devils. So Devil is rational in this movie besides Corso, others are more or less loose cannons that actually have nothing worthwhile to offer. Lesson here: rational people are motivated by self interest. So why does no one ask in the movie why the books were created in the first place? Its interesting though to believe somebody would create people something wonderful just to grasp, but why would anyone, especially Devil, do it without some use for himself? Devil wouldn't, but most people after books never stop and think about it. And thats how many cultists think, they aren't rational in their beliefs. Part of the movie actually shows how funny cultist are, even the Devil they worship can be seen amused by them.In this movie, Devil looks far more person that really doesn't care about something unless it really benefits him/her.But like I said, you can get other interpretations from it, just my 5 cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Requires concentration and some thinking, but well worth it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's start by addressing the negative reviews of this film. It is clear that many of the reviewers were expecting a five minute prologue to introduce some simplistic characters, followed by 90 minutes with a host of winged, clawed, fire-breathing demons, with lots of slashing and blood, ending with a huge climactic conclusion with ten minutes of implausible fighting, and they were disappointed. What they weren't expecting was to have to concentrate, to follow and understand the plot, to work out the clues, and to ..... think for themselves a bit and use their imaginations while enjoying the journey!So, if you only like films where you don't have to think, and where the bad guys all have European accents and obvious world domination motives, and where every small detail of the plot is laid out for you verbally and in simple sentences by the characters, and there's lots of blood / gore / explosions, then don't watch this - just head straight for re- runs of Die Hard (which, for clarity, I also like, but in a completely different way from this film).If, on the other hand, you enjoy clever films with an interesting story, where the plot develops and twists and turns gently to keep you on your toes, and where you are never quite sure who are the good guys and the bad guys, or where all of the protagonists are decidedly ambiguous, then this is for you.The scenery and cinematography are perfect and absorbing, the dialogue is credible and realistic. The acting is generally excellent, with only a couple of small parts of scenes where the performances are a bit flat. The ending isn't simply tacked on (as others have said), but is a sensible and interesting conclusion to a compelling story, tying together the rest of the plot in a way that makes logical sense of all of the twists and turns and clues. I don't want to say more and spoil the ending, but I will say that it isn't a huge, ten minute, edge of your seat epic struggle. It is an appropriate, relatively low-key finish, where you are left to imagine the obvious details, but that in no way detracts from the ending - it simply relies on you being vaguely intelligent, and doesn't insult that intelligence by spoon-feeding you.I have a couple of minor gripes with this film. I can't believe that a rare book dealer would smoke and drink while examining the books (he actually smokes and drinks OVER the books), or would treat them with such lack of care (wrapping his copy in a cloth instead of packing it more robustly, leaving it in all sorts of strange places, allowing someone the opportunity to switch the book, forcing the pages flat so as to break the spine, etc.). I also struggle to believe that he didn't make better notes when comparing the books (I don't want to say any more.....!). A Rolls Royce wouldn't stop just because it was being driven through a ford in a river - it might stall, but it's a 2.3 ton car so its momentum would keep it rolling. The matte work and effects on the castle looks a little crude, even for 1999. However, none of this detracts from an excellent and very enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are answers if you look for them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoiler - Don't read this if you haven't already seen the film)First off, I have to say that I really enjoyed the movie. Polanski is a genius at making his characters so much larger than life, almost caricatures of real people. I think that he does this by choosing just the right costumes and accessories (in Corso's case it was the satchel, the glasses and the woolen tie), and then filming the characters up close so that they seem to fill up the whole screen. This gives a very personal feel to the movie.A number of reviewers have commented on the lack on an ending, or the lack of explanations to many questions. I found the ending to make sense, and I found no unanswered questions. As another reviewer pointed out that Polanski admitted he didn't have a real ending for the film, perhaps my understanding of the ending has nothing to do with what Polanski had in mind.Towards the end of the film, Balkan solves the enigma of the Nine Gates by reuniting all of the Lucifer engravings, and reads the riddle to himself (and a watching Corso). The riddle (as far as I would make out) is `To travel in silence; by a long a secretous (confusing?) path; to brave the arrows of misfortune; and fear neither noose nor fire; to play the greatest game and win; foregoing all expense; is to make a (something?) of faith; and gain at last the key; that will unlock the ninth gate.'If you watch the film closely, you will find that Corso does indeed, albeit unknowingly, follow the instructions in the riddle. He travels discretely; the path certainly is confusing; he had many misfortunes, but persists; when confronted with his dead friend (on the noose), and in several places fire, he is not afraid; he certainly played the game of looking for (and getting) the engravings; he spared no expense, notice the bribes and tips that he passes around; and at the Baroness's library he proclaimed his failing faith.Perhaps Balkan had also done similar deeds, but since the last engraving was a forgery, and gave the wrong instructions, he failed to open the Gate.Who made the forgery? Obviously the Ceniza brothers. When Corso met them, they showed ample knowledge of what was required to forge a book like the Nine Gates. Their solution was to forge only a single sheet in the book. Being specialists in antique bookbinding, they could very well have replaced the page. You can make up your own mind why they did it. Was it because they knew the power of the book and wanted to make sure that anybody who tried to open the Gate would fail, or were they agents of Lucifer who wanted to be able to choose whom (s)he allowed to access the Gate?What was behind the Ninth Gate? What do _you_ think? Hell, heaven, ultimate power, ultimate suffering? It's whatever you think it is. You don't have to be told, just decide what it is yourself.Why wasn't Corso arrested for murder? Who actually saw him at the murder scenes? In New York it was the taxi driver who would probably not find out about the murder anyway. In Portugal, Fargas lived by himself and probably didn't tell anyone that Corso was visiting him. In France there were two witnesses, but they only caught a glimpse of Corso fleeing the scene, and even if they did recognize him, the police still had to find him, and he skipped town pretty soon after.All in all, I think that there are answers for just about any questions you could ask about the film. But you must, as the Ceniza brothers would say, `think!'</fullReview>

You have to know very much about the satanic background to understand all the details and the course of the plot. And that doesn´t involve the "traditional" satan nonsense. The audience was very disappointed, cause they awaited a devil or something like that. But it wasn´t about such crap (go, see arnold for that), but about following your own goal. And it was a pleasure to see the character evolving in that way through the movie. There won´t be that much people who´ll understand the film, but they´ll enjoy it!!!</fullReview>

I really enjoyed how the film differentiated between bogus Satanism and what would more likely be the case if Lucifer were to make his presence known. Johnny Depp is brilliantly cast as the shady rare books dealer and Frank Langella gives his best performance as the millionaire Satanist intent on finding the final page of a spell that was reportedly written by The Dark One himself.

		<shortDescription>Marvelous, subtle thriller; an exquisitely crafted tapestry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS THROUGHOUT *** Viewers who give The Ninth Gate high praise are "very perceptive" indeed. The film's slow pace is Polansky's device allowing us to savor plot richness as originally conceived in Perez-Reverte's admirable novel, El Club Dumas. Plot details eliminated serve to enhance rather than detract from this translation of literature to film. Polansky's focus on auditory and visual detail is a metaphor for omitted storyline. Music (signature pieces, orchestra, voice), set design, location, cinematography, fine ensemble acting by a stellar cast, dialogue meticulously incorporated from the novel, all combine to layer a modern gothic veneer over a film that is essentially medieval noir. Often in translations of this sort what is lost makes gains visually in ways that are surprising and compelling. This is true of The Ninth Gate. Polansky seems to be reminding us that one picture is, indeed, worth a thousand words. The obvious -- and not so obvious -- delectable plot turns have been discussed by IMDB reviewers but one theory doesn't seem to have been mentioned (or I may have failed to notice it). This story may represent a dream sequence -- Corso's Dream. Several clues indicate this. 1) The slow pace of the film vaguely resembles sleepwalking. (A professor in my screenwriter's class mentioned that Kubrick's film, Eyes Wide Shut, was deliberately slow to mimic the pace of lovemaking). 2) Corso is found napping at the conclusion of Balkan's lecture (maybe he naps often because he drinks quite a bit). "The girl" is the last person Corso sees before falling asleep. Is this why she's incorporated in the story as a stranger without identity? (She is given a name in the novel.) Her socks - blue and red: affirming the dual nature of divinity - are viewed by the audience only after Corso falls asleep. Also, Corso and Balkan discuss sleep in a long, bizarre conversation as they walk together toward the library. 3) When Corso arrives on Liana's doorstep and greets her for the first time, he says: "Good morning". When she takes him into her husband's library a few moments later the clock very clearly strikes three times: Is it early morning or midafternoon? 4) On Corso's arrival at the Cineza bookbindery in Portugal, one set of church bells begins to chime the hour then another set joins in from another direction a few seconds later. This works to clue us in to the true identity of these two fellas but also serves to confuse us regarding time sequence. This entire scene is easily one of the film's best. It has an eeriely comical, dreamlike "feel". (Wonderful!!) 5) On the train as Corso makes his way from car to car (slightly drunk), he meets "the girl" who asks him: "Are you traveling in this car?" He indicates he's in the next car and she says with a knowing nod: "The Sleeper". Is she commenting on his state of wakefulness? 6) After visiting Fargus, Corso returns to his hotel room and is wakened by "the girl" pounding on his door: Tousled, groggy and grumpy, Corso snaps at her: "What time is it?" eyeing his watchless wrist. The church bell outside strikes exactly five times. Do the chimes we hear in each case signal Corso's entry into cycle of REM activity? 7) Is the light which envelopes Corso at film's end celestial in origin or is it hellfire? Does it signal Corso's awakening from the dream state -- a changed man, perhaps? Perez-Reverte finished his novel with the comment: Every man gets the devil he deserves. We are left to wonder which devil exactly Corso is heir to. The seductive pleasure in this work is that its secrets must be discovered like treasure and mined to unearth its gems. This is one for the ages. Rating: 11 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have finally decided to write my piece of mind about this masterpiece. This underrated, dark piece of cinema. This is actually my favorite Polanski film. And that says a lot, I think.One of very few films I can not see a flaw in. Everybody is perfectly cast (I can admit though, as many have stated before me, that "The Girl" could have been played by someone else). Polanski's style is very comfortable to watch. Kilar's Soundtrack is mesmerizing, soothing and gives that mystical feel that few movies have. Repetitive, yes -- But beautiful never the less.Depp as the antihero Corso is unforgettable. He's no saint, but we feel for him and understand his choices. Langella portrays Balkan perfectly, and gives the movie the edge it needs. And let's not forget Olin, who makes a solid role as Mrs Telfer.I have watched this movie once a year for the last three years, and at each viewing, raised my rating for it by one point. Starting at 7/10, I now believe that it at least deserves 9/10. This movie really takes its time with each plot point, which is rare these days. I think You should watch this movie and just enjoy movie-making at its finest. These 2 hours and 13 minutes just fly by and leaves you wanting more.</fullReview>

The music score complemented the film perfectly, but the ending offers no resolution and will leave you extremely disappointed. If the ending had resolved the plot, this would have been a 8/10 or 9/10 movie rating easily. I really loved the movie right up until it ended.

		<fullReview>Right now, the average grade of this movie, here on IMDb is 6.6 A coincidence?"Ninth Gate" is another, after cult classic 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968), example of critically acclaimed and controversial director's Roman Polanski... fascination with evil. The story looks simple. A rare book dealer Dean Corso (Johny Depp) gets an assignment to compare - by first finding the missing ones - the three last copies of a medieval "Ninth Gate of the Kingdom of Shadows". Of course the hunt for the book, gets more and more complicated as strange things begin to happen and Corso gets himself involved in something beyond imagination..."Ninth Gate" brings out of memory the "Devil's Advocate" with Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino but in many ways it's totally different. First - Roman Polanski proves he is such acclaimed director for a reason. In every scene, you feel his existence, you feel that almost every scene has its powerful significance. Part of that is great, cold and suspenseful Cinematography. Great Score by Wojciech Kilar adds to the climate of the movie.Johny Depp is great as always, and in the seconds plan actors you won't find a bad one. The screenplay is witty, there is unexpected humour in a lot of situations which makes it an easy, fun watch until... the ending. The ending turns the movie into a dark thriller leaving lot of things open, unsaid. We can almost FEEL the evil, in the end.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable movie. Roman P. is a great director. Right up there with Martin S. This movie, if you believe it, is about getting an equal footing with God through Lucifer. Lucifer is the father of all lies. Don't believe in the point of the movie. Of all the talented directors Roman P. is the only one who is obsessed with horror and specifically with the devil. Why ? Look at Rosemary's Baby, The Fearless Vampire Killers, etc. The story line is fascinating, to be on a level with God while on earth. No one in the history of man has Lucifer ever giving anything to us except horror. Lucifer, once God's best friend, tempted by Bilal to realize himself more, turn out to be God's great enemy. Hmmmm, Jesus of Nazareth choose 12 close friends to be his apostles. Three of them choose to deny Him. One choose to betray Him. Judas the betrayer, Peter denied knowing Him, and Thomas who choose to see so that he can believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every scene features either somebody smoking (Corso if not someone else) and ashes. The Ceniza brothers have a Spanish last name that means 'ash'. And, of course, this being a movie about the devil and an author burned at the stake, fire and smoke and ashes HAVE to be there as a means for Polanski to add some humor to the story. Maybe. But I still am trying to figure out the Ceniza bros. They look like the angel with bow and arrow in one of the engravings. Or are they the reincarnation of the infernal spirit of Aristide Torchi, author of the Ninth Gate, burned at the stake? When Corso, in the final scene, goes into their Toledo bookstore one hears and sees one boy saying in Spanish "sí, sí mamá", the very words Corso heard from him the first time he went into the Ceniza's store (a time capsule).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great Polanski detective thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A long overdue return to form from the master Polanski. The ninth gate is a great detective thriller, a kind of combo of Polanski's 2 best movies: Rosemarys Baby &amp; Chinatown.Johnny Depp is excellent as the mercenary, sleazy Raymond chandler-esquire detective and Frank Langella also gives a great performance as the collector who hires Depp to authenticate his book which can supposedly summon the devil.The film moves along with a good pace with many characters and has everything that you expect from a Polanski film; dark humour, great dialogue, immaculate cinematography and of course beautiful women(including Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner &amp; Lena Olin as the femme fatale).The film is much better than the novel on which it's based(the Dumas club) although the film is not Polanski's best(lets face it Rosemary's baby &amp; Chinatown are pretty hard to top) it's still a great film with great music, this is one of the best thrillers of recent years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At last, something interesting ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Congratulations and thanks to Polanski &amp; Co. for making a truly enjoyable film.(and that's something considering the kind of drivel that is available for our entertainment these days!) For those who keep moaning about being left-out of the ending or the meaning of the film-stick to your Disney's Classics or else grow up, read more books and be more imaginative! These people probably need a on-line walkthrough to go to their own toilet and cant appreciate a little mystery or enigma! Let's face it-the world's a mysterious place and you cant expect neat and convenient signposts! The film as I understood it: Unknown ages ago Satan had given mankind a "manual" describing how to acquire godly powers, in the form of "Delomelanicon", a legendary scroll written by no other than "Louis Cyphre" himself! A Venetian demonologist, Aristide Torchia, acquired a copy of this work and adapted its text and engravings to a book he called "The nine gates to the kingdom of shadows". Torchia deliberately hid the true knowledge of the "Delomelanicon" in three variations of his book-a measure to weed out the lamebrains who read the book "just for a Sunday evening". Only three copies survived his torture and eventual burning at a stake.It is of these volumes that Balkan speaks of in the film. Corso is a cynic and only realize the true significance of the "Nine gates" as he research for Balkan's assignment. In the end it becomes an obsession for him, too. As for the ending ... seeing the last engraving Corso finally realises the true meaning of his quest and he is magically transported to the Devil's castle for an audience with Satan himself. From the choice of actors and the musical score to the locations, the use of SFX, visual metaphors ... "The ninth gate" excels. Polanski's vision is unique, to put it mildly, and the acting by Depp,Lagella and Jafford adds realism to the the quirky characters. Films of such delectable european flavour are indeed rare in these days of uninspired, talentless films. Please dont give us a sequel("Return to the ninth gate", "The ninth gate-part 2") ! For those who found the film to be "heavy" - give up on the original story "The Club Dumas" by Arturo Peres-Reverte ... you will be confused some more. As for the rest, please find a copy and enjoy since it is much more detailed than the story and have those cool engravings!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some people don't know what "thriller" means...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite taken aback by some of the highly negative comments about this excellent supernatural thriller. After a bit of reflection, I noticed they seemed to fall into two groups:1. People who thought that a "thriller" is a similar genre to an "action movie". This movie contains no explosions, only three on-screen deaths, and only one high speed chase which lasts all of about 10 seconds because the chasee gets away. It does have sex, mystery in a very Sam Spade-esque sense, unusual camera techniques to heighten tension, plausible levels of violence, and a very spooky supernatural element. That last deserves some amplification too: with modern CGI, you might be expecting some breathtaking "apparition" effects. And you'd probably be thinking, "Nice CGI, but it's really kind of cheesy". Not in this movie; the supernatural element is so subtle it nearly makes your skin crawl. In fact at quite a few points you nearly start thinking they're all just crackpots and nothing is really happening, but then Seigner's "thing" happens again and makes it clear that All Is Not Well.2. Some people were annoyed by the lack of an explanatory ending. I admit I am not sure what happened, but I've a couple of theories and enjoyed discussing them with others after the movie. What's wrong with that, for heaven's sake? It's a bit of a sad indictment that people feel cheated if they don't get everything spelled out for them. For those who want my theory, MILD SPOILER ALERTIt's not shown because it's irrelevant. The film is about Corso's journey of discovery and seduction; he is transformed from faithless and selfish to openly embracing evil. Does he gain what he seeks? The question is unimportant, what mattered was his decision, for one way or another he is now surely lost.END OF SPOILERMy only gripe: I was actually kind of interested in the puzzle, but they never showed it clearly enough or long enough to get to grips with it. Maybe this is to force me to get the DVD 8^(</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unscrupulous book dealer Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is drawn into a dangerous world of witchcraft, magic, and mystery after he is hired by collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) to seek out the only remaining copies of Satanic textbook 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows', a work reputed to have the power to summon the Devil.After several viewings, I still don't fully comprehend everything about The Ninth Gate: it's one of those film that is deliberately ambiguous. Despite my frustration at my lack of understanding, I still have a fun time trying to further unravel the riddle, spot as-yet undiscovered clues and diabolical references, and work out the answers to questions posed by the plot.While the film's inconclusive narrative does little to diminish my enjoyment of this wonderfully complex supernatural thriller, which benefits from excellent direction from Polanski, a great leading performance from Depp, and a suitably ominous score, I do struggle with the way in which the bibliophiles portrayed treat their treasured tomes, smoking fags and slurping alcohol as they study the text, handling the books sans protective gloves, and leaving vital pages to gather dust on top of old bookshelves?I treat second-hand paperbacks better than that!7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, when I first saw this movie a few years a go I didn't get it. (I'm not sure I still get it.) But I was still captivated by it. The atmosphere and the slow pacing just kept me interested. Cinematography is great and every scene and shot is a joy to look at. The acting is brilliant, Lena Olin especially gives a very good performance. The ominous score and the eerie atmosphere will glue you in.I don't wish to spoil the plot too much, but let's just say that Corso's mission is to authenticate a book that was supposedly written by the Devil himself. This simple mission starts a journey or rather a descent, into a corrupted and bizarre world. Corso himself is not a very noble man either. It's interesting to see just how far he is willing to go, as his journey gets more and more dangerous. His employer promises more money as the journey gets ever more dangerous and bizarre. People are reluctant to help Corso and he has to resort to dubious means to obtain information. Corso is a very intriguing character. Depp plays him well of course and it's quite fascinating to watch Corso's descent. Emmanuelle Seigner is very creepy and sexy. Fine performance from her too.The only negative thing is that dumb "Shell" product placement. It really took me out of the movie. Maybe this movie is a bit too clever as well for it's own good. It took me quite a while to understand the ending. Other than that Ninth Gate is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cinema of Roman Polanski: The Ninth Gate of Hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate (1999) was Roman Polanski's return to the horror genre. This tale takes place in France and it stars American ex-patriate Johnny Depp. Former mac daddy Frank Langella, Lena Olin and Polanski's hot wife Emmanulle Seigner co-star as well. An investigator of sorts (Johnny Depp) is hired by a rich collector (Frank Langella) to search for a rare and possible demonic book. Lena Olin is a rival collector and occultist who wants the book for her own personal gain and Ms. Polanski is Depp's "benefactor".An interesting horror flick that doesn't rely on flashy expensive special effects and gory set pieces. It's a psychological thriller that'll keep you entertained and caught up in all of the mystery and intrigue. The ending and story of the movie has many interpretations and it'll keep you guessing until the very ending.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Polanski's mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Polanski once again directed an interesting mystery film-thriller starred by Johnny Depp and seconded by Polanski's wife, Emmanuele Seigner, and Lena Olin. From the very beginning one is trapped by the excitement and curiosity to know about the fate of copies of a particular book. In fact the excitement lasts only until the secret is discovered. The film although starts in New York where Polanski cannot be, it recreates mainly in Spain and cold Paris. The merit of this film is that instead of looking for a rare jewel, the agent (Depp) was trying to understand the mystery of a book. The environment of the film was all cultural since it shows three or four libraries, but also with some doses of violence. Instead of being a Superman, Depp behaved as a normal human being, only cautious when the circumstances demand to be like that. The film is good to be seen, in addition to its excitement, it gives also some entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First I'll say a few words about the "looks good" in the title. Movies these days are so DARK. It's as if there's a new rule ? every room must be dark. So I don't watch movies made these days. I've never been in a room where I can't see the wall ? or barely. But nearly all movies these days have rooms where I can't see the wall. Stupid. Or rooms with lights in places where no room in the known universe HAS a light. OK. That's all about that.The Ninth Gate is a good movie with an old Europe feel and an occult slant. You don't have to believe to like this movie, though, and the action is minimal. It's just a good, unique, mystery and a story that keep's you involved in what is going on. Roman Polanski is a director. By that I mean, there a lot of so and so's posing as directors these days in the movies and on TV. The best thing, they say, you can say about a director is: "I didn't realize that he/she (the director) was there." (Today's directors work very hard to tell the audience that they are there.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was willing to go along with The Ninth Gate until I realized that it was playing out just like another Johnny Depp picture, Sleepy Hollow, where-in, one-by-one, people are killed by an unseen, unidentified force or entity.Apparently, the writers/producers of both pictures felt that there was no need to let the viewers know what was actually happening and why. When the baroness was killed, I shut the movie off. Enough was enough.I can suspend some disbelief, but when Bernie was killed, M. Corso should have called the police, instead of inevitably becoming a suspect in the murder.Also, you think he might want to see to a burial/funeral for his business partner before he flies off to Europe? The door to the antiquarian shop was unlocked, so maybe Mr. Corso figured the next customer would find the dead body and take care of the arrangements.After Fargas.., and then the baroness, were killed, Corso would have been an international fugitive. (Oh yes, the flying lady would have saved him from all of that). I am glad we have angels on the side of those who would do (just about) anything for money and who make it their sole raison d'etre.The music in this movie was incongruous to the point of it being ridiculous. When the lady hit Corso over the head with a bottle, I thought I was watching The Naked Gun, or some similar movie. Were they trying to be funny?Gratuitous violence with no explanation. Lots of brandy being drunk and cigarettes smoked.Like in Sleepy Hollow, an excellent acting performance by Johnny Depp is wasted by screenwriters who underestimate the intelligence of their audiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***May contain spoilers and stuff*** I hadn't seen this film in several years when I chanced across it on the telly a couple of nights ago. And I have to be honest, it was a lot better than I remembered.Plot: It's all about the devil, books and witchcraft, with a bit of sex, violence and intrigue carefully mixed in for good measure. The film begins quite arrestingly, and then the plot slowly twists and turns, cleverly drawing you in.Acting and casting: Johnny Depp is very credible as the aloof, arrogant, back-stabbing and very unlikable rare-book specialist Dean Corso who would cheerfully sell his own grandmother had he clearly not already done so. Frank Langella brings his not inconsiderable screen presence to the role of Boris Balkan, who employs Corso to do some digging for him; Balkan comes across as utterly chilling and not a little bit deranged. Lena Olin plays the psychotic vamp Liana Telfer, who is hell bent on getting her hands on Corso's package, using a combination of beauty, tight clothing and ruthless violence. Good stuff so far. Emmanuelle Seigner also turns in a good performance as a mysterious young woman who seems to inexplicably turn up throughout the film (don't want to spoil it)...Music: Atmospheric, and very appropriate. Much better than in many lesser films of the genre, as one would expect of Polanski.Setting: Some excellent locations were used, adding to the atmosphere.Summary: If you are at all into suspense, mystery, horror or the supernatural then you will surely greatly enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unscrupulous rare book dealer is hired to seek out the last two copies of a demon text and is subsequently drawn into a supernatural conspiracy.Filmed 11 years after Frantic, The Ninth Gate is the film adaptation of The Dumas Club, written by Arturo Pérez-Reverte. Johnny Depp plays quirky Dean Corso, a book dealer, who is in search of copies of "The Nine Doors To the Kingdom of Shadows", a book purportedly written by Lucifer himself and is said to contain knowledge to raise the devil. Corso gets drawn into a conspiracy with supernatural undertones.The film is actually a lot cleverer than it's given credit for, a subtle subtext, complex story and so on. Johnny Depp gives a fantastic low-key performance as a cynical morally corrupted anti-hero. Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner's is cast as a mysterious blonde. Lena Olin fleets in and out as to does Frank Langella (Boris Balkan) who gives a great exaggerated performance. Like Polanski's Frantic there is an array of quirky characters that push the story forward to a intriguing conclusion.The special effects are very minimal and used very effectively, Darius Khondji's cinematography is excellent and Wojciech Killar score is superb. Writers John Brownjohn Enrique Urbizu and Polanski cleverly allude that what/who the main players are searching for has been in front of them all along in the guise of the unassuming girl, the devil looking for a mate to allow into the kingdom of light.The Ninth Gate is a highly atmospheric occult mystery, and a fascinating experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably not for fans of the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a big fan of "El Club Dumas", the novel on which this film is somewhat based, you will probably be very disappointed by it. In the book, there are two simultaneous plots going on, one dealing with the Nine Gates book and Boris Balkan's desire to obtain what one might call a "working" copy, and the other dealing with an autograph chapter apparently from the lost manuscript of Alexander Dumas' "The Three Musketeers". The protagonist of the book spends much of his time trying to figure out how the two plots are intertwined and, in fact, thinks he has it figured out at various times, but in the end we discover that the plots were indeed separate and unrelated all along. Though this is an ingenious and potentially powerful literary device, for me at least, it didn't work very well and left me quite disappointed with the ending (which is unusual for a Perez Reverte novel, the others that I've read had very strong endings, though this one is still worth the time as his writing is always gripping and thought-provoking). Polanski made the decision when he made this movie to eliminate the Dumas plot line and make the story entirely about the Nine Gates book. That involved considerable rewriting and changes of events and characters. So someone who is expecting a faithful rendition of the novel will be quite annoyed. However, I think Polanski made the right choice because the ending of the film is far stronger and more satisfying than the book. The only thing he could have done better would have been to make a film of Perez Reverte's "The Nautical Chart" or "The Flanders Panel" instead!</fullReview>

There are plenty enough reviews. I just want to point out that "The Girl" is unambiguously Lucifer in the book, so reviewers like Diana51 are correct in their deductions. I would say that many of the reviewers find their clues in the various evil qualities that Corso appears to have. In the book the rather interesting and dangerous question is raised as to whether Lucifer is truly evil, or whether, in fact, Lucifer loves humankind, and out of love persuades Adam and Eve to acquire knowledge about themselves, calling into question the nature and source of good and evil.</fullReview>

Thats why the search for the mysterious is so exciting, it is not so much the result as the process itself that keeps people researching the goal is more like mountain climbing and less like the perfect sexual experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find it incredible that so many people on here who so openly admit that they 'didn't get it' are then so willing to dismiss this movie as rubbish. If you understood it and still didn't find it entertaining then by all means give a review and score explaining why. Enough people who clearly did get it have already said all that needs to be said about this film. As to the rest, who clearly found it too cerebral, stop embarrassing yourselves by pointing out supposed plot discrepancies. This is a well executed film, very entertaining and well worth two hours of your time. However, unlike many films it assumes a degree of intelligence from the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish European backgrounds add flavor to otherwise enigmatic story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's stylish direction is a big plus factor in being able to appreciate THE NINTH GATE for the handsomely photographed thriller that it is in a tale about a man's quest for the only genuine volume of a work penned by the Devil when only three such volumes exist. The mission is assigned to a sleazy book dealer always on the lookout for a sweetheart deal (JOHNNY DEPP who wears glasses to appear scholarly) and it is his acceptance of that mission from an equally shady publishing magnate (FRANK LANGELLA, who literally phones in his performance), that makes the film a clever psychological thriller.For all its cleverness, it does leave one stumbling in the dark toward the end which has a climax that is more confusing than enlightening. It's the kind of ending open to a host of interpretations and perhaps it was the enigma that puzzled too many in the audience and kept the film from having the sort of popularity it deserved.Depp is not as quirky as usual in his characterization and perhaps this is why his fans failed to recognize the full merits of the piece. It's the kind of story that Alfred Hitchcock would have enjoyed filming and no doubt, for added insurance, he would have summoned Bernard Herrmann to write the background score. Perhaps the film would have risen to the level of some of Hitch's best works--but here, unfortunately, it's not one of Polanski's best.Having said that, it's definitely worth viewing for an interesting tour of European locales, striking color photography of handsome sites, and a few intriguing twists along the journey into darkness. If it's not first rate, at least it tries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tall order to make books scary, but this baby does it! Also it has by FAAAARRRR the best and coolest 'meet the devil' scene EVER! And no it's not some pointy guy with horns saying hello. Watch the movie and you'll see... (damn I just got chills thinking about it). OK OK I'll let you in on a secret - devil lives in the burning fire of destruction and is embodied in your lover (ok still doesn't make sense till you see the movie).Well Johnny Depp is a quite good actor I must say, and shooting this thingy all around Europe gives it a fresh 'travel channel' vibe while you go about chasing down demon relics and whatnot - even makes me long for a stay in some of those funky little hotels! :) I must visit! Maybe I shal meet El Diablo...This is a very VERY elegant horror movie. NO bloody gutsy to speak of - but lots of good plot things happening and just all around very 'cool'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understated Excellence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest I can't think of a single thing wrong with this film. It's not my favourite film of all time, but I can certainly appreciate excellence when I see it. If you're a big fan of Hollywood horror films you might just hate it. I would call it more of a thriller than a horror film, but even that isn't quite correct. It's almost like a Bergman film that transcends genres. The film is the story and the story is the film.Roman Polanski has created a film about devil worshipers that has almost no blood and the violence is not at all excessive. There are no teenagers and there are no slashers. There aren't even any traditional villains or heroes really. The villains aren't the usual caricatures that we have become used to and the protagonist is certainly less than heroic. And the demons don't look any different from us.The action is slow and evenly paced over a long movie and it leaves us wanting more at the finish. Which is what a movie should do. Polanski does not wrap every thing up in a neatly tied Hollywood conclusion. We are left with unanswered questions. Since most Hollywood endings are disappointing to at least some viewers, that's a good thing.Very well directed and excellent performances from all of the actors. Emmanuelle Seigner gives a very understated performance and effective performance. Johnny Depp is excellent as always.Cinematography is perfectly suited to the story and the editing doesn't miss a beat. Music and sound are both very good. Special effects are very minimal and used very effectively. And the locations are perfect.I've been a Johnny Depp fan for years, but I somehow missed this film. I'm glad that I finally had the opportunity to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meeting the Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the money-driven dealer Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare-books expert and partner of Bernie (James Russo), who owns a bookstore. He is contacted by the renowned collector of books about the devil Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), who has just acquired the rare The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows from the collector Andrew Telfer, to verify whether his book is authentic or a forgery. Balkan explains that the book was written by the writer Aristide Torchia, in 1666, with Lucifer and he was burned at the stake with his entire work. There are only three exemplars of The Nine Gates and in accordance with the legend, its nine engravings form a riddle to conjure the devil.The skeptical Corso accepts the assignment and has to flight to Sintra, Portugal, and Paris, France, to contact the owners Victor Fargas (Jack Taylor) and Baroness Kessler (Barbara Jefford) to find the genuine exemplar for Balkan. Meanwhile, he asks Bernie to hide the rare book. Before traveling to Europe, the widow Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) wants to retrieve the book and has sex with Corso, but he does not accept her offer. When Corso goes Bernie's bookstore, he finds his friend murdered in the same position of an engraving.Corso travels to Toledo, Spain, to meet the Ceniza twin brothers and learn more about The Nine Gates. During his journey in Europe, Corso is pursued by Liana and her bodyguard, who belong to the sect The Order of the Silver Serpents, and is protected by a mysterious Girl (Emmanuelle Seigner) with supernatural powers. Meanwhile, the owners of the two other exemplars of The Nine Gates are murdered. Corso becomes obsessed with the book and discloses the truth about it."The Ninth Gate" is a great movie with a confused conclusion that is not clear. There are many messy interpretations, but mine is very simple: neither the skeptical Corso nor the Girl is the devil. Corso becomes passionate with The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows and is protected by a supernatural creature. In the end, he succeeds in summoning the devil and The Ninth Gate opens to him and he will meet Lucifer. Just it! My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Último Portal" ("The Last Portal")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stylish masterpiece: no wonder so many dullards dislike it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly the best and most stylish horror of the 1990s, it placed Roman Polanski back at his roots, allowing him to once again explore the dark depths of the occult and the human psyche, and providing the viewers with the pleasure of following the new protagonist on a thrilling journey in search of... ah, no, see the film and find out what it is that Corso wants and what he ultimately discovers. Having seen and loving this masterpiece, I immediately expected hordes of dullwitted mouthbreathers throughout the world to loathe it for its elegance, stylishness, unconventionality and darkness - and they did not disappoint me. I quickly saw them attack the film, complaining (their complaints always badly misspelled, with horrendous syntax, third-grade lexicon and short, monotonous sentences, regardless of the language used) that the movie was "confusing" (please stick to your level of entertainment, an X-Men cartoon), that "nothing happened" in it (nothing certainly ever happens in their heads; as for the film, the fate of the world being chosen and sealed was but one of the things that happened), that it was "too slow" (no, my "dears" - *you* are), or that "the acting was bad" (compared to their favorite pearls of cinematic performance, such as "Scream 3" or "Jason goes to Hell"), or that there "wasn't enough action"... ...and with this complaint of theirs, we arrive at the real reason why the dullards disliked "The Ninth Gate" (other than the fact that they were unable to understand it) - it did not have enough explosions! Not enough Marilyn Manson! Not enough kung-fu fights in slow motion! Not enough Sarah Michelle Gellar! Not enough clone syrup! Well, "dears", sorry - this is a thinking person's film. Not *your* kind of movie, but ours. Now leave us in peace, allow us to enjoy Roman Polanski's vision again, and feel free to go see an Adam Sandler "comedy" or "Charlie's Angels 2" - flicks of this kind should certainly match your "intellectual level" and provide you with enough infantile "entertainment" to last you the whole afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, Absorbing, But Perhaps Dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate reminds me of a more somber, less charming, Hitchcock version of Charade (1963) and an attempt to envelope both a mystery thriller genre with suggestions of the occult. Polanski's 60s direction doesn't age well from his classic horror movie Rosemary's Baby (1968). Today's emphasis on dramatic, stylized hand to hand combat scenes, The Ninth Gate seems pale and actually staged. Depp's character's lack of meticulous care for a rare book and its security seems out of place nowadays, and his character's evolving relationship with the mysterious girl doesn't seem genuine or believable considering the reoccurring circumstances.Polanski does successfully evoke the thriller mood, a slow paced effusion of atmosphere, yet the pacing seems too slow for the lack of the depth substance and crisp cinematography. The clues and mystery evoked is effective, the plot line relatively clear and consistent, yet the magic and spark are missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story opens up in a shocking fashion, straight with a disturbing scene, strongly suggestive although not directly graphic. The story unravels piece by piece in a good manner and steady pace. The end finale though is rather greatly predictable since there are very revealing hints repeated throughout the movie, and centered on just one character. The hidden conflicts don't really explain themselves clearly though. The conflictive relation between Liana and Boris doesn't get to be clear even to the end of the movie. The acting is nice. I enjoy Depp's performance here. He gets into character well and managed to get the character's habits to be performed just as a normal habitual person does them. Having Frank Langella to anchor the final conflict in is also great in giving depths to the early conflict start and the finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never got what people liked about Johnny Depp, but I kind of liked the way he played this part. There was something very natural about his portrayal of a sort of detached rare book dealer. What a weird and intriguing concept. A bachelor in his 30s who is kind of cynical and sleazy, but who makes a living dealing with articles of high culture.Frank Langella plays evil beautifully here.The director cast his young wife in the role of a mysterious stranger and she plays it with a truly eerie, all-knowing aloofness. The one thing I didn't get is why Depp's character never freaks out about this woman's special powers. How could he spend a whole movie seeking the key to evil and not notice the supernatural strangeness of his companion? He asks her who she is a few times, and then just accepts her as some weirdo who follows him.I loved the European settings and as much as violence and satanic themes normally disturb me, I have to say that the death scenes and portrayal of evil in certain characters really stuck with me.I see that many people on the net are attempting to explain the plot and conclusion. I think the best one I read had it right. The girl is the Devil and she's in love with Depp. So she guides him to her kingdom so to speak.I would have preferred more character development, but that is my complaint about most films. How did this guy become who he is? He is ultimately seduced by the devil. How does one go from being a book dealer to wanting to summon Satan? A little more background please. We do see in the first scene that he is not ethical in his dealings.This one requires two viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 6. OK, MAYBE it deserves a 6.66.Hahaha. Get it?Bad jokes aside, there seems to be some very polarized opinions on this movie. On one side are those that love it, claiming it to be a "masterpiece," worthy of intense discussion and intellectual debate. They cite the symbolism inherent in the picture, and draw analogies between different characters and the strata of hell, or Dean Korso's representation of the 7 deadly sins, (greed, envy, lust, sloth, gluttony, pride, wrath) which I'm not so sure about.On the other side are those that hate it, citing it's anticlimactic ending, slow plot, and most of all, the fact that we never get to see a showdown with Satan, (The blonde haired, green eyed, flying demon women may or may not be the Prince of Darkness) &amp; Johnny Depp never really enters the "Shadow Kingdom" or hell.Yeah, yeah. I admit I was disappointed too that the movie ended without Johnny Depp's head exploding after receiving too much knowledge from The Nine Gates of the Shadow Kingdom a la Raiders of the Lost Ark, or that he didn't have a change of heart and turn out to be a Hero in a villain's cloak, send Satan back to the fiery gates of hell, and live happily ever after with green eyes (the storybook/Hollywood convention of love-will-conquer-the-darkness.) He simply walks up to the 17th century castle, just as the sun is setting over the parapets, bringing to life the final engraving of the book, end scene, the movie is done.In the words of Roger Ebert, what??But, I suppose what the film is really about, (I have to search for some redeeming quality to the movie, I just have to) is human nature. (Artsy, right?) What this film is saying by this very ANTICLIMACTIC ending is that man's search for the truth is so fundamental and powerful, that it overrides our pursuit of pleasure and fear of death. This is Korso's journey, and this is what unlocks "the ninth gate."If you don't believe me, think about how disappointed you were by never actually witnessing the unlocking of the ninth gate on film. Wouldn't you like to see what happens when Johnny Depp walks into that medieval castle?Yeah you do. Now the question you have to ask yourself is, how far would you go to see it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate by Roman Polanski is not a perfect film by any means but it still remains a personal favorite of mine. I can understand some of the detractors of this film. Technically it's kind of odd and goofy. The tone is quite strange. In particular the character of the Albino seems horribly cast and the movie doesn't really go for thrills or scares. And the whole runtime is pretty much about a guy studying a book for 2 hours. But it creeps up on you and gets under your skin somehow. The Ninth Gate by Roman Polanski is much more than just a film. It's on of the most fascinating and cerebral studies of Laveyan Satanism ever put on film. It's the book itself that gets under your skin more than anything once you realize that everything about Corso's journey is tied into the engravings and altered by their meaning. What is that meaning? Well that's up to the audience, but the dialogue and visuals and full of little clues that point to something revelatory upon repeat viewings. For one thing, everyone seems to serve Corso's every whim. Is he actually the Devil? Laveyan Satanism is basically the idea that Satan is inside of us all, not a living entity. Is the secret of the book that it unlocks the True Will? The power to master one's own destiny? Or was it Corso's destiny all along? This film is definitely not for everyone but I find it endlessly fascinating. Everything means something if you really look closely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polansky offers a supernatural adventure, with perfect music and excellent photography.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Co-production between Spain and France, from one of the most popular novels of Arturo Perez-Reverte, "The Club Dumas", in which Roman Polanski ("Dance of the Vampires" 1967, "The Pianist" 2002) adapted counting with the participation of actor Johnny Depp, playing a specialist in ancient books "Damien Corso". Their collaboration in the pursuit of some specimens in which Lucifer himself could have written on its pages is the challenge that will take you from the United States, Portugal, Spain and France. Hired by "Boris Balkan" (Frank Langella) a billionaire editor obsessed with occult rites and especially in regard to Satan and witchcraft, "Corso" will be involved in a spiral of persecution, murder and encounters with "femmes fatales" (from a "perfidious" Lena Olin to an "angelic" Emmanuelle Seigner).Good movie. But music is still much better and improved. Kilar is a composer of the best in the office of the incidental music. It often happens that music acquires autonomy where images lose weight. Even so, not only because of the good soundtrack, the film is interesting.It is true that this movie does not reach the quality of other Polanski films like "The Pianist" 2002, but it is certainly a good movie that has great moments. It should be noted how the director makes us feel tension. Those scenes, just not show anything, have their strength. And that's pretty hard to see and get and have merit, without very explicit decompositions or without ghosts and strange sounds make us feel terror distressing.Admittedly, the plot tells Polanski is captivating, thrilling, captures you and does not let go, it is also a dynamic led very entertaining and nothing fancy. Scenarios, the exteriors are beautiful. "The Ninth Gate" is a supernatural adventure, its music is perfect in everything, and it is evident the enormous precision and care that has been put in the movie. The special effects are minimal and effective, and excellent photography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satan gets pregnant? Interpretations of the ending abound.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting that Polanski went back to Satanism as a subject matter, dealing with it in a more sophisticated i.e. serious manner than is usually the case. TNG could easily have been a goofy, unintentionally funny movie in someone else's hands. Kudos to the little formerly-house-arrested kiddie-fiddler for tackling such an idiotic (but fun) topic with such style and competence; not a small achievement by any means. Especially given what a disappointment the vastly overrated "Rosemary's Baby" was, 3 decades earlier.Speaking of competence, or a lack thereof, the Devil couldn't have been a very competent book distributor, what with having written one that only a handful of people ended up ever seeing. Was Satan perhaps shy or insecure about his work, fearing that it would not stand up to the great commercial success of his adversary's work, the Great Book? Chances are that Satan's little opus couldn't possibly be any dumber ? or duller ? than the said collection of rants and raves that are obsessed over in various over-decorated, suspiciously financed buildings throughout the world by men of cloth paid to (mis)interpret that crap to their weekly gatherings of bored but fearful flock. Besides, it would be only fair to hear both sides of the fence, i.e. to read what the opposition has to say. TNG improves with additional viewings - not that it isn't good the first time around, far from it; it's a slick, well-acted little mystery with a good cast (apart from Lena Olin and her goalkeeper-sized hands and rugged face) that will repel the "ka-blam" action crowd, but this was never intended for morons anyway. There is far too much talk for fans of Jet Lee films, the action being quite sporadic, especially in the mostly static first half.It isn't explained why Balkan would entrust such a valuable book to one skinny man to roam around Europe with, while various angry Satanists follow him around trying to nick it off him. It would have made more sense for Balkan to send a couple of beefy guys to protect Depp and the book, or to join him on his European tour. Balkan spent his whole life trying to get hold of a copy, but then he simply sends off a middle-aged book expert across the Atlantic with it. That makes no sense at all.Baroness Kessler says her encounter with Satan was "love at first sight", but something tells me she didn't follow up on his offer to strike up a deal with him: she ended up in a wheelchair and with one arm half-gone, something that couldn't possibly have been a wish she'd express in even the silliest of Faustian contracts.The ending seems a little muddled, and there are various explanations. Depp has developed an obsession with both the book and its potential power, and ends up stepping into whatever out-of-this-world realm that exists behind the gates of the castle he enters in the final scene. And how nice it is of film-makers to finally bring up Portugal in a plot. I don't remember ever seeing a movie that takes place there. An unfairly ignored EU country, just because it sits at the ass of Western Europe.There's the theory that the adventure was a way of Satan to get another Damien evil-seed offspring born - hence Seigner and Depp having sex. That interpretation is inane, however, because if Satan wanted Seigner to get pregnant by Depp, then all he needed to do was send her to New York, to Depp's home address. I doubt he would have rejected her ? and 9 months later (as opposed to 9 gates later) voila! Satan Jr's glorious birth. There is also speculation that Polanski's Satan not only appeared disguised as a woman (Seigner), but is in actual fact "himself"/herself a female. Can anyone out there picture a pregnant Satan? Too ridiculous, even for the goofy world of demonology. This brings up too many tricky and tacky issues, such as how long Satan(a) would breast-feed her child, whether the milk would be too hot for the toddler, how Satan(a) could possibly be gentle toward another being, etc.The question remains what purpose Seigner had. She is obviously either Satan(a) himself/herself or just a kung-fu-skilled demoness sent on a mission. Was the mission's purpose to make sure Balkan fails, or was it to make sure Depp makes it to the Gate? Impossible to say. One can find logic flaws in both explanations, but inconsistency, self-contradiction and logic holes are hardly uncommon in matters related to either Christianity or Satanism. Why would Satan care about Depp's soul so much? Was it enticing to the Horned One to capture a soul that belongs to a non-believer? Do souls of atheists count for extra points in the Heaven-vs-Hell soul-collecting competition between God and Lucifer? If it's Balkan Satan was after, then why not simply wait for him to die, instead of going through this whole shebang? Surely, Satan already knew that Balkan's soul was as good as snatched; I certainly don't see how Balkan would have been allowed to enter the Pearly Gates anyway, what with his CV. And what if this whole hoopla was orchestrated by demons just so Depp could be hell-ified? Don't atheists automatically go to Hell anyway? This would make it a waste of time for the Devil to fight for Depp's soul; he's got it already.Yes, one can easily get lost in the thickets of the world of goofy and confusing religious rules and regulations. Not a smidgen of logic to be found on either side of the fence. Whatever Seigner's ultimate purpose was (aside from providing Polanski's trophy-wife with another film role), we shall never know (or perhaps it is better expressed in the novel), but it doesn't take anything away from the sheer entertainment value of the movie.For a Depp biography, google "vjetropev depp".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story about the search for a genuine copy of a rare book on the subject of raising the devil. But it's the unscrupulous people involved in the search that make it so interesting. Depp's character (Corso) seems to have no redeeming features, he'll do anything for money. But as the movie rolls on, he seems to be the one exhibiting the most morality.Frank Langella is excellent, as is Lena Olin and James Russo. The conversations and interactions between Depp and these three are superb.I'm sure you'll especially like the dialogue with Depp's character and Langella's in the private library. Russo's Bernie exhibits a sly respect for Depp's Corso when it comes to swindling people out of their rare and valuable books. The expression on Olin's face when she realizes that Depp's character understands the purpose of this rare book that she wants to recover for herself is astounding. Polanski's eye for detail is especially appreciated. The scene with the twins(played by the same actor,Jose Lopez Rodero, and flawlessly interwoven)is a classic. Lastly - Sumi Jo's voice in the soundtrack is perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Polanski's engaging devil-worship chiller is lush with a rich Gothic atmosphere and style to spare. The storyline is deceptively simple: bookseller Johnny Depp is tasked with tracking down copies of an ancient text believed to have been written by Satan himself. He soon finds himself menaced by dark and mysterious forces and discovers that nobody can be trusted. Although the film's nothing to do with the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, I found its depiction of sinister mysteries and ancient books to be extremely Lovecraftian in tone.It's a film with plenty of mystery and little solution. If you watch it waiting for a big ending, you'll be disappointed: the pleasure's in the journey rather than the denouement. Nonetheless, Polanski shoots his film just right, and employs a wonderful orchestral score which adds to the atmosphere no end.Depp's on solid form as the brash, rather unlikeable protagonist and Frank Langella delivers a powerhouse supporting turn. There's also Mrs Polanski, Emmanuelle Seigner, in the role of an ally not dissimilar to the one in Frantic. Bypass the occasional missteps ? the jarring use of wirework in one sequence is a big mistake, and there are other cheesy moments ? and instead relax and soak up the atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No 'Rosemary's baby'... but by no means to be tossed away.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie based on (half) "The club Dumas" by Arturo Perez-Reverte seems like a good idea... and it is.The ninth gate introduction cards are Roman Polanski, the man who taught America the smart approach to horror movies with "Rosemary's baby"; Johnny Depp, who is known for his wonderful performances when it comes to weird characters; and, for those who are into Spanish literature, Arturo Perez-Reverte, who is regarded as one of the best Spanish writers of our time and whose novel served as inspiration.Unfortunately for the movie, Polanski overdid the supernatural approach... leaving us with lots of questions without an answer, a couple of answers without question and an ending that doesn't seem to please anybody in the beginning. Depp delivers a convincing Corso, but something is missing from his performance that makes him look flat: this may work for the Corso portrayed in the novel, but for a supernatural script, a little bit more character would have been in order.On the bright side, I think this was masterfully directed with a pretty good cinematography, good pace and an excellent plot overall. Even the ending becomes significant once the movie is seen a couple of times. I believe the main point of the movie would be to illustrate the consequences of knowledge, and how we all have a choice when it comes to it. It is a really smart movie, when seen on that side.Despite it's flaws, it's a really good try and a movie definitely worth watching more than once.</fullReview>

Fantastic mystery shrouds this film, based on the El Club Dumas novel in which Frank Langella himself quoted to be one of his favorite stories. He is brilliant as the multi millionaire Boris Balkan. The intriguing part of all this is the wonderful and fun Direction that Polanski demonstrates with pure class. The characters are fantastic and very charming with an abundance of perks and wit that shine through with a taste of black comedy. One of my favorite films in a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so this film isn't for everyone. It is very slow moving (and deliberately so). It's pace will cast a spell on some, while infuriate others. But this is a gothic mystery, and everything happens for a reason. Polanski, the master of small details, once again wants the audience to figure things out for themselves. Allow yourself to be lulled by the pace and sucked into the mystery and the details, and you will have a devilishly good time figuring this one out. This isn't as great or as bold as some of his earlier horror films (i.e. "Rosemary's Baby"), but Polanksi can still weave a tale for those who enjoy the macabre and bizarre. This is worth a view for filmgoers those who enjoy more "classic" horror. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp leads the way in another starring role (this came out right around the same time SLEEPY HOLLOW did). He plays a rare book dealer assigned to tracking down an ancient manuscript entitled "The Nine Gates of the Shadown Kingdom" that is said to summon the Devil. Frank Langella also stars.If you are in the mood for something refreshing and interesting, see THE NINTH GATE. In order to watch this movie, you must be patient and willing to take your time watching it. The movie requires thinking. It is sometimes slow and dull, but when the film is exciting, you are on the edge of your seat. You must see this film if you are fan of films like THE OMEN or THE EXORCIST and any other of those Devil movies.This is an enthralling picture and a must see to anyone with a general interest in film. THE NINTH GATE gets 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hypnotic, engaging, original - one of Polanski's more accessible films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a lover of horror films, but I do like a good ghost/supernatural story when it's well told. And who is better at unfolding a story before your eyes than Roman Polanski?From the very first scene, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I found the whole experience hypnotic and unmissable. While I can understand other users comments about a vague ending and meandering plot, I believe every detail you need is there in the film, but you have to watch closely to reap every reward. Fortunately, the whole thing is so compelling, I had no trouble watching closely!Depp is fantastic, playing a shady, understated character with considerable skill. Similarly, Langella brings a brooding sinister air to the proceedings, even when his character is only heard over the phone! Seigner is great as the mysterious companion (I have my own theories about her true identity, but I'll leave that to the individual!), and Olin takes an excellent supporting role too. Can't fault the cast at all, even the incidental characters add colour and life to the whole thing.If you enjoyed the creepy air in The Sixth Sense, like watching a story unfold gradually, but with pace and skill (kind of like The Usual Suspects), and like to actually engage your brain while taking in a movie, then see this immediately. I honestly believe the only moviegoers that would complain about this superior supernatural thriller would be the Nightmare on Elm Street/Friday the 13th generation. This is a beautiful film with a heart and soul, and the power to draw you in absolutely.Watch it in a quiet room, nicely darkened, and instead of dismissing the ending, think about it for a while - you won't regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed watching this movie...I watched it at late night alone in the house...and my eyes were glued to the TV for the duration of the movie.The movie is about Johnny Depp, a dealer in ancient books, investigating an ancient book which is about summoning the Satan. There are only 3 copies in the world left of this book, and he is on a mission to find the authentic one.The movie is not really a horror movie thats scary, but falls in the supernatural mystery kind of category.The movie is a bit slow, and may not be the Best of all movies; but has enough to keep you tugged to the movie, and wondering what will happen next.The soundtrack by Kilar is enchanting, haunting and just great. It is particularly great for the mood in the movie.Overall the movie is: Slow, haunting, mysterious, with an air of supernatural.I recommend viewing it - will be best during silent late nights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only there was more of this type of film available in English for Americans. From the first moment of the excellent opening sequence until the last fade to white, I was completely engrossed in this wonderful, intelligent &amp; classy horror film. Then, it stayed with me and GREW. Like a great novel that you can't wait to talk about with your friends, this relatively minor piece of entertainment (what the director considers it) inspired me to figure out its open, unexplained ends. As I did so I became even more frightened than I was while watching the film. Maybe it's me, but I just love this kind of European styled filming in a classic satanic thriller.The more I thought about it, the more it reminded me of the famous Nordic folk tale Peer Gynt. Peer Gynt was about a protagonist whose weakness was greed, among other moral depravity, and he travels abroad in a sort of test of his integrity. In that tale there were trolls &amp; wizards &amp; other characters appropriate for the age, whereas in The Ninth Gate (based on Arturo Pérez Reverte's novel, El Club Dumas) there was a legend of Lucifer &amp; a particularly alluring devil's apprentice, played by the lovely Emmanuelle Seigner, Polansky's wife. But the protagonist, played by Johnny Depp, does travel to exotic places abroad and is at the mercy of his own greed.What made the movie so entertaining was Polansky's classy, European styled directing, including many location shots in Spain, Portugal &amp; France that allowed the director to flaunt this style with grace &amp; panache. His affection for Siegner, who played in his 1988 thriller Frantic with Harrison Ford &amp; played the leading part in the 1992 movie Lunes de fiel, is understandable. Her mysterious beauty is utilized wonderfully here as a pivotal character in the quixotic plot. So wonderfully that, at least to this reviewer, she steals the show.My only criticism of this film is for Mr. Depp, and it is only a minor criticism. It's that certain of his lines lacked emotional strength. The director stated in an interview that he was thoroughly impressed with Depp's ability to make the most of every line. I'm afraid I disagree. True, it was in character to remain apathetic and hardened to the others surrounding Corso. But it seems that his character could have been more hard-boiled, something that Depp's rounded face is not easily capable of achieving. And when frightened, there was also a lack of emotion. He didn't seem REALLY frightened. A few angled close-ups might have engaged the distressed scenes a bit more, but this would have been a departure from the director's unaffected style. That kind of thing is Hitchcockian, not Polanskian. That is, Hitchcock used it more often, whereas Polanski saves, saves &amp; saves until the end for the stylishly angled close-ups, if then. Hitchcock's was a bold directing style; Polanski's is a reserved directing style. The combination of this and Depp's round, pretty face makes for a reservedness that borders on the dispassionate, at least for this character study.In the end, however, the story itself offers enough of an intelligent and adventurous mystery to overcome the above weakness. And Polanski's quiet scenes of detailed, yet natural &amp; almost impoverished beauty - the kind that makes a European scene so delicious - works perfectly with the macabre story line. There were cliches, to be sure. This kind of thing is to be expected from such a film. And the director admitted that the movie was not meant to be serious, but instead merely entertainment fun. That it certainly was, and then some. I give it a 10, but with a reserve for the fact that it makes me wish there were more 70s style movie directors still around to compete with him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see a lot of negative reviews, coming mostly from the people who watched the movie once, most likely not following the plot with care and then failed to figure out the last 10 minutes of it. If you watch this movie carefully and turn your brain cells on, instead of waiting for the movie to chew and digest itself for you, you will understand everything. Who is the girl? You can get a pretty good idea. Why did it not work for Boris Balkan and how did he not feel the fire for the first several moments? Even if it was not explained (and it was) it would be obvious. What happened to Johnny Depp's character in the end? Again as plain as a day. You cannot expect of every Polanski's occult movie to have everything laid out in front of you. Sometimes, the charm of a movie is in its ability to leave something to speculations. This is one of those movies. Turn on your attention, observe every scene, ask yourself what is the meaning behind it, and you shall enjoy this movie a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, well almost!!! What can be a better plot of a slow (i argue with its slowness) psychological thriller on a mystic demonic trail in half deserted , cobbled streets of Europe. And how can we forget Johnny Depp's acting ability accompanied by necessary support by rest of the crew. I am not European but i love Europe and live in there. If you are a lover of history shrouded with mystery, middle ages , Gothic mansions, stoned roads , slow paced life then you will taste the background set of this movie to the fullest. In the beginning I said it is almost a perfect movie, the doubt is in its ending. I thought it could be better if we could know the identity of Emmanuelle Seigner as the mystery girl, is she the devil herself or a keeper of the ninth gate or the book, why did she help Johnny Depp? There are many questions and audience would be left in imagination. Also at some places I thought director could have created the tension a bit more like in the palace of St-Martin where Depp and the mystery girl broke in and were caught and the events that followed. Well perhaps then he needed to deviate from the actual book but that should have been done. Anyways still if you like thriller you gonna like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greatly enjoyed this very mysterious film dealing with people trying to secure very rare books dealing with the supernatural and a desire to secure the powers of the devil. Johnny Depp, (Dean Corso) and Frank Langella, (Boris Balkan) are the two men trying to obtain these books in order to find the Secrets of the Ninth Gate. Boris Balkan wears very thick eyeglasses and you can hardly recognize him and he also likes to stand in a circle of fire and laugh his head off. There is a mysterious Girl who makes quite a few appearances in this film played by Emmanuelle Seigner,(The Girl) who is the real wife of Roman Polanski. As this film progresses, you will begin to learn just who this girl is, especially when you see her sexy burning Green Eyes glaring into your eyes and she does a very good job of seducing Dean Corso. This is truly a great film and Roman Polanski made this film into a Classic for all generation to view and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can people not like this film? I am amazed that this is considered one of Polanski's worst efforts and does not get the recognition it deserves.One of the great things about this film is it changes with every viewing. Every time you watch it, you discover something new, some rare subtlety hidden that proves my case that Polanski is a genius in film making.For example, when Corso is in the lecture room, the very first time we see the Girl, concurrently we have Balkan talking about 'Our perceptions of evil.' Another thing I loved was this film keeps you guessing until the end. There are so many twists and turns, that we because just as intrigued and desperate as Corso to find out the mystery of the Ninth Gate. How many of you were able to guess the ending? I certainly wasn't, but after a second and third viewing you are able to see all the clues Polanski lays out.The casting was brilliant, Johnny Depp did a fantastic job portraying a hero who, to be honest, isn't a very nice guy, but the audience find themselves empathising with him as the film moves on.I advise you to go see this film.

Well, the plot revelations are exactly what they seem on the surface and the ending, as many have commented, is a big letdown. I had to listen to Polanski's commentary on the DVD to get a better handle on it because the narrative simply hadn't prepared one for the volte-face that Depp's character undergoes in the final shot of the movie. And since the Devil's messenger hands him all the clues on a plate anyway he doesn't even discover the secret of the book himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls short of potential in intriguing premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: This review discusses "surprise" ending of the film!) The Ninth Gate is a film with an intriguing premise that unfortunately promises more than it can deliver. Although Depp may be commended for a solid job playing the oily, yet obsessively scholarly bibliophile Corso, caught up between rival satanic factions in the quest to solve the rebus-like mystery of the "The Nine Gates," the film signals us very early to the mechanism by which the riddle may be solved, without ever bothering to convincingly "unpack" this solution. Although much is to be said for a suggestive, open-ending , Polansky makes the mistake of centering his plot around the "meaning" of a set of occult engravings that are never allowed to take on any greater significance for the viewer than that of a mere plot engine (i.e. the "get the girl" of Chinatown has become "get the engravings"). Thus, although Corso's guardian "angel" (the compellingly enigmatic Emmanuelle Seigner) reveals to us in the aftermath of the attempt to conjure the Prince of Darkness that the scheme has failed because one of the engravings was a forgery, even the final "revelatory" glimpse at the genuine engraving is not sufficient to clear the muddied waters of the occult undercurrents supposedly motivating this film. Perhaps the Perez-Reverte novel contains the insights so noticeably lacking in the film. On its own, however, The Ninth Gate suggests a fuzzy filmic hybrid of Rosmarie's Baby and Foucault's Pendulum, which never achieves the unsettling horror of the former because it is lacking in the "systematic" motivation of the latter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing, but unsatisfying "Sorcerer's Apprentice" tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently Polanski is not acquainted with American 20th century stories of "those who seek knowledge beyond Human ken". You know, the pulp musings of Merrit, Lovecraft, Ashton Smith, et al (for that matter, most of American filmmakers can't seem to grasp it either). Or perhaps he chooses to ignore it. Such is our loss. I always enjoy stories about hidden mysteries and covert histories, but his effort here just doesn't present enough eerie juxtaposition between the mundane elements of modern life and the supposedly preternatural parallelism of the supernatural stream of forces hidden just below our grasp. Polanski's satanism is like a dull bureaucracy made up of silly regulations - take nine engravings and call me in the morning. "Rosemary's Baby" showed a little more quirkiness, but still gets bogged down in ritual... I guess it's all those centuries of feudalism in Europe. There is no awe and wonder in this movie - certainly not from Johnny Depp. He's done better elsewhere.Contrast this movie with something like "The Resurrected" and you will see what I mean - and not just for the bizarre shocks, of course they are there to pull in the "correct" audience of jaded young video gamers, but are limited and dispersed for story effect also. It's the same story of ordinary humans confronting a traditional and historical "evil" in the modern world with a considerably more cohesive effect.</fullReview>

Director Roman Polanski (The Pianist, Chinatown) certainly know how to make a film that exists on so many layers. The search that happens throughout the movie is a waste of time as the prize is there all the time for those who can see. Now, I don't believe in Lucifer, but the fact that he/she was there every moment in the movie is a good metaphor for the fact that he is ever present in our lives. Of course, if you look for the he, you will not see the she.Emmanuelle Seigner (Frantic) was brilliant as Lucifer - there I told you, so now you can watch more closely.Johnny Dep and Frank Langella (Dracula, Superman Returns, Dave) were also first rate in their performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well directed but uninspiring satanic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess the fact that Roman Polanski cemented his directorial reputation way back in 1968 with the satanic classic `Rosemary's Baby' has earned him a certain carte blanche to drone on and on about the same subject 32 years later. At 133 minutes, `The Ninth Gate' goes well beyond the time limit usually accorded films of this type ? and it suffers greatly as a result. Still, it is actually the Polanski imprimatur that turns out to be the best reason for watching `The Ninth Gate.' In terms of direction, cinematography and music, this film displays more subtlety, elegance and panache than most modern films dealing with the topic of devil worship. Yet, no amount of cinematic expertise can quite hide the silliness lurking at the film's core.The problem is that the plotting is pretty standard-issue stuff for films of this genre. Johnny Depp stars as Dean Corso, a less-than-scrupulous dealer in rare books, who finds himself enmeshed in the dark world of occultism when a wealthy patron sends him off to investigate the authenticity of a rare book he has purchased ? a book rumored to be able to bring Satan himself to tangible form. As Corso travels from New York City to various parts of Europe, he encounters all the mysterious stalking strangers, cryptic conversations and sudden deaths of important personages that are customary in narratives of this sort. For all the elegance of the film's style ? the beauty of the camerawork, the subtlety of the pacing ? the film is never able to generate much energy, suspense or passion. And the few times that Polanski attempts to mount a simple action sequence, the results are so ludicrous that the audience is more inclined to burst out into a chorus of giggles than a refrain of gasps.The acting is uneven as well. As Corso, Depp does no more than a serviceable job, rarely registering an emotion beyond the surface level. As the mysterious girl-with-no-name - who seems to have the power to fly through the air Crouching Tiger-style when landing a well placed martial arts blow ? Emmanuelle Seigner is both insipid and irritating when she is meant to be enigmatic and exotic. However, Lena Olin is effectively vampish and seductive as the wife of an earlier owner of the book who has committed suicide (although she is occasionally called upon to act out some pretty ludicrous moments) and Barbara Jefford brings a quiet, unnerving dignity to her role as the aging owner of a similar tome. The normally impressive Frank Langella is not accorded enough screen time to give him much opportunity to make a very impressive mark on the film. He, also, I'm afraid, ends up looking pretty foolish in his big moment at the end.Much of `The Ninth Gate,' in fact, ends up looking pretty foolish. `Rosemary's Baby' worked so beautifully because great pain was taken to make every action, event and moment, despite the inane absurdity of the premise, seem thoroughly realistic and believable. We really could identify with the plight of poor na?ve innocent Rosemary as she became more and more enmeshed in the satanic doings going on secretly around her. It is this sense of credibility and empathy that `The Ninth Gate,' with all its globetrotting diffusiveness and adherence to satanic movie clichés, fails to deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why does Mr. Polanski ruin this film??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 30 minutes of this film is great. But as we have seen from Hollywood in many movies. They are lousy at endings. And the same goes for this movie. This is crap. When I think about it, I'm not even sure Polanski has directed the whole movie. It's doesn't seem like it. I just don't understand why he couldn't see that the ending was terrible. Johnny Depp is quite good, but I can understand why he refuse to comment on this film. He said "Let's put it this way. I'm not satisfied with the film" That says it all.3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp gives a joyless, enervated performance as an American dealer in rare books who accepts a job from collector Frank Langella to compare his 17th-century book, "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows," adapted from the writings of Lucifer, to the two known remaining copies, one in Spain and the other in France, only one of which is thought to be authentic; soon, Depp feels he's being followed and, indeed, an enigmatic blonde begins popping up along his journey. Rather dreary thriller from producer-director Roman Polanski, who also co-adapted the screenplay with John Brownjohn from Arturo Pérez-Reverte's novel "The Club Dumas," tries for a low-key menace in the style of Val Lewton, perhaps, or Jacques Tourneur. Unfortunately, the plot consists mainly of exhausting leg-work, and Depp is all wrong for the lead--instead of a modern-day Dana Andrews, we're stuck with this callow kid with gray streaks at his temples. The supporting cast (an amusingly sinister Langella, in particular) is far more interesting than the star; Depp seems indifferent to the material, barely reacting after discovering a friend hanging upside down in his book store. The production is handsome, and the elemental occult trappings are occasionally absorbing, but it goes over-the-top near the finale and then sputters to a head-scratching close. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gothic and gloomy film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of Dean Corso, an expert on trade of rare books, which engages in a macabre story while trying to ascertain the authenticity of a rare book for a wealthy client. Directed by Roman Polanski, which also provides the script with John Brownjohn and Enrique Urbizu, this movie is starring Johnny Depp, Frank Langella and Lena Olin.This is one of the least known films of Depp's career, an actor who is fashionable and has many admirers. Perhaps the reason why this happens is the uncomfortable atmosphere of mystery surrounding the movie until, finally, "swallows" the main actor. The story is deeply mysterious: a book written by the Devil, pictures that can be used to invoke it, and a search across Europe, where every step you can find a strange place. Indeed, it was not by chance that Polanski chose Sintra as one of the scenarios for the story. The small Portuguese village is famous for the mysterious and enigmatic environment, as well as the legends it has. The choice of an ancient Cathar castle for the grand finale is also not devoid of sense, for all those who have studied history and know what were the Cathars.But the film is not only based on demonic mysteries, rare books and enigmatic places. The actors greatly contributed to the quality of the final work, with Depp to give evidence of tremendous versatility and talent, and Langella wisely using his grim appearance and incredibly dense voice to build a very calm character, but extremely scary and dark. Lena Olin is excellent, and although its no longer a young girl, she managed to build a great and sexually powerful character. But one of the strangest and most controversial characters is played by Emmanuelle Seigner, the wife of Roman Polanski. Its an attractive girl whose name is never revealed, but it will follow throughout the film, never showing clearly what it is, or who she is, despite giving various clues and proofs of supernatural powers and to know more about the events than it really wants to reveal. Guess who she is...The sets and shooting locations were chosen carefully, to give the film a dark and Gothic look. The photograph, something misty and dark, will also give their contribution to this environment, as well as the soundtrack, which is a great quality. It's a movie to see and review, although only people with some insight will be able to understand the film in its entirety.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is superbly made puzzle and most people won't "get it" because they are hung up about the idea of the Devil (and their own preconceptions of the Devil).The movie is dualistic in it's character development, telling a story of two paths (Balkan and Corso's) and how vastly different they are when they converge at the end of the story. Balkan is still driven by passion and obsession, whereas Corso learns that knowledge can have greater value than money. The difference is obvious and yet most people don't seem to notice it. Balkan starts out as a high handed, sanctimonious Satanist yet becomes more pathological (and out of control) in his desire to summon The Devil, Corso becomes more thoughtful and genuinely interested in the puzzle of the engravings that speak to achieving a higher plane of consciousness.There is symbolism through the movie that takes the viewer on a journey with Corso (the Tarot's Fool). There is plenty of esoteric analysis available on the Internet if you google the terms "Tarot" and "Ninth Gate" and "engravings." If you aren't already somewhat familiar with occultism, it's probably going to go over your head. Googling "Cathars" is also helpful.I think if I were to give an overall summary of what this movie is trying to say, is that freedom and personal power don't come from self-delusion or worshiping Satan. The Ninth Gate portrays Satanism as a personal and intellectual failure on the part of so-called spiritual rebels that can't see past their own impulses and ego. The lesson of the movie is that enlightenment comes from within and a willingness to let go of attachments to the physical world. The Ninth Gate is almost like Buddhism in this respect.</fullReview>

Polanski had the opportunity to create a seat squirmer had he drawn the audience closer to the dark side, but we see little Evidence of a malevolent presence other than fleeting references To Medieval characterizations clumsily portrayed in the books. Langella is a good actor who unfortunately takes on a role that renders him laughable in the final Scene. No character has a true connection to the demonic, which audiences Crave in a script such as this, but can only resort to overacting to try to Create this effect. Sadly, it misses terribly and we are left only to wonder why Such a strong cast of actors signed on to be in this bland venture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out, the only thing I could really remember was that the ending was a little daft, re-watching it, I can see why. The movie entertainingly drops you into a world of antique books and satanism, our hero (Johnny Depp) gets entangled deeper and deeper into what seems like an 'Eyes Wide Shut' lite plot. I can't really tell if Depp is awesome or terrible, he plays the same type of character in every movie, he's watchable, but he comes off as a bit of a lightweight in the acting stakes when you see him in the scenes with Frank Langella, it's almost as if he's trying to hide the fact that he can't act by lighting cigarettes and overdoing the quirks. Langella is convincing as the baddie, even his voice on the phone is menacing. Polanski's wife makes an appearance as 'the girl', she randomly appears at various points to help Johnny, it's pretty obvious who she is meant to be. Polanski keeps the action moving, you don't even notice the long running time, actually, I don't think I've ever seen a bad Polanski movie. So overall, a good movie, just don't expect a resolution at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst being somewhat old fashioned, even in 1999 when it was made , this movie is very watchable and Polanski proves he still has a little of the old magic left in him. It aches of the substance we miss so much in modern cinema:- Story along with intrigue and characters we love to hate. We all know what's going to happen in 'The Maltese Falcon' but we are still compelled as the story unfolds each time we watch it. The Ninth Gate has this quality in abundance. Some of the rolls aren't particularly well acted , Polanski's (Director) wife for instance but she is none the less absorbing. In the end ,like all, this film will come down to a matter of taste as to whether you like it or not. It will be too light hearted for some and the humor will be lost on others but if you like this film you'll probably love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic - and an explanation of 'The Girl'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie about every year for the past ten years. It never gets old, and I never get tired of the plot. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a psychological thriller. It is not supposed to be a horror flick or action movie. It is a film that demands audience engagement. In fact, I finally read the book The Ninth Gate was based on, entitled The Club Dumas. I have gained a new appreciation for the creative artistry Polanski brought to this story. Johnny Depp plays a role perfectly suited for his looks and personality. All the co-starts and supporting case were expertly chosen. Ignore the complaints, and watch the film. If you are a book lover or collector like myself, this is the ultimate thriller for you.SPOILERS BELOW So, with a little research, I discovered the inspiration of "The Girl" character. In 1772, occultist Jacques Cazotte published a novel called The Devil in Love. Wikipedia states the plot: Alvaro, an arrogant young man invokes Satan. Upon seeing the young Alvaro, Satan falls in love with him, and assumes the appearance of a young woman and follows him as his page. In the journey that unfolds, Satan disguised as a woman tries to seduce Alvaro, who rejects his advances lest of losing his precious virginity.Cazotte was mentioned in The Club Dumas. This author was deeply involved in French mysticism circles during the time of the French Revolution and was beheaded for his "mystical monarchist" beliefs. Cazotte's fictional story, of Satan assuming the form of a woman and serving as an assistant to the protagonist, is adapted for The Club Dumas/The Night Gate. It is a clever allusion to Cazotte's The Devil in Love. Hope this helps to clear things up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as I thought but still needs work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the worst offering by Polanksi, but there are unanswered questions that I'll attempt to answer in this review. Please understand mine is but one of many interpretations on "The Ninth Gate".So, let's get the first mystery out of the way: Why did Andrew Telfer hang himself? Polanski doesn't feel the need to reveal the "why" behind Telfer's suicide. However, he does provide a not-so-obvious clue by using the character of Baroness Kessler to state, "If he (Telfer) ever finds out what his wife gets up to in these gatherings, he'll probably kill himself." This quote needs an explanation to make more sense: Andrew Telfer's wife, Liana Telfer, is the leader of a secret witches' coven known as "The Order of the Silver Serpent". This coven was formed back in the 1600s and its purpose was to read from the book and worship the Prince of Darkness. But in the present, "they've degenerated into a social club for bored millionaires and celebrities who use its meetings as an excuse to indulge their jaded sexual appetites." On top of that, there's also the "possibility" Andrew Telfer found out that his wife only married him for his money, so she could buy a copy of "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows" and have her family's château restored for Satanic meetings. In the end, I feel the truth was too much for Andrew to deal with.Corso visits an antiquarian bookshop owned by the Ceniza Brothers. The Ceniza's are two old guys who happen to be twins. Just as a side note, in mythologies from various cultures twins are seen as a sign that something bad is going to happen in the future. Anyway, the twins tell Corso that only six of the nine engravings were signed by Torchia, the other three by Lucifer. They then go on to interpret an engraving for Corso. This engraving clearly shows one of the twins as an angelic archer holding a bow and arrow ready to shoot. One of the twins explains its meaning and says, "Venture too far and danger will descend on you from above." Notice how the twins live up to their myth by indirectly warning Corso of the dangers that lie ahead if he continues on his journey.In my opinion, Polanski is using the twins as cherubs who've been sent by God as messengers to warn Corso that he's reached a fork in the road, so to speak. He can go left and choose the path of Satan or go right and stay on the path of the righteous. By the way, in the Western occult tradition, the left-hand path is the path followed by Satanists and those who believe in Black magic. Obviously, Corso didn't get the message, which reminds me of Milton's "Paradise Lost" where Satan says, "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven".The biggest mystery of all is, who is that blond woman? As far as I can tell and based on what I've seen and what I read in the screenplay, she's the Devil. Yes, that woman is Satan himself. And what's up with all the flying and martial arts, you might ask? Well, I think Polanksi needed a way to make Lucifer's presence on Earth not so obvious to Corso. Let's face it, having the blond woman wave her hand to kill a person would reveal too much. So, making her a into a decent martial artist allowed Polanski to get around this problem. What about the flying scenes? Polanski stated in an interview that he wanted the Corso character to question his sanity. Did he see the blond fly down from the ledge or did he imagine it? This is where Polanski tries to be clever by using these cheap tricks. I guess you will have to decide.Another clue to the identity of the blond woman is found in the screenplay. Corso bumps into the blond at the hotel lounge. This is their conversation:"THE GIRL: Are you on a business trip? (indicates his shoulder bag) Is that why you always carry that thing around?CORSO doesn't answer, adjusts his glasses. inquiringly at her book.THE GIRL hands it to him. We see the title: 'The Devil in Love' by Jacques Cazotte.CORSO: Been traveling long?THE GIRL: Ages."Here we have the clue of the title of the book which identifies the blond and her amorous intentions for Corso. Also, the fact that she's been traveling for "Ages" pretty much leaves you with one conclusion. If that's not enough, here's another quote by The Girl, "I'm a bit of a devil myself..." I rest my case.As I mentioned above, the Devil has the hots for Corso so we know why she's helping him and leading him down that wicked road to sin. Before I continue, Angels like Satan are pure spirit with no gender and usually take on the form of a human male when visiting Earth. But in this instance, Satan took on the form of a human female. So, for those who think this is some kind of "homosexuality" by proxy, you're wrong.To continue, there's more to their relationship when you think about it from a scriptural point of view. Satan had a chance to destroy Job, God's servant, but he failed miserably in the end. Perhaps Corso is his second chance to get back at God. To laugh in his face once again.What about the scene where the blonde marks Corso's forehead and nose with her own blood? I think that's her way of literally "marking" her man. As if she's saying, "You belong to me and no other woman." If you notice the marking, it looks very similar to a trident, or in this case, the Devil's Pitchfork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not as relentlessly creepy as say, Rosemary's Baby (1968), but it definitely has a creep factor. It is part Film Noir and part Supernatural and it is the Noir parts that work the best but when you have a story about the Devil Himself, or rather his influence on certain gullible types, this makes for a semi-scary fall down the path or persuasion, either real or imagined. It is a brooding Movie with an occasional witty line that makes you smile but most of the time our "Hero" is looking frighteningly over his shoulder through the haze of cigarette smoke and smoky colored liquor. He is befriended and beguiled by a sensuously frumpy seductress (taking on the style of her target) that is at first an enigma but as time goes on and bodies pile up it becomes clear that she is more than meets the (green glowing) eye.The Movie is fun and frightening and is sombre and scary, well acted and looks ominous. This is light weight Polanski and that is better than most, and can be enjoyed as a Mystery delving into eclectic circles and bizarre Cults. You know you're in for some tantalizing teasing, if you look quick and close, at the beginning when the earthly antagonist punches numbers on an elevator keypad accessing his private floor. One guess what the three numbers are. Most Director's would have shown that in close-up, but we are not dealing with most Directors here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I also thought this movie was rather boring when I first saw it. I don't really understand the confusion about who the woman is, doesn't the sex scene make it more than obvious? For those who claim she might just be a servant, that may be the case but I don't really think so because of the details...such as when they are driving to the villa to get the book back from Lena Olin's character and she pretends to be an Arab man with headress ....Satan was another term for "sultan", in case no one knew that. Also, the fact her hair is blonde ...and Lucifer is the bringer of light. And then the demonic eyes, esp in the sex scene with Corso. Clearly Satan controls who gets into the kingdom, why would he/she want competition? Or perhaps evil is not what most think it to be (a major theme of the movie....as Balkan states , he is trying to gain "absolute power to determine his destiny" which is not something most would traditionally think of as the definition of evil. THen again, perhaps most don't understand its true nature. However, this could also be thought of as Balkan's delusion: that anyone can achieve power over their destiny. Perhaps it is this illusion that makes him fail, and why Satan personally controls whomever gets entrance into his /her kingdom or not.If Balkan really thought that Satan would allow equality with herself, or that getting into "hell" would give him equality with God, that also was another illusion. There are many ways to think about this film. I do think the ending could have been a bit less obvious for my taste, but I think there is still plenty to think about (what is hell, what is the nature of evil, what is Corso really gainig entrance to etc)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate was not a movie that fared particularly well either commercially or critically, in spite of a high-profile star and a producer-director who has successfully straddled both art-house and popular filmdom for decades. It does admittedly begin with some rather awkward premises. First of, all it wants us to believe that second-hand booksellers are a bunch of amoral double-dealers generally lacking any sense of human decency (and for all I know they may well be). It then goes on to try and convince us that that nice young man Johnny Depp is just such a bastard. It's a shock, I know, but give the movie some time. There's intriguing stuff afoot here.Roman Polanski co-wrote as well as directed this thing, and he has constructed a tight if rather bizarre little thriller. As opposed to the relentless pacing typical to the genre, Polanski employs a slow, creeping style, with lots of long takes and a moody, wandering camera. The opening shot is oddly brilliant, taking us from a cityscape in through a window (like the first shot of Psycho, but facing outwards), so that the view recedes to a vanishing point. The eerie quietness of the picture's design makes for some effective shocks. When Depp is at the old man's house, he's reading quietly, makes a discovery, and then the phone rings. The phone call has no bearing on the plot, but it's timed right to make the audience jump. Polanski populates the picture with the different and the unexpected ? a bodyguard with bleach-blond hair, a Sikh taxi driver, a set of identical twins (part of a symbolic theme of doubles and copies). Throughout the movie little things are creeping into the frame, not intrusively but enough to sneak them into our consciousness. Some are clues, others are red herrings, such as the attention drawn to the secretary's oranges.As for Mr Depp, he's cast against type, and reacts by underplaying the role. He's a performer who shines brightest when at his most flamboyant, and though by no means bad, he is simply not very exciting here. Meanwhile Emmanuelle Seigner acts about as well as bread pudding, although being she does at least look right for the part (sexy yet evil). Frank Langella is the only player to really stand out ? you can truly believe in him as a fusty old book collector who's gone to the dark side.Other than the wonky acting, there are a handful of things to dislike about The Ninth Gate. The occasional attempts at action seem poorly staged and out of place. A particular blunder was the idea of those slow-motion jumps that Seigner does, which remove a lot of the ambiguity around her character. But in spite of these flaws the movie is good enough at being a thriller that it manages to hold our interest for its two hour runtime, which in all fairness is more than many technically less-flawed movies can boast.</fullReview>

Was also unsure of Emmanuelle Seigner's role as the unnamed girl. What was she at the end, a guardian or sorts for Depp's character or some evil force that was complicit in the various killings?

		<fullReview>If you needed an actor to play a somewhat strange and peculiar role, who would you choose? Roman Polanski, the controversial former husband of actress Sharon Tate and still wanted for his dalliance with a 13 year old girl, was certainly the right man to direct this dark film, filled with the realities of human frailty. Depp was the ideal actor, his ability to interact with others, yet stand apart from them is a crucial element of the film. As with all Polanski films, this one is filled with villains with nuances of evil, from the jaded, wealthy Lena Olin to the pontificating and self-righteous Barbara Jefford. Emmanuelle Siegner, Polanski's wife, provides our supernatural character, but on whose side is she? The plot weaves intricately from step to step and the reality of the book is only revealed in the end. Rated R for nudity, language and violence, this film is definitely a late night indulgence for the grown ups.</fullReview>

He is hired by a rich book collector, played by Frank Langella, to research and authenticate his rare book that is said to have been written by the devil himself. Only 3 copies are known to exist. With one of the copies in his hands, he travels overseas to Europe to research the other two books and to verify they are the same. However, Depp runs into a dead end when he finds that books are exactly the same with one exception that he nearly misses. He becomes involved in an international religious cult that seems to be stalking him at every move. An overall decent film helmed by master director Roman Polanski.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique images in this Gothic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly fine piece of work with great actors, a highly addicting story with a couple of surprises, a really great soundtrack, a great light work and a more than solid camera work. Some images are really impressive in this movie and will stay on your mind for a while. I don't want to reveal too much but the movie includes a creepy murder scenery in France and a very unique sex scene for example. Even the locations and the different languages spoken in the movie are exotic and add a very special touch that should please to those who are interested in foreign history and culture.Even though there are some lengths in the beginning of the movie and even though the book still beats this adaption, this Gothic and occult thriller is a must see for any cinematic maniac when director legend Roman Polanski and one of the most brilliant actors of all times with Johnny Depp work together. The movie gets more and more intense, atmospheric and dynamical with every minute and has some good ideas even though I thought the devilish ending was a little bit too predictable after all but it leaves you on a rather mysterious and uneasy note instead of having a mainstream conclusion. The book and the movie are definitely extraordinary despite a few little and definitely pardonable flaws.Anybody who likes to have a dark ride should get in and watch this gripping and unforgettable flick. I enjoyed watching this movie several times and it never gets boring as you can always discover and focus on some new elements of this artistically diversified work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a masterpiece, but still wonderfully macabre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Ninth Gate" is one of those clever, thought-out, dark thrillers that always seem to go under the radar at first. At the box office it was a total flop, but over the years the appreciation seems to have grown exponentially. It's still not a mainstream type of thing by any means, but it does have somewhat of a cult status now. A thriller about a guy (even if the guy is Johnny Depp) who traces books for a living is a hard sell, maybe that's why people seemed hesitant to acknowledge it's existence. It's totally worth it though. I'm not saying "The Ninth Gate" is a perfect film, but it's atmosphere can't be beat. The fantastic soundtrack, the beautiful locations (particularly when on fire), the quirky local characters: the movie has so many impressive stylish touches you can forgive the occasional contrived scene. The plot is just your average running from here to there and back and you also get some weird coincidences that tie everything together, but like I said that's not really the point of the movie anyway. Just lose yourself in the occult style and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ninth Gate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine Johnny Depp movie ( I could speak only about him, because he's my all- time favorite actor. There's only one more movie by Polanski I have watched and that's "The Pianist", so I'm not much of a judge. I always say there aren't enough occult movies - and certainly those who are made aren't no good. "The Ninth Gate" was, surprisingly, very enjoyable and thrilling. It also was shot in Paris ( something that could please me any time. )What I didn't like in the movie was it's predictability and it's lack of originality. The characters ( with the little exception of Johnny Depp's and the girl who helps him ) was absolutely annoying and incomplete.However, as I said, it was thrilling and enjoyable and it's worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great underrated intelligent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with a previous reviewer, I also have seen this film many times and as before, get something out of it upon each successive viewing. Love Depp and the lead woman. Beautiful. I love old books and this flick is right up my alley as a top twenty keeper. I was chagrined to see everyone smoking and drinking over the supposed priceless tomes. There must have been a reason for it and I feel a bit dim for not knowing why Polanski would have the book restorer in Spain drop ashes on the cover and then... rub it into the leather! Anyway that is irrelevant. Love Depp's reaction to LCF. Love the general subject and the atmospheric locales used, as I have worked in a few large estates such as depicted as well as having been involved in the book industry and the restoration of vintage books. Langella does a great job as do all others in the cast. I feel somewhat sorry for the numerous critics who panned the film upon release. It is an underrated intelligent film and should be on the must see list of every thinking adult.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah the Devil. What could be a more juicy subject matter to move one through a film? Like the sinking overtones of its very ominous score and title sequence the viewer is pulled through each perfect frame by this future attractor until the ultimate fade to white. And that is really the scary thing about this film, its perfectly realized vision of beauty. The plot is a loose extract from Arturo Perez Revertes 'The Club Dumas'. The book deals with an altogether more complex tale that if transfered as a direct carbon copy to the screen, would have been bloated and far too complex to sandwich into any kind of workable narrative/runtime. The tale here instead focuses on just the one book and is much better for it. I give this a score of eleven. Just as Lucifer made his perch over god, and with all great works of art, this one went over the critics heads. In time however I feel this will stand as Polanskis finest film, and certainly among the greatest of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You need to watch THE NINTH GATE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A leap taken back over a decade to 1999, before Johnny Depp became world renowned as one of the pirate lords and before the horrors of world war was shown through epic productions as THE PIANIST, there came Roman Polanskis' THE NINTH GATE. Both mentioned movies are works of the same director; it's just that the latter was done 3 years prior. If one did take the time to watch I would believe there is a clear distinction in the improvement of direction and also choice of script as a director. Of course one may say that the director is hired by the producers, however the director does have freedom of choice. As clear as day Roman Polanski went from a good movie to a great one. I watched the good one!THE NINTH GATE is a movie engrossed in good choices. I reckon long hours of brain storming did go through at the higher ranks on the more intimate details of costuming, musical score and cast. Polanski has a method to his madness. Countless number of baby steps or else if I may say stepping stones. The introductory credits and the musical score set the ambiance and prepare you for something mysterious. I have to say it was not eerie but mystical. This mystical score continues quite well and rolls smoothly until it overflows at the end credits. The next wise creative decision would be the detailed books. They did for sure look like something that was dragged right out of an old vicarage. The base tones with the books were set in that instance. However I need to disagree with the high take library vault Balkan (Frank Langella) had made for himself. It somewhat compromised the authenticity of an antique book collector. Lastly Johnny Depps' costuming was simple and invigorating in terms of a book detective. With the long trench coat he was just as a normal detective with the only difference of specializing on books. Had he worn anything else, it would convince less.Apart from the obvious success story in the acting, which I will deliberately leave out, the fanciest selling point, the icing on top of the cake and the final cherry on top was the directorial approach. The movie although a thriller does not flow as fast as you would want it to. It's stretched; it's not dragged, it's stretched. When the actors tone down and stretch the suspense it keeps the viewer guessing. Is the puzzle in place or not? Do not misunderstand me there is flow; however the focus is not on the plot, but on all that leads to the event, instead of a long battle scene, we have long scenes of the soldiers getting into place and like a ten second battle. Does this make it clear to you? If in doubt, you need to watch THE NINTH GATE.Dean Corso a book detective is hired by a wealthy book collector by the name of Boris Balkan. Balkan pays Corse a large sum of money to take trip and research a very valued and ancient book which has a demonic foundation. There are only 3 books known to man ever to be published and Balkan has one in his possession. All he needs to know is if his book and the others that are found in Europe are the same or if there are any discrepancies that would compromise the authenticity of his copy. A book with such great value will obviously have a high demand. I mean come to think of it there are only 3 books in the whole world, and how many antique book collectors does the world have? Corso takes up the job and accepts his payment and hands the book over to his close friend Bernie for safe keeping until he returns to collect it on his way to the airport. Corso packs up and returns to find Bernie DEAD!Title: The Ninth Gate Directed by : Roman Polanski Starring: Johnny Depp, Frank Langella, Lena Olin and Emmanuella Seigner Rated: R for some violence and sexuality Rating: 07/10 133 Minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occult Neo-Noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the year 2000 represented nothing more than the 1,999th anniversary of the year in which a sixth-century monk mistakenly believed Christ had been born, the approach of the end of the second millennium was greeted with dire predictions of the end of the world and an upsurge of interest in the occult. Even the panic over the supposed "millennium bug" can be seen as a millenarian prophecy wearing a secular disguise. It is therefore perhaps appropriate that 1999 was the year which saw Roman Polanski's supernatural thriller "The Ninth Gate"; it was by no means the only film with a demonic theme to appear in this particular year.Dean Corso, a New York rare-book dealer, is hired by Boris Balkan, a wealthy book collector, to authenticate a book he has recently bought, "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows", a volume of occult lore written by a seventeenth-century Italian author named Aristide Torchia. Torchia was burned at the stake by the Inquisition and surviving copies of his book are extremely rare, although two other copies are known to exist. Legend has it that Lucifer himself acted as Torchia's co-writer and that possession of a genuine copy of the book will enable the owner to conjure up the devil.Balkan has recently acquired his copy of "The Nine Gates" from another book collector named Andrew Telfer, who committed suicide soon afterwards. Telfer's widow, Liana, wants the book back, claiming it was her property and not her husband's to sell. Corso travels first to Portugal and then to Paris to examine the other two surviving copies, but realises that by accepting Balkan's commission he has put himself in danger as there are persons, possibly including Liana herself, who will do anything to obtain a copy; several persons connected to the book meet violent deaths.Despite the paranormal theme, "The Ninth Gate" is not a horror film along the lines of "The Exorcist" or "The Omen". (Or, for that matter, Polanski's earlier "Rosemary's Baby". Although he has publicly said that he does not believe in the occult, he clearly has an imaginative interest in the theme). There are no ghosts, demons or monsters and no spooky special effects. For much of its length the film resembles more closely a neo-noir thriller with the book acting as what Alfred Hitchcock called the "McGuffin", an article of no great importance in itself but which the main characters in the movie are all trying to get hold of. There is a resemblance between Corso and the private detectives who were the heroes of many of the original films noirs. To begin with, the only explicitly supernatural element, apart from the book's subject-matter, is the presence of a mysterious young woman, never named and only referred to as "Green Eyes". This woman, played by Emmanuelle Seigner (aka Madame Polanski), acts as Corso's guardian angel (or should that be guardian devil?) and seems to possess powers which go beyond the purely natural.The film has something of the feel of a tale by that Edwardian master of the ghost story, M R James, a feel heightened by the solid period interiors in which much of the action takes place. James's stories often centre upon an artefact (sometimes, indeed, a book) with supernatural powers, the nature of which is gradually revealed as the story develops, and an initially sceptical narrator whose scepticism is replaced by a realisation that the forces which confront him are real. So it proves here. Corso, initially motivated solely by the prospect of a lucrative deal, begins to realise that Balkan, Liana and others may want the book for reasons other than its financial value.Although Johnny Depp can be good in films about the paranormal or the gruesome ("From Hell", "Pirates of the Caribbean", "Sweeney Todd"), this is not his best performance. It was a mistake to try and make him look older, as even with greying temples he does not seem convincingly middle-aged, and his acting is flat and uninteresting. (There were reports of artistic clashes between him and the director).The film as a whole, however, is a reasonably good one. Polanski is one of those auteur directors (others include Kubrick and Peter Weir) who try not to repeat themselves and to make every movie as different as they can to its predecessor. (His film prior to "The Ninth Gate" was "Death and the Maiden", a study of the politics of dictatorship in Latin America, and his next two were to be "The Pianist", about the Nazi occupation of Poland, and an adaptation of Dickens's "Oliver Twist"). This film is not only different to "Rosemary's Baby" but also different to Polanski's previous neo-noir, "Chinatown", from 25 years earlier. That film was set during a hot, dry summer and shot in a harsh, glaring Southern California daylight. In "The Ninth Gate", by contrast, the colours are darker and more muted; it has an autumnal feel to it, even if the state of the vegetation suggests that it too was filmed in summer.The plot is less complicated than that of "Chinatown" (or many other neo-noirs) and, although it is at times slow-moving, it never loses the viewer's interest as it moves towards its disturbingly ambiguous conclusion. I would not rate "The Ninth Gate" quite as highly as "Chinatown" or some of Polanski's other masterpieces such as "Tess" or "The Pianist", but it is nevertheless an interesting film, proof that it is possible to make a supernatural thriller without resorting to shock tactics. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Took a few repeated viewings to fully "get it", but after watching it again recently can say it's grown on me. Johnny Depp is good at playing an unassuming book authenticator who gets in over his head. His performance is kind of the antitheses of the character he played in "Sleepy Hollow". Also, really enjoyed Emmanuelle Seigner's mysterious role (although I could never really nail down who she was "actuallY' supposed to be). Roman Polanski is obviously a very talented director and you can see signatures of his style at work here. The material at hand moves at a slow pace but never gets too dull and while I wish there was a better payoff, the movies final frames do leave you thinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better on a second viewing - but not Polanski at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some films are the victims of audience expectations, and that's certainly true of The Ninth Gate, which saw Roman Polanski apparently return to the horror genre but with very different results and tone to Rosemary's Baby in a film that left horror fans and admirers of its source novel alike feeling shortchanged. Based on Arturo Peréz-Reverte's The Dumas Club, but throwing out its parallel story revolving around a lost chapter from The Three Musketeers that many found the book's most interesting part as well as dropping the literary allusions in general and parallels to Dumas' novel in particular, it revolves around amoral rare book dealer Johnny Depp's ill-fated attempts to authentic a rare book for ruthless billionaire publisher Frank Langella. It seems that The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows was co-written by the Devil himself, and Langella wants to meet the author, something the book's nine engravings give instructions for ? but only if interpreted in the right way and only if the book, one of only three remaining copies to survive the bonfires of Inquisition, is not a forgery. Naturally Depp's attempts to compare and decipher the volumes leave a mounting trail of dead bodies in his wake and put his life and immortal soul (if he has one) in danger as he finds himself shadowed by fatale femmes Emmanuelle Seigner's 'guardian angel,' who demonstrates her supernatural credentials with a couple of bits of wire work that seem to have crept in from another picture, and Lena Olin's devilish millionairess.But rather than playing it all as a po-faced horror movie, Polanski chooses a more slyly mischievous and playful tone, its Satanic double-dealings more the stuff of black comedy than a black mass. Certainly it's hard to take many of the details seriously: these books are worth millions of pounds, yet no-one wears gloves to handle them, people casually flick through the pages with a drink or a cigarette in hand, even pressing down the spine to read them, ensuring that the only truly horrified members of the audience are obsessive bibliophiles. Unfortunately if you won't be scared, you're also unlikely to be thrilled as it winds down from the mildly quirky into the increasingly routine and it's let down badly, as are pretty much all let's-go-to-Hell movies, by the is-that-all? ending, which leaves you wondering if this journey down the left handed path was really necessary. Still, there's a delightful cameo from Jose Lopez Rodero, the film's production manager and the assistant director of many shot-in-Spain epics such as El Cid, King of Kings, Papillon and Patton, as eccentric twin Spanish book dealers (one dubbed by Polanski himself) and a couple of workmen, and there are a few nice little bits of business along the way that help mitigate the inevitable first-time disappointment on a second viewing.</fullReview>

Although,kin a Hitchcock influence Roman Polanski deserves the epithet "The Master of the mysteries"So The Polanski fans they know what i am talking about! As i said on the beginning I always hungry for this film works. The ninth Gate story is the modern story made by the old classic way!The cinematographer Darius Khondji done his work perfectly well and made this film magic.The cast is very good,Langella,Johnny Depp, lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner are magnificent.So,very stylish film along with the acting bat under the maestro Roman Polanski made this film unik.

		<fullReview>When films come out of novels always the same debate arises: which is better, is it faithful, why the changes and so on. Let's take for example Hillcoat's adaptation of The Road; rarely seen a more humble and plain translation from the word to the image. In The Ninth Gate something very different happened. At one end we have Arturo Perez Reverte's novel The Club Dumas, a nice well built story with thrill, adventure, kind of romance, strong hints to supernatural, blood, twists, nothing missing for a good screenplay and a box office hit. On the opposite end Polanski adaptation, where everybody and everything is twisted, painted with the most evil (thus confused)colors. Surely happy are the satanists with their unending arguments about who is what, how Hell is furnished and the color of Satan's tie. If you mess with the Devil you get a mess, and there may be a touch of art in it. The reason of the twisting may be found in the terrible past of Polanski, the war, the murder of his wife. So, i guess, having read that robust and effective novel the director went on a trip of his own into the darkest unknown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a supernatural mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the type of movie where you get to discover things along with the main character. You don't have to wait for the character to catch up with what the audience already knew, I hate those type of movies and I'm happy that this isn't one of them.The best way to describe it, is that its a supernatural mystery. Its not one of those movies where they give you the answers, there are answers, but there is also a mystery even towards the end and its one of those movies where you need to use your imagination and make your own conclusions.Movie going audiences aren't used to that these days anymore. I admit, that I expected more, I wanted to see the Ninth Gate but at the same time, well you can use your imagination to fill in what that might be. I think its a good idea to leave some mystery as to what it might be like.Basically, the plot is...a rare book dealer is hired to track down three books by a rich rare book collector. Along the way he meets this mystery girl and she helps him in his quest. Its implied in the end, that she's the devil. Giving you a different perspective on the devil and in this movie, the devil isn't evil. She defies every stereotype there is of the devil.I really liked that. I love the creepy and mysterious vibe to the movie. I would definitely watch it again and own it on DVD. The ending is not to what I was used to as a movie viewer, but I think these days that's a good thing. Its different and you can draw your own conclusions too. I especially love Johnny Depp in this movie. He fits the character perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with the comment above. Just wanted to point out that in the "goofs" page it says the 1780 print of Don Quixote has no special relevance because Don Quixote is from the 1600s. Interestingly this is one part of the movie that has been well researched.The four-volume edition referred to in the movie is El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha (1780). It was published in 1780 by the Spanish Royal Academy in Madrid. It contains a detailed map of Spain as well as over thirty engraved illustrations. It is considered the most magnificent edition of the tale ever produced. The decorative engravings (one per chapter) illustrate the situations Don Quixote faces. This publication contains a biography of Cervantes, an analysis of the tale, and an engraved portrait of Cervantes designed by Jose del Castillo. The edition was printed by Spain's premier printer, Joaquin Ibarra, and no expense was spared to make it the best.Obviously opnions on what is best differ but this edition is undoubtedly historically significant. I would imagine this collection would go for $23,000-$64,000. The range is quite big but it's for my safety since I'm not an expert on this kind of book. I can however safely say for the full collection in good condition it would not be less than $23,000. Considering in the movie he got it off the owners at $4,200 he made a tidy profit either way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wrong Castle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noticed something very strange in this movie the second time through. In the scene where Corso is in the library looking up the reference material for The Nine Gates of The Kingdom of Shadows, the picture shown in the reference is of the engraving in the copy he has with him (Balkan's). He compares them side-by-side, and they both show a woman on a dragon, with a narrow turreted castle in flames behind her. He jots down a note, then the camera zooms in on Balkans' book again, but this time the castle is different: it's the wide one from the end of the movie, with squared features.Later, when he's comparing notes with the Baroness' copy, it shows that engraving 9 is by LCF for Balkan's copy, and AT for Fargas. We can assume then that the Baroness' copy also has an engraving 9 by AT. Since the ninth engraving is the one that was supposedly a forgery, it makes sense that the AT engravings are the two with the narrow turreted castles. However, this makes things difficult for the reference book. If its image of engraving 9 really had looked different from Balkan's copy when side by side, Corso would have been on the right track a lot sooner. Where is the real mistake, in not having the wide castle in the reference, the first shot of Balkan's copy of engraving 9, or the second shot where it's been changed?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revelations of artwork, interpretation of a pagan occult practice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate is a very entertaining movie which makes the pagan occult of un-holy communes a spectacle. The sound selection seemed adequate and not overly done. I think the major roles of each character were well laid within the plot as the story was un-told. The plot of having a book detective investigate authentic claims of publication is unique. I think Johnny Dep plays a fairly good role.I am trying to understand the role of illustrations with-in the plot, un-less to reveal a second story as the ending may infer as the book detective walks into the rising sun of the East. Visual cues are a definite link to the great entertainment of audio-visual works of art. The ancient Greeks used masks with auditory megaphones to help communicate to the audience. The details of any great work of art are in the details as well. Which can be said for painting, drawings, etc.Personally I would like to see a sequel of how Middle Eastern thought may be involved with the concept of paper illustrations. The Sun itself is a religious icon in the Middle East, which coincides with the power of heat and light over darkness. As singular thought to re-recognize true natural power is the essence of society. To master one-self and co-ordinate others to harness the power of nature seems the object of how the sequel should continue this story.In retrospect the use of fire and natural lighting is very play-full right up to the very end, or climax. I think the passion of the human spirit as portrayed as a natural energy for the quest for authentic knowledge was also done with very good artistic ability in this film, The Ninth Gate. As for the natural power of pagan occult practices with use of gender the differences between male and female seem obvious. This is a curious facet as compared with the use of symbols where the pentagram is primarily used instead of a waning or waxing phase of the moon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do I love this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't particularly think this is a classic or anything like that. I say that because Polansky seems to switch again and again between making a serious movie about books, Satan, and myth to making a parody of the very same subject matter. In general, if you like mysterious stories about weird underworlds (i.e. European book collectors and Devil Worshippers) then you should find this an entertaining movie. I love Depp, and I think he gives a strong performance playing a book collector with very little soul who gets embroiled in a job. His job is to authenticate an edition of the Ninth Gate, one of 3 existing. The owner thinks he has a fake, but in actuality the links between the 3 editions become much more complex. There is a mysterious woman who helps him along the way, I've always had my theories on who/what she represents but I wont spoil the movie for the rest of you. Shot well, acted well, and fairly captivating, the only negatives are the occasionally weird scenes that don't fit the underlying themes of cerebral, mysterious, and unknowing story lines. At times it seems Roman kinda just breezed through a scene or two, thats my only problem with the movie. Over all its definitely underrated, largely because it never received Hollywood's stamp of approval. Go see it.</fullReview>

In whole of the movie and especially by its end I was crying and yelling that yes! girl is the Satan himself. And, just read the comment by Diana, I independently observed all that she had said and reached the same conclusion. If you see movie carefully some of the scenes (like that of dog in the street after baroness dies, the naked lady in the last scene with serpent guarding the hell(hence meaning that girl is the Satan himself),the scene of Barnie suspended inverted etc) resemble the true woodcuts signed by LCF. Thus telling that the way to reach Satan and the ninth gate wasn't just to collect the woodcuts and perform some rituals, but to experience them in succession, in real time. And Carso unknowingly was experiencing all the scenes in the wood cuts, symbolically and sometimes literally, and by the procedure reached the Satan in the end. Movie is pretty clear on the facts that girl is the the Lucifer, and why and how only Carso reached him in the end.</fullReview>

The concept of the devil's engravings was spot on for the genre, and the use of various European locations added to the atmosphere. Unfortunately - like so many have remarked - the last 10 minutes didn't really work out, and this affected the impression of the entire movie which sort of fell apart in retrospect.On the plus side, there were some striking images - like Frank Langella's fire scene, or the wheelchair/fire scene - that only a first-rate filmmaker like Polanski could come up with. Like other viewers I thought about "Eyes Wide Shut" during some scenes, but that was a much more serious and developed movie. I liked Johnny Depp's performance, though his character was unsympathetic and he wasn't as focused as in "Donnie Brasco" for instance.Someone called this a "lazy" movie by Polanski, and I guess that's a good description - you can see the talent and the fun he had, but there was no real commitment. I gave it a weak 7 / 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the book...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, it may sound like the usual book-movie dilemma, but, as much as I admire Polanski's work, this movie doesn't quite cut it, as we say. To start with, the book called "Club Dumas" (Arturo Perez-Reverte) is much more varied in its storyline, since there are many threads and investigations in the story, including the parallel with Alexandre Dumas' "Three Musqueteers", the "Ninth Gate" and the characters themselves. The movie centres around only one story and I am disappointed in this. Otherwise, the cast is good, Depp excellent, Olin fantastic, and it doesn't look or feel like an Hollywood movie at all, which is its strength. On that note, I'd say, see the movie, and read the book afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie with reservations. I think that Johnny Depp carried an otherwise slow moving movie that was easy to predict from the get go. I loved the subject and was extremely impressed with "the devil" being played by an extremely talented young lady that I would love to see more of. I feel that Mr. Polanski should of allowed Depp more free artistic expression. I kept waiting for something a little out of the ordinary, as is the custom of Depp, but it didn't happen. I was very impressed with the filming and the fire scenes. Loved the location shots and feel that something must have went askew in the marketing of this fine film for it not to have had a higher box office total. Great film that I intend to watch several more times!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Literary Book versus Motion Picture Bout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I really enjoyed this movie. The first time I saw it I didn't care for it too much; it took a couple more subsequent viewings to actually appreciate what Polanksi was driving. I can't say that I'm a Polanski fan, I think the only other movie I've enjoyed to any degree was "The Fearless Vampire Hunters". I am a so-so Johnny Depp fan, even with the PotC movies of late. I have far more respect for Frank Langella.Then, suddenly, this movie appealed. I began to understand the Machiavellian application to it; forget "Satanism", Satanism is merely a religion/philosophy which teaches its followers to indulge in their every whim. Overindulge without restraint; this leads to chaos.The Ninth Gate is Satanic only in the way it dares to challenge status quo and the Firmament. Can Man equate with God? It appears that if he contemplates the cryptic but profound lessons of the Nine Gates (in Numerology, 9 is symbolic with God) he may become one with Divinity. The other lesson about touring the Nine Gates? He has to be ruthless and not distracted; therefore you cannot overindulge yourself. Hence, the work is not akin to the doctrines of Satanism.The book, Reverte's "The Club Dumas" was literary and enjoyable in parts, but lacked Polanksi's more direct approach. The book merely hinted about Satanism and the equation of Divinity and Man. I felt that Reverte wanted to say something, but like an alchemist looking for the Philosopher's Stone, he had trouble locating the right formula.Polanski redoes the work and makes it more streamlined. The movie is much more frightening in what it supposes than "The Da Vinci Code"; Nine Gates actually makes Man God.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Decent Movie Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to look at these comment areas for movies in an effort to better understand what a movie is about, or at the very least some rough outline of what to expect going into a movie. I'll try to keep it as unspecific as possible, I promise! Basically Depp's character is a rare book "detective," for lack of a better word. He's an expert in the field, and instead of collecting many such books for himself, he instead tracks them down and sets up sales for potential buyers and collectors. He takes a job having to do with a specific book on the occult said to be able to summon Satan himself. Understandably, this is a pretty rare book, having only three copies intact, as most of the other copies were burned along with the author some four hundred years before during the Spanish Inquisition. So, he is given the task by his client (Langella's character) to track down the other two copies of the book and see which is the original, as he believes two of the three to be copies. That is basically the plot outline in a nutshell, as vaguely as can be described without giving too much away.Having some small background in rare books and a fledgling interest in the occult myself, I found the movie to be very interesting. However, if you watch this expecting to see a "Devil's Advocate" or a "Stigmata" or some other action-packed religious-undertoned film, think again. I mean, the religious undertones are there, but you kind of have to appreciate the bigger picture with this film; they're not all out in the open and in your face like in the aforementioned titles. From the viewpoint of a student of literature, this is a good film. From someone wanting to see the devil incarnate blow stuff up and a righteous hero come in to save the day, it's probably not for you. However, again, I'd recommend it to anyone willing to sit through it in an attempt to appreciate the subtle undertones presented therein.Although they didn't dissuade me from enjoying the film overall, I did notice a couple of small foibles. The book(s) in question (as well as others that are seen throughout the film) are supposed to be ultra-rare and extremely old, but they are presented in almost brand new condition, which is utterly impossible even if they had been kept in immaculate condition ever since they were printed. Such paper naturally grows brittle and yellow over time, and the bindings, although made of sturdy leather, will inevitably over time begin to crack and break. Also, none of the extensive collections presented in the film were pampered nearly enough in accordance with their respective worths; they were kept in almost direct sunlight, unshelved in some cases, and open to regular air, and yet if ancient books were actually kept under such circumstances, it would greatly reduce their respective lifespans. Finally, throughout the film, Depp's character does not handle the books in the way any real self-respecting rare book expert would. He constantly manhandles the books with his bare hands (natural acid from human hands will only help to erode pages in ancient books that much faster) when he should have been using a pair of clean white gloves and by all rights a page-turner (basically a small spade-like tool). He also smokes constantly around the old texts, which again is a big no-no. It does nothing but destroy the lifespan and lower the resell value.Anyway, sorry for the side-tracked tangent! It was a good flick overall, if you can overlook some small problems in vocational portrayal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's Scarier Than a Polanski Film About the Devil?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Answer: a Polanski film about the Devil starring Johnny Depp, the toughest pretty-boy in film history. In fact, the pairing of the brilliant, Francophile Depp &amp; the exiled genius seems so natural that it's a wonder it never happened before. Clever, mercenary rare book expert Dean Corso ("a double-dealing, money-grubbing bastard" according to his best friend) is hired by zillionaire publisher &amp; demonology collector Boris Balkan (Langella) to research Balkan's newest &amp; most prized acquisition: one of 3 copies of the "Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows," a book written by the most flagrant Satanist of the Inquisition period, allegedly in concert with Lucifer himself. Cursory examination of the book indicates it's original, but Balkan professes to be unsure &amp; will pay Corso a fortune to examine it with the other two: one in Spain &amp; one in Paris. Corso can't even get out of Manhattan without realizing there's a lot more to it than that. Two women bedevil Corso's journey: French aristocrat Lianna Telfer (Olin), the widow of the book's former owner, who will do ANYTHING to get it back, and a beautiful, shabby, enigmatic blonde (Seigner) who appears whenever Corso needs a guardian angel. But why would an angel protect a scumbag like Corso? Polanski's adaptation of the cool, dark, intelligent Spanish novel "Club Dumas" is very European, with just enough violence to keep a Yank from rigor mortis but dripping with temptation, sex, intrigue &amp; pure, Roman Catholic evil. Like the book, this film is the opposite of "The Da Vinci Code," which is about puzzles &amp; devices. The characters, not the story, are Polanski's puzzles. They don't come off as well as they might. Corso doesn't really have any redeeming qualities, no underlying goodness, only modest reserves of courage, no end to cynicism. Yet he's neither ambitious enough nor evil enough to avoid being the tool of his betters. Olin, fine but a stereotyped femdemon, is a bit too effective as the devilish widow, leaving little to the imagination, least of all that toned body. Had the role more closely followed the book, Nicole Kidman or even Reese Witherspoon might have found it a worthy challenge. The supporting cast is above average, notably Langella as the hulking, mild-mannered intellectual who effortlessly matches limitless finance to the glories of Hell, Jefford as the crippled aristocrat with a girlish crush on the Prince of Darkness &amp; Taylor (another American exile) as sad, shabby Portuguese nobleman Fargas. Of the three overt devices Polanski insists on using, one--the never-ending smoking of cigarettes--is annoying, confusing &amp; contrived since most of the characters are supposed to be the quill of rare book experts. The second, the book &amp; its drawings, contrive a puzzle just hard enough to keep our interest when Johnny needs a break. The third device, Seigner's mystery girl, is far more satisfying, never really letting us know whether she's out to save Corso's soul as well as his butt until the very end. But it's Depp's show &amp; he overcomes the pedantry of Corso with a nuanced portrayal of cynicism, greed, fear, awe, frustration &amp; determination, a performance that never lags, never fails to fascinate. Could any other actor still be a believable sleuth who persists despite being regularly pummeled by women? Khondji's masterful cinematography &amp; Kilar's dark score round out Polanski's quiet but stylishly sable tale of classic, Old-World devilry. There's little blood-drinking (and that little is sexy), no flesh burned or curdled, no metamorphoses, no crosses warding off evil energy. "The Ninth Gate" cuts to the chase: the chase for our souls, for Polanski, Depp &amp; company make this supernatural tale human enough to put us in fear of the Fallen One. It's a necessary addition to any Halloween collection or a fine, dark thrill any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots Of Potential (But The Ending Misses The Mark)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What starts out as a promising thriller from veteran director/writer Roman Polanski ("Rosemary's Baby", 1968), ends up getting tangled in a spider's web of technical miffs, poor editing, and weak score.Starting off strong, we learn about Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), an unscrupulous book dealer who is willing to deceive in order to get a deal on a rare copy of "Don Quixote". One of his regular customers, Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), calls on him to verify the authenticity of his rare book "The Nine Gates" by comparing it to the only other two copies in existence. But Balkan is too insistent and suspiciously generous in his offers, already promising to double the money before Corso even starts. But Corso (apparently not being as smart as us viewers) doesn't really question this. Additionally, Balkan offhandedly entrusts the $1,000,000 book to Corso without hesitation or contract, despite its enormous value.As Corso tracks down the other two books (he gets on an airplane - Balkan has already told him of their European locations) and people around him start to die, he learns that the book (derived from a book by Lucifer) somehow holds the key to opening a portal called the ninth gate.Corso, examining the differences in the nine illustrations between his and Victor Fargas' copy, finds some of the illustrations signed by LCF (for 'Lucifer'), and some by AT. Here the plot takes a major 'wrong turn', as the viewers can clearly see what Corso doesn't: that the nine LCF illustrations, distributed among the three copies of the book, must be brought together to solve the riddle and unleash the book's powers.As we wait for Corso to catch on to this mind-numbingly obvious fact, he continues on his quest, which instead of gaining intrigue, becomes plodding and familiar. The same goes for 'The Girl' (Emmanuelle Seigner), who mysteriously appears and disappears, occasionally gliding through the air, but we never learn much more about her (except she has a thick accent, never answers questions, and likes to have sex near burning buildings).Aside from Depp, who finally succumbs to sleep-walking through his part, most of the acting is B-rate. Seigner blurts our her lines at times, much to the dismay of viewers wanting something more substantial. Langella, for the most part, does well until the climax of the film.Effects, even minor ones, could be troublesome. A wire to tip over a podium during a fight scene was glaring. The CG in the opening titles was poorly done, though mostly forgivable. Driving and flying scenes were obviously rear projections, if only they hadn't been so thoroughly abused.Then there are things that defy explanation. Corso, in hot pursuit of Balkan, stops in the middle of a stream (where he supposedly got stuck). A car, trying to hit Corso, manages to miss by swerving in the opposite direction. In an attempt to surreptitiously follow an unsuspecting target, Corso and The Girl choose a loud, high-revving red Dodge Viper. And the film must get at least a mention for having one of the most distracting mustaches (Pedro Ceniza) ever to be projected on a silver screen.The weak score from Wojciech Kilar was often more fitting for a comedy than a thriller. As Corso walks down an alley on his way to a book dealer, we hear a kind of 'adventure' music, similar to what you'd hear in a comedy during the setup of a physical joke (I was half-expecting to see Depp pushing a circus elephant into the back of a convertible). Occasional mismatches between the action and the musical peaks don't help. During the same alley walk scene, the 'adventure' music starts in the previous scene, before we even get to see Corso walking, and it is jarring when the visuals finally catch up.At 133 minutes, this film was nearly an hour too long, plodding its way through details that should have been thought better of. Why do we care if scaffolding suddenly comes tumbling down on Corso? It wasn't scary or mysterious, just out of place.I so much wanted this movie to take me to new and exciting places, and fulfill the promise of the opening minutes. But that was not to be. It is clear that a moderately bigger budget, a few better actors/actresses, and some retakes, could have put a completely new face on what ended up being, for the most part, substandard fare. In fact, just re-scoring the movie, along with some minor editing, would move the film up a few notches.I gave this film a 6 out of 10 as an indication of 'what could have been' and for Depp's characterization of Corso.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking toolbox</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been the owner of the excellent orchestral score to "The Ninth Gate" since it was released. I have listened to Wojciech Kilars music countless times and finally decided that perhaps i should also see the film the music was written for.I had heard many things about "The Ninth Gate" before watching it, both good and bad i might add. One of my friends holds it as one of his favorite movies, but he also expressed that it was demanding in the sense that it could seem bewildering to those who were not updated on the mythology. And i guess i am one of those people.. I though this movie was intriguing in many ways and i was not really disappointed by it. But still i feel that it has perhaps a bit too much mythology to it.Doing as Polanski does here, presenting a lot of events and a story but leaving the interpretation to the viewer, is usually something i appreciate. Perhaps i feel this time though that i don't have the necessary toolbox to really understand all of what Polanski wanted to say. Yes, he has a man (Balkan) who seems to be an avid satanist wanting to gain power through an ancient book. He uses an unknowing agent (Corso) to help him. And then others are entered into the mix on both sides of the fence so to speak. Even though i am fairly sure i understand the movie and it's events well, i still don't really know the significance of "The Ninth Gate" itself. I have heard that there are DVD's out there with a commentary track where Polanski elaborates on these subjects, unfortunately the DVD i bought is not one of them (that's what i get for being cheap!).So to sum things up i liked the movie but it leaves me somewhat unsatisfied in regards to it's resolution. That being said though i guess it might make a lot more sense to someone not being as 100% detached from religion as i am.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Private investigator, specialized in tracking rare books, is hired by a manic collector and supporter of demonology to confirm the originality of a satanic book that is supposed to be written by a human hand with the help of dark powers. His investigation, will take him from New York to Lisbon and from there to Paris, in a path full of enigmatic females and unexplained murders...Just like Alan Parker has done before, Roman Polanski with this on screen version of "The Club Dumas" book by Arturo Perez-Reverte, attempts to tell a story of metaphysical terror, with terms more aesthetic rather than philological ones, that are unleashed through an intense flirt with the codes of operation of "film noire" (vonurable detective - stalking horse , femme fatal-es of unknown origin, faceless persecutors , all moving within a temperament of uncertainty and pendency, illustrated with expressionistic precision)All fans of the once utmost, unique Polish stylist, wont be able to resist the unique humor, erroneous eroticism and hair-raising atmosphere of some clearly "polanskic" scenes.The truth is, although, the man has gotten old, is tired and.. unendurably bored. This becomes obvious from the unduly and lazy rhythm of the action, the uneasily setup climax scenes towards the end (most noticeable in the unutterable showdown sequence inside the tower of Liana Telfair) and sloppiness in actor guidance. The final result wont be disliked by Polanski's fans, but it will certainly disappoint them.A good film, but certainly not one to be considered as one of Roman Polanski's highlights</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "The Ninth Gate," Depp plays an unscrupulous bookseller sent out on the trail of copies of an ancient book that purportedly will give the owner supernatural powers. Along the way, he must deal with madness, mayhem and murder. Polanski made this, so you know it will result in a downward spiral of self-destruction for our unlikely hero. Depp is terrific as the shady book agent, and it is really his movie all the way, with some high-powered supporting players like Frank Langella to back him up. Polanski keeps the suspense up, although it seems to me Depp gets knocked out once too often (shades of DEAD MAN!). The ending comes upon us rather suddenly, and leaves us with questions. I figure Depp finally puts the book together and gets to travel to the next realm, possibly Hell. Maybe Polanski ran out of money or plot or interest. Who knows? See it for Depp. He is exquisite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't get it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just after seeing this film, I didn't understand it, or know what to make of it. Not being a huge fan of ignorance, I went ahead and read a few different analysis's, and I think I've pretty much figured out what the film means now. I'd probably have to watch it at least once more to understand it, though. I get what it's about and several of the interpretations of it make nearly perfect sense... but I'm left still not understanding large parts of the movie. Therefore, this review will be entirely based on the film as entertainment, and as a piece of art that wasn't understood by the author of the review(yours truly). First off, like most other Polanski films(at least to my recollection), this features some great dialog, an involving story and a likable lead character. The plot is very good, and it evolves nicely throughout the film. The pacing is very good, I was rarely bored. It seems to go out the window near the end, though. The final few scenes seemed tacked on as a result. The acting is all top notch... there wasn't one single character who I found poorly acted. The cinematography is exceptional, though I have come to expect nothing less from Polanski. Roman reuses Emmanuelle Seigner, the young French beauty he earlier used in Frantic. She does an equally good job in this film. She's mysterious, hypnotizing and alluring. Though I don't understand her native tongue, I believe I'll have to find some of her other films, just to see more of her. Polanski certainly knew what he was doing when he chose her for the part. All in all, a very good horror-mystery-thriller, which should entertain even the most critical fan of any of those three genres. Unless you're into western religion, however, you will probably have the same reaction as me(not understanding it). I recommend this to any fan of Polanski, Seigner and films with supernatural undertones. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Literate And Intelligent But Scary And Fun Satanic Plot Horror Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dealer in rare books takes a job from a sinister figure to investigate the authenticity of the three surviving copies of a medieval tome, The Nine Gates, rumoured to have been written in collaboration with the Devil. He uncovers a satanic secret hidden across all three books, which leads to double-crossing, murder, and ultimately a gateway to Hell.Based on the book El Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte, this is a beautifully creepy horror-odyssey film, as hero Depp sinks inexorably into the mystery, struggling at first to give credence to his mission but ultimately being seduced by the possibilities it might lead to. All-important atmosphere is perfectly judged by Polanski, with excellent camera-work by Darius Khondji and the brilliant use of the Seigner character. Credited only as "The Girl", this mysterious and seemingly all-knowing figure may be a demon or even Satan himself (herself ?). The movie wisely never explains her presence, and uses only the subtlest of touches to suggest her other-worldliness. She is a fascinating figure to try and fathom. The cast are the usual assortment of Polanski wackos (including production manager Jose Lopez Rodero as identical-twin brothers, would you believe), and all acquit themselves well. Depp is terrific, playing a bewildered middle-aged sceptic without histrionics, thereby giving the movie a crucially ordinary centre from which the madness can spiral out. At one point when asked by Seigner what he plans to do as they confront some heavies he says, "I was going to hide behind you.". Langella does a textbook job in Menacing as Depp's Faust of a client (there's a lovely moment where he breaks up a satanic-cult meeting by shouting "Boo" at the crowd), Olin is her usual deliciously depraved femme-fatale, and Jefford is wonderful as a crisp no-nonsense French aristocrat. Polanski has crafted an intelligent, enigmatic, spine-tingling, literary horror-film, set against a marvellous international backdrop, with a great script and cast. This film proves that horror and culture need not be mutually exclusive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>132 minutes and 50 seconds of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd have given this film an 8.5 out of 10 for the first 132 minutes and 50 seconds of its 133 minutes. Langella is creepily brilliant as Balkan, the macabre demon wannabe who doesn't get it. Depp is equally adept at being the greedy ass sonufabitch who really wants to be the devil. Depp going from French guy to high society lady to Balkan searching for the copies of the book to decode the secret for becoming Faust is an inspired touch. The movie's look is great, too. All grays and browns. It almost looks like the interior of a coffee house trying to be chic.Even when the succubus comes to Depp's aid, you can admire Polanski's vision and style. Even when Langella is standing there asking Depp if he can feel it (shortly before his unfortunate and messy demise), you can marvel at the character interplay.However, all of this was thrown away by the worst imaginable copout ending. Having teased us with creepiness all throughout (and with plenty of violence, both hinted at and shown), Polanski cops out with a "you figure it out" ending. I HATE "you figure it out" endings. They bring no closure, offer no denouement to the story, and ultimately, leave you with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach.Now, don't get me wrong, I didn't want to see a special effects phantasmagoria with Depp's head splitting open and horns sprouting and all of that crap. Instead of walking into that stupid light "shades of Poltergeist and "DON'T GO TOWARD THE LIGHT!,"" Depp should do something subtle, such as walk forward with the camera on his face (instead of over his left shoulder), and have the light from a flicker of flame caress his face. That would be subtle, but leave the viewer with a sense of finality.The only way the present ending makes sense is if Polanski were going to do a sequel where Depp comes back from the depths of hell and wreaks havoc on the world as a sort of Librarian Screwtape. So far, after six years, there is no sequel.So, in all, Ninth Gate was a very good movie made merely average by Polanski's fear of completing the transformation of his hero into Faust.</fullReview>

Again I find myself wondering if they saw the same film I did.This is a good all round supernatural thriller that never goes over the top. Some of the imagery is superb (the chateaux at night surrounded by flaming torches in particular). Frank Langella was magnificent almost resembling Christopher Lee at times. All the cast were excellent (don't mess with Lena Olin) but the jewel in the crown was the score. Forgive my spelling but Wojciech Kilar's music is genius. His 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' was one of the finest soundtracks ever and this came very close.There is always something great about films concerning the devil. They carry an atmosphere that can never be replicated in other genre movies. Rosemary's Baby had it, Angel Heart had it, The Omen had it and I'm glad to say The Ninth Gate has it.Now all we need is a damn good remake of The Devil Rides Out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Polanski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A typical Polanski film: dark, intelligent, good casting, and good storytelling. What struck me the most was Polanski's use of certain characters that were either comical or were perfect casts. For instance, Depp does a wonderful job at playing hopeless wimps. He is no macho man, and rarely is cast as one. This movie was a wonderful precursor to his performances in Sleepy Hollow and From Hell. Another example of a comical character were the "brothers" who ran the rare book shop in Spain (I didn't realize it at the time but they were played by the same man, AND later when the brothers "shut down operations," the workmen tearing down the store were also the same person as the person who played both brothers). The ever-beautiful Lena Olin played her part well, a nasty bad-tempered woman who got what she wanted. Nepotism never impresses me, but I have to admit that Polanski's use of Seigner, his wife 36 years his junior (Polanski still loves 'em young) was a very good cast. Seigner, with her rare beauty, played a perfect "Devil." Her face and eyes can really put a man into a daze, even without the special effects. Finally, Polanski always tells a compelling story, which in this case was the story of three mysterious prints of a book, which were "almost" identical to one another (you will have to see the film to learn what I mean by "almost" -- this storyline made the film). Rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is it that I've never seen a good movie about the devil. While I thought Exorcist 2 had it's moments it never really moved me. (as for Exorcist 1. It bored me)Now we have this. Usually I like Johnny Depp. I think he's agreat actor. While he certainly did his best here the movie falls short in the scare department. I want my movies about the devil to be accurate and not humoour which this was. Why if hell's name does hollywood have to make every damn movie funny? Lucifer wasn't funny. Lucifer was an angel who dared to stand up against god because god favored the race of men over his first creations. Lucifer was a proud angel. And I for one understand how he felt. Wouldn't you? For once I would like to see a serious movie about this subject. Why not make a movie about Dante's works. But for crying out loud don't butcher it with senseless commercialism. Films should be about art.. And while this movie certainly was entertaining it wasn't art. Mere entertainment. PS the girl was The Whore Of Babylon as shown on the last engraving. Even I saw that on the first viewing. And I must say she was pretty hot. But that's just my opinion ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie, it had so many neat little things, some as obvious as the sun (loopholes and hints), but who cares, this is a movie of dark magic.. The only weak point i can really think is the love scene.. it wasn't really necessary.. I bought the movie, and i have to admit I am glad I did.. People have to remember a movie is escapism.. I wouldn't of seen it in the theatre, not at the prices they charge now, but as a purchase or rental.. yeah, it is well worth it.. In fact, this is the movie, that made me believe Depp(two p's people)is a good actor, or sunk it in, I love Fear and Loathing.. I give it 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I liked Johnny Depp that much.... but, after looking at how many of his Movies I own, and have seen here lately, I guess I could say I'm a pretty good fan of his. This movie is no exception... his portrayal as a book dealer/appraiser (scrupulous, to say the least) was very convincing, maybe cept for the part about the smoking.... I really don't believe that any REAL collector of rare books would let anyone NEAR their most rare books while smoking, dropping ashes on the pages, etc.... NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!... but, overall, I really liked the movie... there were some unexpected plot turns here and there, and you had to be paying pretty good attention to the movie. Roman does a good job with the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i didn't see this when it came out in the theater, but a friend recommended it and i enjoyed it the first time i saw it. then i started collecting books and realized that i have often enjoyed movies with a devil theme or that deal with the occult in a non-gore/silly fashion. anyway, i had to buy the dvd and then i read the book that the movie is based on called the club dumas by perez-reverte which i also enjoyed very much, but i like the ending of the movie much better than the end of the book. anway, i love this movie because of the obsession for books, because of the very interesting characterization of the devil (the devil in love (this is gone into more in the book)), and i love the mood that polanski creates. and i have some kind of weak spot for johnny depp that i have been fighting for some time, but i give in johnny, you win, now i'm one of those people (johnny depp fans). i wish there were more movies like this. and am putting off seeing this movie again so as to savor the desire to see it and hope to see it with friends. i plan on seeing it again and again over the years (not something i do with very many movies at all). highly recommended for people who collect books especially.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is not very important that at the middle of the film the story is about clear.The point is the atmosphere that surround you about the devil. The message seems to be that the devil choose the ones that has to be their pupils... Roman Polansky also illustrate the devil like something that has appeal, interesting, not so bad as is said. Well, I can strongly agree on Ms Emmanuelle Seigner, but the movie represent too much a advertising for mr Satana.. btw, is not possible to be detached from the atmosphere. A good work, and Johnny Depp confirmed its ability to jump from a role to another, changing also aspect and way to be on the scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A game</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have been served notice right from the beginning, and reminded throughout the movie: it's a game.Before going into the game business, let me say first that this is not a heavy game. Polanski makes sure that we get our fair share of chuckles as we play along. A good example is when "book detective" Corso (Johnny Depp) gets his phone call in the hotel room whe he is with the girl, he immediately tells the operator that he'll take it in the lobby. Recalling that not long ago he had just got a call in the lobby which he wanted to take his room is ticklish enough to make us chuckle. Not falling off our chairs, but just a little chuckle. We get plenty of them, with the repeated calls from his client, and when he gets into the habit of losing his consciousness, as in Sleepy Hollow.Although there are traces of Gothic horror, Sherlock clues and Hitchcock suspense, The Ninth Gate is none of these. The story develops in a simple, traditional, linear progression. The "mysteries" get unraveled pretty quickly and continuously throughout the movie, swimming in predictability. All too famaliar are the encounters, chases, killings, as well as the seemingly omnipresent villain.What Polanski seems to be telling us is, "Be patient while we play this little game. I don't want to distract you too much with over-complicated stuff. Just wait for my final twist". This final twist, when it comes, is at best mildly satisfying, but not sufficient to carry the entire movie.Is it a good movie then? I would say yes, for a number of reasons. Debb, for example, has just the right mix of seriousness and playfulness so that we do enjoy the ride with him in this game. The cast is excellent, portraying a good variety of interesting characters. I particularly love the mischievous brothers (twins?). Both cinematography and music are appropriately positioned to attract some attention without becoming overbearing. Finally the humour, dry without going to the extent of being dark, makes the game an enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have this movie on VHS so I've seen it a couple of times. Very good acting performance by all actors. Depp is excellent in his role as a 'book detective'. He looks like the devil himself at times, and I think his dubious character is an essential point. Like another user has mentioned I think it's a story about the devil, portrayed by the girl in the movie, finding a mate. Depp is the chosen one. That explains why the girl always appear when he is in trouble to help him and lead him in the right direction. The one who solve the puzzle in the books will open the ninth gate and enter the world of the devil. The first time I saw the film I was a little disappoint of the ending, but after understanding the movie better I think it is suits well in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty good mystery/horror movie overall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the era of Hollywood action blockbusters, it was a pleasant surprise to witness a movie that did not rely on endless explosions and special effects to keep the audience enthralled.Ninth Gate is memorable in that it catches your interest. Essentially a mystery, you follow Depp's character as he tries to unravel the secrets of a book reputed to summon up the Devil.There's plenty of mysticism and occultism threatened throughout the movie, but it isn't until the end that it really makes an appearance. At that point I was uncomfortably reminded of such classics as "The Devil Rides Out" in terms of people in robes etc.. Or as I've heard it referred to "Mumbo-Jumbo, Dennis Wheatley".The cast is not particularly brilliant, though Depp is reasonably good. He seems to be trying to carve out a niche for himself in strange films involving mystery and horror. Perhaps he fancies himself as the next Peter Cushing? In any event, a competent performance and the other members are bearable.It's not a film you can watch many times and enjoy, unless you miss the point of it the first time around, when a second viewing might help fill in some holes.The only thing I can say negatively about it really is to do with the basic premise of the book in the film. It's supposed to be allow the Devil to be reborn, but I can't help but think that, if I was the Devil and had "co-wrote" the book, I wouldn't have made it so convoluted and blasted difficult to get to the bottom of things.Anyway, a different type of movie from the usual action-fests, and refreshing because of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very artistic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDB total rating of 6.4 Why?There are movies that are entertaining and there are some that are artistic. If you can combine the two, you have a legendary movie. The Ninth Gate was more artistic than entertaining and that's probably why it has a low rating. Unfortunately, I believe a 7.8 is more appropriate.I believe that most viewers were looking for a simple investigative thriller and did not comprehend the view of the director. One of the greatest directors, Roman Polanski, creates movies that are full of art that real movie buffs can appreciate. He is not going to present you with a predictable Morgan Freeman thriller. I admit that the story wasn't that extraordinary: but you have to look beyond it and put yourself in the director's shoes.The movie is rather clever. You have the three characters, not including the frenchman, who are obsessed with the devil and have studied many ancient books related to him. There are three very valuable books in the world that may be the strongest link to reaching him. Corso, who cares very little about the situation, makes a journey to find the link for Balkan simply because he is getting well paid. Balkan, the baroness, and Liana devote their lives to finding the devil but they fail. Corso doesn't. Why? Because the link to the devil lies in the journey. The girl is the devil and she gives him an invitation rather than the other three because of the journey he made. Cool idea.Also, you have to respect Johnny Depp's performance. He is so incredibly talented and he never lets us down. He chooses incredibly challenging roles and plays them to near perfection every time. On a lower note, I thought the overseas traveling and the investigation was pretty cool too.3 out of 4 stars. Check it out.</fullReview>

Wooden and stilted delivery and bad make-up (grey hair surrounds an otherwise very youthful face) conspire with lack of depth to make the ending the perplexing anti-climax commented on by others above. Depp really doesn't show the viewer any change in the character's motive, and he just looks comically silly near the end, stuck in the floor boards like that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The nine gates go very deep... Enter if you dare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I want to say how well, I believe, this movie was done. Perhaps, a bit too well. Many people have given proper consideration to this film and should be commended. However, for light enjoyment with spooks and scares; look elsewhere. The horror that is present in this story is far more permanent and dangerous than making the viewer jump in there seat (which I never did). My usual format goes that I say what I liked and then root out what might not have been so good. The acting, the direction, the plot, appropriate lack of action, and musical score all were very powerful.What worked: Most of the things I mentioned above. In particular, I think Depp has just the right amount of nafarious atmosphere about him. Drinking, smoking, sex... it seems he falls prey to all vices. And, he cares only for himself which is true Satanism. The French actress was superb... I'd like to see her in more films where a mysterious heroine is required because she fits the bill. And sexy... Nevertheless, each of the actors and actresses did a top-notch job portraying their roles. I also liked the movie's atmosphere... seductive; just like the book in the story.What didn't work: In short, nothing but the ending which I will go into in a moment. I think the all-out drive of the movie was it's combination of several elements, but this ending -- though I might know the reason for it -- was a huge let-down.SPOILERS -- SPOILERS -- SPOILERSFirst of all, I think most people have hit the conundrum, surrounding the mysterious girl "Green Eyes". Some say she's Lucifer. Now, I'm not a sexist, however, I'm pretty sure that Lucifer is not a woman. At least, not according to the Bible. However, if one wants to look to the Bible for answers to help explain this movie... well, there might not be much except perhaps in Revelation. The harlot or whore that rides the beast. The picture, as well as, some artists rendition of this depiction in Revelation almost perfectly match the final engraving in the Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows. The one where "Green Eyes" appears to be riding some sort of beast to the castle. Supposedly, this picture in revelation is a whore that has consorted with the beast, maybe a dragon, most certainly the devil, or Lucifer. Therefore, she says she is a student of sorts. A student of Satan. Near the beginning of the film, Balkaan is giving a lecture. In it he states that a witch usually are companions with familiars which are usually to say that they are animals that have the spirit of demons or other beings in them. What's to say then that Satan doesn't have his own 'familiars' and that they are witches/harlots/servants or students that run his errands and do his bidding. Also, one could note that when Balkaan specifically speaks of this witch-trivia, the camera goes to a full focus on "Green Eyes", alone. Polanski's way of letting us know that she is a witch (or fooling the viewer), and that she is actually a 'familiar' instead. Lucifer's familiar, a witch.Now, about the ending. Alfred Hitchcock had a name for it in a movie when the focus is drawn to a certain object (in this case the gate - in others, like Pulp Fiction it was the briefcase - in another movie it was something in another case; I can't remember the name). At any rate, directors like to do this where the actual focus of the story isn't really important, at all. The object of the movie is to bring out other intrigue while making one think the intrigue is the gate, itself; when it isn't at all. I don't like it, but really good directors and screen-writers love to use it. Like it or not, it's their call I suppose.9/10, though I wanted to take more off for the ending.thank you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not scary, but intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers) In this very cool and cerebral movie, Mr Polanski is back to the subject of satanists, again after Rosemary's Baby. And, although the Baby was much better, I still have a soft spot for this latest effort. Maybe it is because I am a bookworm and I am tickled pink by stories about books and the power they wield. But in fact, beyond the inanity of the whodunit plot, the fact is that there is a very smart idea underlying the movie. And here comes the spoiler: I have to say that if you did not understand that the Girl is Lucifer himself (or herself, if you wish), there is nothing much left for you to understand, because it is a key point.The idea is, you don't choose to follow Lucifer, but he chooses his companions himself. Or, you are not evil because you want to, but because you are. We know how evil Corso is: right in the beginning, he commits a very cruel deed (he swindles a rare book from the relatives of an old man, right under the nose of the book's owner, who has been rendered speechless by a stroke, so he cannot protest). He shows repeatedly that he cares for nothing or nobody. And, ultimately, the Girl chooses him, and discards all the wannabe satanists. The scene at the club ceremony, in which Balkan chides the cultists, saying that Lucifer would never deign to appear before them because they are such buffoons, is in fact heavily ironic, because the Girl is walking freely right before him and he never recognizes her.The movie is not frightening (not as the Baby was), but it is still intriguing. Johnny Depp plays a flawless Corso and I liked Emmanuelle Seigner as the Girl: she plays it with a cool humor that goes very well with the movie. And I liked the off-the-wall details, like the mannish secretary or the book sellers who are identical twins. Only one thing bothered me: do the dealers of rare books really smoke so much among their merchandise? At one point, one of them drops ashes all over the Portas book... I actually cringed at that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have read the last 90 comments on this movie, and no one seems to agree on what happens. This leaves me with several unanswered questions.First of all, who is The Girl? Some say she is Lucifer. I seem to believe that she is not Lucifer, but someone working for Lucifer. At one point she says she is something like a student. To me this means that she is a student of Lucifer. In addition, during a fight scene she is injured and bleeds. If she was Lucifer, then why is she bleeding? Also, she seems to pick Corso to enter The Ninth Gate. She tells him the location of the last page, but why?Second, what is the deal with Ceniza Brothers? At the end of the movie, why was there bookstore being dismantelled? It seems obvious that they forged the fake page in the book, but why? If they wanted to keep it out of somebody's hand, why leave it on top of a bookshelf? Why not just burn it? My best guess is they worked for Lucifer, who wanted to choose who entered the Ninth Gate. I suppose if they worked for Lucifer that is why they had the book so long and knew that three of the pictures were drawn by Lucifer.Finally, what is the Ninth Gate? When Corso enters the ninth gate at the end of the film, what happens? Did he go to hell? Did he become immortal? Did he aquire absolute power? When Balkan attempted to enter the ninth gate, it seemed that he believed he was becoming immortal. Another comment suggested that The Girl was the Ninth Gate, but what does that mean?Maybe no one knows the answers to these questions. Maybe the point of the ending was to leave everyone guessing. Personally I'd like to know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first Roman Polanski film, and it may be my last. I don't know who Polanski was shooting at, but it wasn't me. The worst thing is that it comes so close! I would go so far as to say I liked it right to the scene where Balkan immolates himself. All of a sudden, Frank Langella forgets how to act! After a brief looksee through the internet I did not see anybody mention how Corso just happens to witness or be a part of a scene in the movie that depicts every one of the engravings. The ending was the thing that really did this movie in for me. 1) Why does Corso need the darn piece of paper if he made the scene that was portrayed in the engraving? Why is the representation more important than the reality? 2)Why did the spanish brothers take the page out of the book? If they were goody goodies they could have destroyed it. 3) Why don't we see any kind of triumph on the part of Corso? It was all so anticlimactic to me. Not to say that the movie was all bad. Depp IS a damn fine actor. The flick was suspenseful. I thought that the cinematography was fantastic. The special effects were annoyingly bad though. Finally I must express my irritation at the fans of this movie. This seems to be their attitude - "Well I understand this movie - if you don't then you must be a lesser being."

If not for his voice I would have had trouble knowing it was him. I hope that he was heavily padded and made-up as if not then he has aged horribly (sorry Frank).My only warning would be this - if you hate those kind of endings that don't offer any type of conclusion then avoid this film at all costs.

Johnny Depp is a very watchable actor who makes the best of every role he takes on and because the story line is quite slow paced Depp makes the film very watchable because he is in nearly every scene. The story is about a Book collector/investigator who is asked to check the authenticity of a book that is supposed to be written by the devil himself.As i have said this is not a shock horror it is more of a thinking man's horror so if its a Scream type movie you are after dont bother but if its an intelligent horror that you want this is for you. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

They also share a plot in which the characters who develop a close interest in the book die one after another. Besides, the two movies contain numerous references to black magic, supernatural and mystery (secret places, sudden fires, burning books...).Considering the quality of the plot, the directing and acting in The Name of the Rose or other thrillers (Hitchcock, Clouzot), I realise that although enjoyable the Ninth Gate has flaws, like a lack of attention to details and too much vagueness. However,it avoids becoming corny by leaving some freedom to the imagination (like at the end, by not showing you-know-who).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>roman polanski's great work 'the ninth gate' is a great thrilling mystery with great actors, great camera work, directing and music all together creating an unique atmosphere.so, what more do you want? i'm really surprised of the low rating, but i sort of understand it also. movies that have something to do with religion are always sort of on/off movies for most of the viewers. i however have no religious beliefs whatsoever, and i found this movie doesn't try to make the viewer a believer, religion is just used well as the method to make good horror. there's nothing really showing 'proof of supernatural' for the main character in the plot.at best it's almost like a lynch movie with mysterious scenes and characters, at worst it's too predictable (the mystery of the book for example was WAY too easy to figure out) and has some goof-ups, too, like language mistakes, which is very surprising.but towards the ending, again, it went more mysterious and i started liking it more again and making the little flaws invisible and irrelevant to me. the movie was scary but a great movie nevertheless, or because.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film ruined by viewer's expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i saw this film when it first came out with a friend of mine. i heard of it, but never really put any thought into it. he told me he wanted to see it because it had really cool special effects. well, we went to see it, and the movie caught me by surprise on how intelligent it is. what i've heard is that there are nine gates of hell and all that jazz, so the plot is plausible. by the end, i understood the film completely. i thought my friend and i would have one of our typical "after movie" conversations. but no, he disliked the film. but i think he thought he'd see more gore or special effects, which i think would have ruined the movie. my dad also saw it and didn't like it, but i simply think in his case the subject matter was over his head. now don't get me wrong, i am not a satanist, but i had a friend who explained some of this subject matter to me because he was once curious. i also didn't base how i feel about this film on what he said. it just helped me make sense of it. that, and the fact that i went in without any idea on how this movie was to be, lend me to really liking it. this is not a movie for everyone. it's an old-school tale filled with old books and older people who are evil at heart. not some special effects gore fest. so, to most viewers, the content may be too far-fetched, dark, or over their heads. or as in the case of my friend, stupid, boring, and not what he thought it was</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something beautifully refreshing about movies where you actually have to think while you watch. And to be honest, the ending takes so much figuring out, that the more people you ask, the more opinions you'll get.The mood for the film is set right from the start. We first meet our hero, Dean Corso, an antique books dealer, as he swindles a hapless couples out of a priceless first edition of Cervantes' Don Quixote. Mr. Polanski is taking a bit of a chance by presenting his protagonist as a rather reprehensible creature, who's clearly in it for he money. But this portrayal is necessary, as it is important to understand that Corso does not believe in the supernatural in any way, nor is he especially fond of books. Again, it's all for the cash. The ever evil Frank Langella may at first be mistaken for Satan himself. But his character, the driving force behind Corso's quest, and a dangerous man to displease, is merely a devout disciple, and, as such, a firm believer, thus representing the other end of the spectrum.Minor spoilers.In spite of our initial misgivings, our empathy with Johnny Depp's character is established after about the second time someone tries to kill him. It won't be the last time, either, so luckily he is assigned a guardian angel, who might also be something else. And he's not the only one in danger; as Corso progresses on his quest to secure the copies of the fabled book, the people who own them, die. Those deaths (did he have a hand in them?), the ever deepening mystery and his beautiful angel, work the necessary transformation. Having forgotten about the money, Corso now carries on out of his very own... curiosity? Obsession? He has long been turned into a believer when he undertakes a final journey. Looking for the Devil, it seems, is like looking into the abyss; He might also be looking for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give credit, even when it's not due</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to give Johnny Depp credit, he keeps trying different things--Ninth Gate, From Hell, all those Burton movies, even Nick of Time and Don Juan DeMarco. You have to give him even more credit that he keeps persuading producers and directors to give him those roles even though he puts in consistently bad performances, or rather he's simply not up to the task at hand. This is a typical example: Though as usual, they try and obscure Depp's pretty boy looks, they only manage to make him look like they're trying to obscure his pretty boy looks. Not like he's a real character -- he's like a mannequin.The movie itself needs lots of work--there seems to be a lot of filler, long stretches of the movie where they don't have anything to say so they have Depp riding in a car, walking up to a house, usually that's all context, here it's just stretching the movie out so that the length of it, around two hours, will obscure that not much is going on. It's rather unusual for a movie to be bland and empty when the plot itself is incredibly complex and rich. But a movie about books is tough, books are for reading and making a movie about them is quite a task. The central question of what this book, the central plot device of the movie, actually says is not answered.In fact at one point Depp is asked "What are you looking for?" and he answers: "I'm not quite sure." That encapsulates the movie.Problem is it's not answered at the end. So you have a question out there, lingering.Still it's an unusual movie, and though overlong for what we get, it could have been longer if it had decided to fill out the plot. I tend to think it was designed to be Omen-esquire, but it doesn't quite get there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a welcome change when I saw this movie in for the first time. Roman Polanski is a gifted filmmaker to say the least, but his sexual exploits exhiled him to Europe and turned an icon into a nobody. However, The Ninth Gate provided some escape.Johnny Depp played a role which seemed meant only for him, considering the moribound nature of the character's demeanor. The cinematography was very good, and the deep, baroque soundtrack really brought some atmosphere. In a way, it did the same thing for books what Pi did for math: make it more interesting than it naturally appears to be. A solid film to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title "The Nine Gates".The number `Nine' also is part of Dante's The Divine Comedy and the journey through the Nine circles of hell.Corso(Johnny Depp) Itinerary is similar of the Italian Poet but with a sustancial difference.The knowledge progression of the sin helped Dante to free himself from it.Meanwhile Corso own Destiny Overwhelmed him:The contact with Evil.The figure of "The Girl" is like a false Virgilio.Our Protagonist shares the same age with the Florentine Poet and the idea of "The nine Gates" it is similar to bible passages like this:' In the Tranquility of my days I will walk to the Doors of the sun'.It reminds us the beginning and the ending of the movie.I also find interesting that A BOOK is a key protagonist in this film,as the Ring was for Lord of the Ring; or the Forbidden Book who intrigued us in The NAME OF THE ROSE.Also The Ninth Gate in some scenes works as a parody.Especially the scene of the Satanist Sect,this is a Satire that tells us that The Evil is not behind this eccentric celebration, the evil it is a more complex than that.All of Polanski Protagonists(Catherine Deneuve in Repulsion; Jack Nicholson in Chinatown;Mia Farrow in Rosemary's Baby and Polanski himself in The Tenant) are anti-heroes or Unconscious propagator of Evil.Their stories progress negatively to the point of Resignation."They do without Knowing".They seem dominated by forces beyond their control.Note: Spoilers!.Corso,is not about to let his chance at immortality slip away.Driving,hitching rides and walking,he makes his way to Balkan's ancient stone castle,where the publisher is preparing to deliver his soul to the devil.The two man battle for control of The Nine Gates,but neither one knows that the set of engravings contains one forgery,rendering any attempt to pass through The Ninth Gate doomed. Ultimately it is THE GIRL,revealed at last as an agent of the devil,who decides wether the secrets of The Nine Gates will be unlocked and to whom.'(extract from TNG site)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very well done movie, that treats what has become a cliche subject matter with classic Polanski originality and care. This is one of those "freaky" movies that even the very smart and cynical can enjoy, because it doesn't leave plot and dialog gaps at all the usual places. I wrote a review because I was shocked by how underrated it is in the IMDB. Don't be deterred by the whines of the kiddies who would have preferred chainsaws, axes and monsters. Polanski doesn't need squirting blood and "glowing red eyes" to generate a chilling effect. If YOU need it, then stay away from good movies like this one. Otherwise, take a look.</fullReview>

There was no feeling of tension that a thriller should convey. This movie was more like a Drama, a well paced but boring drama.I watched the film a second time to see if there was perhaps something I missed that was more subtle, but I couldn't see anything more.Though the acting was well done, the plot and intrigue were stale.This is a movie that when finished you will sit wondering why you watched it, no message was really conveyed, other than perhaps, Seek and Ye shall find.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading a good portion of the comments here, I feel that a number of people didn't "get" this film or they were disappointed with the lack of an ending that would answer all the questions one might have.One thing I think most people missed is that Corso indeed follows the path of the engravings through the movie probably without being aware of it (which Richard Champalbert pointed out in a previous post). I thought this was pretty clever of Polanski because it might not occur to the audience unless they were paying close attention.Just because a film doesn't spell out all the details for you doesn't make it bad. It is the style and mystery of this movie that makes it so appealing.On a side note, I never cared for Depp much before this movie, but health reasons aside, he has mastered the art of smoking on screen. I don't know of any other contemporary actors that can do a better job.</fullReview>

After boring us for two hours with monotonous drivel lifted out of other like films, the "climax" is not a climax at all, but rather a finishing of pure contempt for the audience: in essence, there was no point to the film in the first place, because what DID happen was what we were PRESUMING would happen. Silly, mindless, stupid and unoriginal...gets 5/10 for the "woman".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World of Books meets the Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without being active into the World of Evil (I'll take God anytime, thank you) I was very gladly impressed by this movie. This is the story of a rare book specialist who becomes both entangled and fascinated in his search of the Devil. Johnny Depp stars as Dean Corso. He is subcontracted by publisher mogul Boris Balkan - played here by none other than terrorific Frank Langella. Balkan sends Corso off to Europe with an unusual task: to compare his own copy of "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows" (a manuscript that has the particular quality of summoning the Devil) with the only two others in existence. And so the game begins.I never even considered Johnny Depp as a good actor, but I was obviously mistaken, to the point where he's much improved. From the very first scenes Depp shows us just how much in command of his acting he is - as much as any good actor can possibly be. Frank Langella is nothing short of genial in his role of the calculating magnate. Lena Olin plays the part of a consumate "dishy" - as Corso puts it -, rich widow who desperately wants to get her own hands on Corso's copy of the sacrosanct book, a copy that used to belong to her husband, who hanged himself not too long ago.So glad this is not a typical Hollywood movie. Johnny Depp aside, it is a Franco-Spanish production with local actors and sites, filmed totally in Europe. I loved the idea of the world of antique books as background for the story. Since I have a passion for book collecting, it was mother's milk to me. Just for that, the film will appeal to collectors worldwide. The leather bindings, the paper, the fantastic engravings... it makes one's mouth water. Moreover, there is superb acting from Depp , Langella and fellow actress Barbara Jefford and a rich baroness; but every single role is extremely well personified, so kudos in numbers go to the casting director. The erotic scene of the castle in flames has to be one of the most impressive ones I've seen in cinema lately, and it will stay in your mind for a while, not because of what is shown but because of what is not. Typical of Polanski, his actual wife (Emannuelle Seigner) has a significant part too, but I won't tell, so you'll have to watch the movie. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a solid thriller about a greedy and cutthroat rare book dealer going after a rare tome that has the power to call up Satan. There are some pieces that might not make sense but that really doesn't take away from the film. What makes the movie is the performances and the main plot. Johnny Depp made a good move when he accepted the role of Dean Corso. Lena Olin and Frank Langella did well as the two people who tried to play Corso at every chace they had. Emmanuelle Seigner was a surprise as "The Girl". Many people who watch this movie will ask what her significance in the movie was. I think I have figured it out but I won't reveal that. Roman Polanski did well in making an exceptional work about satanism even though it wasn't as good as "Rosemary's Baby." Overall, this is an underrrated film and one of Roman Polanski's better directing efforts. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hired by a suspicious New York City millionaire, Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) to find and examine the other two versions of the same cult-like novel for any signs of forgery. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), a so-called "book detective" heads off to Spain, Portugal, and France to locate the books and study each one's authentic views very closely. What Corso finds is certainly more than he imagined as he meets a stranger known as "The Girl" (Emmanuelle Seigner) and a determined widow (Lena Olin), whose motive to get her husband's book back from Balkan anyway she can.Director Roman Polanski ("Chinatown", "Rosemary's Baby") makes this film seem easy to understand, applies great camera work, and the pace moves steadily thanks in part to a good story which Polanski took in part as well. Depp is fine as he usual is and so is Langella, but Seigner surprised me with an excellent performance. Whenever Seigner's character appears, something exciting happens and to me, she's the driving force here. It's a lavishing and sharp-minded thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once this film establishes its tone, you begin to forgive it for its somewhat silly premise.I found it impossible not to think of Hitchcock. In particular, "The Trouble With Harry." There is plenty of morbid fascination in the Hitchcock tradition. The score sometimes contradicts the expected mood for a given scene. Like in a Hitchcock film, this reminds you of your own morbid fascination, your ability to be entertained by death and peril.Depp is perfect. He plays a supremely confident intellectual, or intellectual wannabe. He is either a fraud or a genius in his line of work: finding, authenticating and collecting rare books. The character is akin to Jake Gittes (Jack Nicholson) in "Chinatown" in its consistent portrayal of a questionable character who stumbles through the plot for perhaps the wrong reasons. And it is as brilliantly performed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING - MANY SPOILERS - SKIP IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEMFirst - This movie has the same flaw as all "pact with the devil" movies. Why are these people so eager to contact the devil? I'm not religious but at least I understand the motivation of religious people - they assume their devotion will get them into Heaven. People who make a pact with Satan have to assume they'll wind up in Hell - tough to see an upside. And most of the people in this movie are already rich enough to do whatever they want. Who needs Satan? Besides they were all so evil that could be assumed to be hellbound without any help.Now the spoilers - I hope this is enough space. This movie is filled with bits and pieces that go nowhere and are never explained. Why did the guy at the beginning commit suicide? What was in the note? It was never mentioned again. If the book was so important to his wife, why was it sitting on his shelf where he could dispose of it? Who killed the bookseller in NYC? Not Balkan - it was his book. Ms Telfer? Maybe, but she didn't get the book, so why kill the guy and leave? I'm sure he would have been glad to tell her where it was, under torture if necessary. "The Girl" - if so, why? What was with the Baroness's missing hand?People are killed all through this movie, but you wouldn't know it. Shouldn't Depp be wanted on two continents?The main problem, of course, "the girl". Supernatural? Sure. Satanic? Probably. But to what end? If she's the devil, what's in the book business for her? Depp's soul? As I said above, he was digging his way to Hell to begin with. Balkan apparently wanted to be fireproof, which could have its advantages if you're making a pact with Satan, but what else was the movie about?Did the twin booksellers exist? Was it just a coincidence that they looked like the figure in the engraving Depp noticed right afterward? What was the ending about? Who hid the last engraving? What was going on? I'm sorry, I don't get it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apparently a previous reviewer can offer insight into the ending of this film. Personally - Im sceptical of this. A film should be able to stand on it's own two feet without the need for voice over explanations or of leafing through pages of internet critique.Okay, so the film had atmosphere - and looked good. Sadly - it also had one of the most shockingly dreadful endings of any film Ive seen. It made the ending of 'North by North West' seem satifying and substantial by comparison - and I never thought I'd say that (sorry Hitch!). Alot of the comments here alude to this - although I think my fellow contributors have been much, much too kind.Some might describe this film as 'enigmatic'. Enigmatic is a word that often gets used to describe things that are just too intellectual for us normal grubs to comprehend. It suggests a movie that lives on in the mind well after it has finished. The trouble with the Ninth Gate is that no one did actually ever 'finish' this one.I can see it now, on the set and the director casually glances at his watch.... - 'Oh my goodness - is this the last day of shooting ??!', Quick, light a bonfire in the castle and get the main character to walk in........Phew, that was close...'Ultimately - this one will leave you extremely cross. The ending is perfunctory and inexplicable (and that's me being kind now..). The plot centres round a puzzle that has defied a solution for centuries - it get's solved (possibly!?) - but at no point is this answer shared with us.On the DVD Polanski voice-over he mentions that the book contained a second plot, but that for the sake of clarity he decided to omit it. Huh! You lost the plot alright, Polanski.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja Vu?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Polanski is obviously a seasoned movie maker, as this, his latest offering proves. One thing I couldn't help but notice, was the similarities with this film, and one he made 33 years previously, namely "Fearless Vampire Killers, The". Libraries, and castles seem to feature prominently in both; as do spiral staircases, old men with bushy grey moustaches, fires being started by throwing an oil lamp on the floor, and our two heroes infiltrating a get-together of vampires/devil-worshippers towards the end of the film, disguised as one of them.The one thing I couldn't get my head around, was - how one Earth does "the girl" (E. Seigner) manage to float about during fights etc. - that was never explained. Some people have compared this film to a very long episode of "Scooby Doo", which is a little unfair, as I prefer to think in terms of a cross between "Chinatown" and "Rosemary's Baby".Having said that, the photography, particularly the scenes in the garden of the Portugese book collector, is beautifully done; and the scene where Boris Balkan sets himself alight is particularly eiree, and sickenningly portrayed.Definitely worth watching, very stylishly filmed (to a greater extent than "Omen, The"), with (and here's the final similarity) a beautifully haunting score by a Polish composer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining but flawed thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate is worth a look and has a lot of interesting effects, building suspense slowly. The story line itself is what is captivating, and it is a terrific vehicle for Depp. Flaws surface with Depp's character, though, because at times he seems completely callous and uncaring about both his clients, his contacts, and even the supernatural nature of his mission, and at other times, he seems keenly interested, right up to the ending that offers no reason why he ends up where he does, other than perhaps to solve the puzzle once and for all.Emmanuelle Seigner's role as "The Girl" seems to change directions and it is never explained, even out of hand, what motivates her actions. Is she angel or demon? Are we to ask if there is a difference? The pacing of the film is slow at times -- unnecessarily so -- but it seems to pick up just as it begins to drag. I could imagine a much more compacted film with many more elements in the over-two-hour movie that would have made it more of a real thriller. Worth seeing, but could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER (sort of...)I first saw this movie last night (5/30/2001), and was mystified by Seigner's character. After reading most of the reviews by other IMDb members, I saw (to my surprise) that I was not alone in my frustration. Most of the other reviewers who mentioned Seigner also claimed to have no idea who or what this character was either.Then I read diana-51's review from 10 April 2000, and it all became clear. Even the last couple of scenes (which I had thought were stupid) began to make sense.I won't steal any of Diana's thunder by repeating or attempting to reword what she has said. If any of you are still trying to figure out Seigner's character, I urge you to read diana-51's review.Thanks for clearing it up, Diana!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations of Ninth Gate were a little too high, as I selected this movie based on who directed it. From the beginning, this movie lacked a heart. The character played by Johnny Depp was insufficiently developed. At times he was placed in comical situations, which was at odds with the subject matter. I was never sure what was the focus of the movie: was it the characters and their morals and beliefs, and was I supposed to be scared? Overall, this is a movie that I'm glad I didn't pay to see on the big screen. Don't expect any great depth or feeling in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A promise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard about this movie, a thought it was a promising title and storyline. I like old books, I like intertextuality, I like theories about god and the devil and I like (medieval) mysticism - so this should be a movie for me. When I read the backside of the videobox I was assured of that once more and because my girlfriend does not like this kind of movie I rented it this night to watch it on my own in a lonely setting (which contributed to the atmosphere of the movie). I must say that I am a fan of Johnny Depp for some time now. Mainly because I like the kind of roles he plays and this movie is no exception to that. I was surprised by Emmanuele Seigner because I had not yet heard of her, and now I think that is a terrible waste of my time. I also liked the scenes in the movies from dusty Spanish towns to medieval castles of gothic architecture. And I certainly liked the music of Kilar. But at some points of the movie I could just cry. The movie seemed to be directed by an amateur if you watch the errors, mistakes and the cheap montage. Also the appearing of some satanic, sexual order was a kind of disillusioning part of the movie. But afterall I have to say that I enjoyed the movie and will give it 8 out of 10, I think Ms. Seigner is the promise I took the movie for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*** Little payoff but intriguing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest piece by Roman Polanski doesn't quite pay off in the end as well as it should, but it's a fascinating thriller all the same. Johnny Depp is terrific in the lead role as an antiques appraiser who is given the ride of his life when he's asked to investigate the whereabouts of a book that was supposedly written the devil himself. Along the way he finds himself constantly being followed by a supernaturally gifted woman (Emmanuelle Seigner, way better here than in Polanski's Bitter Moon) and an obsessed lady with dark purposes (the always-gorgeous Lena Olin). Polanski fared much better in the Satanic subject with Rosemary's Baby thirty years earlier, but the beautiful production design and constantly tightening plot here make it well worth a look.</fullReview>

It is done with the style &amp; panache that makes you pay attention to each scene &amp; listen to each line of dialogue, in the same way we watched an Alfred Hitchcock film. Johnny Depp is a book detective &amp; we follow him in his search for copies of this book. There is very little action &amp; next to no special effects,that has ruined so many films of this type.

		<fullReview>This supernatural tale of intrigue set amongst the shady world of arcane book dealing is highly promising for the first two thirds or so and really has you puzzling over identities and motives. Unfortunately it seriously loses it's way at the end and leaves you with a frustrated sense of disappointment that you were cheated out of seeing a really good movie.The dependably spooky Johnny Depp is the book expert hired to investigate the rumour that of the three remaining copies of the much sought after 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows', only one is genuine and reputed to have been scribbled down by Lucifer himself. Several groups want this book and soon Depp is surrounded by shady millionaires who would stop at nothing to complete their collection or perhaps have more sinister designs for the book.For the most part Roman Polanski's globe trotting jaunt is great. It has a pleasantly old school feel to it, mixed with cosmopolitan European stylings. It's not as serious as you might think and has many wickedly amusing moments, along with a frequently mischievous score. It's great fun following the various scrapes and characters encountered, with a delightfully convoluted plot.Unfortunately the ending is awful, despite being adapted from a novel I'm sure it would have been a good idea to rework it into something entirely more satisfying. What a waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Ninth Gate" suffers from being exactly the sort of movie it should be. It's a supernatural thriller about a book detective who gradually learns the truth of the horrors he is investigating and unleashing. It is not about car chases, Bosch-inspired landscapes, or what evil lurks in Mia Farrow's uterus. There's no slam-bang ending, because none is needed - it's about the journey, not the destination.What's left is an intriguing mystery, great performances, some classic set-pieces (eg when the wheelchair keeps bumping against the wall, the ritual that goes wrong), and *lots* of dark, dry wit (eg the constantly breaking glasses, the EWS parody). "The Ninth Gate" won't convert those who aren't already fans of Polanski, but it is a wonderfully paced and original thriller that received a preposterous amount of drubbing.Highly recommended to anyone who doesn't mind a spiritual noir that has the emphasis on the noir and not the spirits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>that was a very enjoyable experience. The movie got a lot of bad reviews, because it was over the top and took itself too seriously. Much ado about nothing, in a sense. But i don't think this is the case. The movie is very ironic, and works on two different layers. It constently mocks itself (see the scene with the twins); this is very apparent in the (excellent) tongue in cheek performance of jonny depp. You always suspect if this guy is really serious about what he's doing. The "touristic" nature of the movie is also very enjoyable. Depp travels from town to town, country to country, like a librarian Indiana Jones. Roman Polinski is certainly a very special director; one of these directors that are usually misunderstood, or want to be misunderstood, like paul verhoven perhaps. This movie is not going to change the history of cinema, but, who cares anyway? It's still ten times more intersting than the usual stack of nonsense that is thrown at us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Close...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate has been dubbed a thriller, but thankfully the film for the most part does not revert to cliches associated with the genre. Far from a horror movie or thriller, The Ninth Gate is a mystery and an adventure, with the feel of a dark Indiana Jones picture, without the one-liners. Director Roman Polanski comes close to making a great movie, but three quarters of the way into the film The Ninth Gate loses itself, and the audience.Adapted from the novel The Club Dumas by Arturo Pérez-Reverte, The Ninth Gate revolves around Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), a rare book finder who sells his discoveries to the highest bidder. He is contacted by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a wealthy publisher with his own rare book collection, all relating to the Devil. His most precious is titled The Nine Gates, one of only three copies in existence. A legend states the book was co-authored by Satan, and that the nine etchings contained within can conjure up the man himself. Balkan wants Corso to compare his book to the other two copies for authenticity, and to bring the real book back by any means necessary. `Any means necessary sounds illegal', Corso replies wryly. A large cheque quickly convinces him, and Corso heads to Europe. Soon things begin to go awry and death follows Corso wherever he goes, as well as a mysterious woman (Emmanuelle Seigner) who acts as a guardian. Faces of people in the etchings begin to look remarkably like people Corso meets in Europe, adding to the eeriness. (minor spoiler) Upon comparing Balkan's book with the others he notices the etchings are slightly different, and that some are signed LCF (Lucifer). A race for the Devil's etchings ensues, and the power they contain, with Corso in the middle.What is most intriguing about the movie are the books it focuses on. The audience is brought into the world of bibliophiles, collectors of rare books, and soon their passion becomes our own. Scenes of books being removed from shelves, carefully opened, and delicately looked through evoke feelings of mystery and discovery not easily forgotten. Memories of going into attics, tingling with excitement at the hope of some discovery are what The Ninth Gate brings back.The cinematography in the Ninth Gate is amazing, courtesy Darius Khondji. Close-ups of Corso's fingers running across 400 year old pages lets the audience feel them as well. The movie was filmed on location in Spain, France, and Portugal, and scenes at twilight amid castles and the countryside are breathtaking. Even the colors of the film are noticeable; dark, rich shades are prominent and it seems everything is dimmed without being gloomy. Rounding out the look and feel of the picture is Wojciech Kilar's perfectly matched music, setting the mood without being overly menacing.The acting in The Ninth Gate, and the casting, is top notch. Depp really fits the role of Corso, if not from just a physical standpoint. With his librarian glasses, dark clothes, and mustache with goatee, Corso looks both educated and mysterious. As for his acting, Depp begins with a stock character; Corso is a mercenary without conscience and lives for profit no matter who is in his way. Thankfully, throughout the movie Depp adds enough wrinkles to the character to keep the audience confused as to Corso's true intentions. Corso's alcohol intake increases with every scene, and he unravels, forming an obsession surrounding the book rivaling Balkan's. Frank Langella is simply perfect as Balkan. He takes on a character that could easily be done in an over the top fashion, but he remains reserved, creating a complex and frightening character.The pace of the film is a treat, but with a running time of over two hours the Ninth Gate loses its power towards the end. The search for the truth about the book is given time to develop instead of being forced upon the audience, but this doesn't justify the length of the movie. Adding to the problem are the unnecessary twists in the last 30 minutes of the picture. Just when a resolution seems near, a new fold appears, and Corso must follow along. The plot twists simply appear, without letting the audience take part in their development. Finally, when making a film with an epic storyline such as raising the Devil, the director has to decide how far to take the story. The Ninth Gate is foremost about the search, and Polanski leaves the rest to the imagination. This is probably for the best, but the viewer still leaves the theatre feeling a little cheated by the ending.Under any other director but Polanski, The Ninth Gate could have degenerated into standard thriller/horror fare. Instead we are presented with a movie focused on mystery instead of fright. Polanski though can't seem to pull the film together, and near the end the tingly feeling of wonder in the back of the viewer's neck disappears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With so much danger revolving around this mysterious volume of devilish protocol, it's amazing that Johnny Depp's character makes it past the middle of the film , but then if he didn't , there wouldn't be a film right ? And this , as every single person within a fingertip of him comes to an untimely death . But aside from the gaping plot flaws , this film is still watchable because of Depp . While you find yourself rooting for him , you never quite believe in his ethics , and his real motives are always in doubt . Frank Langella's role is deliciously dark at first but dissolves in a befuddling ending sequence where his great mastery of his faculties inexplicably falls apart . There is so much potential in this film that it's hard not to be disappointed at the finished result , and I believe Polanski has tried here to be too thoughtful and mysterious instead of quickening the storyline and expanding the characters which he could have done. It seems to apply to many movies lately but...........oh what could have been! Mjc</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>View it with the right expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed it with wrong expectations. I expected a horror movie. Also didn't pay much attention. So I joyfully waited for Gothic atmosphere and cool monsters. When it had ended, something like "Well, I think I didn't understand this." drifted slowly through my mind. Only one or to days later it dawned on me that I had expected the wrong thing. This is not a horror movie but a movie that tries to make you think. It is about a riddle and it is a riddle itself, full of clues and meanings. Viewed this way, it makes a lot of sense. I found myself thinking about it again and again.To me the main question while I watched was: Who is the girl?SPOILER WARNING *** SPOILERS IN NEXT PARAGRAPHLike it is written in some of the other comments (without spoiler warning though), I think that the girl who appears again and again but refuses to tell her name is Lucifer. With that idea everything seems to fall into place. I don't know much about these things but a quick lock into my etymological dictionary told me that Lucifer means light bringer and is also a name for the planet Venus and that Lucifer is said to be a fallen angel. It is very clear that the girl must be some kind of angel, at least the hero's guardian angel. The only supernatural things which are shown in the film (and with fine, quiet understatement) are done by her and also she seems to be the only one who knows what it is all about. But this is not simply the answer to the riddle but leads to other interesting questions, the most important being: Is Lucifer in truth a good person? Not the devil, the source of all evil, but perhaps only said to be by the church because he has turned his back to god? The girl does never do anything bad in the story and the picture of somebody walking into light is often used for entering into heaven. Or is it all deception to seduce the hero to evil? But then why doesn't the devil reward the bad guy who is willing to worship him? During the hero's final fight with the bad guy the wooden floor breaks under him. He clings helplessly to the rim of the hole, afraid to fall through, and you automatically expect some ghastly pit or a long drop to be underneath. His enemy exults. Then more wood breaks and he falls through but discovers that there is neat and save ground close beneath. There are even stairs and he can easily walk out again from under the wooden ceiling, find his lost gun and overcome his enemy. This is a fine metaphor for what happens to the hero in the whole story. I don't think I'm wrong, it fits to well.END OF SPOILERSWhen I saw The Ninth Gate I thought the story was containing pretty much chliché and implausible elements. But now I think that more of it has a meaning than I first thought. In other comments it is said that the careless handling of the precious books books throughout the movie is some kind of joke. That is probably true. It is so obvious, it must be intentional. I could say much more but I won't because this comment has already gotten pretty long.If you like to watch a movie that gives you something to think about and perhaps discuss it with some friends afterwards, this is a good choice. My rating is 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed by admirable work by Polanski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate, Roman Polanski's first film since the highly satisfying Death and the Maiden, starts off innocently enough. Corso (Johnny Depp) is a detective of sorts. His job is to track down rare volumes of books for his clients. Boris Balkan, played by weirdo-loving Frank Langella, hires Corso to prove the authenticity of his most prized possession: the presumably satanically-inspired The Ninth Gate.Corso is off to Paris to track down the two other copies of the book, finding them in the hands of two famous book collectors. He soon discovers that all copies are indeed authentic, and with careful investigation he comes to realize that each book has unique characteristics that were specifically designed by the devil. All of the books are needed in order to bring about the resurrection of Satan.Things begin to go a little sour for our boy Corso when the tomes go missing or are all but destroyed, and with the help of his `guardian angel' (played boringly by Emmanuelle Seigner) he manages to get himself out of a bunch of devilish situations.About halfway through The Ninth Gate it becomes rather obvious where it is going. Someone will eventually stumble across all of the needed pages from the book and will manage to figure out the chant to utter to bring about the revival of the Prince of Darkness. Polanski was surely aware of that and chooses to make the journey to the inevitable end as pleasant, if that is the correct term, as possible.Polanski has always been one of my favorite directors. With the possible exception of Maiden and Macbeth, he tends to find a rather crass humorous element seething inside of his characters and chooses to amplify those elements to an oftentimes delicious comic effect. The Ninth Gate is no exception.It seems rather odd that Corso would try to make an effort to be more meticulous in the way he handles his books. With books these old, Corso never finds it objectionable to flip through them madly or have ashes from his cigarettes fall on them. Polanski knows this all to well and at one point has his Baroness Kessler (Barbara Jefford) admonish the quietly rebellious Corso for his careless ways.Rosemary's Baby worked effectively because Polanski is very much attuned to the perversities that run under the skins of his characters, oftentimes presenting their eccentric behaviors in a creepy, matter-of-fact manner. We suspect the evil in his characters and he rarely lets us down. Sure, the surprise may not be as strong, but Polanski is more concerned with journeys than with end results.The Ninth Gate moves at a very steady pace. A huge part of the film focuses on Corso's searching for the rare books and, as expected, the journey is not as fast-paced as one might find in your average action-vehicle. Still, the gorgeous cinematography of Darius Khondji and the nonchalant direction of Polanski create an atmosphere so stunning that we relish every situation in which our protagonist is placed. Certainly not as deadpan as Fearless Vampire Killers, Polanski still manages to interject his trademark elements of humor into this film. The Ninth Gate is not a grand affair by any means of the imagination. It has no profound comments to make about life or death and it is sorely lacking in character development, but the journey to the rather opaque (yet unsurprising) ending is one that is full of a highly stylized camp that one can't help but sit back and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Depp classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest this film was unheard of over here in the UK, i only heard of it due to being a fan of johnny depps acting skills, which is a shame because this came out along side terrible films such as the Perfect storm and Mission Impossible 2 (enough said). This film did not dissapoint. Johnny Depp is a Dirty Book valuer who investigates into the values and the authenticity of books. He is hired by a sly client who wishes depp to investigate into the authenticity of his so called "Nine gates" book. This means Depp having to goto the location of the other 2 known nine gate books, which are located in Spain and France to compare there appearancs.From the start of his journey to the very end there is murder, betrayal, suspense and a hint of supernatural goings on that seem to get in Depps way. There is nothing really new here in this kind of film, but its the way the film developes through the aid of some Polanski magic that makes it a class apart from most supernatural thrillers. Johnny Depp as per usual is on top form and captures the screen throughout the hour and a half of this movie.9/10 - go rent this now!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent enough to watch twice now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just seen the movie a second time, and I must admit that it was a thought-provoking (although not overly-so) film. It had some elements of the occult, enough to add to mysticism to this mundane world of ours. Johnny Depp's performance was excellent.The movie is over 2 hrs long, yet it seemed as though they just rushed over everything. It left me wondering what had happened, especially the ending (although I would not expect a sequel). For example, who exactly is the girl? A demon? An angel? The devil? Sure she's associated with Johnny's task, but to what degree? One cannot exactly tell based upon the engraving shown to us.In some respects, I found that this movie and "In the Mouth of Madness" share some common roots, although the two movies are still quite different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first 60% of this was good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second 40% was stupid. I'll elaborate: The scene that opened before the credits was well done. (If you've seen the movie you'll remember, the camera work was simple and it really told a story.) Then we're introduced into Johnny Depp's character as a NYC rare book dealer with no morals. We're introduced to Frank Langella, a shady book collector who wants Depp to investigate a 400-year old book said to be written by satan. And that's when the mystery begins. (and it does get interesting) The last 40% of the movie got confusing, became inane, and unintentionally laughable. I'm not going to give away what happens, but we figure out that everyone wants to get supernatural powers from the book, so much so that everyone is fighting over it. You finally understand Depp's intentions at the finale, but the last scenes were too overdone to be taken seriously. The positives and negatives are perfectly balanced, so you'll have to watch it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a really disappointing occult movie in spite of good acting by Depp and Seigner. The plot - the search of the three copies of a book called "Ninth Gate" - has good prospects in the beginning but runs through a predictable line of murders and mysterious incidents. Balkans final intention is also transparently predictable quite early in the plot. Balkans end due to 'an error' in the copies is a damp squib - one expects a climatic encounter at this stage! The ending is very vague and we are made to believe (??) that Depp's guardian angel played by Seigner is the "whore of babylon" who lets finally lets him in through the Ninth Gate to the Prince of Darkness (ironically the Ninth Gate is shown as a blindingly bright place!!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt that this film was complex and attractive enough to warrant purchase for repeated viewing. I enjoy action-packed thrillers also, but found The Ninth Gate to be engrossing ... perhaps the love of old books moved me. My chief disappointment was Polanski's commentary; he bumbled along endlessly about the cast and working with actors, filming techniques and locations, but had almost nothing to say about the plot. I don't watch tons of films, so I always view each in naive innocence, clueless as to what to expect next, therefore sometimes I "just don't get it", but then I enjoy films more this way. I plan on reading the book to get a better perspective on the story and ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting this all into prospective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh dear! We seem to have some very differing views here with no relation to movie or general intellect. I think that expectations are the cause of most peoples problem with this movie. This is either because we have a high regard for Polanski or Depp or it could be the hope that in an industry starved of good supernatural thrillers we had hoped this one would go a little way to rectifying this.So what went wrong? For those veteran movie fans out there Polanski is probably one of the five leading directors of all time, up there with the likes of Hitchcock, Kubrick, Coppola, and Lean. I am sure many of you will argue this with choices of your own but you cannot argue with classics such as Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby, Tess, Repulsion, Macbeth, and a whole bunch of minor classics as well. Polanski is a victim of his own success and this being possibly his worst movie to date has left a lot of die hard fans a little disappointed and the rest wondering what all the fuss is about. Having said this, the ending is responsible for a lot of this and I can't help but wonder if the cutting room floor is responsible for what seems like a rushed finish to the film. All the hallmarks of Polanski however are here... awkwardness, unease, subtlety, unpredictability (only by watching the majority of his other films will you know what I mean by this) three dimensional characters, great score, lavishly designed sets and locations. If the ending had been better this would be a minor classic.Depp gives his usual trademark performance but nothing can save the disappointing end.For those of you who are under the age of thirty, you will only know the formula for a modern day thriller which creates pace and mystery through quick Camera shots disguising a shallow thrill by showing as little of the scene as possible through a series of micro flashes. The thrilling parts of real life are not like that and Polanski never attempts this cheap trick by modern day editors and directors. Instead he sustains a shot all the way through the scene often from an unusual viewpoint. His thrills come naturally out of a given situation relying on anticipation and the unknown.It is a shame that the DVD for this film marks the only venture so far by Polanski to do a commentary. Maybe he will back track a little with some of his earlier films. I look forward with some hope to a Directors Cut for this film with say an extra half an hour. It must be on that floor somewhere!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a different and enjoyable horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hmmm, I think that this movie was lost on a fair few people out there, which is fair enough as the movie leaves a lot to the viewers imagination.The movie, with its strange characters, situations and locations has a dreamlike quality with a feeling of impending doom not unlike "The Devil's Advocate". You never really see anything satanically connected, but you always know that its there. This in turn makes the movie so haunting. Regardless of what people thought, the ending was the only way the movie could have gone. After only feeling the presence of evil throughout the movie any actual personification would have been disappointing. The ending is left up in the air and left to the viewer's imagination. However, having said this, I must also say that the story is about what Johnny Depps character, Dean Corso, purpose is, and not the end result. We are only meant to see what the discovery of the different books will do, and what it means to Dean Corso, not where it will lead him. One final note, a few of the other comments that I have read indicate a negative feeling to the characters that Corso meets. These characters are all part of Corso's fate as guided by different people, so when it comes down to it they are only there to get him to the inevitable end and really, serve no other purpose. Overall, a different and enjoyable horror movie that I hope will grow on viewers who aren't expecting copious amounts of action and gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Polanski's "Book" of Magical Realism :</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE NINTH GATE (: "of the Kingdom of Shadows") is the famous director's European cinematic adaptation of a wonderful Spanish novel where the Gothic and the Mystery genres are 'interwoven', in a postmodern mode.Arturo Perez-Reverte's EL CLUB DUMAS is definitely NOT to be found in the form of any 'very faithful adaptation' in this French-Spanish co-production, financed by Artisan Films. Polanski's much "more literal" interpretation - just as his own decisions led to the prior unsuccessful rendering of another fine &amp; very "postmodern" award-winning play, so replete with star-studded cast of Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley, in his previous movie : DEATH AND THE MAIDEN - here fails, likewise, to fully satisfy even his most literal-minded target audience. That is, at least, without the much fuller artist's commentary and critical references to the great book it was based on; which the director wisely saw as being quite necessary to provide in his lengthy "Special Features" supplement to the DVD release.What might have saved Polanski's different attempt to conjoin "the supernatural" to the "romanticism" of "the detective story," and thus to avoid the widely reported audience-disappointing 'abrupt ending' - that is, of course, without actually remaining more faithful to the postmodernist/post-metaphysical ironies of the novel, which just "sort of dissolves," as he puts it - would surely have been to retain at least one element from those so "complex and convoluted," "very erudite," "two main plots and many subplots," in his own "kind of a fairy tale for adults." The element in question being, Perez-Reverte's subtle references to a French medieval novella, THE DEVIL IN LOVE !Given that Roman is presumably "in love" with his (the) "Girl" (wife, Emmanuelle Seigner), who is, after all, "the Devil" of both film and book ("or at least His messenger"), this editorial / directorial omission proves to be a great disservice to himself, even within the limited and limiting context of his de-postmodernizing of the ironic ambiguity of the fine novel.Critically, perhaps something central to the media-philosophical nature of cinema ?!? The so-called "Latin" genre of "magical realism" in Literature might provide texts that are, as Polanski says, "unadaptable" to film, up until now !But this single lapse in Polanski's otherwise sharp sense of "irony" and his, at least partial, careful attention to about one half of the "book" (in his "movie about a book") is very unfortunate indeed !-- TheFilmGuru</fullReview>

Ninth Gate looks nice and has a certain amount of style, but weakish acting and very predictable plot drag it down into boredom. My video store categorized it as Horror, IMDB as a thriller, but it really has none of the qualities that either of these genres need. Perhaps Polanski assumed that a satanic theme would have the same impact it had back in 1968 with Rosemary's Baby. It doesn't. Picks up a bit towards the end which I rather liked although I could see it frustrating most people. On the whole, unless you are a rabid Johnny Depp fan, I'd give it a miss.</fullReview>

To an end that leaves the viewer confused, disappointed, and--after investing 2 plus hours in what was an intriguing movie--angry. It's as if the screenplay writer didn't know how to write the ending, so he just concocted some symbolic mind-twist that was neither clever, nor ironic, nor satisfying. And I absolutely reject the notion that, if only the viewer were a deeper thinker, then it would all make sense. Nonsense! Socrates, Aristotle and Plato or their modern movie-going equivalents couldn't have made sense of the way the film ended. Perhaps if you majored in Luciferic studies at Satan State University, perhaps--perhaps--you'd "get" what happened at the end of the Ninth Gate--but I doubt it. If Satan himself watched this movie, even he would walk away scratching his horns, and ask, "What the heck happened during the last two minutes?" Watch this movie if you like disappointments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate is an intense, exciting &amp; well-acted thriller with great direction and cinematography. The story concerns a man named Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who collects books relating to Satan. He hires Dean Corso (Johnny Depp in another great performance), a rare book dealer, to track down copies of the book "Nine Gates of The Shadow Kingdom". 3 are known to exist: Balkan's and 2 others owned by collectors in Europe. He wants Corso to seek them out and compare them to see which, if any, are authentic. The book is said to have the power to conjure Satan. As Corso goes about his mission, the movie engrosses you with its suspenseful and spooky story and the beautiful European scenery. Lena Olin plays a woman whose husband owned a copy of the book, which he sold to Balkan before commiting suicide in the film's opening scene. She is trying desperately to get it back. Emmanuelle Seigner, director Roman Polanski's striking wife, appears from time to time to aid Corso and saves his life several times. I don't want to give too much away, but I was truly stunned reading comments on this film by how few people really understood it. I thought it was easy to follow and by the end, we knew, at least I did, what was going on and what the Seigner character's purpose in the film was. The final scene has been roundly criticized on here. I thought it was a great ending. I had never seen a Polanski film before, but now I plan to see some of his others, like Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown which I've never seen but heard alot about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, if you haven't yet seen the film, go read "The Club Dumas" by Arturo Perez-Reverte first. The book is a terrific read that really shouldn't be spoiled by watching the film.That said, the film does seem to try to be a faithful adaptation of the book, and I rented it just to see how Polanski would realize it visually. For the most part, he made sensible decisions about how to streamline the story for the screen. And having been to Europe, I must say that watching the film really gave me serious flashbacks; the guy certainly knows how to put you in a crowded Paris street, or on a back road in the middle of nowhere in Spain. "The girl" (Polanski's wife!! u b*****d!!) is absolutely perfect for the job, although I do wish more of the conversations between her and Corso (Johnny Depp's character) had been included as they give the premise a bit more substance and were some of the most interesting parts of the story. Without reading the novel, I think most viewers will feel the movie ends unexpectedly and inexplicably.</fullReview>

Blatant shots of supernatural elements (such as The Girl floating around and kicking people...) that just weren't ever explained. It's not so bad to tell a story with no closure at the end except when you spend too much time filling the screen with unexplainable elements. For the movie's length and pace, and for it's subject matter, I simply felt that the audience deserved more from the conclusion.

		<fullReview>A film that broods right up to its conclusion and yet throws it away with a terrible ending. In fact, the problem is that the ending is so understated and anti-climatic after a long slog through a slow moving and ultimately fairly pointless tale. I adore horror (of the classic variety) and Polanski but this film really does miss some final revelation to make it more than just good. The ends are not wrapped up, the ending does not call for imagination, there is less here than meets the eye. A film that seems to be full of meaningless portentious detail and imagery, in fact isn't. It plays like a studious RACE WITH THE DEVIL without the ending. The most shocking thing about the film is you come away thinking how dull it all was and what a waste it was. For Polanski, that is an astounding reaction to one of his films and you get the feeling the makers and studios knew this before it came out. Thinking about it, my goodness, it's like a modern version of Hammer's generally woeful and similarly anticlimatic TO THE DEVIL A DAUGHTER. That film put the final nail in their coffin, I get the feeling it won't help Polanskli either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Polanski film, until...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I had bragged to my wife about Polanski and his work. I also explained why he is now in Europe instead of living in America. These points figure in my review of this film.The Ninth Gate is a typical Polanski film, full of "cloak and dagger" twists and turns that the director is famous for. There are scenes reminiscent of Hitchcock, as in when Corso, played by Johnny Depp (in another fine performance), finds himself in whenever someone turns up dead, reminds me of Gary Cooper or James Stewart. They're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Except that Corso chose to be entangled in the situation.The "blue screen" effects that everyone seems to be talking about, especially the New York shots, stem from the fact that Polanski can't enter the US without being arrested, hence he can't film here and resorts to stock footage of New York as his backdrop. Yes, this does cheapen the car scenes, but also pays homage to Hitchcock, in a way.The first scene that gives you a sense of the supernatural is when Corso is being beaten by the black man with blond hair (you don't know his association at this time, he is just following Corso). Suddenly, in a creepy, but cheap shot, the woman, who seems to be wherever Corso is, floats down the steps of the river enbankment (I had to rewind this shot because I had to make sure I wasn't seeing things). She then proceeds to Bruce Lee this unknown black man. From that moment, you know she is more than just a pretty face.I was hooked into this movie until...let's say it all together now...the final scene! I saw the credits come on the screen and said out loud, "WTF?!"I promptly apologized to my wife for making her sit through this film. Thanks for the letdown, Roman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a clever movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Depp's superior acting truly makes this movie interesting throughout the first 95% of its length. The plot, although very simplistic, was intriguing. The repetitive, yet excellent choice of music kept me on the edge while watching, wondering exactly what would occur next and who Corso would meet. Camera shots and scenery are top-notch and make the movie a pleasure to see.Despite the exceptional acting, wonderful dialogue, and fairly gripping plot, the movie falls short of clever. The first drawback is both a blessing and curse to the movie. The mysterious girl adds a twist to the movie and is intriguing. Unfortunately, at the end of the movie, her role is still difficult to determine. Who was she? Why was she there? The most painful part of the movie was the end (most people seem to agree). The absolute lack of closure of the movie is not appropriate for a mystery movie of this sort. Perhaps the end of the movie is a reference to a Bible passage or an obscure medieval story, but I sure missed the point of it.I give the movie 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski is back to his dirty old tricks...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally caught this film at the Melbourne International Film Festival. It has been quite a wait - and the size of the audience (I had to queue for over 30 mins) was impressive. Beautifully realised, The Ninth Gate is a return to Polanski's dirty old tricks of brooding horror and suspense with considerable 'tongue-in-cheekery'. It has a haunting opening sequence and the journey is rewarding all the way to the very end. This is the film that Kubrick tried to make with 'Eyes Wide Shut' but (in my opinion didn't quite succeed). Where Kubrick failed, Polanski shines with the help of a fine cast (Depp expert as usual), haunting score &amp; production design and smashing cinematography. The comparisons to Rosmary's Baby will be numerous (but unfair). This film is a real treat for the devil in everyone, but especially Polanski fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski pays homage to Hitchcock and Kubrick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Polanski's "The Ninth Gate" portrays Johnny Depp as a greedy book investigator who may be getting more than he bargained for with one particular obsessive client. Polanski pays homage to Hitchcock's "Marnie" and Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut" with two darkly comic scenes. The Hitchcock take occurs during the scene of the secretary's lunch-break (I know I had seen that tongue before). The nod to Kubrick may be a bit of a stretch since "The Ninth Gate" was released so shortly after "Eyes", but it involves a cultish orgy-like scene. Both "Marnie" and "Eyes" are films involving men who are driven by their own sense of guilt and are attempting to absolve themselves from that feeling, unlike Johnny Depp's character who seems to pride himself on his mercenary skills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screenplay not "in the spirit" of or true to book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently read all of Arturo Perez-Reverte's novels in English I was of the opinion that they would all make great movies...until I saw "The Ninth Gate".While Polansky masterfully sets a the appropriate mood at the beginning, the plot is so gutted that it leaves only an absurd ending.Depp's Corso is actually quite good and effectively filmed.The poor choice of Lena Olin(Liana Taillefer) is only balanced be the omission of much of her character's action in the book.The other cast members, including the director's wife, are well suited to their roles.The screenplay, however, reverts to flames and pentangles a la Vincent price rather than attempt to deal with the intermingling of plots in the novel. The book has Corso running down copies of "The Ninth Gate" and unraveling a web of intrigue involving members of the "Club Dumas" while accompanied by "the Girl"(non other than the Devil) who loves Corso.I mean no slur on Mr. Price. His films on Poe stories were wonderful in their day and few of them have been remade with any improvement. In most Price/Poe films an effort was made to honestly use the Poe titles. The makers of "The Ninth Gate" clearly did not feel they wanted an audience which might have read the book. References to Dumas and "The Three Musketeers" were eliminated in the screenplay.I really would like to see Polansky and the cast have a script that included more of the magic of the novel. Clearly, the directing and acting talent were available, in abundance and mis-used.I can only hope that a better effort is made with Perez-Reverte's other works.I'd love to see Salma Hayek play the female lead in "The Fencing Master".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless film (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scary-sounding plot, intriguing box, Johnny Depp, beautiful supporting actress, a Roman Polanksi film... Sounds like it adds up to an excellent movie right? Wrong. If I had one word to describe this thing, I would use "turd".Johnny Depp's acting reminded me of Brad Pitt in his early years.. flat and fake. In all honesty, you don't really know who anyone actually is in this movie. No one's motives are ever explained, thus creating characters that do things for no apparent reason. This creates a false sense of "twist". They're not twists though because what the character is doing isn't actually that unexpected because we don't know who the character even is.To create an analogy, this film turns over a lot of stones, but doesn't look under any of them. Why did the old man kill himself in the beginning? Why did Depp's buddy at the book store get killed? Who killed him and why? Who is "The Girl"? What is she supposed to be? Who is the black guy that chases Depp? What happens to the two old brothers that own the book store? Why is Fargas found dead? Who killed him and why? What is the significance of the engravings in the books? What do they mean/stand for? Why does the Baroness get killed and who kills her? Why does Depp never inform the police, especially with his buddy in the beginning? He wasn't doing anything illegal at that point. What as with that group of people in that Eyes Wide Shut-esque scene near the end? Where did the forged engraving come from? Who forged it and why did the two old brothers have the original? What's with the end? Does Depp becomes obsessed with Satan too? Does he go back with all the proper pages to summon the Devil? These are all questions that never get answered. It makes you wonder why this movie was ever even created in the first place.If you don't like being left out to dry, don't see this. If you don't like crappy movies, don't see this. Actually, just don't see it at all. -3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate isn't Polansky's best (his best being Chinatown) but it's still a very good film. The settings are wonderful, the atmosphere is so strong that I could almost feel an old book smell. Johnny Depp is a talented actor (in Tim Burton's Ed Wood, especially), and he plays his role very well. Everything is mysterious in this film, especially ''The Girl'' (that's how she is credited), whose name is never revealed. The ending was the only deception in this film, and partly because it was the end of this very good film. The story reminds me many other movies, but it's not clear in my head which ones...A rare book dealer named Corso is paid by a collector to prove that his copy of The Nine Gates book is the original one. There are only three copies of this book in the whole world. One of them is in the United states, another one in France and the last one in Spain. But Corso (played by Johnny Depp, by the way) discovers that three parts of each copy are written by the devil himself...and three parts in three books make nine gates...and the ninth gate is the key to see the devil...A good film, especially for the settings...pretty enjoyable...I give it 83%.</fullReview>

The nature of Depp's blond paramour/shadow, clearly somehow supernatural, is never revealed; and Frank Langella would be better off staying on Broadway, rather than tarnishing his reputation with this over-the-top portrayal.

I like the film, and Depp, Olin and Polanski's wife Seigner are all great -- what's up with Depp's intonation though? -- but the film is too long, there are not many films that survives being over two hours long (I'll watch Summer of Sam tonight and to my great disappointment I saw that it was 134 minutes long) and The Ninth Gate certainly doesn't -- it should have been at least half an hour shorter. And at times it gets too close to the ridiculous for it to be comfortable. Well, like I said, it's a good film, but it is seriously flawed. (6/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a masterpiece in modern mystery movies. The movie Is about Dean Corso (Jonnhy Depp) who is a book detective. He values rare books and tracks them as well. One day one of his clients shows him a book that is claimed to be co-written by Satan himself...Corso gets the assignment to find the other two copies of the book (the only copies still existing), and find out wich one of the copies is the real original. The book also claim to have a sort of black magic and has the powers to bring the prince of darkness to earth.Despite appearances, the movie isn't so much about the devil but more about the rarity and mystic of the book. And if you don't stay focused on what's happening you'll never really like this movie. But I did and I think it's really great.But one really bad thing about the movie is the ending. I'm not gonna give it away, but I can tell you that it's one of those figure-it-out-for-yourselves ending. Plus a few other things that made this movie drop a few points.

		<fullReview>I have just seen this film, and to be honest I was very, very impressed. Everything about this film smacks of quality, until the last 5 minutes. Johnny Depp (whom I have always rated very highly) puts in a great performance as the chain-smoking, money-driven book dealer who becomes more and more embroiled in the mystery of the book he is paid to authenticate.Polanski has directed and produced this film masterfully. The locations are rich and well displayed, although I think sometimes computer-enhanced. The camera work is great, the story is great, and there's even a completely gratuitous sex scene to mull over. And, on another note, I thought the title sequence was excellent, and the music absolutely topped the icing with a little cherry.The only complaint I can have about this film has been made before by other people, and I will make it again - the ending is a bit rushed, and doesn't really do the rest of the film justice. I won't spoil it here, but just make sure you judge the film as a whole, and not on a slightly flimsy ending.But overall a great piece of film, both intriguing and intelligent. Also funny, although not in an uproarious manner, more dark humour that perhaps some people won't get. I loved this film, and will certainly be getting it when it comes out to own.</fullReview>

She could have just been a mysterious stranger without the floating down from above kind of nonsense. Second thing was that sometimes the movie was just to predictable. It's a bummer when a perfectly nice movie is spoiled by being not surprising. I would have liked to see more about the satanic tendencies of Balkan (Langella) and Telfer (Olin).

		<fullReview>I saw this film shortly after I had seen Roman Polanski's biography and not long before I became enamored with Johnny Depp as a person and his tremendous ability to really make a movie real.I, too, am surprised the critics didn't complain about this movie. It seems like it would be another one that people would avoid because the critics didn't like, and yet I never heard anything very negative about it. Perhaps the loose ending might bother some people but I think it lets the view draw their own conclusion as to just what Dean Corso does in the end.Lena Olin's character and the "young black man with platinum blond hair" really kept me guessing. Was she an angel? An agent of good? What is the deal with this guy that keeps following Corso? it makes for an excellent mystery.Last, but not least, were some of those one-liner bits of humor. It gave some comic relief to this otherwise ominous movie. Johnny Depp wearing his glasses even though they barely stay on his face after they're broken, the baroness's secretary, the sheep in "voolve's clothing" bit, the TV dinner, and my favorite reply of "I thought I just did." If you've seen the movie, you'll know which part I'm talking about. ;o)All in all, I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy a good thriller or horror or mystery movie or especially if you enjoy Johnny Depp. He really gives slimy, greedy Dean Corso life and he does it with his usual style and sensuality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was certainly a breath of fresh air after so much recent miserable horror fare. It really has more in common with Roman Polanski's films such as Frantic, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown or The Fearless Vampire Killers than with "religious" horror films such as End of Days or Stigmata, it also has more of a tongue-in-cheek tone. The film has the feeling of a good film noir or Hitchcockian thriller that just happens to have a book to summon the devil as it's mcguffin. Good performances all around, particularly from Johnny Depp and Frank Langella, excellent photography by the great Darius Khondji, and a good musical score by Wojciech Kilar. As much as I liked it, I'm not surprised it took a beating from most critics and wasn't a runaway hit, it will probably appeal much more to those familiar with the names Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Mario Bava (and Roman Polanski, of course).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a straight-forward supernatural thriller but rather showcases Polanski in a darkly humourous mood as he plays around with the conventions of this genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Critical and commercial reaction to Roman Polanski's films has always been mixed at best. To say that his films are an acquired taste is an understatement. The Ninth Gate is no exception. Despite what the film's trailer would have you believe, Polanski's film is not a straight-forward supernatural thriller but rather showcases the auteur in a darkly humourous mood as he plays around with the conventions of this genre. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is an unscrupulous book dealer whose motivation is purely for financial gain. He swindles a na?ve couple from a set of rare and priceless books in an amusing scene that sets up his character beautifully. A very rich book collector (Frank Langella) who owns a copy of The Ninth Gate (a book reputedly co-written by Satan) hires Corso to validate the two other existing copies in the world. It seems like a simple enough task but as Corso soon finds out, someone doesn't want him to complete the job. He crosses paths with an odd assortment of characters, from a mysterious woman (Emmanuelle Seigner) who seems to help him in his quest, to another, more obviously evil, woman (Lena Olin) intent on impeding his progress and quite possibly killing him. While this rather standard, cliché-ridden story coupled with slow, deliberate pacing has turned off many, I felt that there was a method to Polanski's madness. The gradual pacing drew me into this engaging world. Perhaps it was the European setting but the film has an otherworldly atmosphere that I really enjoyed. The attention to detail and Darius Khondji's richly textured cinematography is exquisite and contributes a lot the overall mood of this vivid world. However, The Ninth Gate doesn't just have atmosphere going for it. Johnny Depp adds yet another intriguing character to his roster of unconventional roles. Corso is an unethical cheat who would do anything to make a buck. He really doesn't care about others and yet, despite all of his reprehensible qualities, Depp's natural charisma and charm makes him kind of endearing character that you care more about as he delves deeper into dangerous waters. As for the cliché aspects of the film, I was less concerned at anticipating plot twists and predictable elements in favour of simply enjoying the ride. I get the impression that Polanski was aware of this and decided to have fun with them. Balkan's "666" password, Corso's perchance for getting the crap kicked out of him, and the one-armed woman book dealer all contributed to a playful mood that punctuated the film whenever it ran dangerously close to getting pretentious or self-important. The Ninth Gate is a refreshing change from the trend of mundane Hollywood supernatural schlock (i.e. The Bone Collector, Stigmata, End of Days, et al.) that takes itself way too seriously and tries too hard. Unlike those films, The Ninth Gate never falls into that trap. It contains some truly vintage Polanski black humour that, alas, North American audiences don't seem to appreciate. They seem to want meat and potatoes filmmaking, which he has always resisted in favour of subversive thrills and following his own muse come hell or high water.</fullReview>

Albeit a bit over-long, I really was mesmerized by Johnny Depp's convincing portrayal of a sleazy book dealer who is hired by an eccentric occult book collector to find two copies of a same book, supposedly written by a devil worshiper (what else?).The most fascinating about this movie is the camera work and the dialog. The story telling is really well done, one simply is grabbed by the intrigue in which Depp is immersed while searching for the books, and the riddle they seem to form.I give this movie four-and a-half stars, out of five, for the fine performances, the story and the fine direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was very enjoyable to watch. I found myself looking all over the screen to absorb it all. Darius Khondji has another beautiful work to his credit. He can make even the most mundane scenery, such as a European freeway, seem special. When he is given great sets like this film has, the screen comes alive. The story was good and spooky in a fine old way. No horned demons with machineguns in this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I read the book, I was ecstatic - I wolfed it down in one day. Needless to say, I couldn't wait for the movie. To my dismay, just about everything I liked in the original novel was thrown away from the movie. I enjoyed the book for the narrative style and the Dumas references - I am a huge Dumas fan - and as such was disappointed with the film. It wasn't *that* bad, but concentrating on the Satanism aspects of the book made me uncomfortable, it was so old-fashioned. All in all, if you liked the book for the Dumas bits and if devil stories make you yawn, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of the same mediocre voodoo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enough about Polanski this, Polanski that...the Ninth Gate is nothing more than a superficial, entertainingly mediocre horror film. Polanski hasn't made a truly great film going on 35 years now, since his brilliant '60s trilogy of "Knife in the Water," "Repulsion," and "Cul-de-Sac." The vastly overrated borefest of "Chinatown" and the Shock Value success of the Hollywood Hack-Job "Rosemary's Baby" both benefited from starmaking lead performances that made Polanski look like a charm. But as the years went by, the hope of something truly relevant ever again coming out of this guy gradually turned into: "Yeah, right!" The ridiculous "Bitter Moon" should've been the last straw for me, but I still had illusions for the best whenever I re-viewed the classic trilogy. "Death and the Maiden" was a step in the right direction, but the long awaited "Ninth Gate" is once again a slap in the face. Not that I was expecting much, I knew not much was coming. So forget that this guy used to have talent and support the new talent instead. His autobiography "Roman" by Polanski, is actually his best work of the past 20 years. It contains the fabulously detailed, odd perspectives that made his early films great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing effort from Polanski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the first Polanski film I was able to see in a theater, I must say "The Ninth Gate" is a disappointment of sorts. Polanski's masterpiece "Chinatown" is one of my all-time favorite films, while this one is a pale shadow of it. I did like Depp's character and other technical aspects, such as the music, cinematography, and lighting. However, the script is the main problem here, with an excessive length and redundancy present throughout. "Chinatown" had an entertaining story to engage the viewer, while this film seems to be dragging its feet with too many scenes involving Depp investigating the mysterious books. The climax is anticlimatic, although the ending is interesting in an ambiguous way. In other words, for die-hard Polanski fans only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The commercials marketed this movie as a scary, Satanic flick - which it wasn't. The movie, as it turned out, was based on Johnny Depp's character going on a search through Europe for a couple of copies of a certain Satanic book. Along his way, the owners of the book keep dying, and he meets this really strange girl (actually the director's wife). Anyway, the movie dragged on for hours without any climax, and then the credits rolled in. Never once was the audience told the meaning of the Ninth Gate, nor who that strange mystery girl was supposed to be. The only interesting scene involved sex and fire.Overall, very poor development of characters and plot - and enough plug-ins for Shell already!</fullReview>

Frank Langella, his eyes dwarfed behind outsized Ernie Kovacs specs, is the man with the world's biggest collection of books on Satan. So when he sends Depp on a mission to find two rare books on the Devil, you'd think the cagy, rico-suave Depp would at least wonder if...it's not important. What is important is that 1) Depp and Langella give performances of such forty-karat dapperness they deserve a special consolation prize, 2) Polanski and his DP Darius Khondji achieve a level of elegance and eloquence that bears comparison to Hitchcock, 3) the fixation on books, the riffle of their old pages and the ancient engravings therein, is gratifyingly anachronistic, and 4) the movie is slower and sillier than a sugar-sated vanload of seniors on their way back to the home from a night at Baskin-Robbins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It helps to be schooled in metaphysics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate is a film metaphysical at its core. As such, it falls into a very sparsely populated genre; Alejandro Jodorowsky's ?El Topo', released nearly 30 years ago, is arguably the highest and best example of this artform. With Polanski's work, any viewer who does not have a deeper knowledge of Christian symbolism and mysticism, or isn't something more than passingly informed on the root theme broached (Lucifer) will likely find themselves wholly disenchanted ond/or befuddled. And as my statement is proven by the majority of negative and/or puzzled comments here (as well as in the popular press). There are a few in this readership who more or less got the point and savored the experience. Count yourself lucky (if not blessed--which really is what the Ninth Gate is about). You won't get an argument here that films like this don't reliably enjoy much popularity. Therefore, it's somewhat surprising that the powers-that-be who determine theatrical release threw this one into that general cinema miasma; presumably they didn't bother to regard the film much beyond a synopsis which included mention of the Devil and then noted it was from the director of the very popular ?Rosemary's Baby'. So into the fray it went. Regret to report that in the audience I was seated among the ending vocally elicited. if not quite booing, a decided ?uuuhhh' of disappointment from those ticket-payers expecting today's de rigueur denouement of sensory-whacking special effects, and which leave little capacity for subsequent contemplaton or musing. However, this essentially mystical ending was utterly faithful to The Ninth Gate's thematic progress. And--at great risk of insult to those critics who panned this work. and to cite from the Christian Bible--proves the adage ?pearls before swine'. In any case, rather than echo the storyline already amply done, I'll simply make notes not mentioned (and of possible help if anyone gives The Ninth Gate another go-round). First, if sufficiently interested, acquire some information--and beyond the popular conceptions--about Lucifer, Christian mysticism, and Western esoteric sciences such as alchemy and the Tarot; equally important is an understanding of the related symbolism and upon which The Ninth Gate heavily relies. Second, pay closer attention to the faces in the three tomes: if rendered in a rudimentary but befitting wood-cut style, you'll notice that they're the faces of the characters the protagonist encounters. This is important, since the director took pains to render this similarity; its function is to tie the events of the book to the events of the seeker. Third, Balkan, the main engine behind the seeker's endeavors, comes to a very Faustian end, borrowing a great deal from Goethe's poem. Fourth, basically the director and film writers (I've not read the book the The Ninth Gate is based on, although I suspect it was chiefly used as a jumping-off point) are broaching the subject of Saving Grace (as well as the ultimate resolution of Good and Evil). Point being, you should note that all of those actively seeking to bring forth Lucifer only succeed in failing in that quest, while the Innocent (Depp's character) unexpectedly attains this goal. It's an important to know, in the spiritualism beneath many of the great religions, that this State of Grace (aka, Enlightenment) comes in a manner wholly unexpected, or apparently deserved. Fifth, as to the mysterious young woman following the protagonist and who resolves into being akin to a Guardian Angel before finally resolving into the thematic equivalent of Cerberus (to borrow from Roman Mythology), it comes to be understood that only the one free of personal ambition in this quest (puzzle as God Game)--i.e, the guileless--is the one meant to ultimately fathom the meaning of the three tomes once integrated. Did I like The Ninth Gate? Frankly, ?El Topo' was a far more evoking experience for me. I admire Polansky's attempt to raise the esoteric caliber of current cinema, and loved the European settings and tongue-in-cheek score. It was extremely well cast (Depp is something of a miracle among today's US actors). So I'd give this film a ten for effort, a nine for execution, and an eight for succumbing to a few hokey cinematic tricks and needless adjuncts. Still, highly recommended</fullReview>

At least, that's how I felt.There's nothing wrong with the setup, Depp is absolutly amazing as is the music and the cinematography. However, beyond, roughly an hour into the film, things start to get a little wierd.First off, Depp is the only truly great actor in this film. Langella is over-acting, Olin, under-acting, and Seigner, well, she wasn't acting at all. I really thought it was peculiar because I would think Roman Polanski would really be able to get the best, but I digress...The problem with this film is my attachment to it. I love caring about the characters and the plot and the consequences of certain moments. By the end, I didn't give a hoot if he found the goddamn thing or not. It wasn't boring, it was just futile. "Oh, here's the book, oh no, I lost it, oh no, I found it, Shit, the devil took it, oh..."That's what every scene seemed to look like. And plus, it was really long, too. I mean, I sat through The Green Mile, and that was brilliant, so I don't have a problem with lenght. It was just so looooong.One word to note: If you read this review before you see the film, and while the film is going on, you think, wait a minute, that guy was wrong...wait till the end.Whatever...2/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting premise, but flawed at times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Roman Polanski excels at is creating character driven stories, and the problems that arise from the characters needs. Johnny Depp is a book detective sent out into the world by Frank Langella to authenticate a book that is allegedly co-written by the devil himself. Strange things occur as Depp gets closer to his goal, and he is aided along the way by a mysterious, unnamed girl. Problem is, there are other forces working against Depp, and anyone who has come in contact with the book, or its companion volumes, has met with a ghastly fate. What I liked about the movie was the way Polanski suggested that the devil need not be made of flesh and blood, but rather manifest himself in man. Through man, the devil does his dirty work. He lies, steals, cheats, kills, all the good stuff. The film is shot well and we get lovely views of European locales, but the overall package is a mixed bag. There were scenes that had me stifle a laugh, and I'm sure there was no comedic intention. The ending left me a bit confused, and I can't say anymore or I'll spoil it for those who want to see the movie. I had mixed feeling about this movie, some good things mixed in with some not so good things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first time I had been angry leaving the theater in a long time. I really enjoyed the opening credits and music. The direction and camera angles were excellent. Johnny Depp does a great job as the rare book expert. Now for the flaws: This film was PAINFULLY long. I am glad that it wasn't geared for instant gratification, however, many of the scenes took so long to develop that I was glad when the end of the movie was coming. I kept telling myself, when I make it to the end I will be rewarded. NOT!!! There was a questionable sex scene and then the credits start rolling up the screen. You're sitting in your seat going "Hey wait, not yet! I waited two and a half freaking hours for something to happen!" It never does. There are times when a film will end and leave you guessing. That's fine. There are two problems with that here. One is that the movie does not drop enough substance in your lap for you to conclude "Okay this happened and then I think this happened here and so on" and then feel satisfied with the result. I could have stayed home and surmised what happened in the movie from what I saw the trailer, and even THAT would have been more satisfying than the ending. Bringing me to point two which is this empty feeling of non-fulfilment is even more acute when you wait two and a half hours for a nothing-but-whatever-you-fill-in ending.The film has a very interesting story, and the directing and acting are so good as to make it a passable work even with the non-ending. If there is a major clue I missed in the film, to be fair, please send it to me. Judging from the other reviews, I didn't miss anything -- it just wasn't there. This could have been great, but was fair. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad to see that most of the people commenting like this film. I was totally entranced from the first frame. Sure, the story is fluff and kind of ridiculous, but it's just so nice to see a (new) movie that is intelligently directed. The movie unfolds slowly and the very slowness becomes part of the menace of it all. Polanski is very clever about the supernatural aspects, and keeps it all, for the most part, in the realm of "is there something supernatural going on, or is it just in their minds?" If good direction and wonderful cinematography are enough to get you excited by a film, see this one. It's amazing the poor reviews this film has gotten, especially critics saying this film is poorly directed, which I think is evidence of how stupid even well-respected critics (like from the New York Times) are lately. They think this film apes Eyes Wide Shut, when there is an OBVIOUS visual reference which tells you that he is consciously alluding to that film. Sigh... it's sad.The score is nice, not overwhelming, but in contrast to the lifeless, unintelligent scores most films have, it is INCREDIBLE!!I also WORSHIP the opening credits of this film. I won't tell you, but I will say that you should try to get a seat in the center of the theater for maximum effect.And Johnny Depp continues to amaze. He is just so good. It's to the point where I'll see anything he's in because I trust his taste. Yes, even The Astronaut's Wife.Which brings me to the ending. I'm sure there is some great meaning to it all, but I sure didn't get it. I think this film, like The Astronaut's Wife, is an exercise in mood and tone, in pure suspense (as in suspense witout a payoff) and you have to be willing to enjoy the craft and build-up of it without expecting Satan to rip through the floor at the end and whip fiery knives at little Johnny.

		<fullReview>This movie seemed good until the end. The end really spoiled it. After waiting 2 hours to see the ending it doesn't really have much of an ending and that kind of ruins the movie. The first 75% of the movie is reasonably good. If it had a better ending it would be an acceptable movie but the way it ends now is just a let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moves along nicely, until the end, and then bam... what does it all mean?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are not that many films that take the time to be a really good thriller. Most films that are produced are smart enough to realize that most people have the attention span of 4 year old when it comes to films. Something always has to be happening for the audience to stay focussed on the film. Well in the Ninth Gate, that doesn't always happen. As a matter a fact if a James Cameron flick is your idea of the only form of entertainment, then you should stay clear of this one because it really does move slowly. I am not saying that is a bad thing, just a fact. I really liked the film, right up until the very end when it makes no sense. And I have read other reviews in here that complain about the same thing so I am glad that I am not the only one. I believe this film could have been excellent if only it would have explained itself a bit more at it's conclusion. I still recommend it highly but I have no idea what it all means, you figure it out.The film has one of the best opening set ups that I have seen in quite some time. It begins by showing Dean Corso ( Johnny Depp ) as a sleazy book hunter. He swindles a couple out of some rare books and then he heads off to his best paying client who then informs him that he wants him to go off to Portugal and France to find the only two other copies of a book that may or may not open the Ninth Gate, where Satan is supposed to rise from Hell. The man's name is Boris Balkan and he is played with a quiet sinisterness by Frank Langella. It seems the book that he has is one of only three copies. The man who wrote it was burned alive in the Spanish Inquisition because he was apparently in cohoots with Satan himself. Corso does go on his journey to Europe to locate the two remaining books and find their secrets. While in Europe looking for the books, he escapes death numerous times, discovers discrepencies with the three books, meets a stranger in the form of a beautiful French? woman that uses martial arts to save him once and she also floats twice from stair cases, but we, the audience get to see that, not Corso himself. The scenes in Europe are so thick with potential that when the end does come about, it makes no sense and it ultimately lets you down. I was greatly reminded of Alan Parker's 1987 film Angel Heart and I could see a great many similarities to the two characters and the situations that they are in and I was sure that the movie was setting us up for a similar fate for Corso that Angel went through. But then, it just ends. There is some vague attempt at an explanation but it really left everyone in the theater confused. If anyone really knows what it is all about, please email me and let me know. I would be most greatful.To locate and research the two books, Corso has to talk to their owners. When he spends some time with both of them and then the day after they both show up dead, there is a world of possibilities that could lead to. Again, I was reminded of Angel Heart where all of Harry's suspects turn up dead. A similar fate could have been in store for Corso but again, all potential for mystery and sinister people is all but erased because the story was too lazy to go the route that it should have. And that is too bad because, as I said before, the film has so much potential, so much. But it was wasted. Sure there is an underlying theme about being seduced by power and the dark side but again it is not explored at all, and you would think that a film that runs over 2 hours could explain more of that to us.The Ninth Gate is a fascinating film with an intriguing story and it keeps you interested throughout the film. I liked it for that and if only the ending would have told me more then I would think this film is one of the best ones that I have seen on the occult. But with the confusing ending, it just feels like something is missing, and it is.7.5 out of 10 ( should have been a 9 )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, just got back from the theater. My girlfriend and I came out of the theater very pleased, unlike much of the rest of the audience who attended this film. After listening to people shout out, "what a piece of s**t movie!" and other negative things, we decided to comment to each other on it's amazing atmosphere and how much the music and scenery drew us into it. I don't remember how many times I got the chills from the music. Aside the music and scenery, the trailer for this film had me expecting a more scary, jumpy sort of special effects type movie like you would regularly see with this kind of storyline, however, that was not the case. Don't get me wrong, I love special effects and everything, I'm a big fan as a matter of fact....But overall, I was completely not disappointed with the Ninth Gate and HIGHLY recommend it. If you know what good cinematography and good storylines and good acting is, go see this movie :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie will very likely be one of those either loved or hated. It has its flaws to be sure, but I didn't feel them to be accidental. So many films (at least, in this country) concern themselves with witty dialogue...sometimes to the point the players look to be reading off prompters. Other movies are destroyed by an overkill ratio of effects to story and style. What most movies don't have is atmosphere and life. It's hard to point at exactly why, but after watching this movie I felt it had both. First of all, many critics have and will attack this movie on the basis of its length. I've never felt this was a valid criticism personally, and in this movie I think it was necessary to transform a simple detective tale into the dark and somewhat confusing story it finishes as. The movie moves slowly, but the sights and sounds along the way add momentum to the overall feel. Nevertheless, those requiring frequent stimulation doubtlessly will be annoyed with all of this. Secondly, much criticism has been devoted to certain cliche areas of the movie such as the black-robed coven and the sex scene by firelight. I think there was a bit of humor in both...however it didn't detract anything to me. At the point of the sex scene, most observant viewers will have likely drawn conclusions to the nature of Mrs. Seigner's character...it merely struck me as simple symbolism of Dean Corso's coupling with evil. Somewhat hokey perhaps, but intended. The movie never gave me the impression of seriousness; it is a fantasy piece after all. And finally, that the movie strays away from the religious I felt wise. The movie wasn't really about religion. It was about humanity and the darkness within...and overall, it was something of a ghost story type...like The Omen movies. If it had become bogged down in religious issues of good and evil, it would have become another boring story that has been done over and over again. (Read...Stigmata perhaps?)Overall, I felt the movie had a dark, yet fun feel to it. The visuals are outstanding. The acting is terrific. The music is well done. (Give me a break on the cliche music bit. James Horner made a career on it) If you're looking for some deep message here, avoid this. If you're attention span clocks out at an hour and a half, avoid this. If you're looking for a movie with a dark, mysterious life of its own give this one a look. I give it a nine of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very entertaining...but don't come to this movie looking to be horrified, terrified or shocked; if you do, you'll be disappointed. The Ninth Gate isn't horror so much as it is humor. Beautifully filmed, the movie takes you right into Europe, but the cinematography and sets are about the only things taken seriously in this film. Satanic camp, if such a thing exists, is probably the category I would put it in. The Ninth Gate is a long movie - almost three hours - and there are no crashing, banging, booming special effects, but if you don't mind that, you will have a great time. The only thing that would have made the movie better would have been hiring a better actress - Emmanuelle Seigner is beautiful, but cardboard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Between this and Pitch Black, maybe I should stop listening to so called respected critics out there, who seem very quick to diss most movies lately. Ninth Gate's concept does sound rather unoriginal, "oh, it's another innocent man pulled into the crazy wacky world of devil worshippers." But the movie is actually quite enjoyable, especially with Depp as a well-known "book detective" and Seigner as his mysterious "guardian angel."A specific criticism I read was that the movie was too vague, and the ending doesn't really tell you exactly what happened. This is from the same people that worship 2001 A Space Odyssey - there vagueness was ok because it was "an experience." It really annoys me when a character on the screen explains something that the audience has already figured out. If you're of the same opinion, then this should not be a concern for you. The movie explains what it wants and leaves the rest as a cool mystery. I advise you to see it, especially if you enjoyed the visual feel of that other recent Depp movie, Sleepy Hollow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent, engaging classy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, to those of you who want to see this film because you hope it's going to be filled with devils and gore and killing and action, this isn't the film for that. Go see "End of Days" if you want a special effects romp. Go see "The Ninth Gate" if you appreciate being intellectually stimulated on a fascinating and ancient subject matter such as Lucifer himself. Johnny Depp plays Corso, a rare book hunter who is tracking down two of the three copies of The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, the third copy known to be in existence belonging to Balkan, the man who has hired him to hunt down the remaining two and distinguish which one is the real one. "You're a book detective?" Liana Telfer asks, the widow of the man who previously owned Balkan's copy. Corso is sent to various countries in search of the books, and along the way his life is threatened on a number of occasions, people are hunting him down, and he meets a mysterious woman repeatedly. He is also brought to the Baroness Kessler's office. She is a woman who has studied intensely and written a book on her copy of the Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows. Upon being asked by Corso why she has chosen The Devil as the subject matter of many of her books, she replies with a laugh, "I saw him one day. I was fifteen years old and I saw him as plain as I see you now: cutaway, top hat, cane. Very elegant, very handsome. It was love at first sight." A fire is set and the Baroness is strangled. Corso awakens in her office to see the copy of the Nine Gates being burned in the fire. He quickly snatches the book. "The Ninth Gate" leads Corso and The Girl who is following him to a mass occult orgy, hosted by none other than Liana Telfer, reading from Corso's stolen copy of The Nine Gates. The rest is up to you to see and analyze. But see it for the intelligence and well-written and well-acted dialogue. Not for cheap special effects, especially since this film knew it didn't need them and thus discluded them. Great acting by Johnny Depp (Sleepy Hollow!), Lena Olin, and director Roman Polanski's real wife, Emmanuelle Seignor, playing The Girl. A richly layered and stylized film, "The Ninth Gate" is by far one of the most intelligent and engaging thrillers I've seen in a long time. And that's not just lip service.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski returns to the macabre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen every single Roman Polanski feature film ever made. I can strongly say that he is definitely one of the greatest masters of contemporary cinema. He is a director that doesn't follow one path of filmmaking. He specializes in thrillers, but he proved with Chinatown and Tess that he is capable of masterpiece filmmaking. Personally I prefer him as a cult status director. The subjects of his films are based on the macabre; this reputation has caused him to become one of the greatest and most controversial directors ever. As any Polanski connoisseur knows he fled to France and has reside there ever since. His last film was Death and the Maiden. A project he took because he needed the money. Nevertheless it was a good movie. Afterwards he disappeared from the face of the earth until he began filming a project based on the genre he was familiar with, a supernatural thriller based on the occult. This project is called The Ninth Gate. I was very eager to see this movie mainly because I love Polanski's movies. Now that it has finally been released here in the US I am happy yet sad. I went to see it opening night, which was this Friday, March 10th. I left the theater somewhat disappointed. It seems that Polanski has spent those years off partying in France. His style has somewhat been lost; his emphasis on creating a psychological thriller is not there. Instead we have a slow paced film which ends up looking rather silly. Some guy said that there were fighting scenes that resembled The Matrix's fighting scenes, I'm not sure which film he saw but there was nothing of the sort. There was however a shot where you seen Polanski's beautiful wife Emmanuelle Seigner fly, and kick some guy's butt. I don't know but I felt that was quite silly. The burning castle sex scene, which everyone keeps complaining about, is quite pointless although it does serve a purpose within the story. I really wanted to like this movie, unfortunately I couldn't find a good reason to, except that it's A Roman Polanski Film. The film had a lot of potential of being something great but it failed. Sure I was disappointed, but you have to love the film for what it has to offer.</fullReview>

In my case, I saw the opening and entire film immediately after a series of stupid promos for forgettable junk films depicting a series of boring explosions accompanied by loud, irritating noise. I was about to get up, ask for a refund and walk out of the theater when these graceful titles started. The Ninth Gate's occult theme is rendered in Polanski's celebrated cinematic style with subtlety, deft, and visual beauty. Its casting is impeccable, and most rewarding with the unfailingly good stage and screen actor, Frank Langella, who plays a rare book collector and then some. For those who are tired of ducking and weaving the current, standard Hollywood product of ever cheapening special effects, meaningless, boring stories or non-story films with puzzling characters that are never known or understood: this is a satisfying, welcome reprieve. It is a glance back to a more artistic, eloquent Hollywood of a more rational period. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching our humanity (Note: Will spoil film for those who haven't seen it)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before writing this, I've read many other comments made on this film and seen many mixed reviews regarding The Ninth Gate. Personally, I believe it will probably be the best film to be brought to mainstream audiences this year, and is one of the most intriguing films of recent years.First of all, I'd like to address 'The Lady' (Seigner) as the credits so eloquently entitle the character. I've seen many people unsure of what she represents, and I myself even am curious to know what Polanski wished the character to be. As for my own interpretation, I see her as the ultimate representation of humanity itself. Perhaps she is an angel, and perhaps that is saying that angels are really only humans with a few extra powers. If anyone has ever seen The Bishop's Wife, this is shown in Cary Grant's feelings towards Loretta Young, as well. Seigner, however, seems to parallel Depp's character so perfectly in my opinion. We see this superificially by the fact of her being wherever he goes, protecting him, helping him. Much like the deeper consciousness of ourselves. The sex scene is not merely an attempt to show Polanski's wife having sex with someone, in my opinion, but to show the desires of humanity. It is not to show us our sexuality, but our humanity. Seigner is a balance between good and evil, just as all humans are. And the question must be asked, in the end, do good or evil actually exist?That seems to be touched on with the topic of the pictures themselves. After all, nobody really cared about the books in the end, did they? The longing Depp feels for the key to the Ninth Gate, and his eventual opening of that door, makes us ask what evil truly is. Throughout the film, it seems that we are given the impression of these evil, devil worshippers wanting the book. Yet none of them are able to succeed in opening the gate. But Depp is able to open this gate. A character that isn't portrayed as evil, but as curious and self-serving...as a normal person.It seems that the Ninth Gate itself represents coming to the realization of who we are and finding enlightenment. I think the film ending at the point at which it did is perfect, because how can any director or writer ever express what Nirvana or Heaven must be like? Only the common man, who comes to the realization of who he himself is, can ever find pure enlightenment of the self and be able to move on, either in this world or the next. Those who rely on worshipping of gods to find truth are really only wasting their time and not searching where they should (within themselves) to find truth. Another parallel I notice is that of the worshippers of the occult. It is somewhat implied that they are worshippers of Satan, yet perhaps it is really only being said that those who worship any gods might as well be doing the same. All gods are the same and none are perfect. Though some may see gods as evil, the same balance of good and evil exists within deityhood as in humanity. Or within all sentient beings.So, in my eyes, The Ninth Gate is this overall view of the search for ourselves and the need for others to help us upon this path towards enlightenment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ironic black comedy by Roman Polanski.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate ***This film, directed by Roman Polanski, would best be described as an ironic black comedy. . The the comedy is subtle, the sarcasm is also subtle but pervasive. It combines a peculiar world reminiscent of H.P. Lovecraft with a modern world of supernatural conspiracy. The movie stars Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, an amoral, atheistic rare book dealer who is commissioned by a millionaire to investigate the authenticity of a medieval Satanist's book, "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of the Shadows" (written in 1666), by comparing it to the only two other known copies in existence.The movie looks really good, and presents us with interesting and eccentric characters. It takes us into a fascinating world of rare book dealers and collectors, and occultists. Corso investigates the previous owner of his client's book and the two other owners the book. Each of these people has their own obsession to the exclusion of virtually all else in their lives, one with his wife, one with his collection of books, and one with the study of the occult. As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that Polanski is poking fun at the genre of Satanist movies that was popular in the late 60s and early 70s. He also blanatly mocking the idle and the rich, who dabble in the occult as an 'excuse to satisfy their deviant sexual urges'. Not suprising, as his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered by amateur occultists in the 1960s. Sometimes the 'poking' is anything but subtle, and the audience did pick up on most of the laughs. At first Corso's "arch" character has an atheistic approach to the investigation of the book. Several people are fighting for the secret of the books. Gradually it becomes clear that the book is choosing its own master, and will not be chosen. Polanski teases us with a conventional ending that we have seen uncountable times in these satanic ritual movies, and then interrupts it in what is the least subtle, but funniest plot twist in the movie. The ending doesn't have the payoff that we expect. It becomes clear that the book is more about a self-actualizing journey, rather than some occultist secret. It teaches us a lesson, that we don't need to go in search of evil, that it already lies within human nature, and will find us if we choose not to resist it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ROMAN'S DIRTY HOME MOVIES</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of both Polanski's "The Ninth Gate" and Brian De Palma's "Mission to Mars" on the same day, you can say there's more evidence for those who still need it that the 70's era of personal, meaningful filmmaking is long past. While De Palma has always seemed to crave the big studio success that others in his circle have found (in fact, he is rumored to have said as much about the stratosphere that pals Spielberg and Lucas attained), Polanski has until now seemed to have stumbled into his Hollywood success phase ("Rosemary's Baby," "Chinatown") while always remaining true to his compulsive desire to make films about obsessive characters and themes. His last undisputed critical success was "Tess," made after he declined to return to the US to face statutory rape charges. While not the nail-biting thriller it aimed to be, "Frantic" was certainly far from a by-the-numbers suspense film. It's no easy feat to make Harrison Ford look ordinary, lost and weak (and hence, a very common man).  Each film deals with men and women who find themselves tested as they move against the status quo to find answers or to survive. It is Polanski himself, playing a thug, who slices Jack Nicholson's nose in "Chinatown" for being too nosy. In "Gate" we seem to be at end-game. While there is a muddled mystery in this stylishly decorated and shot film, our protagonist Johnny Depp does all he can to NOT pursue it. He is forever on the phone with the underused Frank Langella (both here and in general. For Pete's sake, will someone give this man a decent part in a good film!) trying to get out of his assignment of authenticating a rare book on the occult. Not that one could blame him, given the pointless nature of the story.  As a "dishy" older woman, Lena Olin gives the film a few moments of smoldering heat that are never allowed to fully catch on fire. Given the sexual tension of his last effort, "Bitter Moon," it seems odd Polanski doesn't pursue this. Olin, looking very different now in her mid-forties, is all set to correct decades of Older Male/Younger Female couplings with the boyish Depp when Polanski cuts away. The answer becomes clear later. For the point of all this mumbo-jumbo about Satan, burned heretics, secret covens and a heretofore unknown circle of rare occult book bibliophiles is this: Roman Polanski's wife "gettin' some." I'm not making this up, folks. What else explains why it is never laid out (sorry for the pun) what exactly anyone thinks will happen when mystery of the books is solved. Does it bring back Old Nick to rule the world or is it just a one-on-one conference thing? Depp never seems all that concerned that those around him want Lucifer as their NBF (new best friend for the over-25 crowd). As a matter of fact, Depp doesn't seem too concerned about much of anything. Holding four and five hundred year old tomes in his bare hands, he is prone to smoking directly over these supposedly very expensive volumes. No special cases necessary either, apparently, as he casually tosses the books into a battered shoulder bag only occasionally thinking to wrap them in a besotted rag. A note about the music: another parallel than could be made with "Mission to Mars" is the recycled music. In "Mission" Ennio Morricone blatantly used his "Humanity (Part I and II)" from John Carpenter's "The Thing" and here we have Wojciech Kilar aping parts of the score he did for "Bram Stoker's Dracula." Except for this one piece that pops up occasionally that is almost jaunty, sounding much like the theme from "Ghostbusters." The most surprising thing about both Depp's character and the movie, is how unconcerned with a religious view they are. There's not even lip-service given to whatever faith he is and not so much as a glimpse of a priest or rabbi in the film. The whole point seems to be we get to watch Emmanuelle Seigner (Mrs. Polanski) have a sweaty session atop a seemingly confused Depp while a building burns behind them. Other than that, I'm grasping at straws to explain what it's about or the significance of the last shot. While she is attractive, I think the next time Polanski wants to make a movie to see his wife get boinked, he needs to use a camcorder. Wait for video, or rent one of THOSE videos.</fullReview>

It was first and foremost a mystery but as the protagonist travels about and learns more and more it becomes clear that the "case" he's solving is not exactly of this earth. Another more obvious comparison is the book that causes many interesting deaths, like Damien did in 'Omen'. Polanski is a master of the subtle horror film. As with 'Rosemary's Baby' this film starts out very reserved and as the story progresses everything comes together with disturbing results. Which leads to another aspect of this film that I enjoyed, the ending. Although it leaves many questions unanswered and also leaves our "hero" in alleigence with Lucifer it fits well with the overall dark and mysterious mood of the film. The acting, on all counts, is fantastic. Johnny Depp plays a the flawed "hero" very well and it was good to see Frank Langella as the evil but ultimately incompetant Balkan. Emmanuelle Seigner plays an interesting female lead that keeps the audience guessing. The cinematography, music and imagery are all perfect and add well to the creepy feeling. If I have one complaint about 'The Ninth Gate' it would be the laughable fight scene by the river. Completely unneccessary. Otherwise great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monochromatic and perfectly Polanski.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having no suspense, action, or surprises, this perfectly Polanski mystery is filmed in dark tones and complex sets. The expert development of Johnny Depp's character is as monochromatic as the film itself, with intense interest provided by his "girl" helper actress Emmanuelle Seigner. The part of Balkan (Frank Langella) seemed miscast. Still a must, but subject matter plods no new ground.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"mumbo jumbo mumbo jumbo mumbo jumbo" says Boris Balkan as he disrupts the witches coven towards the end of the movie. I kept saying these words when I walked out of this movie after 2 hrs of snail-paced book-hunting and its highly unsatisfying ending.Stunning visuals are the only redeeming features here. There is an implicit assumption in the supernatural thrillers that God has ten fingers and favors base-10 numbering system, which is why numbers like "9" and "666" conveniently assume significance.I dont have an answer to how to end this movie. But I do believe, someone like Polanski should figure out how! That's why they are paid the big bucks and a portion of the $8.75 that I paid for this vapid waste of celluloid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with potential, but in the end, faded away.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Johnny Depp, I had to see this movie. The first 2/3 of the movie drew me in, with its deep and haunting theme about a book that would bring back Lucifer himself. Suspense, action, and mystery, combined with a few bits of off-color humor had me thinking that this would be a great movie. But as for the last twenty minutes, I was thoroughly disappointed. The movie took a huge turn from its fairly linear plot into an incredible twist (which included a highly irregular and unnecessary sex scene). The ending left no questions answered, and the whole theater still pondering the absurd sex scene. All in all, aside from the last twenty minutes, I would say that this was a good (but not great) movie. I recommend going to it, as long as you appreciate it for its first 4/5, or just for another chance to see the witty Depp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The previous commenter simply has poor taste in movies. This movie is for the birds. I wouldn't say it sucks, but it is neither good nor bad. Depp does what is asked of him, however the film is hokey, and goes on far too long. The special effects appear outdated, and below par. Polanski usually familiar with this sort of theme appears very unsure of himself here. Red flags appear when one witnesses that five writers worked on the script (never a good sign) and that the film was shot nearly 3 years ago, and is just getting released.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ninth Gate is one of Polanski's greatest films...with a couple flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate By Dean Kish Acclaimed French director Roman Polanski returns to the horror genre with the Ninth Gate, or does he? The Ninth Gate follows the life of bookworm Dean Corso (played by an always impressive Johnny Depp) as he tries to find the last two remaining copies of an extremely rare book called, `The Book of the Nine Doors to the Kingdom of Darkness'. The book is mythically spoken as a text written by an insane man who claimed that `The Devil' wrote the book through his hand. A disbeliever Corso continues his quest to unlock the authenticity of the other copies and what he finds even shocks Corso. The Ninth Gate is one of Polanski's greatest films as it doesn't try to conjure up the horror but instead goes for the intelligence. The intelligence in this film reminded me a lot of Polanski's all-time greatest film, `Rosemary's Baby'. Rosemary's Baby is a horror classic because it was so intelligent and we didn't need to see the gore or even the baby to know what evil men were doing. And to bring it full circle that's exactly what this film is intelligent and has no gore but intrigue. What I enjoyed about the film is that it wasn't in a rush to convey any of the pieces of the puzzle but instead brought us into the mystery and made us curious what the right sequence and or pages were the ones to unlock the Devil's secret. As each piece to the grand puzzle was revealed Depp was faced with a new hurdle and through that kind of plot revelation I was reminded of `film noir'. The mystery and its unveiling is very similar to a those great dark mysteries of the thirties and forties. Another great strength was another great performance by Johnny Depp who proves once more that he is becoming one of our greatest actors. From the first twenty minutes, I wondered if this bookworm was to boring to follow around on his quest. But when the plot deepened and the myth was slowly revealed he captivated me in a way that Indiana Jones captured me when he watched that burst of sunlight unlock the `Well of the Souls' in `Raiders of the Lost Ark'. As for faults, Ninth Gate is great as a mystery and relic seeking type film but its supernatural finale and the French-Angel chick made me scratch my head. Was she an angel? Was the Ninth Gate really what the people thought? Did that evil consume our hero or did it satisfy his curiosity? The Ninth Gate needed a more satisfactory ending but not done over the top. What I mean is an ending similar to `Raiders of the Lost Ark' where the real power is revealed and man has no hope in hell of harnessing it. Let's see a little of that power these people craved so much. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski takes on the Satan, again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was watching THE NINTH GATE, I was remembering that this is the same director who brought us a film back in 1968 about a woman who is impregnated by the devil in ROSMARY'S BABY. Now director Roman Polanski returns with the same subject in his newest film. However, unlike ROSMARY'S BABY, the climax isn't as exciting. Johnny Depp stars as Dean Corso, a book detective who looks and searches for very valuable and rare books. He is hired one day by highly wealthy business man Boris Balkan (Frank Langella). Boris wants Dean to find two of the three copies of a book that would open the ninth gate of evil. Boris wants Dean to make sure that the copy that he has is a original and to show proof. Dean meets with the widow of the book's former owner (Lena Olin) who does want the book for her own reasons, and will do anything to get the book. Then there is a mysterous woman (Emmanuelle Seigner) who helps Dean from time to time in finding the other books. It's hard to believe that this film is from the same director who has brought the cinema such classic thrillers as ROSMARY'S BABY, THE TENNANT, FRANTIC, and one of the best films of all time: CHINATOWN. With this film, Polanski just seems like that he is sleepwalking through this film, and at times, his pacing is a bit too slow that he almost puts the viewer to sleep and walking out of the theater. There are some good and eye catching scenes, but no enough to make it worth watching. Johnny Depp does a good job as usual as the man looking for the two other books and is caught in the middle of a big mystery. And Lena Olin and Emmanuell Seigner are also very beautiful and scary as the women who wish to have the book for their own reasons. But Frank Langella comes out of this movie at times looking like a baffoon some times, and ridiculous the other times. Overall, THE NINTH GATE is just a film to put on Polanski's list of films done, but it's not one that is a must see. Hopefully, Polanski will again make taunt and captivating thrillers again like FRANTIC and CHINATOWN. Sadly, THE NITH GATE is no FRANTIC, and it's definitly no CHINATOWN. ** (out of five)</fullReview>

Throughout the movie his values change, so, when it ends he is as obsessed by the Devil as the man he was hired for.

The movie can`t answer the question, why this unable (but likable!) man is one of the best "book-hunters". For instance, in the beginning he has to ask the "Toledo Twins", if it would have been difficult to fake antiquities like these satanic verses. That's poor... but relieving! After all, it's one of the Polanskis you'll forget soon. He can't handle this x-files-like-mystifying sujet for a long time. The scenes at the castle, on the satanic feast of high-society, are embarrassing and terrible, if you remember the morbid touch of "Dance of the Vampires".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Novel and the Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not such a bad film (neither so good). I think Polanski does a real good job making one plot out of the two in Reverte's novel. Very interesting in order to understand the difference between the language used in films and literature. I have though a couple of aspects to criticise in this adaptation.First, some characters from the novel are maintained just for the sake of it and they lose the profoundness Reverte gave them, which after all justifies the way Corso moves around in the novel (unfortunately not in the film): I am talking about Grueber, the receptionist of the hotel in Paris, or the brothers Ceniza. "Telfer" is no more the "Taillefer", the "Iron maiden" or Milady of the novel, etc.Second, Polanski shows who is behind the whole plot from the beginning, which makes the film quite predictable. We get to know Balkan too well if we compare him to the Varo Borja of the novel.Third, and as a Spaniard, I think Johnny Depp is a bit too cool: one of the most attractive ingredients in Reverte's novels is the "anti-heroism" of his protagonists, losers with honour and a particular "gentleman code". I suppose this "Americanisation" of Corso is necessary to be able to sell the film, but it leads to a disappointing end. If you read the book, you know that we all have the devil we deserve (as Reverte writes) and, at the end, Corso goes away with his: the ending in the novel is a bit obscure but suggestive, open both to those who believe in the Unknown and to those who prefer to stay in our "wicked" world.I recommend you to read the book, although it is not one of the best by Reverte.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not in general particularly fond of Roman Polanski as a directer. In The Ninth Gate, however, he accomplishes something rather special--a genuinely unnerving and haunting intellectual thriller, and one of the very few films that treats the occult with intelligence and respect.Inevitably, the comparison to Rosemary's Baby has to be made. Let's start with the source material. Ira Levin's novel is a well-made pot-boiler; Arturo Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas, on which The Ninth Gate is based (the novel is quite different in certain respects) is a first-rate intellectual thriller, and, frankly, a much superior novel. Rosemary's Baby is more a nightmare of a really, really bad pregnancy than a supernatural film. In addition, it stars two of the most annoying fingernails-on-the-blackboard actresses imaginable--Ruth Gordon and Mia Farrow. It's a chick flick with pretensions.The Ninth Gate is superior in every way. Superficially, it's a detective story with occult content and a Faustian subplot. But how many films deal with the world of rare books-accurately? This film does not insult the viewer's intelligence.The script is well written and literate. Boris Balkan, a book collector obsessed with rare books about the devil, commissions rare book dealer Gregory Corso with an unusual task. Balkan has just obtained one of three copies extant of "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows"--a book printed in 1666 and purportedly based on an actual text by the devil himself. (The author was burned at the stake for heresy). Balkan wants to verify the authenticity of his copy by comparing it with the other two. This quest becomes more and more perilous as it becomes evident that some sort of singular significance attachs to variations between the three copies in the nine engravings. Balkan attempts to use the nine engravings to summon Lucifer--and fails. But there is something about the ninth engraving.....The casting is just about perfect--the only actor who somewhat falls below the mark is Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl--manifestly Satan's minion in this demonic Pilgrim's Progress. A former model, Ms. Seigner is beautiful--but boring. Apparently Polanski directed her to play the role flat--but except for the occasional special effect with her eyes, we really do not feel a demonic presence. Fail of direction, or actress? Probably a bit of both. Johnny Depp does a notable job as Gregory Corso, a book dealer without a conscience; Lena Olin does another turn on her standard over-sexed villain persona as Liana Telfer; Frank Langella is appropriately menacing as Boris Balkan, an arrogant book collector who longs for union with Satan.What makes this film work so well is that overused term atmosphere. There are few films indeed where atmosphere plays so important a role--a just comparison is to another notable supernatural film, one of the very few really frightening ghost stories on film--Robert Wise's The Haunting. In The Ninth Gate, as in The Haunting, the surrounding are critical characters. Corso, Balkan, and other inhabit spaces that are frequently strangely empty of other living beings. The barriers between the world we know and a numinous world of seductive promise and evil threaten to dissolve at any moment. This is a genuinely beautiful film--beautiful to look at and to listen to (the score is also first rate)--beautiful, seductive, and menacing.Many commentators has disliked the ending--and yet it is the only possible one. Corso, having obtained (or has he?) the secret of The Ninth Gate, enters the castle shown in the final engraving, which then dissolves into yellow light. Apotheosis? Transcendence? Damnation? Impossible to say. Anything more definite would be a disappointment. The ending is chilling--in the best way.This is not a film for the literal-minded. There are few comparable films--The Devil Rides Out, for one, and perhaps Dead of Night. I doubt if Polanski has ever done anything better--and the The Ninth Gate is one of the very few films about the supernatural that does not insult the intelligence. A singular and worthwhile experience indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mysterious thriller that is watchable, but has little to offer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a two hour plus feature, (which is plenty of time) The Ninth Gate, doesn't manage to accomplish as much as it probably could have. The problem with the movie basically comes down to a lack of ambition. As a mystery it is not terribly involving, and as a thriller, not too exciting either. The story is not very complicated, and does make progress, but only in baby steps, and when all is said and done, you feel like you've only gone about ten feet.The Nine Gates is a book supposedly written by the devil himself. Only three copies remain, one is in the possession of Boris Balkin in New York. Balkin hires renowned dealer Dean Corso to go to Europe to search for the other two copies. He is suspicious that one is a forgery. The more Corso discovers, the more danger he is putting himself in. Someone else is after those books, and will kill to get them.simplicity is usually a positive attribute in movies, but not with this one. The story line, is unoriginal, and it doesn't come to life until the last fifteen minutes. There are hints that The Ninth Gate could've been something more interesting. Just occasionally it flirts with Christianity related fantasy, but chooses not to embrace this. Something else that gets squandered is Johnny Depp's acting ability. He does a credible job, given the limited depth and scope of his character, but he is essentially just a body to be moved from one place to the next.The Ninth Gate, is watchable, but it never gets off the ground. It is a gate whose doors are closed to the possibility of something more epic or clever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The devil is in the details...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like a Swiss watch: a stunningly crafted thing of beauty. I give this ten stars, alongside Polanski's THE PIANIST. While this is not a transcendent revelation like THE PIANIST, sometimes a movie can "just" be a movie and still be sheer perfection.As in the best Hitchcock movies of the 1950s, every scene leads beautifully to the next, and there is a tingling delight in just about every shot. Watching it unfold the first time is pure pleasure, but the film also pleases on subsequent viewings. I particularly love the subtle (dare I say devilish?) humor, which is so often a part of Polanski's films, especially those with a supernatural element.Special mention to the music score by Wojciech Kilar, to Johnny Depps' perfectly calibrated performance, and to Frank Langella, who delivers one of the most memorable performances of his career, mostly by phoning it in (literally). As his character, Boris Balkan, discovers (also literally), the devil is truly in the details.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesomeness of flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many questions arise from this film, a plethora of interpretations are possible. After watching this film again, I have come to the understanding that what Polanski is really trying to teach us with this film, above all, is that "good" and "evil" are products of moral relativity. Is it good to kill? Is it evil to protect? You could watch this film five times and see it ten different ways.Depp plays Corso so brilliantly that it is this film alone that vaults him, in my humble opinion, into the elite of our modern day thespians. I simply love the character, and his uncanny ability to manipulate those he comes in contact with. Witness the interactions with the smug Baroness, his equally greedy buddy rare book dealer, the greedy offspring of a rich stroke victim, eagerly waiting to profit from his (not their own) life's work....he even manages to endear himself to HER, which is the source for his ultimate triumph.Who SHE is, by the way...has been the subject of much debate. Is she Lucifer? The Whore of Babylon (my initial thought)? I don't think so. The Whore of Babylon was a representation of many entities and why would Satan need or want to involve "itself" in the selection of some meat sack worthy enough to enter "it's" kingdom. Doesn't "it" have minions for that sort of thing? In my humble opinion, she represents the scales of justice, balancing all things. If you watch her, she is always watching and waiting. She never seems to commit to any action until it becomes obvious what should be done (at least in so far as to protect Corso). Is there a parallel between her and the female depicted in the 9th engraving? Sure, if you are a sucker for the frontal assault. However, she appears to be much more then that...full of power, knowledge, and restraint. Justice. Given the hell Corso went through to get to the end, it was only justified Corso received the shagging of his life...can anyone disagree? The ending is, in a word, perfect. No need for anything other then the suggestion of a journey completed is necessary. Where does the journey end? What happens next? Well, I'd bet a brace of Gutenberg Bibles that there won't be a sequel. Thank God for that, because for a film like this, it would be sacrilege.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guys, please, read the book! Polanski is a Genius but he didn't create the character of the girl. It was on the book! The character of Boris was actually merged with another one: Varo Borja. This, I believed it was done with the intention of actually "simplyfying" the plot. And the whole idea of the DUMAS Club so present in the book was apparently left behind to focus in the main, more attractive, side of the story. Yes, maybe it "hollywoodized" the book, yet it cut the whole sub-plot that kept us so immerse in the pages of The Dumas Club. Great work from Polanski... understood and underrated, yet hopefully valued by true enthusiasts of Roman's work.In any case, just enjoyed both: the movie and the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different View on "The Girl"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, a movie comes along that requires thinking and not just mindless absorption of the pixelated images displayed on the screen. Such is the case with The Ninth Gate. This movie makes the viewer analyze the content and characters to figure out what is actually happening.After watching this movie MANY times, I believe that Corso is the devil; not "the girl". My reasoning: the ninth gate engraving. The title of which is "I know now that shadows come from the light." Who was Lucifer? He was a fallen angel...he came from the light. "The girl" is the whore of Babylon (which I've noticed I'm not alone in this belief). She was there to welcome him back. Gates 1-8 was his journey through the Kingdom of Shadows (the world as we know it) to his true self.I've watched this movie quite a bit, and each time I watch it I see something new...I never tire of seeing it. The imagery, the musical score, the characters are all perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I received this movie on DVD as a gift, and wasn't quite sure whether I would like it or not. I had heard some good things about it here on IMDb, but was afraid it would be a slick movie of little substance, maybe with a few jump scares. Now there isn't anything wrong with that kind of movie, and I've certainly enjoyed my fair share of those, but that's not what I was in the mood for when I watched this one.So I was pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be a suspense filled, slow burning horror-thriller that gave off feelings of dread throughout. Excellent performances by Johnny Depp, Frank Langella and Emmanuelle Seigner. A fitting musical score. Beautiful settings and good atmosphere.Yes, I liked this one and would overall consider worth a viewing or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dean Corso is damned anyway; most of his sins are forgivable, but he smokes in elevators, and that's that. So he makes the most of it by using hell's most exclusive entrance, via the rarest of books. But along the way he pisses off one of the most villainously named institutions in film: the Balkan Press. It sounds like a boot on the neck, and Boris Balkan's massive build looks as if he could press pretty hard. A detective story set in old libraries is a commodity to be approached with trepidation. Such romance is contained in the premise - the knowledge of the ages as the key to some contemporary revelation - that the issue is almost inevitably disappointing a la NATIONAL TREASURE or DA VINCI CODE.But this is Roman Polanski, not Ronnie Howard; and though it's predicated on the supernatural, this is hard-boiled noir, not an action vehicle. Lena Olin has more than a gun in her stocking, Emmanuelle Seigner flies a BMW broom, Johnny Depp chainsmokes Luckies, Frank Langella delivers Clare Quilty via Dracula. Wojciech Kilar bolsters Polanski's creepy atmospherics with a score that merges the Hitchcockian elements of Bernard Hermann and Dmitri Tiomkin. Plus corny dialog, tasteful grue, nasty shocks, and the least predictable ending in a shamus caper since KISS ME DEADLY. Oddly enough, it's almost the same ending, except that Mike Hammer's meeting with the devil may be postponed beyond the end of the movie.Now if only Warner Brothers would release a decent DVD version of FRANTIC, my collection of scenes featuring Polanski's wife brawling on Seine embankments would be complete.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a few years too early</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Roman Polanski's film was made today it could be a big hit. The last few years were extremely successful for the historical thriller in books and movies especially following the best selling success of the DaVinci Code. Still, the 'The Ninth Gate' inspired by the book by Spanish author Arturo Pérez-Reverte is quite a good film by itself, bridging between the devilish movies of the 90th and historical thrillers of the 2000s. It is a little bit too long, and loses interest in the last quarter, especially as the ending is not really very satisfactory, and the bigger mystery of the movie - the identity of the green eyes lady - is not really solved either, besides the very obvious explanation. Johnny Depp is a fascinating actor to watch in any film, although here he seems a little bit distracted or un-interested, as principal hero could have shown some more involvement in the the search of the Ninth Gate, or at least for the two gorgeous women who try to reach for his attention. Anyway we are left with a well filmed movie, good acting, and a decent story - overall good entertainment which is not little thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time has been good to "The Ninth Gate." Generally panned upon release as a "would be" international sensation it has generated quite a cult (go figure) following and rewards patient viewing. Like the great noir films ("The Big Sleep", "Murder My Sweet" etc) the joy is found not at the end of the film when everything "is tied up with pink ribbons on it" but rather in the quest itself. Many of the film's defenders (who were actually surprised by the flood of negative reviews) go to great lenghts to justify it's plotting, lighting, music, etc. but the real defense of the film is that it is one of the best film noirs made since, you guessed it, Chinatown.Much of the film's technical qualities have been widely praised in this entry but to see such a convergence of fine film making technique all at once is quite a bit of fun. At any point in the film you can focus on the set-ups, framing and what not and can certainly tell the difference between this and the routine collection of hack jobs that show up at the multiplexes weekly.It would not be until the release of "The Pianist" two years later that Polanksi would get the majority of critics squarely back in his camp. The "Ninth Gate" is almost reason enough to quit reading the critics, period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I love this website for it's detailed evaluations of movies and its castmembers, directors, trivia, etc...there really does exist a large number of reviewers who make comments and post ratings who really do have NO idea of true genius movie-making. This would be a mild case when I see that Roman Polanski's "The Ninth Gate" gets an average vote of 6.6 from over 25,000 reviews. Granted, that is closer to a 7 than a 6, but COME ON. Are you kidding?! This is when garbage like "Batman Begins", "The Departed", and "The Matrix 2" all rank in the top 250 in all of the movie reviews on here. There really is a definite lack of genuine movie appreciation when a gem of a film like this only warrants a 6.6. Well, the only thing I can do is rate it a 10 and say a few words. The cinematography is mesmerizing, the acting is more than good, and the plot? A story about the power of obsession over a book that reportedly can conjure up Satan is more than enough to hook me! If you like movies that depend on quality screen writing with amazing cinematography and atmosphere rather than crutching off of computer generated special effects and explosions and a story that will rake in the 12 year-old popcorn-munching public, then do yourself a favor and watch "The Ninth Gate".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can describe this movie with one word, excellent. But to be more of use for those who wants to know what I thought of it more thoroughly, I will certainly give my best shot.First of all I just think that Polanski did an amazing job with "The Girl". She was so beautiful, but yet she seemed so evil some how. You can tell that Polanski wanted "The Girl" to be mysterious and for the audience to have a little mystery of their own, "Who is this Girl?" "Does she work for him, or maybe even for her...?". I think that was what made me really enjoy this film, to really think. But if you really think about it, it was quite easy in the end to see who she really was. When they are having sex in front of the castle that where in flames, her eyes really turned evil and as one before me already have said she always and only showed up when Lucifer was the topic in the conversation, she WAS "Lucifer".And the acting, Jhonny Depp is with out questioning one of the best actors out there, and Emmanuelle Seigner fit perfectly in the role as "The Girl". So as the topic says, the film gets a ten from me, 10+ if you so could.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate is a superb masterclass in intrigue and the occult from Roman Polanski. Johnny Depp is excellent as Dean Corso, a book expert who is hired by the mysterious Boris Balkin to examine a rare item that was supposed to have been written by Lucifer himself.Depp's character finds himself over his head when people he has talked to about Balkan and the book start getting murdered. He is aided along the way by a mysterious woman with supernatural powers who may or may not be working for Balkan (or Satan himself?) The music score is excellent and richly composed throughout. The European sequences look very nice indeed, in fact the film's production design looks almost gold coloured in every scene, no doubt thanks to Dean Tavoularis who worked on The Godfather films.Special mention to Lena Olin for her fantastic turn as a sexy hothead femme fa-tale who smolders in every scene shes in. This is the type of role that has become her trademark. Frank Langella is impressive as the mysterious Balkan, after this performance it can only be a matter of time before he is cast as the new James Bond Bad Guy.If you are a fan of such movies as The Omen and Chinatown, this film is for you.The Ninth Gate is a superb mystery thriller with lashings of Gothic Romance and millionaire devil worship, one of those films you watch once and discover it was much better than you thought it was going to be.

The point is missed entirely.This film, is above all else EXTREMELY SATANIC, in the sense that much of its narrative conforms to a Nietzchean-LaVeyan ethic steeped on the concept of meritocracy. The audience could not be permitted the same reward as Corso because they had not earned it, and ignoring that fact would have resigned us to the same fate as Balkan--destroyed by counterproductive pride. Corso earned the right to conjure and meet the devil himself and thus was the only one able to do so.There is no mystery, only merit.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp is a "private dick"--albeit of the "book detective" variety. There is a femme fatale, of course, played by Emmanuelle Seigner. Depp is oftentimes hilarious in the role of Corso, who despite surface appearances, is probably the most moral character in the film. The scenes are beautiful and it plays like the reading of a great mystery story. The soundtrack is a masterpiece as well. If you like Hitchcock, you should love this movie.

		<shortDescription>Ponderous Polanski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a purely technical level, Roman Polanski has made some of the most entertaining, enrapturing long movies in the history of cinema. "The Ninth Gate" is another epic that goes on for over 2 hours, but ultimately suffers from a distinct lack of wonder and urgency. For a film whose theme regards the revival of Lucifer through an ancient text, it never feels overly apocalyptic. It doesn't help that our protagonist, rare-book dealer Dean Corso (Johnny Depp, still excellent), is so mercenary in his quest that he never displays much in the way of human emotion (he barely reacts to the death of a collaborator, for instance). Lena Olin shows up in a few scenes as a femme fatale; Frank Langella plays a millionaire looking to conjure up Old Scratch (and quite literally 'phones in' his performance). Polanski's overall execution is rambling--15 or 20 minutes could have easily been shaved off this baby, and the end result would have been a much more economical picture. However, he wrings as much passion from the B-level material as possible, and winds up with a result that is not on par with his previous works, but still not all that bad.</fullReview>

In a subtle way it makes fun of those who seek the devil or the evil, and in todays age quoting Al Pacino in devils advocate " who wouldn't admit that the 21st century was my(the devil's) century ".

		<fullReview>High production values? Give me a break. With all the little going on in this film, it could have been direct to video. With such a flat performance, they might as well have gotten a nobody in for Depp. The so-called remarkable score is pretty much non-existent. Furthermore, poor matte shots and hilariously bad fight scenes don't help things either.This film is made out to be some kind of masterpiece by pseudo-geniuses but the film's intelligence and wit is about on par with an episode of the Outer Limits. Don't be fooled; this is your standard, over-the-top cheese-fest of an occult mystery with the pacing slowed down to a crawl and a purposely anticlimactic ending which must be intellectually stimulating for those with an IQ of under 100.Granted, I found the film interesting for what it was. But its sheer simplicity is a major turn-off considering that it's supposed to be deep. If you honestly had to watch this film more than once to understand it, I can understand why you'd feel it is such a work of art, because you're quite simply unsophisticated. This movie, in every way, resembles the work of an amateur director who shows promise working with a low-budget. Nothing more.</fullReview>

The collector is a powerful and wealthy man and tells Depp to keep it safe. When it is inevitably stolen as you know it's gonna be Depp has to track it down and recover it. What entails is a race to achieve the seemingly impossible yet possible. To pass the Ninth Gate and meet Satan personally.

		<fullReview>I have to say that I didn't expect much of this movie even though it was directed by Roman Polanski. You wonder why? Before I saw the movie, someone told me the director only made this movie because of commercial reasons, meaning that he needed to do this movie to get money from a big studio for another project and that he probably didn't work on it with his heart and soul...Not a good start to watch a movie, i know. But I have to say that i was pleasantly surprised. Of course this isn't one of his best movies, of course it's sometimes a bit predictable, but did it bother me? Not really. In the end I liked it. The story is about the book detective Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) who has to check if the rare book of one of his clients is real. There are three copies in the world and the owner believes he's got the only real one. This search gets him in a world of murder, conspiracy and the supernatural.My advice to you: don't expect too much of it, but don't think it is an awful movie either.

		<shortDescription>Jungian Approach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the film last night and strangely enough, I had exactly the same impression as someone else here (the one who took the girl as Lilith) when watching the sex scene in front of the burning building. I guess this theory may be supported by a few other clues too; for example we know that Lilith could run so fast, maybe that's why the girl can manage to be almost everywhere throughout the film, AND when she asks Corso about the meaning of his name and he explains it means "run" and she says, "you don't look like a runner to me" again the same myth is referred to: Adam could never run as fast as Lilith. The final sex scene again provokes the same images of Lilith' myth: During having sex with Lilith in a cave, Adam loses consciousness due to the extreme ecstasy he feels. This is most evident in the film if you look closely to the facial expressions of Corso lying down on the ground. He too is on the verge of losing consciousness. Plus, just like Lilith, the girl seems to be made of fire (her glowing eyes, her ability to fly) and this is again reinforced through the sex scene in front of the burning building... On the whole, I guess the easiest way to interpret the film is to take it as it is: Corso is a man, he is vulnerable, he has no extraordinary feature. He is CAPABLE of the evil, though. Plus, he doesn't seem to believe in anything but himself. The girl, on the other hand, seems to be supernatural (maybe that's why she has no proper name). I tend to think that she is somehow relevant to the evil side, because I guess the plot would make sense in no other way. One important thing you shouldn't forget is that the Devil is very wise, and at the same time beautiful. I guess in western culture Devil is assumed as masculine. That may seem obvious, but don't forget in many other cultures Devil is assumed as a feminine force. Actually, Devil is the biggest projection of the unknown in almost all cultures? Being a student of English literature myself, I noticed that this film easily yields itself to some sort of Jungian Critical Approach: The whole film is a Quest for Corso to be Initiated. The girl is some sort of Guru anyway. She can even be taken as Corso's Anima (Jungian sense) and Corso becomes fully united with her through the symbolic intercourse in front of the fire. That's why he can finally possess the ninth key and passes through the gate, i. e. the light. He gets united with himself at the end and enters the realm of the Unknown. I am not to claim if this is just what this film means. This is just a psycho-literary way to look at it, and a film (or a novel) is considered "good" only when it yields itself to many logical interpretations. I guess this film does so and thus does worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as my mind said, "This would be a great place to end this movie," the credits started to roll. Though I'm afraid most weren't in tune with it that much. A great flick for some, and a "What happened?" for most. But, don't miss it, if you can... It's "Lady Or The Tiger" ending leaves it open for a sequel, though it's hard to imagine what that would be like. ANYTHING would be possible. As in the sequel to The Graduate (Rumor Has It). Or, in the way Whoppie Goldberg's character brought Kevin Klein's character back in "Soapdish" when that character had left the show after being killed by decapitation. They never said how it was done, they just did it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got finished reading some of the other threads that discuss this movie. They ranged from the angst ridden youth spouting off about how there was no action, to those who truly loved this movie. I know that this movie is practically 5 years old, but this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am an avid horror fan. I love everything from slasher movies to the silent films from the 1920's. I admit, when I saw this movie in the theater, I was very disappointed. I think I was expecting some whiz-bang battle with the devil at the end, and for those of you who've seen this flick you know that this is not how it ends. Now, almost 5 years later, I own and watch this film very frequently. Now that I have seen this movie numerous times, I can appreciate the creepy atmosphere and the deep storyline. I have even said to myself "How could they have ended this movie differently in a way that I would be completely satisfied (other than the way they did)?" I couldn't answer that question. For those who have only seen this once, take the time to watch it again with different expectations. I know that there are some who will never like this movie, To each his/her own, but I am very glad that I took the time to see this one again because as it stands now, it will have a locked spot in my top 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretentious, silly but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this came out in 1999, many people used it as evidence to claim that Roman Polanski had lost his touch. His films seemed to be getting increasingly unwatchable (Bitter Moon, anyone?) and The Ninth Gate was the final nail in the coffin. So when he bounced back to critical acclaim, with last year's The Pianist, many people, including me, were surprised. Let us hope that Polanski is inspired to make better films now. As it is, the Ninth Gate is a testament to those trying times in his career.Rare book dealer Johnny Depp is hired by a millionaire book collector, to track down the two other copies of a rare Satanic book, The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, which he owns a copy. The millionaire, played by Frank Langella, is obsessed about authenticating his copy, and if during the research, his is uncovered to be a fake, the real one should take its place. Depp must do this, by whatever means possible. Hence, a large cheque which is thrust in his direction.The ideas are good- you've got weighty themes such as religion, Satanic ritual and the black arts, but the scriptwriters (of which Polanski is credited as one) fail to take the concept any further. This is probably due to the impenetrable plot, which presents the viewers with half-clues, vague character insights but fails to include any clear direction. Thus, you get a Lynchian ending devoid of any of the charm or wit displayed by David. In other words, you get a pretentious mess.However, that is not to say the film is without it's virtues. The lead performance by Depp is both strong and highly charismatic. Again, as he proved with this year's overrated Pirates of the Caribbean, Depp can be relied upon to bring grit and grace to otherwise lukewarm films. He gets decent support from Lena Olin and from an extended cameo from Langella. The first half of the film manages to entertain, and contains several excellent directorial flourishes courtesy of Polanski. The pace is kept fairly consistent (give or take the odd slow scene) until the end, despite the narrative drying up long before. The film even manages to survive a particularly out of place sex scene. The Ninth Gate is a film that had greatness in its grasp. A great director and a superb leading actor on board, if treated with care and precision by the scriptwriters, then perhaps this would have been a cult classic. As it is we get a half a good movie, and half a bad one, strung together with a terrible plot and multiple loose ends. People have baffled over the Ninth Gate, trying to resolve the questions it asks about religion and the macabre. Here's a response to these people: don't bother. Whatever you're looking for is not there.</fullReview>

The fact that it moves rather slow at times IMO adds to the feeling of the movie, but may be a downer to those with a short attention span. If you're into atmospheric movies watch this one.

		<shortDescription>Lavish, but mostly empty-headed and stupid horror/suspense film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* 1/2 out of ****For an hour or so, there's a certain charm to The Ninth Gate. Up to this point, the storyline, though at times a little illogical, is thoroughly engrossing and it does make you wonder how everything is going to wrap itself up. Then, those last 70 minutes do a complete 360, turning a possible Grade A suspense film into a cheap and lousy schlocky B-flick.The story involves a man named Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), a man who investigates books and their authenticity. He's just been hired by a mysterious fellow named Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) to find out whether his copy of "The Ninth Gate", a book purported to be written by the Devil himself, is the real deal. It is only one of three copies still in existence and one of those three is the authentic one.Corso's journey leads him to a path of danger and odd characters. There's a woman named Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) who's also looking for the real copy and a mysterious blond woman (Emmannuelle Seigner) who constantly follows Corso around. He eventually allies himself with this blond woman, and together they search for the truth behind these books and the reasons so many people are after it.Director Roman Polanski has real talent, make no doubt about it. With The Ninth Gate, he proves himself capable of creating a palpable and somewhat tense atmosphere, but is never able to truly deliver suspense or scares in any form whatsoever. The film mostly maintains its slow pace, which is not particularly a terrible thing, it just starts to become unbearable in the final half hour when every plotting device and dialogue become either redundant or excruciatingly lame.Polanski obviously tries to up the energy factor in the second half, which is a mistake. He places in some gunplay and fistfights, the latter of which looks extremely goofy, with his real-life wife Seigner effortlessly floating in the air and knocking some hitman around with martial arts moves.The film's worst flaw is probably the fact that the movie's story goes nowhere. For 133 minutes, you watch an intriguing storyline build up to one of the more pointless finales I've seen in a long time. I would have been willing to give the film ** if not for the annoying final shot and lack of clarity and conclusion.As I said before, Polanski's direction is more than competent, but the screenwriting is lackluster. John Brownjohn's script begins in solid fashion, but as it ventures to a closing, it starts to lose any semblance of intelligence or crediblity. Characters act stupidly, say the dumbest things to one another, and the attempts at humor are misplaced.Are there any other positive aspects? Well, the acting is fairly decent. Nobody involved is spectacular, but at least they don't look embarrassed, which is an accomplishment in itself. Johnny Depp plays the whole thing in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek manner, and he's fairly good at inhabiting his character. Emmanuelle Seigner is surprisingly decent, too. With all the criticism against her acting ability, I was sure she would be the worst of the cast, but she does a fair job. Lena Olin and Frank Langella are both suitably menacing and creepy for the brief moments they do appear, though both do go over-the-top at certain times.The Ninth Gate is a horror film that will appeal to certain audiences, I'm sure. The ambience and the look of the film will probably gain it some sort of cult following, but there's hardly anything else truly worth watching.</fullReview>

Subdued colours, shadows and attention to detail make this a classier film than many that will be put in a similar category.

Within the first 10 minutes, I knew the movie was about weird spiritual and mystical things. It was not that hard to pick up. Gradually, the plot unraveled throughout the movie, yet at the same time, it kept getting thicker. At almost every point in the movie, it seemed like all your questions were about to be answered, but no. It never happened.The unnecessary sex scene at the end shocked me, and the girl next to me actually gasped when she realized what was going on. What purpose did that scene serve?I like unanswered questions in a movie. It leaves a lot up to the imagination of the person. Interpretation is very important in a movie. But when those unanswered questions are just plain stupid and SHOULD be answered in the movie, I have to say the movie was stupid in itself.

		<shortDescription>Spoiler... Spectacular film, that ending though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate is a masterpiece, it deserves nothing less. The film captures you from start to finish as Corso (Jonny Depp) evolves from money hungry book dealer to Lucifers chosen. As a believer in God myself (And as someone who will always have hope that there are ancient, other-worldly, supernatural things in this world) I found this film to be not only fascinating and thought gripping, but also dark and terrifying. For example, when Corso gives "the girl" (Emmanuelle Seigner) some ice for her neck after the confrontation by the water and she takes off his glasses, Corso looks deeply into her eyes and notices for the first time something that could be considered other worldly or supernatural (he doesn't see her float down the steps during the fight). After re-watching the film over again with Polanskis commentary, I can see why that scene was his favorite. There is something remarkably sexy and terrifying about Emmanuelles character as her eyes glow, and as she places her blood on his forehead you can't help but realize thats she's marking Corso for something greater. During the course of the film it is slowly made apparent that Corsos strange companion "the girl" is the incarnation of Lucifer himself, or at least his servant. This is only made more apparent during the sex scene in front of the burning castle, for you see her face constantly shift from that of a stunningly beautiful woman to the frightening smile of something dark and malevolent. One reviewer on here wrote something I really liked (I apologize ahead of time for not remembering anyone that I mentions name, but you know who you are and I thank you for being awesome!). They wrote about "the girl" being the whore of Babylon which is who I thought she was the first time around (and still do). They equated the WoB to Lucifer himself, which made a lot of sense when you consider the fact that often times whores (male or female) are in charge, manipulating and calling the shots from behind the curtain so to speak. Another reviewer wrote something about the twin brothers who had the real ninth engraving in their workshop and how the place where they reside may exist outside of time and space, and that they may be in cahoots with Lucifer as well. This makes sense when you go back and see that the only other person around is a small child who says the same thing in both instances "Si Si mama!" also both sets of brothers are more or less the same, not to mention the second set of "hermanos" basically set Corso up to receive the authentic ninth engraving. I thought the ending was great, almost a "decide for yourselves type of ending, but I wanted it to be slightly different for purely selfish reasons. When Corso looks into the last real engraving and begins his walk through the ninth gate, I wanted there to be a moment where he pauses, the music shifts to something foreboding like a dark choir, and looks forward to see the Whore of Babylon, as terrifying as she is beautiful, atop the beast with seven heads in all its terrible splendor. The camera would show a few of the heads, each snarling and howling with its eyes aglow. Then the camera would shoot over to the WoB, and focuses on her face which has found a balance between angelic and horrifying. Corso would then continue his walk towards the beast, the girl, and the gate into beautiful madness. (Someone else on here made the point that Corso is the man in the book and also the seven headed beast (which I agree with)), I just would have loved to watch that scene,Im a sucker for monsters...And beautiful blond women</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil and the Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The journey is definitely the most enjoyable aspect of "The Ninth Gate". Although some feel the final destination is a bit of a let down, I don't think it's all that bad; it would be hard for any ending to be totally satisfying after the long and absorbing build-up, which occupies most of the movie.Johnny Depp was the perfect choice to play Dean Corso, the slightly disreputable book dealer who receives a commission from wealthy book collector, Boris Balkan, to find copies of a rare book supposedly written by the Devil. Frank Langella gives Boris Balkan lashings of the urbane and cultivated gravitas that he has honed to perfection over the years.Corso's journey takes him to some fantastic locations across Europe and these add to the richness of the film. He also meets fascinating characters along the way including two beautiful women played by Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner, who with their broad cheekbones and calm exteriors have a similar, arresting look; they could almost be sisters.Polanski is such a clever filmmaker that we are led to believe that rare book collecting is just about the most important pursuit in the world. The look of the film is sumptuous and there are some delicious exchanges between Corso and Balkan, reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet in "The Maltese Falcon".In fact, the book at the centre of the story, "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows", acts in much the same way as does the falcon in Huston's classic movie ? it's the 'McGuffin' that drives everything forward. Despite English being his second language, Polanski has always had an ear for the language, and the script has a lightness of touch helped in the playing by a slightly tongue-in-cheek performance by Depp and a slightly over-the-top one by Langella.Polanski's films always have great music and Wojciech Kilar contributed an atmospheric score for this one, with an appropriately quirky theme for Corso as well as some suitably eerie passages for the supernatural elements.For anyone who likes movies that are built around intriguing investigations, this film delivers. I have seen it quite a few times and enjoy it just as much each time ? I think that is about the best endorsement you can give any movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller about bookworms!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Langella is a wealthy collector of rare books who hires expert investigator Johnny Depp to travel around France and make sure that his, Langella's, copy of a medieval book is authentic by comparing it to the two or three other copies known to exist.The content of the book has some sort of supernatural significance. As Depp probes into the other copies he finds that all three are identical except for some discrepancies in the nine illustrations. Most of the illustrations carry the initials of the historical artist, but scattered among the existing pictures are slightly different illustrations signed by "LCR" -- or "Lucifer." It emerges that an examination of the Lucifer illustrations leads (somehow) to a ritual that will enable the successful puzzler to enter the Ninth Gate and become all powerful -- or something.There's not a car chase or an exploding fireball in the whole movie, and only one gun shot, which is a bloodless mercy killing. Now, that's a refreshing fact in itself. This is a thriller based on character, everyday incidents, and mooning over musty old books, and it works.I was grateful too for the absence of supernatural special effects. Granted that Emmanuelle Seigner's strong-jawed face and hypnotic, feral, and almost horrifyingly beautiful green eyes, sometimes takes on a demonic aspect, but that's it. All the events we witness could actually take place.All the events except one. And that's the last one. Depp solves the final puzzle. Don't ask me how, but one of the illustrations has a naked babe riding some kind of monster, the babe resembles a 17th-century version of Seigner, and that opens up the Ninth Gate for Depp. I missed the first fifteen minutes of the film so the answers may lie there.On the other hand, Polanski's work has always had one feature that has sometimes weakened the whole work, and that's a surprise, usually tragic ending, a final bitter twist. He was into tragic endings long before the Manson affair. "Rosemary's Baby" involved devils before the flesh-and-blood devils destroyed Polanski's family. Even a comedy like "The Fearless Vampire Killers" ended disappointingly in an unamusing way.The last shot is of a figure we presume to be Depp walking through the portals of a blindingly back-lighted château. I couldn't figure it out.What I enjoyed most was seeing the troglodytic Johnny Depp wandering around Paris in his extra-long overcoat and poking into musty old book stores with comic proprietors, or into private collections in the hands of oddly eccentric characters who have monstrous lesbian secretaries.What I enjoyed second-most -- and this is a confession -- was watching the wild-eyed Frank Langella convincing himself that he has solved the puzzle of the illustrations, has become immortal and pain-free, then setting himself ablaze and finding out that he was WRONG. I don't usually laugh at full-body burns but I was expecting some computerized imaging to transform Langella into a Disneyoid manticore and, instead, here he is, running around yelling and brushing at the flames just as the rest of us mortals would! Langella is pretty good, by the way. Depp is required to be polite and introverted. (That is, he doesn't act like an American.) Seignier is given a lot of attention, but I never could figure out her role in the story.Not bad overall. Perhaps better than that, if you catch it from the beginning, as I did not.</fullReview>

Depp is an immensely talented actor, but he also has about as much charisma as the character of the spider-chewing Renfield in a "Dracula" movie.They say that the Devil is in the details, and THE NINTH GATE certainly proves it, in spades (or Hanged Men, if you want to use Tarot cards).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a good movie thanks to two names: Roman Polanski and Johnny Depp. One is a unique incredible director and the other is an unusual bohemian actor, "one of the Hollywood's biggest failures" (and thank God, I wish a few more actors would fall to the same level of greatness). Strong presence of those two in the movie made it enjoyable and even interesting though the plot was a little bit of a disappointment. A good story on the whole if you think about it, but a few moments of the movie were indeed very disposable and could have as easily be in the "unseen footage". On the other hand a few other moments could have been developed further and brought out in the storyline. The choice of one of the leading actresses is also very questionable, Emmanuelle Seigner somehow just doesn't fit into the role of a satanic guardian angel. One thing I can't say anything bad about is the quality of the movie, it is simply perfectly done, perfectly edited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither super nor natural</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess that I'm no great lover of films involving the ocult, but I feel the best examples of this genre are those which initially set up a perfectly normal background, so that the supernatural element when it emerges has a truly shocking effect. Classics of this type are Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now and M Night Shyamalin's The Sixth Sense. Part of the failure of this Polanski movie is that it doesn't try to set up a natural context. Straightaway, we are plunged into a portentious world where invoking the Devil is a possibility; rather than letting this awesome prospect creep up on us. Partly, the fault lies with Johnny Depp as book expert, Dean Corso; whatever Depp's merits, he finds it impossible to be anything other than idiosyncratic. A blander appearance and performance - preferably a beardless non-smoker - would have been better, at least for the first reel or so.On the other hand, the movie doesn't grip us with great visual interest or shocking diabolical effects. The opportunity for spooky visuals, eg in Toledo, is wasted; and nothing much supernatural happens, apart from The Girl's (Emmanuelle Seigner's) eyes shining from time to time, and every location - including Paris - being depopulated whenever Corso and The Girl turn up. Also on view are Lena Olin making the most of her (or her double's) body; and Frank Langella making the most of his ability to over-act. Overall, I found this movie slow, melodramatic, and not a bit scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil is in the details.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I looked forward to seeing this film but could not have been more disappointed. It is too long, redundant in plot, visually uninteresting, and annoying in its factual inaccuracies.Now I don't want to seem picky, but if a story's protagonist is a bibliophile and the premise is his search for certain illustrated recondite texts, then perhaps it would be a good idea to do one's research on the topics, but this is not the case with "The Ninth Gate." First, the book-illustrations are referred to repeatedly as "engravings" (which involves cutting into a metal plate, usually zinc), although a rudimentary knowledge of printmaking-technique shows them to be woodcuts (cutting into a wood block). But then again, engravings/woodcuts, they're all the same, right? Second, Polanski dates these "engravings" to the 17th-century, although an equally rudimentary knowledge of the history of style in printmaking shows them to belong to the late 15th-century, specifically in the manner of the German master Albrecht Duerer. But then again, what's a couple of hundred years here or there? And third, in an early scene (when Depp's character examines a small private collection of rare books up for sale), he refers to (or tries to refer to) a landmark in the history of early illustrated texts, Franceso Colonna's "Hypnertomachia Poliphilo" (Venice, 1499). Sorry, that's "Poliphili," which means "of Poliphilo," Colonna's hero. Depp's line renders the title nonsensical.Well, okay, perhaps I really am being picky here, but it seems to me that such seemingly minor errors of fact reveal something about "The Ninth Gate" generally: it's just slapped together. The Devil is in the details!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see The Ninth Gate about a week ago, thinking it would be something like Tecmo's Deception where some guy is trying to revive Satan and ends up killing people in the process. The previews and commercials made this movie look so much more exciting than it truly was. I sat there in the theater, waiting for something "exciting" to happen. Nothing happened. Oh wait, there was a whole lot of talking and traveling, if you consider that something. However, the movie had some intriguing points. But, it was not enough to hold my interest. This is the only movie I've seen in theaters that made me say "Thank God" when it was over. Not even Primary Colors or Deep Impact or even Godzilla for that matter have ever made me say that. My opinion, just get the novel, it's probably way better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How could a movie that started out so promising turn into such a disappointment? Just watch Polanski's THE NINTH GATE to find out. In the beginning, all the elements were there to make an engrossing, suspenseful horror flick. I was totally sucked in by Depp and the situation he found himself in. Who wouldn't want to trek across the globe in search of immortality/invincibility etc? Even after the slightly slow first hour, I still had hope that Polanski would pull it off. Was I wrong. From a slow beginning the film progressed to a snail's crawl. In a truly scary horror film, it is easy to overlook a character's flaws and stupidity because at least your getting an adrenaline rush. THE NINTH GATE offered nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat. Even the sex wasn't all that hot. Don't get me wrong, the film was beautiful and the performances were fine, it just seems wasted on a story which goes nowhere. I know I'm offending a plethora of Polanski fans when I say this, but this film was not one of his best efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last movie of Roman Polanski ( Nine Gate ) is bad movie.I save Depp, Seigner for performance, but Polanski disappoint, for various reasons. Many are the errors of screenplay,one for all : "The police where is?"The story starts well, but after some minutes we imagine all that will happen. The final is very ridiculous, about me could finish 10 min before have would better. The scene with Depp &amp; Seigner in the car seems that be make by a beginner,( the super car seems a slow car) and on the combat scene ( that near the bridge) I prefer put a pitying voile ( seem that Polanski want copy Matrix scenes with terrible results). The horror scenes make a great laugh. The sexy final scene want remember us that the Seigner is always a beautiful girl. But a thought jump in my mind; we are speaking about Polanski, author of great movies, therefore I have a doubtful : "If Roman Polanski has wanted make a Jokes to all ? ".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Roman Polanski Goes to Hell with Johnny Depp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being hired by Frank Langella (as Boris Balkan), "Johnny Depp unlocks the gates to hell, in Roman Polanski's newest thriller. Depp stars as Dean Corso, an unscrupulous rare-book dealer who is hired to locate the remaining copies of 'The Nine Gates of the Shadow Kingdom,' a demonic manuscript that can summon the Devil. Corso becomes embroiled in a conspiracy involving murder, theft, and satanic ritual; and, ultimately finds himself confronting the devil incarnate," according to official synopsis.In order to look old, bookish Depp occasionally has a chalk-like substance added to his temples. He treats rare old books indelicately, and sometimes blows tobacco smoke on them. Despite these early warnings, "The Ninth Gate" becomes intriguing, as Depp's character unfolds the mysteries of three Satanic volumes, and their differing illustrations. Emmanuelle Seigner and Lena Olin are obviously bad news, but Depp messes with them anyway.The major film's main weakness in that it doesn't go anywhere with its promising storyline; and, most importantly, it lacks a satisfactorily ending. You might even call it incoherent (see for yourself, if you dare). Darius Khondji's cinematography, and wheelchair-bound devil worshiper Barbara Jefford (as Baroness Kessler) are strengths.***** The Ninth Gate (8/25/99) Roman Polanski ~ Johnny Depp, Emmanuelle Seigner, Barbara Jefford</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's amazing how a great Director like Polanski can make such crap! I was hoping he had his tongue in cheek, but it's more like we have our fingers in our throats! Cliché followed by numbing cliché. Depp out of his Deppth! Langella over the top again! Lena Olin is hysterical! So many holes in the plot they should have made this in Switzerland!Doing a movie about the devil is always risky because if you don't manage to create evil, you end up creating farce! The closest this movie gets to evil is Lena Olin's imitation of cat woman, and she gets to do it twice! If it was a good movie one could forgive some of the WTF plotting that permeates the screen. Langella has a book that "may" have been written by "The Devil" and he hands it over to Depp to shlepp around Europe with it! Why? To see if it's authentic! And how do we know i's authentic? Why Lucifer signs his initials on the drawings! Freaking brilliant!Depp who is supposed to be a rare book wheeler dealer continually smokes cigarettes while poring over the book. In this movie everybody smokes, and when we see the Lucky Strike pack always nearby we know who helped bankroll the movie, not to mention Shell, whose sign is displayed everywhere, even outside a Hotel! C'mon Roman! Bad guys keep following Depp to steal the book, which isn't hard as Johnny keeps it with him for the first half of the movie, and even leaves it on a library table while he's off trying to find a mysterious blond student (Polanski's wife: flat affect and all) - who as it turns out can fly, but Johnny never notices!Lo and behold the book is finally stolen by Lena Olin's henchmen, one of them a gay African with dyed blond hair, who manages to miss many opportunities to just march up to Depp and steal the GD book. Langella is P.O.'d that his book is stolen so how does he get it back? He walks into Lena's cabal and takes it! Oyve! Then to prove he's gained the power of the Devil the dumb Schmuck pours gasoline on himself and lights it. He should have at least tried it out on his pinkie! He makes a complete ash out of himself!In the end after missing out on clues such as the blond girl's flying and super hero karate, and ability to show up anywhere, and disappear at will, Johnny finally gets it! If she ain't the devil she's certainly the devil with the blue dress; so off he trots to find her! Oh and finally what irked me: every car Depp steals miraculously has the keys in it. As if!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when it came out way back when, mainly because my friend really likes Johnny Depp. I suppose that's how she stayed awake. For me, it was a chance to sleep and dream of driving through the French countryside in a Dodge Viper.I've since become a fan of Polanski; I now own DVDs of Chinatown, 9th Gate and Rosemary's Baby, and am waiting for Repulsion to arrive. I actually watch the 9th Gate fairly often, when I am tired but unable to fall asleep. The lengthy driving scenes, meditative pacing and sombre musical score are safer and healthier than valarium pills.In the director's commentary, Polanski (who, I should add, is not terribly energetic to begin with) musters something close to surprise that his film was longer and less eventful than he remembered it being. This does not give one much hope.</fullReview>

Nobody will be talking about this film in 20 years, I'm sorry to break it to you for fans of the film. Many parts of the plot are ridiculous. Depp runs out of a burning building in broad daylight and passes the secretary (who knows who he is) and isn't arrested? The hotel lets a strange woman in his room? The fight scene at where he ends up stuck in the floor is a very poor plot device. The use of special effects every time the girl appears on the screen to give her a demonic appearance are naff.

A half-mad chase for an evil, hellish book is a strange one to embark on, and it is never explained why Depp's character chooses to do this. The plot just twists round and round, eventually ending up in someone trying to summon an evil spirit, and only succeeding in burning themselves. Who knows how that happened?

The Ending - If you can call it that was hugely disappointing but still not surprising as it merely continued on the tone which the rest of the film had set. Perhaps it was badly edited to keep it from hitting the 3hr mark I don't know.

Unfortunately, once he figures out the mystery, nothing happens. I am not exaggerating here. I do not mean to say, "not much happens." I mean, NOTHING happens. One person tries to grant himself omnipotent demonic powers and fails. Johnny Depp then thinks he may have solved the mystery, and walks toward an old castle. Fade to black. Nothing happens.

		<fullReview>The thing with movies like Rosemary's baby, Ghostwriter and The Ninth Gate is that Polanski creates an environment of questions that leave you behind, after watching, with the insight that you should never take anything in life, especially what is presented as normal history and common facts of life, for granted. The power of Polansky is that he never comes to a final conclusion. Of course within the film there is a 'closure' of story facts - Rosemary gives birth to Satan, the prime minister has ties with the CIA etc.... - but something else is unsolved and left for you to explore. Usually this is something of a secret, an esoteric mystery... Polanski creates that atmosphere of secrecy by purely film-technical means; music, mis-en-scenes, camera positions, color, etc.... Never by real information. So in his soul he has access to this sacred grounds but in his films he stops at the ending.....Ninth Gate for sure has a bad ending. No clue why. But the movie as a whole leaves me, again and again, with the feeling i have not yet looked behind the veil of what is presented to me as 'the real facts'.Please, mister Polanski, show it to us someday. Just take the next step. I will be there!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A rare book dealer, while seeking out the last two copies of a demon text, gets drawn into a conspiracy with supernatural overtones. In New York, the money-driven dealer Dean Corso is a rare-books expert and partner of Bernie, who owns a bookstore. He is contacted by the renowned collector of books about the devil Boris Balkan, who has just acquired the rare The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows from the collector Andrew Telfer, to verify whether his book is authentic or a forgery. Balkan explains that the book was written by the writer Aristide Torchia, in 1666, with Lucifer and he was burned at the stake with his entire work. There are only three exemplars of The Nine Gates and in accordance with the legend, its nine engravings form a riddle to conjure the devil. The skeptical Corso accepts the assignment and has to flight to Sintra, Portugal, and Paris, France, to contact the owners Victor Fargas and Baroness Kessler and find the genuine exemplar for Balkan. Meanwhile, he asks Bernie to hide the rare book. Before traveling to Europe, the widow Liana Telfer wants to retrieve the book and has sex with Corso. Roger Ebert wrote "The movie does a good job of mirroring its deaths with situations from the Tarot deck, and making the Telfer widow (Olin) more sinister by (I think) inserting electronic undertones beneath her speech. I also liked the atmosphere evoked by the dialogue, which isn't too dumbed down, uses some of the jargon of the book trade and allows us to follow Corso's process of deduction as he figures out what the engravings mean and what Balkan's true motives are. It's just that a film of such big themes should be about more than the fate of a few people; while at the end I didn't yearn for spectacular special effects, I did wish for spectacular information--something awesome, not just a fade to white." I thought The Ninth Gate was extremely interesting. It certainly sustained my interest throughout and that is the mark of a good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished the film and wondering how hard Roman Polanski must have rode the entire film crew, so the seamlessness and steadiness of the story-telling appears as we see it. Polanski's strength is always with the great combination of all the shots that move the story forward. I doubt it if he can endure a dull moment in any of his pictures. As a Buddhist, I am quite foreign to the concepts of God and the Devil. Not something I heard growing up. However, Polanski's masterful story-telling allows people like myself to join and enjoy the ride, nonetheless. I get to understand the power of these two creations, God and the Devil, to the believers. I can see how the mysterious woman helper, played by Polanski's own wife, is the Devil himself (or should I say herself?), and gets his/her will at the very end. Film students can learn a lot from Polanski in his skills in make-believe and the suspension of disbelief. It proves to me that all the computer- based special effects can sustain the audience only at the film's viewing time, for the lingering memory is quite short-lived. While, as Polanski shows us here, deep understanding of human psyche and psychology is much imprinting for a film, as classic novels are. In short, Polanski only knows how to make classics.</fullReview>

He has a job for Dean Corso, Depp. Corso needs to find the remaining copies of the Nine Gates. These books are old and are used supposedly to conjure up the devil. Corso is given a sum of money to travel overseas, and track down the remaining copies. Once there Corso travels from Spain to France. When he gets there he observes the copy in Spain and France; and notices some changes in the book. He also notices that he is being followed by a mysterious girl. He contacts Balkan and begins to wonder if this trip is all worth it. He feels like he is being followed wherever he goes. He tells Balkan he wants out, but realizes it's impossible. Once the owners of the two books get murdered, he realizes there is more to the story. The mysterious girl helps him though out the movie, especially when his life is endangered from the owner of the book before Balkan bought it. Her name is Telford and she will do anything to get her hands on the copy Corso has. She eventually does; but in the end she meets Balken; and she becomes his pawn. In the end Balkan appears and gets all three copies of the Nine Gates. He uses the pages he needs from each book to show Corso he can conjure up the devil himself. He believe he is all powerful, but little does he know the ninth engraving is a forgery, which eventually leads to his demise. This movie even though it seems and sounds strange is actually a great movie. It has everything, suspense, action, drama, and a little romance. It's a movie that will keep you glued from the beginning to the end; and the with Langella/Depp it's a hit.THX, Kris L. CocKayne</fullReview>

But it's Polanski that doesn't have a grasp on the tone. There's full blown hilarious camp, such as what happens to the old woman in the wheelchair and then scenes that are darker. The score is also terrible. Despite all the film's problems, it's diverting enough to hold your attention and is nicely shot. But it's the ending that doesn't so much end, as it just stops.

		<shortDescription>Interesting Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate is certainly an interesting movie to watch and it seems to be more than one would expect. By the designs of the film, one would expect it to be a horror or thriller, but it's more of a mystery and one about people. This is not Roman Polanksi's best film by far, but it's still rather enjoyable and something that is worth watching.Polanksi's film is about a rare books collector named Dean Corso who has been asked to search for some very rare books that are believed to have the power to summon Satan himself.As for acting, Johnny Depp does pretty good in his role. He delivers a strong, perhaps a bit flawed performance. Frank Langella is also pretty good and some has some strong scenes to boast about.Overall, this film is a decent supernatural "thriller" that may be interesting to watch. This film had potential to be more than it is, but the product we got is still very watchable and even intense at times. It had a few chilling moments as well. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting premise breaks apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate starts promisingly - an immoral, unscrupulous book dealer is tasked with uncovering the secrets behind a middle-age occult novel which was purportedly written in conjunction with Lucifer himself.Roman Polanski is excellent at portraying cities - from the skyscrapers of New York through to its dinghy rare book stores and rain-flecked streets. Likewise, Paris and surrounding Europe gets fine treatment as with his previous flicks. Most of the acting jobs here are done well, especially Johnny Depp who portrays the nonchalant, cynical protagonist with measured calculation ("All I care about is my percentage..."). The first half of the film unfolds slowly and methodically, with a subtle sense of dread underlying proceedings.It's a shame, then, that the movie takes its atmosphere and characterisation and squanders it in its final third. We are treated to over-the-top occult psychobabble, some silly fight scenes, and somewhat cheap special effects. Some reviewers championing this film have complained that people may not 'get' the film. I think most do understand its underlying concept and twist, and are complaining (validly, in my view) that it's carried off in such a haphazard, glaring and abrupt way that it ruins the atmosphere which Polanski spent the first hour of the film building up.If you want a good psychological, occult-themed thriller with twice the atmosphere, better performances, and a ending that's half as half-baked (went there), check out Angel Heart instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" ad usum Delphini"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting, subtle and nice. New exploration of a old subject with the desire to present the truth about a bookish hero.Good exercise of image and form of rehabilitation.A childish story, with delicate emotion and many clichés.Tale for West sensibility about a Prince Charming in the skin of vampire. And parts of real facts for a decent taste."Ninth Gate" is interesting for good intentions of script, for the temptation to create another image of Dracula, for presence of Romanian good actors (Maia Morgenstern like example), for the historical atmosphere. The only problem is the respect for real facts. For a stranger the film may be a revelation. For Johnny Depp is a caricature. Names of fiction and of reality are mixed for create a flavor. The relation with Orthodox Church is simplificated with some shadows like in "Da Vinci Code". Vlad Tepes is a puppet of time and religion. And the end is last element of romantic puzzle.So, I don't know if it is a good film. The intention is generous but the result is mediocre. For many reasons it is a film " ad usum Delphini", good for a image about a character, fake for the image of twin booksellers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had this been a straightforward mystery thriller it might have worked. It starts off well with Depp and Langella quickly getting into their stride. Depp is adept at portraying the flawed, slightly down-beat genius, and Langella is master of the sinister, powerful and mysterious gent.Where it goes wrong is with the first rather farcical fight scene, which appears totally against the grain and frankly is unnecessary. Suggested jeopardy is often more powerful than actually showing it. It gets worse, with some dubious special effects and rather hammy acting.What makes it watchable is the intrigue and Depp's obvious jeopardy, a genuine mystery surrounding the books, and a mysterious girl whose role is not made clear until the very end.A good story, spoilt by unnecessary and flawed action scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ninth Gate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Roman Polanski is among the most talented, perceptive, and intelligent directors to work in modern cinema. He made his mark with "Rosemarys Baby", and established the efficacy of his genius in the perfection of "Chinatown". The adaptation of Robert Townes script, and the relentless pursuit of the tenor, and ethos of depression era Los Angeles was nothing short of perfection. Since his intro film "Knife in the Water", and the disturbing, and imaginative,"Repulsion", Polanski never fails to deliver both technically, and imaginatively brilliant filmaking. Using a megastar such as Johnny Depp, and casting stalwarts like Barbara Jeffords only solidifies the perceptive and intuitive genius that Polanski has shown over the breadth of his career."The Ninth Gate" fits his profile like a cinematic glove. Kudos to Frank Langella, and especially Lena Olin for their work. I am a BIG Polanski admirer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski does it better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a competent semi-horror film directed by Roman Polanski in 2000. It stars Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, our hero, and Frank Langella as Boris Balkan, our villain. Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner (wife of Polanski) are our sex interests. "The Ninth Gate" is in the same genre as "The Omen" and "The Exorcist" - adult horror films based on some involvement or other with the devil and having adults who refuse to accept the existence of such a beast. Polanski does it better, though. In "The Ninth Gate" the issue isn't whether the devil is real and what we're seeing is attributable to Satan and his minions. The issue, on the surface, is whether one particular book is a genuine 17th Century work. There are two other extant copies, and Corso is hired by Balkan to look at the other two and compare the works. Corso is told that if he determines that any one of the three is real and if Balkan's copy is a forgery, Corso is to acquire the real copy at any price.We follow Corso as he goes to Europe and meets with the owners of the two other copies. Things go horribly wrong even before he leaves New York, and if we're paying attention, we realize that the horrible events mirror the engraved images in the mystery book, which is about Satan. Accidents befall Corso and the owners of the other two copies, again suggesting the graven images. Rather than making Corso dumb and ignoring the obvious hints as do the characters in "The Omen" and "The Exorcist," Corso picks up on what's going on and begins to search not just for the other copies but for the underlying reason for the events unfolding before him. Ultimately, the true search has nothing to do with the physical copies of the book but with the metaphysical truths which may be shown in the engravings. Although the movie has no great themes nor depths of characters, Polanski and Depp keep it moving and keep our interest piqued as Corso parses his way through the variations among the three copies, deducing why the differences exist and why they're spread among the three books. Polanski keeps us in the dark about the identity of the character played by Seigner, so you're on your own in determining who she really is. "The Ninth Gate" is not a great movie, but, to mix my metaphors since the movie is about books, it's a real page turner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Gothic Horror/Thriller, if a bit complex at times.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb)Dean Corso, a rare book dealer, is appointed by a renowned book collector, Balkan, to verify the authenticity of one of his books. According to sources, only three copies of that book exist, and in three different places. After losing his friend who has been killed for that book, he leaves on the mission. He wants to verify Balkan's book but finds something else! During his dramatic travels through Paris and Madrid, too many things beyond his expectations are revealed!Ninth Gate is a great oddity of a film. It's often surreal, complex but always fascinating and engrossing. The story is heavy with Gothic themes, with a very creepy atmosphere surrounding it. The finale is especially intense, and really had me on the edge of my seat. Johnny Depp is perfectly suited for the main role while Frank Langellas is terrifying in his role. Performances Johnny Depp gives yet another fascinating show. He's on the ball the whole two hours or so, and the main reason why I remained interested, even after two hours. He's mesmerizing to watch, and his performance is utterly captivating. Frank Langella is a madman here, fittingly terrifying. I couldn't take my eyes off of him, and he gave me the willies. Lena Olin plays seductive like nobody can and she plays her role to perfection here. Emmanuelle Seigner is great as the mysterious woman; I was intrigued by her the whole way. Bottom line. It's confusing, but not in a bad manner. Simply put I was too fascinated for it to hinder me too much. If you want a good Gothic thriller, look no further. Patience will be required. 8 ? 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked this film up in a bargain basket and was expecting the typical horror flick and a mindless ninety minutes. I like Johnny Depp and respect the work of Roman Polanski so I was curious to see what the movie was like. Well, it was well-paced, well-acted, had a great score, had a lot of humor, and did not disappoint. The story involves the search for old mysterious books and the "supernatural" side of the story actually takes second place to this action. I actually picked up on the identity of "the girl" about halfway through the movie but the clues were obvious. She floated on several occasions and so I realized that she was not "human". Even so, I was anxious to find out how Corso finally made out with his endeavor. To compare this to "Rosemary's Baby" is just silly. Sit back and enjoy a great story, with a lot of humor, fine acting, and a satisfying finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polanski is in Top Form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Book detective Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is hired to track down two copies of a book allegedly written by the devil himself, as a third owner thinks his copy may be a forgery. He travels to France and Portugal and anywhere else he must, but you never know where you may end up when you're tracking the devil... could be very dangerous.The movie stars crowd favorite Johnny Depp alongside cult favorite Frank Langella. I suppose Depp could be called a cult favorite, too -- a big star now, he has done his share of horror and weird flicks.Polanski is very concerned about "physique" when casting, which is why he wanted Johnny Depp and the actor in the opening scene (who was not an actor at all, but a production designer).The film is fantastic. A bit long, but not boring -- it has a steady stream of suspense, a solid plot, some intrigue, and you want to know more... Polanski excels with Satanic topics. It is very much, plotwise, a precursor to John Carpenter's "Cigarette Burns". (I have never heard Carpenter acknowledge this, but he must have known of this film.) Props to whoever decided to have Depp smoking Lucky Strikes, the most classy of all known cigarettes. That really adds to his character's tendencies to add a refined mystique to his exterior, while maintaining an impoverished home life.The DVD features commentary from the legendary Roman Polanski. His English seems forced at times, but do not let that take away from the rare opportunity to hear from the master. Never mind the fact his voice gives out after a while from eating too much chocolate and smoking a cigar.This movie is really quite amazing, and it makes me want to read the book it's based off of, "El Club Dumas", though I truly wonder if it could be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is Satan controlling Dean Corso, or is he controlling Satan? That's a question you'll be asking yourself midway through this film. Johnny Depp gives a decent performance, but somehow, it deserves to be in more interesting movie. Most of the time, he's lighting one cigarette after another, or reading one book after another. The movie works on some levels. As a piece of storytelling, however, it leaves much to be desired. I don't see the point of the flying girl. Is she a part of this guy's fate, or some kind of companion? Either way, I don't really buy it. As for Boris Balkan, could he be Satan? His final scenes seem to imply it. The movie starts out very interesting (I even enjoyed the opening theme!), but the longer it plays out, the less sense it makes. ** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ninth Gate -- A Satanic film that does not quite get off the ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's "Ninth Gate" has a great set up. Corso (Johnny Depp), a book dealer, cheats people out of very expensive books and then sells them on the market to make a hefty profit. He is also an expert on rare books and can tell the different between a 16th century edition of Cervantes' Don Quixote and the forgery. One day, he is given a mysterious assignment by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who wants to know whether his book, "The Nine Gates," is a forgery or not. The assignment is strange, because Corso is convinced that the book is genuine and that a comparison with the two other "Nine Gates" in existence is unnecessary. Then Corso embarks on several misadventures.Unfortunately Corso's misadventures do not play very well, since there is a very strong undercurrent of silliness and persistent dullness in Polanski's "Ninth Gate." No adequate explanation is given to why Corso, all of a sudden, becomes obsessed with the satanic secrets hidden in the Ninth Gate books. More importantly, why would anyone want to go through the Ninth Gate anyway? If the Ninth Gate leads to hell, then presumably there is no point in finding this gate since no one wants to get stuck in the afterlife prematurely. If on the other hand, the Ninth Gate is the conduit leading to Faustian pact, then what does Corso expect to gain from this pact? None of these questions are answered, with the result that we see Corso wandering aimlessly in a journey that has no apparent purpose. The only saving grace is some of Woijciech Kilar's Satanic score and the lovely European scenery, but that's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely a movie of dialog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could be considered more of a mystery mixed with a Satanic Easter egg hunt. Anyone viewing this film expecting to be scared or see horrifying images of gore, monsters, blood, etc, will be severely disappointed. The film is more interested in presenting dialog and sporadic evil ambience's. In many ways , this film could be compared with other films like the 1957 Curse of the Demon, where the directors decide its often better to not show the evils and let the viewers mind do the work{ not the films endless visuals } I can understand how many people would despise this film, because it really isn't a horror film , but I can also understand how others may love this type of slow burn, dialog filled production. Like many films that depend on mainly dialog and acting { instead of gore, sex, blood, monsters, etc} , this film may need to be watched a few times to get the feel for it. Then again,I can see how many viewers would have no desire to re-watch a film that bored them . If Polanski had added a few extra minutes of visual horror, into this film, it could have been a classic IMHO. Positives :solid acting solid dialog atmospheric soundtrack clever and eerie storylineNegatives: can be boring at times lacking visual horrors Satan is never fully presented in the horrific visual images we expect anti- climatic endingI would like to mention something that no one else seems to mention. Its very possible that Polanski also was trying to subtly reveal the evil secret society's and their rumored rituals . Groups like the Talmudists, FreeMasons, etc . Stanely Kubrick [ also Jewish, like Polanski} also touched upon the actions of these rumored sinful sects with his film "Eyes Wide Shut" . To put it simply, Most people who love Halloween or Friday the 13th will be bored by this film and probably rate it 3 or less. Other viewers who enjoy films like Picture of Dorian Gray Curse of Demon Curse of Frankenstein will probably enjoy this film much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pact with the Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Looking completely serene without a care in the world Andrew Telfer,Willy Holt, after finishing a number of letters and sealing them in their envelopes calmly steps on top of a footstool and puts a rope, fastened to a chandelier, around his neck taking one last step beyond by kicking it away and hanging himself. This horrific and insane act on Telfer's part leaves the audience wondering what exactly was the reason to make him do this self-destructive act. You get the answer soon enough when New York rare book dealer the anything for a quick buck Dean Corso, Johnny Depp, comes on the scene within minutes after Telfers demise.For some strange and unexplained reason Telfer had sold this rare book about Satanism to rare book collector Boris Balkan, Frank Langella, who's a closet Satanist himself. Getting in touch with Corso Balkan Balkan tells the greedy and unethical book dealer that he wants him to track down the other two remaining copies of "The Ninth Gate to the Kingdom of the Shadows", the book that Telfer sold him before his suicide. Balkan wants to find out if the copy that he has is the only one of the three that's authentic.Things starts to go downhill for Corso almost as soon as he agrees to work for Balkan when his friend rear book store owner Bernie ,James Russo, whom he gave Balkan's book for safe-keeping ends up murdered. Feeling a bit strange in what he's involved with Corso also ends up getting attacked by Mrs. Telfer Liana, Lena Olin, who want's her dead husbands book back and almost ends up scratching his eyes out after trying to make like she want's to have an affair with him.Going to both Portugal &amp; France where the two other "Devil" books are located Corso is confronted with a double murder of the two people Victor Fargas &amp; Baroness Kessler, Jack Taylor &amp; Barbara Jefford, who own those two ungodly manuals of the Black Arts with them being burned beyond repair. This leaves only Balkan's book being the only one of the three left and obviously the one that's the real McCoy not a cheap and powerless imitation. It turns out that Lena has been following Corso all through his travels in Europe and the first chance that she gets in finding Corso not having the book with him has it lifted from right under his nose out of his hotel fridge where it hid it.Corso soon realize that the book is what's needed to conjure up the Devil himself by this Satanic cult that Lena heads and in return have him, the Devil, gives them all his powers that are far beyond the imagination of the human mind. Corso and a mysterious girl, Emanuelle Seigner, that he met back in New York, who like Lena followed him back to Europe track down Lena &amp; friends in this French mansion outside Paris. It's there where their having a Satanic powwow to bring their master, from hell, back here on earth. It turns out that all the chanting and praying on the part of Lena &amp; Co, through the power of the book for Satan to come back to life, from the world of the dead, and reveal himself is all for nothing. As all this is going on Balkan crashes the party and after strangling Lena chases the Satanists who did nothing at all to stop him from murdering their leader out of the place. Balkan then takes off with the book to secretly use it himself, in an abandoned monastery, in order to give himself the evil powers that Lena couldn't give them or herself.Gut spilling ending that has a totally crazed and happily insane Balkan put, or so he thought, the puzzle of the book "The Ninth Gate of the Kingdom of the Shadows" into place. Balkan by fitting together the books nine mysterious illustrations and then by chanting out a secret Satanic prayer he feels that he'll become as powerful as Satan himself. It just couldn't have happen to a nicer guy then Balkan, who by now seemed to have completely lost his mind, as he tempted both the fates and laws of nature in trying to prove his invincibility only to show to himself, and the startled movie audience, what a first class jackass he is. Balkan in dousing himself with a can of gasoline and then setting himself on fire to show himself and Corso, who tracked him down in the monastery, just how invincible he really is. Instead Balkan end up as one of the Devils many slaves who were insane enough to think that he'll reward them with eternal life by foolishly doing his bidding.As for Dean Corso he just about had enough of the rare book business, after what he went through in the movie, and decided to do his best to forget the whole thing by getting away from it all and and going legit in opening up a bed &amp; breakfast in out of the way Key West Florida.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure if my comments will constitute spoilers or not, but just to be on the safe side, I'm going to assume they will. The usual warnings apply.Johnny Depp has matured into a good actor, and it was interesting to watch a movie in which he is undergoing this maturity process. In The Ninth Gate, he plays a rare book expert who has undertaken a commission to support the provenance of a book that will supposedly call up the devil by comparing it to other extant copies of the book. As he does so, people start mysteriously dying and the other copies are destroyed.This movie is actually a reasonably good whodunnit quest sort of story....up until the last 10 minutes, where it falls miserably on its butt and leaves the entire story completely unresolved. Directed by Roman Polanski? C'mon, Roman, you can do better than that. We never find out who "The Girl" is; we never find out if he actually unlocks the secret of the book. Depp's acting performance is the only reason I gave this movie a 5. Otherwise, from that sucky ending, I'd have scored it a 2 and that would have been generous of me.</fullReview>

The bottom line is that I stayed up way too late to finish watching it, so I guess it must have been compelling. Lena Olin is just delicious as someone you want to see get her eyes gouged out. I had never heard of this film and caught it by accident and I can't believe that Roman Polanski directed it, but yet I can.

Yes! thats right! It is actually more than a synergistic effect. The movies starts with some usual incidents but as time passes scenery changes dramatically. According to me it is one of the best movies of recent time. Roman Polanski knows how to portray a simple character with such an diversified manner. People who loves horror, suspense and thriller should watch the outstanding combination of those in the Ninth Gate. It has some supernatural aspects but that is the plus point of the story. Emmanuelle Seigner was also in great form as the mysterious girl who helped Depp in some supernatural way. The story moves around Depp and his adventure through Madrid and Paris. He was appointed for a 'sounds to be simple' job but it turned out to be a 'full of risk' mission. As time passed to many aspects of that risk were revealed. Depp was to go through that not for the sake of his job but to satisfy his curiosity. The movie is not only full of mystery and suspense but it also ends in a dramatic way! In a word it is a must-see movie for all the suspense, thriller lovers! According to me both Depp and Polanski deserves awards for this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a mercenary book-hunter, employed by a mysterious wealthy man named Balkun (Frank Langella) to trace the sources of a controversial, rare manuscript which contains clues leading towards the "Ninth Gate" - the place at which the Devil is resurrected, or something to such an extent. (The film is kind of shady when it comes to what, exactly, the Ninth Gate really is.) Corso is given the manuscript and told to find out of it's genuine - he begins his journey and immediately finds himself entwined in a supernatural force. His friends are murdered, a strange woman tries to seduce him and steal the book for her own purposes, and then he finds another replica of the book - identical, save for varying drawings inside the pages.The drawings and their differences, when assorted correctly, are believed to open the Ninth Gate. Corso knows he's gotten into something deep and wants to stop - but he can't find his mysterious employer and he is constantly being pursued by a demon woman (Emmanuelle Seigner).Roman Polanski is a great director but when "The Ninth Gate" came out in 1999 it seemed to die out rather quick. I had heard bad things about the film and never got around to seeing it until just last night.Although it's not a great supernatural thriller like "Rosemary's Baby," it is very entertaining and ambiguous enough to merit repeat viewings. There's a lot of stuff I didn't understand, or things I knew I didn't pick up on, that I'm sure would enhance further viewings.However I can see where the bad reviews come from - many audiences were probably not willing to look deep enough into the film and just wanted cheap horror scares. This movie is not what the ads make it out to be. It's very atmospheric, subtle and creepy - "Jacob's Ladder" meets "The Exorcist." Depp gives a good performance and the makeup and alterations to his hair really do make him look older. (He's even got realistic grays.) After seeing this I thought he would be the perfect choice to play Doctor Gordon in the film remake of the video game "Half-Life" - he looked just like him.The rest of the cast are okay - Seigner is given little to do but look sexy and Lena Olin basically has the same thankless task. Langella is good but he's not on screen very much. It's really Depp who carries the film."The Ninth Gate" isn't a flawless movie and it isn't something that shocked me. I felt the ending in particular was a bit sloppy and too ambiguous - after reading the message boards I understand more, but there's some weird stuff that happens at the end, and unless you're a rocket scientist who picks up on really obscure stuff, there's a chance you might not really "get it." Nevertheless it held my attention throughout and it's smarter than a lot of other cheap-shlock horror movies out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewed Ninth Gate for the first time today on DVD. Disappointed in the screenplay, direction and editing. There were parts that didn't make sense to any intelligent adult. Depp's French was perfect---good coaching I assume. I liked the French and Portugese countryside scenes. Music was good. The very beginning scene held my attention. I just kept waiting for it to get better. Perhaps you would like it as a light mystery. Acting overall was good. One good aspect was that the movie didn't contain any garish scenes which could be a complete turn-off. The story-line is kind of similar to the Da Vinci code, but just a little. I hope to view that when it is film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Polanski comes back to his devilish themes. But this time not anymore with the vigour of "Rosemary's Baby". Well, this story is not even badly told. Like any suspense movie it has two stories: the one which is made by the scenes we see and the hidden one which we always expect to know in the end. However here as the story is approaching the end it begins to look like if Polanski had not the slightest idea how the movie would end and how could he disentangle the plot he has built scene after scene. Because the screenplay at the same time it's developing itself, become weaker and weaker till it reaches a climax which looks more than an anticlimax in so far as it is so inconclusive and meaningless and looking as if the director decided to end the story by any means since he didn't know how to untie the skein he had coiled. Like in the fable the mountain finished by giving birth to a mouse and a small one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the uninitiated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last two entries on my notepad after watching The Ninth Gate (1999) were "What?" and "WHAT?" It seemed I'd either somehow overlooked some intrinsically vital plot element, or the conclusion actually was that vague and unresolved. On further rumination, I've decided I didn't miss anything of importance; I was just looking in the wrong places.The Ninth Gate was Roman Polanski's first film since 1994's Death and the Maiden and as such was keenly anticipated. The fact that the promotional material, and Polanski himself, were intimating some kind of Rosemary's Baby (1968) / Chinatown (1974) blend, two of his most celebrated films, only added to the expectations. Far from the Hollywood starred (Johnny Depp), Hollywood horror thriller that many were expecting, despite Polanski's fugitive status from the US, The Ninth Gate more closely resembles a cross between Le Locataire (The Tenant,1976) and Frantic (1988), two of the directors far less appreciated films. The dispossessed, unresolved, hotels and taxis, wild goose chasery of Frantic and the deadly dark humour of Le Locataire make this film a difficult one for the uninitiated or poorly advised.The source material is a thread pared from Arturo Pérez-Reverte's multifaceted novel El Club Dumas, adapted by previous Polanski collaborator John Brownjohn. Mercenary, whiskey quaffing, chimney smoking antique book dealer Corso (Depp) is enlisted by wealthy Satan aficionado Balkan (Frank Langella) to compare one of his rare satanic volumes with the only other two known copies, ostensibly to confirm or disprove it's authenticity. This leads him across Europe and the paths of a cast of pleasingly eccentric bibliophiles, Satanists and, well, whatever it is that the insipid Emmanuelle Seigner (Mrs Polanski) is supposed to be 'acting' as. The puzzle solving inclined will find an ever accumulating in volume, though not necessarily in significance, number of hints, symbols, allegories and clues to chew on. The less intellectually energetic are best served sitting back and enjoying Depp's effortlessly cool and deeply knowing performance. In fact, the key to enjoying The Ninth Gate is not taking it seriously, not trying to piece together the clues, and just observing Polanski's craft. His only goal here is enjoyable escapism.In a film where three books collaboratively penned by the devil are the centre of attention, there is no sense of fear, no atmosphere of dread, no cloven hooves. We know from films like the darkly disturbing Repulsion (1965), and the urban alienation allegory Rosemary's Baby, that Polanski is more than capable of making his audience squirm in terror, and Chinatown shows he can hold together an elaborate mystery. The Ninth Gate seems more concerned with tipping it's hat to noir thrillers of past eras, and indeed Polanski's own films, to particularly care what the audience is feeling. Those who don't mind the journey being more important than the destination, fans of Depp, and Polanski aficionados, will find a couple of hours of entertainment here. Those hoping to scared or compelled will find themselves confounded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atmospheric satanic conspiracy thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting film with a lot more to it than first meets the eye. Polanski described this film as a "cross between Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby' though I felt more of Rosemary's baby than the other, and much more than that also. Shortly after the start, we are taken along with the protagonist into a world pervaded by an inevitable, supernatural doom, and a down-ending is sensed. Corso, and we along with him, are soon separated from ordinary reality and exposed instead to a Roman Polanski world of conspiring evil closing in.Corso is not a likable character early on in the film, and one get's the feeling that his come-uppance is due. I wondered if he would suffer a horrible fate, or change into a better person and help defeat evil, when it came down to it. I couldn't predict how the plot would unfold, as unexpected turns kept occurring. As the film developed I grew to like Corso more. Although his actions seemed to grow worse, We empathise with him more and more as his motives change from money to the need to know. We are with him, and we need to know also.The photography and details are excellent; and the slow pace, mood and settings combine to make this a really scary film. The whole riddle of the engravings in the books, and the puzzlement of their intriguing differences, helps create a very frightening atmosphere.The performances are on the whole very good and the occult characters convincing. Balkan (Frank Langella) in particular is frightening, powerful, possessive. One real horrible scene is where he strangles one of the key characters and the pushes her away in disgust by placing his foot on her back and sliding her across a polished floor with one swift kick. The real bad guys in this film are the devil-worshipers Lena Olin, Balkan and others. Corso's female aide Emmanuelle Seigner, who is obviously some kind of supernatural being, seemed very unevil in comparison. The result of this film to my mind is that it questions our ideas, expectations and attitudes about the nature of good and evil.The final scene left me with an impression not of horror; but with a sense of justice. It was and 'up' ending. It made me wonder at what Polanski wanted to convey about the nature of 'Lucifer'</fullReview>

There are no major car chases, no drawn out fight scenes, no erotic sex scenes, and yet your mind is captivated. It shows the power of the written word is still almost mystical to many people.SpoilerThe only thing that keeps this movie a ten for me is the questions left at the end. Who was the girl really? Was she the devil? A fallen angel? A minion of Hell? When did Corso go from feeling that he was trapped in a game he couldn't escape to wanting to open the Ninth Gate itself?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9th Gate..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Polanski's "the 9th Gate" is more or less "Rosemary's Baby" revisited. The only difference is that Polanski is now much more of a Hollywood director than he was in 1968. That means that while primarily the film is once again an exercise in Hitchcock-ian suspense, the narrative is more linear and generic, even adding action (car chases, martial arts) and black comedy elements. Also, the aesthetics are much less elegant and idiosyncratic.While enjoyable in it's action/ thriller crossover, the script is predictable, and it's metaphysical meaning too vague. Polanski is no philosopher; he is merely expressing his belief in the supernatural, and perhaps destiny. But when compared to the monumental neurosis/ delirium of "Le Locataire", this is a big let-down.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp is absolutely perfect for the role of Dean Corso "Book Detective". The film has one of the most interesting plots ever, truly amazing. One side of me is satisfied just by seeing a good, original movie with good acting performances. The other side wants cry out loud, frustrated and confused by how one of the greatest directors alive, supported by one of the greatest actors, can make a "mediocre" film from curtain angles, even though they had one of the greatest plot for a movie as a base.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Authentic Book Thriller With A Watch-able Spine.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can I say about this movie? It is pure authentic cinematic entertainment from start to finish. I was enthralled by Polanski's tense knife-edge plot and the nervous style of the plot. In the film everything and anything does happen. Depp is a top of his game book hunter and he's hired to find the one book legend says was written by the Devil himself. The plot twists like an eel and there's enough betrayal, back-stabbing, chases, double-crossing and hidden meanings to last you forever. The real question is, is this a wild goose-chase and will Depp's character get killed? The movie had elements that'll make you want to watch it again, with scenes having rich backgrounds, landscapes and glorious cinematography. There is a frightening occult undertone throughout and only watch it if you have nerves of steel and make sure you have a sofa to hide behind.Top class casting, plot, script and story add spice and realism to a brilliant piece of film making, using rich European back drops to encourage old world medieval gloom and forebodeing. I would recommend this film completely. It will not disappoint lovers of one man out-of-his-depth films like North By North West and chase films like Ronin. Watch and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difference between the book and movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While all you have said about the movie may well have been true, did anyone else notice that in the book Corso was a gin drinker whereas he drank Johnny Walker in the movie. The movie is far different from the book. As usual Polanski directed the movie from his screenplay and not from the book. So anything people may have surmised from watching the movie once or even ten times is purely movie effect and not Lucifer, Dumas, Three Muskateers, Quixote or demons and lovers. I think people should read the book as it helps a lot with the movie background. The movie without the book was not as exciting as it could be. But sure enough Johnny Depp with his amazing talent has carried off the role of a villain come hero.</fullReview>

Corso had a clear head. the way he took advantage of market was funny. but he still couldn't read the girl's mind although the pair of clam eyes sometimes betray her. she's no so-called head turner but certainly attractive. the sound effect is special but sometimes a bit dizzy. the colour is wonderful. i like this movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp performed amicably as the book dealer who becomes ensnared in a quest to prove the authenticity of 3 books supposing to be written by Satan. The sharp cinematography was good, made the film all the more enjoyable to watch and the storyline was an excellent concept . Unfortunately, I didn't feel as though the director conveyed the plot to the maximum extent as he could have, the opportunity was certainly there! At first, the curiosity and intrigue were prevalent and then it started to slowly decline throughout the film. The final scenes were quite a let down, it was somewhat difficult to fathom the whole film's basis from the beginning right through to the unsatisfactory ending. Mainly because the conclusion doesn't logically interweave with what is being expressed or seen in the film. One has to question the purpose of the 3 books??? So this is why I feel the plot was somewhat misleading (whether or not this was intentional, I'm not sure?). Despite the few negative aspects, it still remains an interesting film.

Striking in all respects, Ms. Seigner didn't need to get her kit off to make an impression-that felt like one of those unpleasant and embarrassing contractual obligations that the film industry love so much. The second being the amount of smoking that goes on. Almost everyone in the movie smokes like there's not enough lung cancer left to go round. Maybe the tobacco industry co-funded it. If they did, then subtlety can't be their strong point. You may want to step outside and take a breath of fresh air after watching it. Billed as a horror/thriller/mystery, it isn't scarey, thrilling, or mysterious, and I bet it won't be going on Johnny Depp's CV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is wrong with Roman Polanski? One year he makes a masterpiece like "The pianist" and then he makes stuff like "Pirates" and this one... Heheheh, what was supposed to be a horrormovie bored me to death. Not that I was awaiting to see heads fall or bats coming out of the roof but this was just like "Buffy the vampire slayer" with a more talented director, or must I say a great Johnny Depp as after all he was the only reason why I didn't fall asleep completely. And yet the story begins so great, a millionaire who collects old books wants to have the one that is written by Lucifer himself. Three of them exist and it's Depp's job to find out which one of the three is real and which ones are fake as after all there is only one real book. We don't tell the plot but the end will be different nontheless... Why is it so bad then? Hmmm too many unanswered questions, Polanski think it's important to start digging out some details but further in the movie it's like he has to give them an abrupt end (and no this movie is already too long so...) and the end itself just reminded me of "Angel heart", you see we saw it all before and for a moment I thought it'd be a brilliant movie if Johnny Depp only had to search for a rare book that wasn't written by the devil as the movie would have been much better without the cheap horrortricks (you aren't frightened one second if you wanna know...you even can use a clock just in case the eyes are closing down).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this I thought "It's pretty neat, I can dig it" but then I saw the sex scene at the end and then the end.In retrospect...it's really quite a bore. It's not a horrible movie until the end. The sex scene is A) pointless and B) laughable. I'm never a fan of sex scenes in movies, and after the brief nudity, you just see "The Girls" face, and she makes a lot of scary faces. That's about it. Why was this put in the movie? Lame.The ending is the most incomplete ending I've ever witnessed in a film. I won't tell you how it ends, but when I saw the fade to black I was severely disappointed. What starts out as a pretty frightening premise (searching for the devil and what not) just turns out to be a mystery which isn't hard to figure out that has about zero thrills. A couple mildly disturbing images but nothing more than that. I will say it has a few funny jokes that I could appreciate, but I feel that this movie is just kind of silly. Brief yet gratuitous nudity bring my opinion down of it even more. Johnny Depp is smooth as always, and he can play any role he wants because he's talented, but he doesn't make up for this movie's shortcomings. Not really worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a lame mystery about a book detective (Johnny Depp) who is hired by a collector (Frank Langella) to track down the other two copies of a book that contains the secret of how to conjure up the devil. Roman Polanski is responsible for this mess.For one thing, the lead character is as dynamic as mud. I've seen several Johnny Depp films made in the past few years, and I have to conclude he's incapable of playing a mature adult. Frank Langella is good as the evil character pulling everyone's strings, but Depp is like a boy in a man's world. Everyone, including the two female protagonists, Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner , manipulate him with ease. And the story is thin also. If the viewer could have been drawn into solving the mystery of the engravings with the characters, it might have been interesting, but you're left to watching reaction shots to something you never really see yourself. The solution is briefly mentioned near the end, but that's not very satisfying after wading through nearly two hours of muck.The story had the potential to make a decent film, but it wound up in the wrong hands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Ninth Gate' is no doubt Polanski's the worst movie, but the worst for Polanski might be the best for most of the modern moviemakers. Roman Polanski jokingly called this movie `a commercial for hell'. Actually while watching I thought it was an extremely long commercial for `Lucky Strike'. Well, considering the annoying attitude towards smoking as a most horrible sin (especially in USA), a charming chain-smoking hero seems to have a touch of good old Holliwood style. Some people say that this movie is full of stereotypes and banalities. Sorry, you probably lack a sense of humour. During his whole career, Roman Polanski was brilliantly and cynically playing with the stereotypes and movie cliches. The movie is too slow? Well some people prefer exclusive wine, some people prefer coca-cola. It is just a question of tastes. You have not understand what the movie was about and who is who? Hmmm, sorry.In general, `Ninth Gate' is a comics. Arty and stylish, printed on a yellow thin paper in a variety of brown colors and thin black ink strokes.Ninth gate is undoubtedly located somewhere in Polanski's private universe of total absurd. The man is pathetically preparing for some ceremony of black magic. You are expecting that right here, right now Polanski will show you something Infernal and Horrrrrrible and very Crrrrepy. But the man just burns himself with a lot of screaming.Oops, what an odd accident - and it breaks all the genre laws. Relax, baby, devil won't come today- he has more important things to do. Summary: You will enjoy this movie, if you are a maniac obsessed with style (like I am), because here we are talking about the most stylish Roman's movie since `Chinatown'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some readers may feel this review contains minor spoilers.THE NINTH GATE is in many ways a typical Roman Polanski film - an examination of flawed people with weaknesses of greed, whether that greed be for power or money. The main character, Dean Corso, is a rare book dealer who knows his profession well, but seemingly out of necessity. His behavior around the legendary and unique volumes he trafficks is careless to the point of making me cringe - smoking, reading a priceless text in train's a dining car with a glass of wine inches away. This is perhaps the only subtle method in which his character is fleshed out - the rest of our opinion of him comes from exposition so unnecessary that he actually attempts to shush a client prattling on about his unscrupulous, cutthroat business practices, echoing my own feeling about the dialogue.Corso is sent to authenticate a Satanic text for a client who is one step ahead of him. He finds his life in danger almost immediately, and makes a half-hearted attempt to back out - ultimately, another throwaway scene that does more to confuse our opinion of him than clarify it.I half expected the DVD of this film to contain the mysterious missing scenes that would make up the thrilling part of this thriller. I have no complaints about the pacing of the film, which draws on Hitchcock and film noir as its influences; it is appropriate and used properly. However, I never found myself invested in the journey of Dean Corso to the extent I should have been, and most of all, I felt as though the second act's manipulation of my opinion - making Corso a sympathetic character - was a wasted exercise. What we do not see is the transformation into the Dean Corso at the end of the film, and if we are supposed to believe his final course of action, he should have remained a constant, or else we should have seen his revelation. Instead, I was left at the end wondering when and how he changed his course and goal, though I saw clearly what it had become.In the featurette that accompanies the film on DVD, Depp talks about enjoying characters to whom the audience reacts with changing opinion. He has a firm grasp of how the story should have progressed, but unfortunately, I feel that Polanski lacked that same perspective, and the film suffers for it. 6/10 for tremendous production values, a beautiful score, and strong performances of all the primary characters in a story that ultimately fails to satisfy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very, very good movie. Strong storyline, beautifully acted, very surprising. I know that not everybody feels this way, since I've read that many Polanski-lovers think The Nineth Gate one of his worst projects, but I absolutely adored it. Have seen it 12 times now and still find it enthralling every time I see it. Seigner and Depp do some of the best acting I've ever seen... and if you'd like to see the devil personified without special effects or make-up, just take a look at Seigner as she is in Depp's hotelroom... chilling!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a master piece i love it. I played Broken sword wich is the best computer game ever made. The ninth gate follows in Charles Cecils footsteps with a great story about something that is really mysterious, a story that doesnt end when the adventure is over. It leaves you with a huge imagination. The story leeds you in to a dark and mysterius place. Jonny Deep is giving his best performance since "Whats Eating Gillbert Grape" The ninth gate is a movie wich drys an adventures thirst!! The only movie that can top this one is Memento! But even that movie has its flaws.The ninth gate is The movie of the century!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great suspense, terrible ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just couldn't put it together, what was the deal with that ending. If the movie ended 10 minutes earlier, just like that, in the middle of some scene, I would have craved for more to find out what happens in the end. But I was left with a really bad and puzzling ending. It truly was anticlimax at its best. Now I know why nobody saw this movie. But it wasn't really that bad. It starts out very promisingly and although the subject of the devil being awakened has been recycled over and over the atmosphere of this movie had me hooked. Johnny Depp's character is very well portrayed and as Depp himself said you don't like Corso at first because of his cruelty, but you get to like him later on when he's even worse. The other actors truly aren't worth mentioning, Frank Langella is terrible, and Emmanuelle Seigner isn't much better. Her character is supposedly some Lucifer's little helper, but I saw very few hints pointing in that direction. Maybe because the plot was so obvious I was expecting the same for everything else. But the surprisingly good score and the photography somehow made up for all that and even for those really bad 50's special effects every time Corso was in a moving vehicle. But the ending, oh the ending, it was like a slap in the face. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a tad on the SLOW SIDE. Sure, it had DEPP (who always delivers the goods). The good things about this flick were the themes of Satan and the book which was supposedly written by SATAN HIMSELF. Depp goes on a QUEST to find which of THREE COPIES of a SATANIC BOOK is authentic. Along the way, he hooks up with a girl who can FLOAT and DRIVE. He also comes into contact with a bizarre old LADY who is in a wheelchair and has ONE ARM. All of this is shot in EUROPE. It is good scenery. However, there are no special affects to speak of. Also, there are many unanswered questions. I give this a 4 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The notorious and brilliant director Roman Polanski delivers an eerie saga about a rare-book buyer/detective(Johnny Depp)who becomes a target of unknown forces when a millionaire collector(Frank Langella)hires him to find a very rare volume believed to be written by Lucifer himself. Along the country jumping journey of detection, Depp is followed by or either guided by a leggy, mysterious girl(Emmanuelle Seigner). The story is entertaining enough being involved with the supernatural. Intrigue culminates with a fiery finale and the viewer is on his own to decide what he/she just spent two hours watching. I have always seemed to be impressed with Depp's work, over looking some of his early fluff. But on the other hand I thought he was nearly flawless in his role on TV's JUMP STREET. Johnny is the type of actor that seems to keep getting better with each project. Also in the cast are:Lena Olin, Jack Taylor and James Russo. If the occult is your bag...you will enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very weak plot, but reasonably made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Far from the greatest, but not the worst film ever made, is the latest movie from the infamous Roman Polanski. The basic story line is an unscrupulous book expert, is hired to compare three copies of an accent novel, allegedly written by the devil. His employer gives him the first copy, hoping that Dean, be able to see which is fake and which is genuine.&lt;Warning spoilers&gt;In the early stages of the film there is no real clear direction where the story is going. The explanation of what Dean (Johnny Depp's character) has been asked to do and why, is a bit vague. This is what initially gives the film its intrigue. Anyway there appears to be some relationship between the stories in the book or at least the pictures in the book he is given and what is actually happening to him on his quest. Anyway each time Dean encounters the other copies, he notices the differences and then mysteriously the owners are killed, the books remain, but with some page missing.There is a sub-plot involving the wife of the employer, who appears to be another party interested in obtaining one copy of the book. There is also a third party who appears to help and protect Dean.Rather predictably at the end, Dean solves the mystery and realises that he can profit from the books message.The problem with the film is that the plot is too weak, so many questions remain unanswered and a number of events don't appear to have any consequence. I'm happy to let the audience think for itself, but there are such gapping holes, it just doesn't ?come together'. My main gripe is the stupidity of the quest itself, the employer, Boris, is rich, powerful and knows the location of the other copies, so why does he need Dean. In fact, as we later learn, it is he that actually steals the pages anyway. As he already knew where the books were, why not just take them all and then show them to Dean. Throughout the film, the books are treated so badly, handled without gloves and smoked all over. There are also a number of incidences where I'm sure the police would be involved. Dean is involved in 4 separate murders, breaking and entering, and the theft of a very conspicuous sports car. Yet is able to travel freely from country to country, area to area, without any problems.The disappointing part was the end, I hoped that all my questions or at least some would be explained, alas, it just ended.Overall it was interesting, but the plot needed a lot of work to become believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Moderate spoiler ahead)One thing I miss in most previous comments is the absolute perfect casting of Emmanuelle Seigner as "the girl". Who else could portrait a present-day witch (in jeans and trainers) as believably? The strength is not so much in the acting itself, but rather in those hypnotic eyes and hint of a smile. And the lighting of her face in the final scenes is really masterful, in bringing out fleeting flashes of something dark and terrible.Indeed, the excellent casting throughout is one of the real strengths of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were compiling a 1999 top-ten list the first two places would be easy ("Topsy-Turvy" and "Eyes Wide Shut"), and the following seven slots could be filled without too much soul-searching; after that, the levels of quality start to blur into one another, and tenth spot would pose a problem. In the end, out of sheer perversity, I'd probably give the nod to "The Ninth Gate" - nobody else seemed to like it much, but unlike the dozens of gimmick-heavy pieces critics and audiences of 1999 evidently preferred, at least it's a FILM, not an illustrated manifesto.The premise is delicious: an obscure old book (Polanski makes it seem just as real and as rooted in history as the King James Bible), rumoured to be written by the devil, exists in just three copies, and the New York millionaire who owns one of them has reason to think that two of the three are, in a sense, forgeries - written by the author to whom the book is officially attributed, yet differing subtly from the diabolical original. He sends a young dealer in rare books (Brad Pitt, magnetic as ever) over to Europe to investigate.Europe turns out to have the same quality of overcast twilight as New York - it seem as though the entire story takes place in a comforting, enveloping, Old-World kind of semi-darkness. (Polanski gets all the little details right.) The score is as well judged as the photography, and every cast member, down to each single, obscure, walk-on bibliophile, fits neatly and memorably into his or her role (I had no idea it was even possible to assemble a cast of character actors as good as this, these days). The real treat is watching the investigation. Soon enough (but not too soon), we discover the secret of the three books, and it turns out to be a trick worthy of the devil - a genuinely cunning, even sophisticated, idea in its most visually accessible form, perfect for a diabolical folktale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Yet Baffling Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A high-powered antique bookseller is hired to review the only other two copies of a famous book about Satanism for the purpose of checking out the authenticity of the employer's own copy. Such is the basic premise of a very unusual film by the master of macabre, Roman Polanski. Chameleon Johnny Depp plays the bookseller Dean Corso. Depp travels to Europe to look over the other two copies of the book, and mysterious things begin to happen. Naturally, people begin to die and we have a supernatural force in the guise of a guardian angel, if you will, for Depp. Polanski still has an ability to create suspense and tension, yet the film is markedly complex. Too complex for me. It is one of those films that should be watched at least a couple of times to catch all the subtle Polanski directorial touches, and possibly needed in order to fully understand what happens at the end. I am not really sure what happened even now. The acting is very good overall. Depp gives his usual good performance, and Frank Langella adds some class to the proceedings. A very small role by a Barbara Jefford is also most intriguing. The film is not loaded with action or horror really until the end. It is first and foremost a mystery...a puzzle of books and what each one holds. Though nowhere near as good as much of Polanski's other works, The Ninth Gate certainly is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew I shouldn't have seen this movie in the theaters because of the limited release, I should have known I wouldn't have been missing out on much since a lot of people didn't like the film. I expected a lot better from the man that directed the classic film, Rosmary's Baby, but oh well.It starts off pretty interesting where an old man hangs himself and later on Johnny Depp gets hired to search for two copies of a rare book. His job is to compare the other books with the copy he already has to see which is authentic.I was a bit confused in some parts of the film and I think I got the ending, but I'm not quite sure. As usual Johnny Depp does a good performance as the book detective, Dean Corso. I still think his best roll is in the Tim Burton film, Sleepy Hollow.This is one of those slow-paced movie where not much action goes on or anything, but it's still interesting. I was hoping to see a few demons or maybe even Lucifer himself, but was dissapointed that nothing of the sort was shown in this movie.The only thing close to it was some blonde chick that apparently could glide in the air and make her eyes glow. There weren't any real scary parts and I don't even consider this a horror film. Blockbuster called it a Drama Mystery and usually they don't know anything about catagorizing films, but I hink they were right about this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Time Waster That Gets Overly Silly At The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp was well cast in this movie as Dean Corso, a somewhat shady dealer in rare books, who is hired to investigate the authenticity of an ancient text purportedly written by Lucifer himself.The first three quarters of the movie was pretty good. It actually plays the story line relatively seriously, as Corso finds himself dealing with dangerous people trying to stop his investigation, and this was shaping up as a pretty decent suspense/thriller. But everything falls apart in the last half hour or so, as director, co-writer and co-producer Roman Polanski decides to give up on the pretense of a serious movie and simply descends into childish and both undramatic and unfrightening and very predictable horror-type schlock.If it's possible to spoil the end of this movie, this could be a spoiler, so you might not want to read on, (here's your chance to stop)but if you can picture Frank Langella (playing Boris Balkan) frightening the wits out of a coven of witches by shouting "BOO" at them, then you have an idea of how weak the ending to this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where was the ending?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What the hell was THAT?This could have been a great film. The acting, cinematography, music, and the general look of the film are all above average. There are more than a few interesting scenes, and some interesting effects.What kills this movie are the plot, direction and pacing, in the same way that another one of Depp's films, The Astronaut's Wife, was also ruined. The first hour or so is quite intriguing - we are drawn slowly and mysteriously into a world of ancient books, Satan, strangers and murder, with Europe as a beautiful and exotic backdrop for most of the film.Then something happens - the film just completely runs out of steam. The plot grinds mostly to a halt and the film just drags on and on. It's as though Polanski was writing the script as he shot it. The pacing is completely erratic to say the least. At least 30-45 minutes should have been cut from the film's excessive 2 1/4 hour length.I see many complaints here about the ending, and I agree they are all justified. What is particularly frustrating about it is that for much the film, the scenes are extremely drawn out, but contain no plot. Then, suddenly, near the end, in about the last 30 seconds of the film, we are exposed to about 90% of the plot! There should have been far less of the laborious scenes, with virtually no plot development, and much more of the final developments.(Minor spoilers)And what are we supposed to make of that ending? Does Corso (Depp) become one of Satan's agents? Why? Was he seeking power? And who exactly was the girl?Examples of films with great twist endings include 12 Monkeys, The Sixth Sense, and Angel Heart. This last film, made in 1987 and starring Mickey Rourke, is probably the most appropriate one with which to compare Ninth Gate, because they both deal with Satan and involve a long, drawn out odyssey. But Angel Heart, unlike Ninth Gate, has ending that is not just "satisfying" but has an incredible and shocking twist, and makes the entire plot fall into place. Ninth Gate's ending is too short, too quick and feels as though it was slapped on at the last minute, when Polanski finally realized he had better come up with SOME sort of ending.I think a much more satisfying ending would have been that the girl was one of Satan's agents sent by Satan to become pregnant with Corso's child, for the purposes of giving birth to Satan in human form, so he could take over the world. The rituals described in the book would also be necessary for Satan to be born. Corso could have been revealed to have be the "chosen one", the one who had been selected by Satan to be the father. The girl would therefore have been using Corso and the others to gather the books together in order to bring about Satan. The final scene would have shown Corso entering the ninth gate out of lust and longing, in order to be with the girl for eternity. When he final understands how he has played a part in bringing about Satan, there could have been on of two final endings: - a look of horror on his face with the realization that he can do nothing, as darkness descends on the world (European ending!) - he is able to somehow kill the girl and the Satan child using hidden instructions in the book (Hollywood ending!)In either case, at least most of the loose ends would have been tied up.If anyone has any other ideas for a better ending, or if you think my ideas stink, I'd love to hear from you! Post them here or email me and we'll compare notes. The bigger the twist, the better!andrew_brooke@i2.com</fullReview>

I've never heard the phrase "that's quite a book collection you have there" in one movie. This movie showed promise for about the first five minutes. Good opening credits and good character introduction. Then after about a half an hour, I realized this entire movie was about studying books. How exciting! Nothing like watching a thrilling "rare book collector" study books and smoke for 2 hours. This movie would have been good if it didn't have any books in it. It should have started from the last 15 minutes and have been an adventure through the pits of hell. If you're a 100 year old librarian, go see it!!

The movie is a very intriguing story about a rare book dealer looking for three books that are supposed to be the same, but some of the illustrations have subtle differences. Some are signed under a different signature, by the devil himself. The movie follows him through his quest for the different books and he gets caught up in a conspiracy. One problem is this woman who is helping him find the books. You never really find out her purpose. Also, the movie has no climax. That's right, not there. The movie is great, but IT HAS NO CLIMAX!

Was she Lucifer? Was she Lucifer's girlfriend? Was she an angel? One minute she is Depps protector the other she is screwing Depp like she is possessed. I know she was supernatural but was she friend or foe, and why was she helping Depp? It didn't seem a good enough man to be worthy of an angel...The ending was terrible. It should have tied up all the loose ends but all it did was make you ask more.Also, they didn't do their homework when it came to handling rare books. Ask anyone who knows anything about rare books or calligraphic manuscripts and they will tell you this... No one who appreciates rare books would even touch a rare book without gloves, let alone smoke and drink wine where it could affect the book.Anyway, this movie had the potential to be great but the ending ruined it.If anyone has a theory of who the girl was and what happened to Depp when he entered the gate at the end, let me know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nobody does occult movies any more, I usually like them even when everyone else loathes them (e.g. "Exorcist II", "The Seventh Sign") and I was looking forward to this one. But it's a dud from the get-go. Johnny Depp is sadly out of his depth as a book dealer losing his soul; his performance doesn't go beyond the beard and glasses. Indeed almost all the actors are wrong: They look wrong, they sound wrong, and their lines ring hollow. When the wonderful actress Barbara Jefford turns up actually playing the part called for in the script, she seems to be in the wrong movie. Everyone supposes--as I supposed myself--that Polanski is well suited to supernatural subjects because of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Macbeth", but recalling them I realized that the dread they evoke depends on the horror of the everyday. Where the supernatural is unavoidable, as in the scenes of the three witches in "Macbeth", Polanski handles it with no special skill. The scenes in this movie fail entirely to create a sense of dread, of unearthly forces, of cabals and conjurations and powers beyond our ken; it never once makes you look over your shoulder or into dark corners or under your feet. It all seems like a balmy summer day on the Riviera. And the occultism turns out to be a cheat. When a story turns on a riddle, making the riddle a blind (as in this film and "Die Hard 3") turns it into nothing but a trick to keep the audience watching. Even if it turns out to be irrelevant, or to lead on to something else that's the true key, it should have a solution on its own terms. And the last two scenes are weak to the point of meaninglessness. I'll bet that the film was originally intended to end with Depp's finding of the note, which would have made the point intended, albeit unexcitingly. But it wouldn't matter, it all turns out to be a trip nowhere. The Ninth Gate, The Fourth Pentacle, The Sixteenth Covenant--it could be called anything. And it'd still be nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nonsensical waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Johnny Depp will one day be remembered as a uniquely flexible actor who could take on a wide array of roles with great authority. His inclusion in this movie was the one thing that convinced me to give this movie a try. But it sucked big-time, regardless of his presence.The characters are given no opportunity to develop. I have known mannequins with more complex inner lives. Their motives are too-often unclear or non-existent. They are amoral. They are morons. Why would anyone care what ills befell them?I imagine most folks that hate this movie would mention the ending. The ending is abrupt and absurd; it feels like the makers ran out of money. It doesn't explain any of the tense, suspenseful situations the protagonist found himself in during the rest of the movie. There's no sense of the last puzzle piece fitting in with the rest of a jigsaw puzzle; there's no closure. In fact, it's when the credits start rolling that you are sure that you've been had; you've sat through all this drivel for nothing. There is no payoff, no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.For example, the movie begins with a wealthy, elderly gentleman writing a suicide note and then hanging himself. We are never told why. Later, the protagonist is warned that his journey may be dangerous; moments later, he is nearly killed by an enormous scaffolding collapsing. We never find out why it collapsed, or who might have been behind it. Later, the men who warned the protagonist of danger have disappeared, with no explanation or elaboration offered. And it's just full of that sort of thing. Plot points like these should have a purpose.Avoid at all costs. 3/10</fullReview>

The ending is the worst, where it just ends; you would need to watch it a second time to fully grasp the concept of the film. For the great effects (such as the fire and acting), this film gets points, but the film didn't answer any questions at the end. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the underrated Polanski films, not that fantastic but not too bad either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski shows his great directing talents here with this film, even if at times the story risks (and does) run off its own theological hinges. He brings back the issue of the devil (first time in thirty years), making it a pretty good subject for the film, if not as impressive as in his first outing with the material. To say it could've been better is really more at the screenplay, which dives down into 'what' territory after the first hour of its mystery story. And, on a repeat viewing, my reaction is about the same as the first time (my first Polanski). Yet, thanks to great scenery, a good plot, and some better than OK acting by stars Frank Langella and (more so) Johnny Depp, this film should be seen by Polanski fans, even if saying that it won't be like his classics is a fair bet. At the least, there is a very strangely filmed sex scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trouble with this movie is that it ends so abruptly that one is left to wonder if they simply ran out of film or money. Up to the very final seconds, it is a largely entertaining spooky thriller, beautifully photographed and more than adequately acted. But, not giving anything away, it simply stops. However, by and large it is great fun with some over-the-top emoting by Frank Langella that almost by itself justifies the price of admission. If only Polanski had given us another fifteen minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Polanski basically made an Indiana Jones movie, added some nonsensical witchcraft motives and a strange ending. In the beginning the movie looks quite good but then it just gets worse and worse. Johnny Depp is very good but he cannot save the movie, the other characters are rather strange then good, and I was really disappointed by Emmanuelle Siegner. She just kept one mysterious smile throughout the whole movie, no matter what was happening around, and that was pretty much all the 'acting' she performed. While she might be a good actress, it certainly isn't visible in The Ninth Gate. All in all I give it 5 points out of 10 mainly because of the good beginning, the title sequence (which is really impressive) and Johnny Depp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never in the slightest bit scary, The Ninth Gate even veers into Allo Allo farce.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Some books are dangerous, not to be opened with impunity," utters yet another creepy character in Roman's Polanski's ponderous film adaptation of Arturo Perez-Reverte's novel The Club Dumas. The "great director" himself describes The Ninth Gate as a "cross between Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby." However, this devilish concoction never comes close to matching either of his previous masterpieces. Depp plays Dean Corso, a young book dealer whose pursuit of two demonic texts lands him a satan-worshipping quagmire. Depp sleepwalks (at one point his character actually falls to sleep - is that the audiences' cue as well?) through this, but still miraculously keeps his screen presence. Never in the slightest bit scary, The Ninth Gate even veers into Allo Allo farce - thanks to the performance of Polanski's other half Emmanuelle Siegner ("I like books, do you?"). Ultimately, this is far too plodding to be thrilling, but probably owing to Polanski's direction it still holds an odd fascination. Peculiar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real nightmare ... the worst movie ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read through the comments made by other viewers of this movie and I'm very, very puzzled. This is a terrible movie. It has very few redeeming features, which could be edited into a half hour short on "how to make a movie the Roman way", but is otherwise not worth the price of admission.Before some people say "aha, I bet you're a slasher flick, not-too-much thinking kind of gal", I'm not. I normally enjoy character driven movies and have very much enjoyed some of Roman's previous work. But this movie didn't have any depth to the characters, either killing them off before we got to know them as well as we would have liked, or by portraying them as enigmatic beyond belief. The plot is ridiculous and predictable, the cinematography a real giggle (particularly when anyone is driving a car) and the ending sent me straight to the box office to demand my money back.But the critics love it. Go figure. I saw it in the US a while ago and waited for British critics to pan it mercilessly, but no such luck. However I don't think that means it's a good movie.Put it this way. If you like to have endless conversations about what might or might not have happened before, during and after the action, you just might like this film. If, however, you'd like believable, well acted characters, or a plot, or even (God help you) both ... avoid this film. Seriously. It's for your own good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Deep??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people have commented that The Ninth Gate had a deeper message than just in the movie it's self, that the ending is not ambiguous but really meaningful. I guess I'm a little skeptical because that was the same gig that the marketing department of American Beauty uses. "look deeper" and "If you don't get it, you will". The idea that there is so much depth in both of the movies is like selling the emperors new clothes. We, the emperor is too self concious to admit that we don't see anything deeper so sometimes we just praise movies that tell us there is something deeper, even if we don't know what.I liked the ninth gate. The idea is intriguing, although I would have liked to learn more about the making of the book, which simply fascinated me. it's not action nor a thriller, I was not surprised by anything. The girl left a lot to be desired. Why did she keep leaving, could she not have stayed? Why does she wear different color socks, why can't she just dress like everyone else?? I understand she looks a lot like the girl in the missing picture, but why? She was the biggest disappointment in a movie that could have survived better without her.I see it as a passage to capture Johnny's soul. He does not worship the devil as the others in the movie, but it's through the process he goes through to get what he's paid to do that he is admitted through the ninth gate. His soul corrupt through out this movie.Mr. Polanski, if you can hear this, you could have made a much better movie without putting your wife in it. It would have made it shorter (since it was rather slow at time when she was around and she didn't talk since she really isn't essential) and you could have developed Johnnys character since it's his descent into hell that we are interested in. Please think with your head and not with other parts of the body when directing your next movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't close to the brilliance of Polanski's earlier horror/thrillers, yet it still delivers. It has solid atmosphere, interesting characters, and an intriguing plot. The first hour keeps you very interested, than it slows down for an hour before the fascinating ending scenes. Though most critics disapproved of the final shot where the screen fades to white, I found it a great way to end the film. We didn't have to see exactly where Johnny Depp's Character was going to and we didn't have to find out the truth behind the mysterious lady. We can imagine where he's going and who the lady is (in my opinion she's sent from Hell). I love when films end like that and make you really think about what happens next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Polanski's latest film is major disappointment. It has all the ingredients of a morbid and suspenseful thriller but it never reaches the lofty goals it aspires to. The first half of the film sets up some intriguing situations involving a search for some Satanic books. But after that the film begins to meander aimlessly and eventually takes a nosedive and climaxes with a thud. Johnny Depp heads the competent cast and Polanski still manages to create a few inspired directorial moments but these few positives can't save this basically lame movie. The best part of the film is the opening credit as the camera swoops through nine different doors. This is no Rosemary's Baby.</fullReview>

This film never gets on its feet, and the cast performs dispassionately (although Frank Langella gets a good bit in when he passes his hand through a flame while shouting "Behold!"). 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What A Burn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of reasons why I went to see The Ninth Gate. Perhaps top on the list is because the director, Roman Polanski, is the man responsible for the highly disturbing, yet artistically sound Rosemary's Baby. But it's also because of the movie's subject matter, i.e. Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies, Lucifer, and Mr. Boogedyman?whatever you choose to call him. Satan.You can take a look at the past, oh, twenty-five years, and it's amazing how Satan's popularity fluctuates in pop culture. With movies like Dracula, Rosemary's Baby, Prophecy I &amp; II, and End of Days forming the backdrop of our modern experience, it seems like today's society finds the subject fascinating, if not "cool." Satan movies are all the rage. So I went to The Ninth Gate to see if the subject matter gets the same distressing treatment found in End of Days-to see if Polanski didn't sacrifice plausibility for pizzazz.He did.The flick follows book dealer/con artist Dean Corso as he attempts to verify the authenticity of a book for book collector/Satan-lover Boris Balkan (who is also filthy rich). The book is called The Ninth Gate, and it was supposedly written by the devil, who even drew the cute little pictures found in the pages. The theory is that if you get all the pictures together and speak some rudimentary Latin, the Dark Angel himself will pop up and shoot the breeze with you for a while. In a twist of what I suppose is irony, the motto of the book found on the title page reads: "Thus let the light shine." That nutty Satan! He's all into irony.What is redeeming about this film? Two things. The tone, for one, is good. Polanski didn't rush himself, and so he reproduces the same eerily hushed quality found in Rosemary's Baby. Johnny Depp, playing Corso, delivers a well-measured performance in sync with the movie's atmosphere. Unfortunately the tone of the movie demands substance. This film has none. It relies so much on the weight of its subject matter that the audience members are left essentially clueless on some basic plot points.A lot of reviewers are going to harp on the "artistic integrity" of this film, and to its credit, the cinematography and editing are excellent. But good timing and restraint are not workable substitutes for a decent story. Depp's character starts the movie with the type of noncommittal attitude necessary for the plot, but by the end, his indifference is reflected by the audience. Polanski mistook confusion for art. When there's not a strong story to guide the mood, even the best craftsmanship becomes meandering nonsense (see Eyes Wide Shut).However, even with the mish-mash of supernatural gumbo, even with the unfortunate and undecipherable ending, and even with the cartoonish side characters more fitting for a Sandman comic book, the movie at least doesn' t TOTALLY glorify Satanism. I'm all for dissing the devil's fan club. Most worshippers of the devil, it seems to say, are self-indulgent whiners who just need an excuse to hold orgies. What a burn.But that's one brief, fleeting moment in the film. It's an instance of inflated self-awareness that loses steam fast. Polanski gets his jabs in on the devil's followers, but the conclusion of the film makes him seem sympathetic toward the devil himself. As if his acceptance of Satan wasn't enough to distance the movie from the typical non-evil-promoting viewer, that very acceptance is so clouded in distraction and "artistic integrity" that the only thing getting burned when the credits roll is the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplistic plot and slooooow pacing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You're going to see some comments about the "exquisite artistry" of this film. That's all well and good, and in fact there are some decent visuals. But there's much more that was very poorly conceived and executed.First, the visuals, since that seems to be the most important thing in movies now. There are some nice sets and scenery in Ninth Gate. The castle at the end was quite a nice set, for instance. That's not enough, however. The special effects are atrocious all the way through, from the poorly rendered, choppy CGI opening credits, to the obvious computer trickery for the "twin" booksellers, to the horrible, horrible job with the duchess' hand, culminating in some pretty lame fire they CGI'd so they wouldn't have to burn their pretty castle. Really, if you can't do your special effects better than this, then do without!It's getting hard to believe anyone in Hollywood cares anymore, but the story is rifled with holes and flaws as well. Maybe if enough VIEWERS cared, Hollywood would start caring again as well! I know, I'm too optimistic.Anyway, if you know nothing about solving puzzles, this movie won't help you learn. You may in fact find the premise somewhat interesting, though hard to follow. On the other hand, if you DO know a bit about puzzles, you'll be yawning your way through most of this film, as the stars slowly, slowly, sloooowly piece together the rather simple challenge. In fact, when they give the first clue (the first comparison of the engravings), I thought to myself "this might get interesting!" An hour and a half later, as the movie was drawing to a close, and they put together the same facts that any puzzle solver saw much earlier, I realized that that was the extent of the puzzle, and all my patience had been for nothing. Then, just to be ornery, they cheat near the end and make sure there was no way to solve the puzzle unless the powers-that-be decided you should have the answer, at which point they just come out and tell you. This isn't a spoiler; if you know anything about puzzles, you'll agree easily with the above, otherwise you probably tuned out on this paragraph, and more power to you.And no, there's no deep meaning in that ending. Yes, there is a meaning, and I found it quite clear, thank you, just not deep. Sorry. Johnny Depp rules, but as I learned a long time ago, good actors can't save bad movies, and this was no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark tale of destiny and fatalism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is NOT Roman Polanski's best film. It's not as good as Repulsion or Rosemary's Baby. The Ninth Gate, however, is better than Bitter Moon and Death and the Maiden. Polanski has found his wonderful atmosphere (which we fans can notice) again in this dark tale of destiny and fatalism. The important thing is that The Ninth Gate is more than just entertainment. It raises a lot of questions - to which we have to find the answers by ourselves. It has deeper meanings. It is not as linear as so many doll Hollywood films. The ending is simply superb. Yes, the music is great too!****/*****J.R</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>extraordinary occult mystery..... but !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie when I was spending some time in the beautiful city of Angers and apart from the director being the popular Roman Polanski and the awesome Johny Depp being cast, I knew absolutely nothing (i didnt even know the NAME of the movie, since I dont speak French too much). Well.....what a surprise, a story about a book thats said to summon Satan himself..wow !!! I wowed like hell....what more in the beginning the script looks like something from the pen of the BEST SCREENWRITER in Hollywood, the Mr. Twisted Andrew Kevin Walker (awesome Se7en, awesome 8mm and co-writer of awesome Game), even helped by the awesome cinematography from Se7en´s and Alien:Ressurection´s cinematographer Darius Khondij !!! Music played by Prague filharmonia...wow !!! It looked to be an one-of-a-kind movie experience..BUT !!.... 1) The script loosed its breath VERY quickly...leaving the movie on the standard cliche filled mystery thriller level..too bad 2) THE UTTERLY STUPID ending, and I DO NOT mean the very ending, which is a somewhat interesting story shift..i mean the "¨burning castle sex scene"....man that was so dumb... i dunno....it had SUCH a potential...but it failed... all that is left is great french and spanish exteriors, awesome premise and occult links, great (altho, quite repetitous) instrumental music and good, solid performance by the HIGLY underrated actor JOhny Depp (however his performance in Gilbert Grape was MUCH better)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate (1999): Dir: Roman Polanski / Cast: Johnny Depp, Frank Langella, Emmanuelle Seigner, Lena Olin, James Russo: Intriguing horror film dealing with the forbidden. Johnny Depp plays a rare book dealer assigned by Frank Langella to study The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows, which was printed in 1666 and believed to have been written by Satan. With three copies in existence Depp must discover which one is real. A strange woman joins him as numerous attempts are made on his life. Detailed screenplay that places viewers in Depp's position where trust is a risk. Langella dominates with his deep voice and authority although his scheme comes off as embarrassing when factoring in certain facts. Featuring enchanting art direction to further enhance the story . Emmanuelle Seigner is enchanting as an angelic figure whom may confuse viewers by its third act. Lena Olin is fetching as a woman after the book after her husband hung himself. Directed by Roman Polanski whose Rosemary's Baby is superior and dealing with similar themes. He also made Chinatown as well as Repulsion. Visually well made with creepy locations and angelic figures that seem to be watching. Compelling thriller that is sometimes corny but comes through on suspense as well as the ability to be curious. It is about unknown dangers that we willingly trespass. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Horror Film Which Also Explores the World of Antiquarian Books</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supernatural horror and antiquarian books have interesting overlaps. There is something mystical about ancient and medieval books, especially those with covers which look like medieval doors, potentially unlocking mysteries within. For many centuries, books were regarded as far beyond mere utilitarian objects for the transmission of information. They were seen as carriers of secret wisdom of the ancients and even powerful transmitters of taboo knowledge. The Book of Kells, produced in the 8th century, was regarded as a holy item with divine power. "The Ninth Gate" fuses the world of antiquarian books within the genre of supernatural horror.Loosely based on Arturo Pérez-Reverte's novel "The Club Dumas", the story concerns Dean Corso (Johnny Depp), an amoral book scout and dealer who trades in antiquarian books, predominantly those printed prior to 1800. These tomes are quite distinct from the modern hardcover editions published today in millions of copies. Each copy of an antiquarian book produced pre-1800 had to be hand-printed on presses and hand-bound. They are found in leather and vellum bindings, some of them commissioned by the nobility. The paper used in older books is of a superior quality than today, making them desirable to a number of eclectic collectors willing to pay large sums to acquire these treasures. Corso, often using deceitful tactics which would make used car salesmen seem like saints, attains these items and resells them for hefty sums to moneyed albeit eccentric collectors. In an early scene, Corso over-appraises a rare book collection (called high-balling) in order to attain a sought-after set for cheap. (For those of you who know about antiquarian books, the set is actually the so-called "Ibara Don Quixote", printed in 1780. Although not a first edition, the Ibara Don Quixote is regarded as the finest edition of Cervantes' novel ever published, with engravings by the best artist of Spain at the time.)Corso is then hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), an eccentric scholar and high-end book collector obsessed with the supernatural, the occult, and the underworld. (It is not uncommon for wealthier book collectors to hire book scouts as agents to find particular editions.) Balkan reveals to Corso his rare book collection which has an interesting focus: antiquarian books whose subject is the Devil. However aside from the many hundreds of volumes of books in leather and vellum, there is one recent acquisition which is Balkan's prized possession: a particular 17th-century book called "The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows". According to Balkan, "The Nine Gates" is a book of spells written by the Devil himself, and if used correctly can be used to summon the Devil in person. The book was printed in 1666 (of course) and features medieval-like woodcut engravings on nine of its pages preceding each of its chapters or "gates". Only three known copies are extent, according to Balkan, and he wants Corso to tract down the other copies in antiquarian libraries in Europe. (Unlike the Ibara Don Quixote, "The Nine Gates" is not a real 17th century book, as far as I know.)So begins a suspense-thriller in which antiquarian libraries and supernatural horror become unlikely bedfellows. During Corso's travels, he meets eccentric characters whose only commonality is their love for ancient, medieval and renaissance books. Shortly after Corso accepts Balkan's assignment, the widow of the man who owned The Nine Gates makes an unexpected call, wanting the book back, claiming her husband would never have sold it to Balkan. There are Spanish twins who repair and sell such books, often allowing their cigarette ash to fall on the covers of books hundreds of years old. He encounters a collector who views his books like children. And there's a wheel-chair bound old woman who takes an immediate disliking towards Corso, questioning his intentions.This film may be the only one of its kind in cinema to tour the world of antiquarian books and their corresponding collections. Differences between copies from the same edition, called states, are also explored, a detail of book collecting which may not have ever been demonstrated in another film in English. While art collectors, collections, and heists receive far more cinematic treatment, antiquarian books and collectors exist underneath the radar. Certainly not for all tastes, and only about 50% of Arturo Pérez-Reverte's novel, "The Ninth Gate" is still a fun fresh horror-suspense thriller and not to be missed if you're a bibliophile. If you also like horror books, this film is definitely a treat in its original first edition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with so much potential....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truly, I have found this to be a rare movie. It is not full of action, but rather thoughtful and layered. The story is simple, but well built up through the directing and some excellent performances (not including the directors wife I should add). For a horror/thriller, it was pseudo intellectual, and eminently watchable, without being drowned in special affects (except for the weirdness that was the female companion floating around). The style was reminiscent of Denis Wheatley fiction at his perverse best.But the downside is that the movie was hollow, and disappointing. The signs were all broadcast so obviously, the ending was uncharacteristically thoughtless and sudden.Overall? I have watched it a few times, marveling in the almost brilliance of it all. But it's not brilliant. Still, I think it is a worthwhile investment of time for film enthusiasts. And think what could have been...</fullReview>

In the end it seems as if the writer (credit Polanski) must have been creatively impaired. The man must hate actors. He forced them to say stupidly preposterous lines. And poor Frank Langella tries to do the impossible (I can't feel a thing!) - in closeup. I was very prepared to like the film, enjoyed the ride most of the way but in the end I felt deceived and that I wasted my time, No satisfying resolution here. Maybe this film is another Vampire Slayer (reputedly eviscerated by Philistine producer Martin Ransohoff)? By the way, unless he has lost a lot of weight, I didn't spot Allen Garfield.

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie with a Not-So-Great Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a movie contains a surprising twist coupled with a deep statement, the entire setup of the scene must be carefully handled. If the "statement" takes upwards of half an hour to realize, the entire point is lost, and that part of the movie runs the risk of becoming somewhat comical. This, my friends, is the greatest flaw of The Ninth Gate.The Ninth Gate, for the most part, is a stylishly done movie, as is to be expected with Mr. Polanski. The cinematography is excellent, and most of the visual effects are stirring yet subtle. The acting, for the most part, is also effective. Johnny Depp is convincing as the sleazy "book detective", yet the Dean Corso character remains relatable enough for the audience to refrain from completely hating him. The supporting actors are interesting and add to the movie itself, rather than just stay in the background as wallpaper. The only problem as far as the acting goes is Emmanuelle Seigner, who as "The Girl" is a strange combination of overacting and over blinking, who seems to be unable to decide whether she is passionate and confident, or simply completely insane. Again, if this character had been handled more carefully, she would not have come off as such a overdone character.The movie rides along quite nicely until the last fifteen minutes, where the plot takes a backseat to shock value. The problems begin with the strange kinky sex scene, taking place in what looks like either Hell or someone's old basement. This odd view suddenly switches to riding in a car. The end, while probably supposedly deep and powerful, comes across as almost comical, with ridiculous neon lights leaking from an otherwise malevolent-looking castle.So, that's it. This movie is not horrible, but if you're willing to suspend belief for an outlandish ending, give The Ninth Gate a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very captivating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Ninth Gate' is a supernatural adventure-drama about a young man who is searching for a book written by the devil. His searches take him to Paris and other countries where he befalls some obstacles while trying to track down the books. Along the way, he meets ambiguous characters who trick him into being good or evil, depending on the point of view.The problem with this film is that the pacing was slow. Generally-speaking, it did have some good ideas, but it really failed to captivate me. It could have helped with chopping out some of the unnecessary plot and speeding up some of the scenes. It also was not very frightening. My personal taste gives it a 2/10. Pretty good idea, but it just quietly bit the dust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie didn't have enough bedevilment in it for one. Corsco was a bit lighthearted and almost whimsical in the way he dealt with the strange predicament the he had falled into. They should have had him sweating bullits after his buddy was found hanging up side down from one foot. Then it should have gotten progressively stressful from there. They should have just had us wishing " Leave the book and run" Most of all how many times have we seen a villain with visions of gradure get foiled in the end because of a snafu in his master plan for world domination. And I think that the girl was all too mysterious. She never once answered any questions or shed ed any in-site in what she knew about anything. Yes I think she might have been the devil. Did she become a little girl at the airport? Did she become a dog in the park? I think that there should have been some kind of wrap up in the end.</fullReview>

I have to blame the ending on the director. He must not have shot enough scenes to "flesh out" the ending.But I really liked Depp. I loved the sets. Really cool.

		<shortDescription>A supernatural journey that goes nowhere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A supernatural thriller directed by Roman Polanski and starring Johnny Depp?Sounds good? Well it could have been, but what might have been the main selling points turn out to be the film's downfall. Johnny Depp is one of those actors who seems ideally suited to some roles but totally out of his depth in others. Sadly this falls into the latter category. Depp is unconvincing and wooden, though that isn't the film's main problem. For the most part of this film it all seemed to be going somewhere interesting, with the holes in the plot and the sense of confusion not causing any worry as it trundled along in tried and tested supernatural thriller territory (satanic rich people, levitating women - that sort of thing). The major disappointment is the ending. The film leads you along for a couple of hours and just when you think it may be leading to a satisfying conclusion, it all falls down with a hopeless ending. Did they run out of money? Was Polanski making it up as he went along? Who knows. Not really a film that justifies repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much too tame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersThe "Ninth Gate" is an undistinguished and unspectacular movie. If it had not been directed by Roman Polanski and had not featured Johnny Depp, it would have passed completely unnoticed and received ratings between 3 and 5. Of course, you can see that the movie had some budget and was realized by a competent director, but the rest is an old hat. The plot evolves around an antique book about the devil, and most of the people related to it get killed (mostly in unspectacular ways). The mystery is quickly resolved: Already when Johnny Depp studies the book the first time in a library, you can see a woodcut depicting a woman resembling very much Emmanuelle Seigner (so she is related to the devil). The fact that she turns into a guardian "angel" for Johnny Depp makes it clear that he is a "chosen one" of some kind. When Johnny Depp examines the second copy of the book, he discovers the main secret about the woodcuts, and then we do not hear anything new about them until at the end Frank Langella briefly summarizes the meaning of each one. The devil is also the same as usual: He comes in a beautiful guise (Emmanuelle Seigner, bright light), but at the end he betrays those worshipping him. The main problem about this movie is that it is filmed completely without passion. It never becomes exciting or even shocking. The spectator remains as unaffected by the events as Johnny Depp (who keeps the same ice cold uninterested expression during the whole movie). For a film about the devil and hell, this is particularly strange. If you want to watch a movie where hell really breaks loose, I recommend Lucio Fulci's "The Beyond". In my opinion, Polanski made this movie without any personal involvement, just for earning some money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superficial and monotonous narrative supposedly about some books written by Lucifer himself which have the power to materialize him and bestow demonic powers. Throughout the movie, which features the satanic book predominantly, you're wondering what the text says exactly. This is never revealed for the simple reason that what could it say? Rape, pillage, loot! Yeah! It contains engraving which are apparently of key importance, but none of it is really tied together meaningfully or convincingly. Depp is badly miscast as a rare books dealer, he's too young and pretty. They give him facial hair and glasses, have him smoke and drink constantly, but it doesn't work. At first assigned to find these satanic volumes, he is later apparently self-motivated in his own quest for evil power. None of it is believable, or, if you are generous with your suspension of disbelief, interesting on the level of a thriller. Depp's acting is bad (sex scenes are ludicrous), but it's not his fault. It is entirely unclear what his motivation is supposed to be, and later in the movie, his behavior is so lacking in foreshadowing it makes sense only on the most superficial level. The rest of the characters are even more 2-dimensional. Polanski obviously has great technical skill but here at least, no sense for either story or character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Journey through the past.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>23 years after "le locataire" (the tenant) ,at last ,Polanski comes back to the horror genre.Between 1980 and the present,his career became unfocused as ever.After he left the USA, in the second half of the seventies,he was in search of a style:the romantic melodrama of "Tess" was warmly welcomed,but it's a faceless movie,in total opposition to what came before."Pirates" (1986) was his career's nadir and "Frantic",the following year, was clearly uninspired."Bitter moon" (1992) had its moments and with it,the director seems to come to terms with his earlier style and snatches of "knife in the water" (1962) and cul de sac (1966) surface.But it was 1995 before Polanski was again in clover:"death and the maiden" is a harsh and demanding work,wonderfully played by Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley,and the claustrophobia (almost everything takes place in a house) echoes that of "repulsion" (1965).After this important work,sometimes a bit overlooked ,it seemed that R.P. was on the right track again.Then the "ninth gate" which,more than the two former movies, is a drastic return to the good old days ,reintroducing supernatural and the devil.THat was a dangerous path.Because the spectator has in mind one of the finest (and Polanski's finest) "devil movies " in the history of cinema,without mentioning any names "Rosemary's baby"(1968)."The ninth gate" ,at first sight ,seems a great come back:the engravings are ominous and give the jitters.The baroness is a very interesting character.So are the twins.As always,Polanski can turn anything in the settings to his advantage,be it an isolated house,its strange garden,even the road that leads to it.Johnny Depp who has worked with Tim Burton was ideal for the Pole director.And the cast and credits,at the beginning are exciting.But impact is lacking,and we do not know where all this leads us.The special effects are kept to the minimum in the first half.But as soon as the strangled baroness disappears in the flames,the movie loses steam and will become more and more grotesque before ending in a very disappointing way.Humor ,which remained to the fore in "the fearless vampire killers" and "Rosemary's baby" ,and which can save a lot of things has vanished:how can Polanski take all this drivel seriously?He becomes like his characters,hooded,chanting diabolical wild imaginings .A caricature of the sabbath over Central Park in "Rosemary's baby" .Even the old book trick was present in the 1968 movie:remember the one Hutch gave to Rosemary,and the suspenseful moment when it opens on the fateful page.The ending is one of the weakest Polanski has ever filmed.It's a shame,when you think "Rosemary"'s end is one of the strongest in horror movies,being at once moving and frightening.Here,Polanski took the easy way."The ninth gate" may be an entertaining movie,but it stands little chance to become a horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this flick on VHS on a rainy day frankly because there wasn't anything else on the shelf that look appealing. This seemed to be a typical Polanski film with darkness and ominousness a plenty. This is a dark movie bringing for reference to satan and how to manifest him on earth. Depp plays a rare book dealer that is sent on a mission by a rich Satanic book finatic and on his trip to Europe to find the devils work he ends up working right along side the devil and doesn't even notice. Depps acting was a plus but for everyone else they put on a fair showing. This seemed to be a low budget film with small or no name actors and actresses to play key rolls in the film. The plot was fairly elementary for someone of Polanski's stature. Seemed to me the idea probably came from a pre-wicken, highschool kid. It really didn't give me the feeling that this movie could almost be believable and just wasn't worth the time to watch it. If the movie itself isn't a let down then the ending will be. The ending is Depp walking into the light of a mysterious castle and you don't know if the light he walks into is the light of hell or light of goodness. BOMB!</fullReview>

Johnny Depp satisfactorily acted his part in this movie, and the movie demonstrates an intelligent portrayal of rare books collectors. Thats all the good points I can possible come up with this flick.The plot unsuccessfully used platonic devices to reveal the archaic implications of the ninth gate. The ending of the movie left the viewer with the overwhelming sense of disclosure; leaving him to feel like an absolute moron to even allow this laconic movie to reach its end.I recommend anyone who wished to become only dumber to watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a stinker! An unintelligent script with one guessable cliché after another. In Polanski's commentary on the DVD he mentions a foot stool that the camera focuses on in the opening scene. He says this is to get the viewer wondering. Well, you see a distraught elderly gentleman in his well appointed library, sitting at his desk writing a note. Gee, I wonder what the note could be and what will he do next? If you can't guess that one, maybe you should see this film.The best part of this film for me was what appears to be an homage (though Polanski makes no mention of it in his commentary) to Pixar's Geri's Game, the great award winning short subject of an old man playing chess with himself. In the Ninth Gate, the Depp character visits two old twins (actually one actor with special effects) who have a rare book store in Spain. They're made up to look like "Geri" and do a credible imitation, down to the cackling laugh.If you like Lena Olin, she looks great for 44, even for 34. You get a brief look at her bare breasts in a laughable pointless sex scene towards the end of the film (if you can stay with it that long).I watched part of the DVD commentary by Polanski, hoping for some insight. No such luck. Was this really the director who made Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby?If you want too see a much better film about the satan, see the Devil's Advocate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Movie for People with a Brain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the seventh time I have watched this movie and I like it more and more. I was not surprised by the high number of negative comments. In fact, I was pleased to know that most people negatively valued this movie. This made me laugh, because it reinforced what I already knew: this excellent movie can not be properly appreciated if you do not have imagination, some culture, a brain and an open mind. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), many people lack the above mentioned requirements. It is indeed a movie for a minority. 1. The Main Character is great: Here, we have a cynical and immoral book dealer (Johnny Depp), who starts the movie as a money-hungry materialistic mercenary, and ends up being a spiritual believer ready to risk his life in an uncertain adventure with an even more uncertain ending. The man who Boris Balkan trusts at the beginning of the movie because he can be bought with cash, ends up telling his boss Balkan that the Engravings are worth much more than money. The one who undertakes a journey of transformation from the material to the spiritual is Dean Corso. He is the chosen one, aided by fate (and green eyes, of course). He crosses indeed all the gates and lives a truly amazing rite of passage that leads to freedom and the acceptation of the supernatural. 2. The support Characters are impressive: - The ambiguous Spanish twin brothers, the Ceniza Brothers, are magnificent. The apparently harmless brothers, always sarcastic and mysterious, convey very well the feeling that they do know something that you don't (it proves to be true in the end). They are deliciously and childishly malevolent and mischievous. - Victor Fargas, the Old Portuguese collector, is a great example of decadence, an old dinosaur who knows there is no place for him in this world, very much similar to the decadent intellectuals described by Edgar Allan Poe in his novels. He is very much like Roderick Usher. - Boris Balkan is the fanatical believer, utterly convinced that he is the only one, the chosen one to decipher the mystery and take "the road that leads to equality with god". He stops at nothing to get what he wants and is a constant and menacing presence and influence. - Liana Telfer/Saint Martin is great. Attractive, seductive, fishy, evil, immoral, manipulative bitch. - The Baroness Frieda Kessler, aristocratic, eccentric, probably lesbian, infatuated with the devil - Green Eyes, the beautiful Emmanuelle Seignier, is a profoundly disturbing character. She is the incarnation of Johnny Depp's fate, and incarnation of the devil, a beautiful succubus who aids Depp in his journey of self-discovery , change and transformation and actually chooses him to be her "partner". The scene in which they make love in front of the burning castle is amazing. She is so beautiful, mysterious and captivating that the movie is worth watching only for her presence. It is wonderful when she watches and enjoys herself with a mischievous smile when Depp violently kills the black albino.The end of the movie is good, as it is an open end, suggestive and full of possibilities. When we see the light in the castle, we know that Depp is going to accomplish what Balkan failed. What did he accomplish? Well, he is going to take the road that leads to equality what god. No less????? This end is wonderful, because it leaves all to our imagination. Therefore, those lacking imagination will hate it, because they will not see anything at all but frustration. This end is an intellectual end, an open end for those able to appreciate the full extent and implications of the movie. So, what's this movie about? This movie is about the transformation of an upper middle class materialistic person into an adventurer and spiritual believer. Johny Depp ends up being very much like his hated boss, Boris Balkan. The only difference is that Balkan was always a believer and a fanatical adept. But the devil clearly prefers those who are converted. What is more attractive? A man who has always been a Saint (or a devil), or a man who is a sinner and ends up being a Saint (or a devil) after a process of self transformation and a leap of faith? Clearly, the devil preferred Depp, the materialistic unbeliever that quickly transforms himself, and crosses all the gates. In a very short time, Dean Corso, the materialistic unbeliever who sleeps out of boredom at a conference about the devil and can be bought with cash and that only believes in his percentage grows accustomed with the supernatural and accepts it(green eyes), murders two people not for material profit but for spiritual knowledge and ends up daring to risk his life(just like Balkan) in a very uncertain but hauntingly beautiful end. Finally, it was him who dared to take the road that leads to equality with god. And after seeing the dazzling light in the castle, at the final scene, I daresay he accomplished what Balkan failed. This movie is a movie about inverse moral. We are used to see in movies bad guys who in the end turn up to be the good guys. However, here, the process is more complicated and malevolent. This is an inverse process of conversion. We have watched without knowing it what for the devil would be the process of choosing, grooming and rewarding a promising new adept, and rewarding him with the ultimate reward: equality with god. No less. This is a movie for intelligent people. By the way, the devil was always in plain sight, which is an irony: it was the girl, and she chose to reward Depp instead of Balkan. Balkan was already a believer, and Depp wasn't at first. And you know, all women prefer something they do not have, even if they are the incarnation of the devil????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i saw this movie yesterday and i must say i was drawn into the movie.The plot is very interesting and acting (well what can u expect from Johnny?) was fabulous. It starts very well and puts in Mr.Corso's place within few minutes. But but but ending was so awful ...it made me think why did i waste my 2 hours on this movie. I think director Mr. Polansky was not sure how to end this movie. It never shows any relation between the book and Mr.Corso. Also the woman who protects Mr.Corso, who is she? any clue?Overall a very interesting thriller wasted with very very bad ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was genuinely nervous before I watched this movie. Supernatural themes are always the scariest to me, and to be honest, I'm just too old to lose sleep over a scary movie. Well, I decided to suck it up and be a big girl. After all, it was one of the few Johnny Depp movies that I had not seen- I was on a quest to see them all! I was pleasantly surprised to find that despite the advertising, Ninth Gate was not terrifying in the least, but rather psychological and somewhat smart. Intriguing story, not the greatest, but unlike anything I had ever seen before. All in all I could have enjoyed this movie (aside from the fact that it came to an abrupt halt...as if they ran out of money or film)had it not been for the horrible soundtrack. It was completely distracting, and did not fit the mood of the scenes it should have been enhancing. One suspenseful scene was backed by what sounded like a sit-com track. If you decide to watch this one, either turn down the sound when no one is speaking, or turn it up to discover how a soundtrack does affect the whole experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By Roman Polanski and with Johnny Depp, promising terror and the supernatural, I thought it would be the perfect distraction.The opening credits were promising enough. The camera gliding wraith-like through great old stone and wood doors, opening into vast deserts of darkened rooms in which hung the credits, mid-air; gliding across the sandy floors, speeding towards the gleaming credits, through them just as they'd become legible then leaving them far behind for another heavy gate, heralding some supreme evil at the end of them all.I do like a good set of credits. But beyond the credits there wasn't a lot to be found. There is a neat storyline in this film, a sort of riddle which ties itself up nicely in the end, but this could have been done as well, if not better, in a short film.*The Ninth Gate* could have done without the shonky action shots, the horribly cliched script and the ordinary casting [few of the characters work]. Depp [who as far as I'm concerned has had his last chance] never really came out from behind his hard-nosed grifter veneer [there's a reason, but it's not apparent until the end]. If you want to escape, this film will do it for you, but only just.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1999 was the year of demonic movies, but save your time for Stigmata, or even End of Days . Roman Polanski misses the boat here. There is no action. The plot is trite, and unfolds tediously. Johnny Depp sleepwalks through his starring role . Frank Langella is hammy when he needs scarry. Lena Olin and Emmanuelle Seigner are ornamental, but wooden . Seigner's character is intended to be mysterious . In this the movie finally succeeeds in something , but as a result, we never figure her out, leaving us with no characters to care about, not even an anti-hero or attractive villain. Polanski might have made a tight 105 minute comment on the attractiveness of evil, or the inevitabilty of descent once one wanders from virtue . Instead, he gives a 133 minute cure for insomnia , which is self-consciously artsy, rather than entertaining. An average episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer has more tension, and more fun . Lets hope Polanski gives us a better effort next time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yawn, with a laughable ending.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took three screenwriters to come up with a "who cares?" story with a dud of an ending. Millionaire book collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) hires Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) - a rare-book dealer - to track down two copies of a satanic book and compare engravings to his copy.The Ninth Gate is not an intelligent or a sophisticated movie. It's not even clever. The devil is apparent the moment we are introduced. So are the "signs and symbols". Everything is blatantly handed to us. Yawn.The ending is laughable. Any intelligent actor would have spoken up and challenged the writers and the directors to a rewrite. That being said, you have to wonder if the screenwriters - especially Polanski - subconsciously wanted to make a statement about their own relationships with women. I have one thing to say about that: you picked her, buddy! (Or bought her.)Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roman Polanski has really lost it as a filmmaker. I didn't see (and don't intend to see) THE PIANIST, so I can't comment on his most recent film but personally speaking, THE NINTH GATE is one of the dullest, most tedious films I've ever seen. The film is professionally made but there's absolutely nothing in it: no interesting characters, no interesting drama, no interesting setting, no interesting story, etc. Everyone looks like they just showed up for work, shot some scenes and went back home. No one, and I mean no one looks interested in what they're doing. His previous films, including FRANTIC, suffer from this as well. Everything is simply a job to Roman "Punch your card and grab your paycheck" Polanski.Polanski's films are usually overdirected products but his earlier films had a flair of fun and a definitive ting of danger in them. Not so anymore. The man is totally a professional now, meaning he has nothing interesting to say and there's simply nothing interesting in THE NINTH GATE. I've seen wallpaper more exciting than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor and cliched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comments here seem to come from two camps, one of which supports Polanski and the other of which uses movies like the Matrix as a barometer of quality. The truth is, this movie is poor, not because a lack of action scenes or explosions, but because it has nothing new to offer. Action movies are entertaining in their own right, as intellectual and explorative movies are in theirs. However, this movie manages to avoid both. The initial concept of a book authenticator being protagonist was promising, but what follows is the staid "Assemble the pieces of the puzzle that allow one to summon Satan" formula. There is nothing to engage either the mind or the adrenaline glands in this movie. The "floating" effect of the nameless female character destroys any possibility of reading the story as being one of true supernatural elements versus collective delusion. Instead we are left with the most cookie cutter version of the Summoning genre, devoid of both visceral and intellectual value. If Polanski's name were not on this film, it would be universally panned, and it is only his presence that makes it viable for pseudo-intellectuals to willingly embrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about books that's only good on paper</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate ought to be a good movie. It boasts a famed director, some very accomplished actors, truly elegant locations, and a story overflowing with possibilities. Yet, for some reason, the film simply refuses to take these ingredients and make something interesting out of them. Quite frankly, this film is DULL. Not in a `there-not-enough-fighting-and-guts' way, but a `why-am-I-supposed-to-even-remotely-care-about-these-people?' way. For one the cast's performances are uniformly dull. In fact, whether they are supposed to be excited, angry, frightened, or dieing, everyone seems downright BORED. Things aren't helped much by the clichéd, unnatural dialogue either. Truly artless direction, surprisingly enough, is the final nail in the coffin. Somehow, poor Mr. Polanski has found a way to suck what little energy might have been generated out of the film through a plain, painfully unimaginative, job that occasionally borders on amateur (the Peter Pan-like wire work during the obviously over-rehearsed `fight' scene is especially embarrassing). Ultimately, The Ninth Gate recalls the campy B-movie relics of the fifties (the ones we keep around to make fun of, not the ones that actually stand the test of time) in a very bad way. There are simply too many obvious and inexcusable flaws to take it as anything other than an example of how even promising ingredients can fail to survive the trip from the page to the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was I thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My theory about this movie is that there is a huge conspiracy behind it. There is a massive game set up where people who have already seen the film tell others that it's really good, and that they should go see it as well. For every idiot that believes them, they get one point, and whoever gets the most points wins. Anyway, whoever told my girlfriend that renting the movie was a good idea is probably laughing their head off right now.Indeed, the plot did sound rather intriguing. I usually find movies with a religious theme interesting, but this one was so poorly done I could hardly believe it. The only element of the plot that held any "suspense" was Johnny Depp's (I didn't feel enough connection with the character to bother remembering his name) quest to compare the three books, and although the solution became painfully obvious about halfway through the movie there was still another hour or so spent on the subject.Even the rather slow and hard-to-believe plot line could have been partially saved by an interesting ending. Unfortunately, I would have to say that the film had one of the lamest endings I've ever seen, being far too simplistic and answering virtually none of the questions which were raised. I haven't read the novel that it's based on, but I'd recommend going for the book instead of the film version. It must be better, since it can't possibly be any worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is an unscrupulous NYC rare-books dealer. He is brought in by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who specializes in collecting books on the Devil. He has just acquired the 1666 Aristide Torchia's The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows from the collector Andrew Telfer right before he committed suicide. Aristide was burned by the Inquisition along with his books except for three surviving volumes. Balkan is convinced that only one book is authentic and hires Corso to find the other two to determine if his is the one. A correct reading of the book's engravings is reputed to raise the Devil. Corso is skeptical especially since Balkan allows him to take his book. Andrew's widow Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) wants to get the book back. There is also the mysterious girl (Emmanuelle Seigner) stalking him.Director Roman Polanski returns to the supernatural with much less success. The premise of books which could raise the Devil is interesting. However the movie has no tension. Johnny Depp is a pretty compelling lead but the quest lacks the required excitement. The start is pretty good but the movie slowly deteriorates. The movie does have some spookiness like a musty old book store. The ending is so underwhelming that I lost any feelings for this movie.</fullReview>

Not challenging at all for the viewer, not in the slightest bit creepy and maybe it is Polanski's style but it looks amateurish. Maybe it is in the field of the Italian Giallo style and I am doing it a dis-service but it really was Hammer meets Tin Tin and then add on another half an hour just to try and make it epic but it then just becomes bloated and boring after at least giving you some laughs early on, the scene when Liana Telfer visits and seduces then attacks Jonny Depp is pure comedy, the Girl was identified as the devil when she appears on the other side of the library shelves to Depp in another cheesy scene and those two Spanish book dealers, are they twins and in fact the same actor ? was straight out of Tin Tin. Really, if you want to see how these kind of films can be done just go to the Hammer series of films especially the ones based on Dennis Wheatley films. It is also sloppy as it is never too clear what the Ninth Gate is for, is it to bring out the divil or for someone to enter and the characters and acting (other than Depp) are 2 dimensional and you have no empathy for them. Polanski being self indulgent and full of himself, shocking display of film making.cack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The authentic images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's use the detective film as example.At a basic level filmmakers tell us detective stories, where the man seeking 'truth' unravels a plot. Our reward is the answer to the riddle.Better filmmakers invoke the atmospheres of the places where these similar stories have taken place. Having invoked a visual memory, a set of images that we associate with a type of film, they wish to see behind the image, the processes by which it comes into being. Lynch does this, by presenting us with noir situations as they manifest in the mind. Here he we experience the detective film internally, where it was generated in the first place. Our reward, often in the absence of any easy answers, is a glimpse of the mechanisms behind the questions.And there's a select few filmmakers, sages of cinema, who emerge from this pursuit for meaning with wisdom and the ability to inform our awareness in turn. By severing the bonds that bind him to ego and the self, the journalist in The Passenger, abandons his role as the man seeking 'truth'. What we're left with is an awareness of the world as it is, a playground of possibilities and distant threats where films vaguely unfold in the background. At some point in the 70's, Polanski seemed like he could fit all the criteria. Then something happened, and he resurfaced later in Europe in a Hitchcock mode. We can practically see the transition in the two halves of Frantic, as the elusive mystery turns into a conspiracy. The Ninth Gate (and to a lesser extent The Ghost Writer) show the decadence of that mode.We have a detective here seeking hidden meanings in ancient relics. As he salvages the Fargas copy of the book from a fireplace, with only the engravings torn from it, we understand that only this set of images removed from the book matters and the text is trivial, itself a commentary on the processes of the detective film.The decadence then is firstly encountered in what this specific set of images is meant to unlock, communion with the Devil. Occultists from the Middle Ages were devoted in the same decadent work, the devising of elaborate symbols in which supposedly was encrypted 'important knowledge'. Decadent because knowledge was obscured, meant only for the enlightenment of the few, and focus was reserved not for the realities a symbol suggests but the symbols themselves.The symbols were thought to matter, in a magickal way. Polanski naively, perhaps unwittingly, transfers this mode into his film.We see, by Balkan's failed attempt, that knowledge is not to be unlocked in the images themselves. As we discover, they need to be the authentic images, meaning a power exists in the original frame itself which cannot be reproduced by human hand.This is why the spiritual journey which Corso finally undertakes becomes meaningless to me. On one hand it's not the text or images that we may gather but our pursuit of gathering them, on the other hand these tools by which we can attempt communion with worlds beyond are not to be discovered within, by introspection, by a new awareness, but rather on top of a dusty cupboard somewhere in Portugal.More importantly, anxieties of the soul, which earlier Polanski had discovered to spring from the dissolution of the self, of this illusionary consciousness, are now the byproduct of larger conspiracies at work. If peace eludes us then, it's not because we haven't mustered the courage to defeat inner demons but because we are mere pawns in the grand schemes of powerful orders.What little of this works is lost in a blur of something that is very brown and explains too much for its own sake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might have been tolerable at 90 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat embarrassing supernatural thriller from Roman Polanski. Johnny Depp plays a rare book collector who is employed by Frank Langella to compare his super-rare demonic scripture to the two other copies in existence. Depp at first is ecstatic to get such a high paying job, but soon he is being attacked by the book's former owner (Lena Olin) as well as being stalked by a bizarre and mysterious blonde (Emmanuelle Seigner). People begin to die all around him. With films like Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant under Polanski's belt, one might hope for something eerie and subtle. No, this is something more along the lines of Sam Raimi, loud, campy and kinda silly. But not in a bad way, necessarily. It can be quite a bit of fun at times. I loved the bit with the electric wheelchair, for instance. However, the film moves pretty slowly, there's not enough of the fun stuff and I had lost interest pretty early in, only occasionally getting back into it. It really doesn't need to run for two hours and fifteen minutes (to add insult to injury, Lionsgate's Blu Ray, which can be purchased for $10, lists an incorrect - and much shorter - running time on the back of the box).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie on television a while back and only watched a bit of it because I had something to do. Suffice to say I found it very interesting as Depp's character was appraising these books and then went on to have an interesting conversation with another character interested in a book known as the "Ninth Gate". Well I found this movie cheap years later so I bought it and it played out somewhat good, as all the book research was actually pretty interesting. Also, there was possible conspiracy afoot. A few twists and turns here and there as Depp's character does not know who to trust, as he is set on a mission to compare three books with each other, those who own the other books are being snuffed out. Then near the end it just got to weird as Depp's character seemed to do some stuff that did not seem to be his motivation for the majority of the flick. He seemed to develop an interest for what the book did on the spur of the moment and it kind of made the movie crash when there were some strange happenings. Still, it was enjoyable enough for what it was, just needed a better ending possibly more realistic. For the most part though this movie is sort of like the satanic version of Da Vinci Code...however, it still has some humorous moments as well and strange bits of music that makes it seem like it is a comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I was looking forward to this, as I'm a fan of both Johnny Depp and Roman Polanski. Polanski has done some awful clunkers, but I was hoping this would be of the quality of The Pianist (whis is, IMO, a masterpiece).It started off intriguingly, with the opening credits and the U.S.-based scenes which set the plot up nicely.But as soon as the action shifted to Europe, the wheels came off.Suddenly we were plunged into what looked like a cross between "The DaVinci Code" and "Eyes Wide Shut" (two truly awful films in their own right), filtered through an old episode of "The Avengers", and done as a Hammer horror spoof. Only if Hammer had done it, they'd have made a better job of it (Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt would have been ideal in their heyday).By the time of the closing scenes in the castle, the missus and I were laughing out loud, it was that bad. Still, things could be worse, it could have been an adaptation of the God-awful "The Shadow Of The Wind" (oh no, I said it, now it WILL happen!!!) I've given it four stars for the first twenty minutes, but I'm afraid the stars just bled away after that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ninth Gate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Book Detective"(a person whose job is to authenticate and track down rare books)Dean Corso(Johnny Depp)is sent on a journey to compare his client, Boris Balkan's(Frank Langella)book The Ninth Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows with two others, getting paid quite a substantial amount for his efforts. Balkan wants to see if his book is the authentic version of the book, authored by Torchia, who was burnt at the stake..and, also, supposedly written by Satan himself. When asked if Corso believes in the supernatural by Balkan, he replies, "I believe in my percentage." When asked if he even liked Balkan, Corso replies, "I don't have to like you..you're a client and you pay well." Two others own the other books authored by Torchia "and Satan", Fargas("Some books are dangerous not to be opened with impunity"), a collector who is seemingly in debt and selling off his possessions, and a wheel-chair bound cripple named Baroness Kessler("I saw him one day. I was 15 years old and I saw him as plain as I see you. It was love at first sight."). Kessler mentions to Corso that there was an order dedicated to Torchia and Satan called The Order of the Silver Serpent where rich aging couples use a sect gathering as an excuse to commit carnal orgies. Sinister things begin to occur to Dean. He carries Balkan's book with him everywhere and it seems many desire to possess it..even kill for it. Particularly persistent is Liana Telfer(Lena Olin, perfectly cast)whose husband committed suicide after selling the Nine gates book to Balkan. She has a blond black henchman following Corso everywhere..Liana even slept with Corso as a means to possess the book. Corso even loses a fellow collector, Bernie(James Russo), who owns a book store, to death thanks to his hiding the book in a safe place. As Corso pursues the truth on why all three books have variations in them, particularly the different riddles on photos in each and how images appear slightly changed. Even more threatening is that the two collectors, Fargas and Kessler, who owned the other two books, wind up murdered by someone..could it be Balkan or Telfer behind these deaths? Adding to everything else is a mysterious young woman, who appears to be Corso's guardian angel, always around and seems to know more about what's going on than he does. As Corso admits to her, "Someone's playing a game with me." His guardian angel(portrayed by Emmanuelle Seigner)replies, "Of course, you're part of it. And, you're getting to like it." Through all the danger Corso faces, he does begin to desire understanding the truth behind the Nine gates himself, immersing in the shark-infested waters seductively willing to continue.I simply think this movie is marvelous..so brilliantly constructed and mysterious. Seemingly unpredictable and always taking us into one fascinating encounter after another with Corso walking that line between life and death all the way. Probably my favorite film on Satan, the film, despite all the different things that takes place throughout, is always centered around Lucifer and the books he might've rented. As twin collectors(who sold their Torchia book to Telfer)pointed out when mentioning how Torchia dies at the stake as a victim of the Inquisition in Vienna 1667, "Even hell has it's heroes."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly the Pitts!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, from the start I am going to be quite honest. I LOVE Johnny Depp and would readily watch anything he does. Roman Polanski is always interesting, at least, and with such stalwart credits as "Rosemary's Baby" and "Chinatown", I figured, "how bad could it be?" Trust me....THAT bad. The plot was simple and interesting enough to command my attention but the storytelling could not at all keep it. I fell asleep and missed the ending and from what I understand, that did not hamper the whole film experience. Johnny Depp was gorgeous and adept and Frank Langella was sinister enough. I agree with another reviewer in that the picture set a mood and always remained on the fringes of being a thought-provoking piece of work, but, alas, fell horribly short. Of course, you must be true to your own opinions and tastes. It is worth a viewing for no other reason than it has a reputable cast and director, and is a mood piece but the bottom line is this is one to use on those nights you can't fall asleep and you don't want to use drugs of any sort. This will definitely do the trick!!!!!!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9th Gate-Euro Trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roman Polanski tries to present a tale of devil worship in the modern era with his library- centric tale of greed and murder in the book trade. Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a sleazy appraiser of rare books who is hired by Boris Balkan (Frank Langella), a ruthless collector of missives on Satan. He has acquired a rare volume titled "The Ninth Gate" which is reputed to hold the key to conjure up the demon, and provide its owner with supreme "self- enlightenment." Corso's task is to compare and contrast the remaining volumes of the book held in private collections in Europe and report back to Balkan on the authenticity of his book. Somehow, there exists in Europe, groups of aristocrats who, having outlived love-ins, have turned to devil worship to provide excuses to meet in castles and have orgies. Priestess among this group is the widow, St. Martin (Lena Olin), a woman who wants her book back from Balkan at all costs.The thinly veiled excuse to visit European locations in Spain and Paris provides Polanski and Depp with the fodder to drag the story through deserted estate homes, old book collections, and the Seine where Depp keeps running into Mrs. Polanski, a somewhat handy person to have in a scrap as she floats through life hanging out wherever Corso seems to hang his hat, and she can kick fight when Corso gets attacked by lackey's of Mrs. San Martin. Throughout this film, the theme of books co-authored by Lucifer and possessing the key to demonic enlightenment is a somewhat convoluted mystery of who has the real volume of the "Ninth Gate." Balkan wants his copy to be the only authentic copy, and he kills everyone who possess the rival copies burning libraries in the process. Nevertheless, his heavy handed arrogance is not sufficient to pull the secret of the three volumes together to permit him to access "The Master" leaving only Corso and Mrs. Polanski in the end to do the deed.While some may find the ramblings of Polanski's tale entertainment, it is a shoddy production with little to compare it to earlier works by the director, who should never cast his wife in his films. She has no chemistry with Depp's Corso, and while she is unique in appearance, is not of the calibre of actors as Olin, Langella and Depp. All in all, a significant disappointment and silly film that can easily be overlooked in the oeuvre of an auteur filmmaker who should have known better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though rich in atmosphere and mood, with excellent cinematography both indoors and out, and a decent musical score that helps contribute to the movie's eerie feel, the Ninth Gate falls apart in all other regards. I appreciate all the users' comments that attempted to explain this movie to me, but in the end I have to agree with the protests of those who found fault with the ending (or really, the lack thereof), thin plot, tediously slow story development, and some pretty glaring gaps in the logic. Some strange and esoteric movies have captivated me in the past, but this one either went over my head or died crossing the street. I appreciate Johnny Depp's skill as an actor, so I'll give an extra point for that, but the end result for me was an unsatisfying movie experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depp seems undecided whether this is comedy, drama or horror although his acting, as always, is solid and entertaining.Other performances range from hammy to wooden and the story itself seems to try to be thoughtful and arty, but simply comes off as second rate.The score, again trying to avoid standard horror/ drama nuances, is often jarringly comic.And, yes, being Polanski there is a gratuitous sex scene which adds nothing and removes much (unless you are taken in by the unlikely sex-magick larks).In short, watch it if you aren't paying for the privilege of doing so and have low expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a first for me not really liking a Johnny Depp film. I have been a fan of his way before "Pirates of the Carrabean", the first film I saw of his was "Edward Scissorhands" when I was 5 years old. I was hooked ever since. I have -ALMOST- seen every movie of his. That's how much I enjoy his work. So, I didn't really hesitate to see "The Ninth Gate". It was an alright movie. It didn't really excite me though. Throughout the movie, for me at least, it was pretty predictable. Roman is a very gifted director. I think he is one of the best around, and the picture is very well directed. It was just the story for the most part. I think I've seen too many "End of Days" type of movies.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The script for this probably looked fairly interesting to Mr. Depp. He puts his all into creating a style and look for his character. His acting is wonderful and the scenes between Depp and Lena Olin are the only interesting bits. The actual directing and final editing of this film were what damaged it to the extent that it is reminiscent of bad 70s and 80s TV mysteries. If Jessica Fletcher had shown up, it would have been fitting!The supernatural overtones to this mystery aren't handled as well as Joss Whedon's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" did in its seven-year run. When someone in Sunnydale was trying to conjure up someone or something, at least it was interesting! The goal in this film, to meet the Devil, just seems trivial and silly!

It was filled with spooky scenes, spooky castles, spooky music, spooky characters, and on and on...In the end I just had to laugh "this movie can't end like this, no way". But actually it was a perfectly spooky ending...Johnny Depp made a good performance as a spooky antique book salesman, who had no glue what was going on around him. He looked like a fool all the time.Most of the other characters were also utterly stupid and naive, and the flying devil dressed in a sexy woman's outfit was also very ridiculous and made no sense whatsoever. Even the stupidness of this movie was spooky.If you want to see a brainless thriller that doesn't scare you in the least, this is the movie.

		<fullReview>Okay, Edward Scissorhands threw me off Depp completely. Benny &amp; Joon was NOT a good movie, in my opinion, and What's Eating Gilbert Grape was good, but at the same time, weirdly atrocious.But of late, I'll say in the past few years, Depp has risen above his little avant-garde style of role choices and thankfully, so has his performance quality. While he seems to loathe the mainstream, he fits into it quite well, in my opinion.The Ninth Gate was a HP Lovecraft-esquire story in which Depp's character is an antique book dealer sent out to compare three copies of a book most dire. His job is to authenticate the copy held by his employer.There are some slow spots where not even character development is being utilized, and Emmanuelle Seigner's acting talents are practically non-existent. Those are the down-sides of this production.Beyond that, the story was dark and riddled with intrigue, the direction was adequate, and Depp's performance was outstanding. Too bad this movie did not rate his attempts. The potential for greatness was wasted here. The best aspect of this movie was Depp and the almost good story line which was botched somewhere along the path to the cutting room. It had such a great potential, but this production fell far short of realizing that potential.It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend.</fullReview>

As you watch the minutes tick by on the VCR/DVD player, etc., you slowly notice that you are actually losing more and more of your life as you continue to waste your time on this piece of drivel.It starts good.. then ends terribly and completely disinterested me in seeing another Polanski film for a long time.4/10 for production values, Depp, and this miserable excuse for a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a bachelor's degree in history, yet I couldn't make heads or tails of "The Ninth Gate". The plot is somewhat interesting for the first hour, despite some obvious cliches. In the last half-hour, the movie falls apart. I was really disappointed because I like Johnny Depp a lot and was hoping for a good movie on this interesting subject.My take on what went wrong with this film is that Polanski tried to make a mainstream movie, with the requisite amount of sex and violence, about a subject which is unconventional. We didn't need the over-the-top scenes of hellfire and burning buildings toward the end, but someone must have thought we did.The plot was also ridiculously complicated for the last half-hour. Two of the main characters (Frank Langella and Lena Olin) are betrayed, as act completely uncharacteristically in order to serve the convoluted and histrionic final scenes. Don't bother with this poor film. 4/10.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp (who I normally like) doesn't have much to do except smoke incessantly and seem massively detached. His love scenes are totally devoid of passion and any involvement. Frank Langella I hope (like other members of the cast) is embarrassed by the silly role he was asked to portray. He is a fine actor who has done some great work, such as "Frost/Nixon". The plot was transparent - I could see almost every new event coming. Overall, a cheap, not very entertaining thriller wannabe. Not worthy of Roman Polanski's time and involvement.</fullReview>

Tension rises when (SPOILER) Depp's pal meets a grisly end portented in the iniquitous text. Thus begins a jaunt across continental europe, which unfortunately descends rapidly into sub B-movie dross. Hammy acting, wooden characters and a risibly incongruous score means that by the time the woeful end comes you're left relieved (phew.. thought it would never end) and frustrated in equal measures (is that it???? what happens next?). When Depp eventually confronts the eponymous gate what are we given for suffering through the plodding plot: the sterile directorial cop out ...fade to credits. To add insult to injury, we're left none the wiser about that silly French bint who floats about (sometimes literally) during the movie. Note to directors: enigma and suggestion can be very effective in film (cf. Blade Runner) - half baked ideas about throwing in some ill-thought through 'eerie' character, whom you give the audience no raison d'etre for are just annoying and lazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potbolier, pastiche, Polansksi!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Arturo Perez-Reverte writes taut thrillers whose distinctive settings almost manage to disguise their fundamentally generic elements; Roman Polanski has a long and interesting career as a film-maker; and yet this adaptation of one of Perez-Reverte's works by Polanksi disappointingly emphasises all its more potboilerish elements. So the plot feature megalomaniac millionaires, secret societies, a hero who never goes to the police when witness to murder, and a mysterious, kick-boxing female sidekick. While the film features dire acting (Emmanuelle Seiger is especially bad, it's not actually possible to tell if she is trying to play a human or an angel), hackneyed (English) dialogue spoken in cod-European accents, and some of the most risably choreographed action scenes I've ever seen. This level of basic ineptitude simply wasn't something I expected from Polanski, although the comic soundtrack rather adds to the impression that it's intended as pastiche (although, if so, it's pastiche without jokes). And the film is also lazy, failing to follow through its conceits with rigour. For example, the story hinges on a priceless ancient book (a book, in fact, for which people are prepared to kill), but the hero walks through the streets with it under his arm in a linen sack, and reads it carelessly, dirty-fingered and smoking. The film loses further marks in its ending. Polanksi has, I believe, added satanic elements to the original story (in keeping with his previous work), but these are simply ludicrous; and the film's final ending just baffling. As is the fact that such a distinguished cinematiste could have made such a truly awful work.</fullReview>

'Angel Heart' meets 'The Big Sleep' could have been the pitch in this juiceless Roman Polanski helmed supernatural noir tale based on Arturo Perez-Reuerte's book 'El Club Dumas' with Depp as a book detective of sorts who is hired by sinister rich collector Langella to find two more copies of a rare book supposedly ghost written for ?Satan! Yes check all other signs of believeablilty at the door because it doesn't get any better as it continues in its snail pacing, wooden acting (the ethereal Seigner ?that's Mrs. Polanski to you) and suspension of disbelief all congeals into a static storyline that could've used more horror (or at least action) than it intends. The few good things to mention are Darius Khondji's bruised cinematography and the atmospherically murky production design by Dean Tavoulairs. Depp, who seems to have a cottage industry on loner oddballs, tries to keep things lively even if it means resorting to him chain smoking and bingining on Jack Daniels throughout the film. Sadly Polanski seems to have lost his touch in something that should have been up his alley ('Rosemary's Library'? anyone).</fullReview>

The first of the other two books resides in Portugal with a collector called Victor Fargas (Jack Taylor) &amp; the other in Paris with Baroness Kessler (Barabra Jefford), wherever Corso travels death seems to follow as he digs deeper into the meaning of the books &amp; discovers that they may be the key to unleashing Satan himself upon the Earth...This French, Spanish &amp; American co-production was co-written, produced &amp; directed by Roman Polanski &amp; has a few admirable qualities but ultimately isn't that successful &amp; let down by a few things. The script by Polanski, John Brownjohn &amp; Enrique Urbizu was based on the novel 'El Club Dumas' by Arturo Perez-Reverte (it actually had a large subplot about a secret society obsessed with serialised novels such as those written by Alexandre Dumas during the 19th Century, a subplot which wasn't included in this filmed adaptation) takes itself extremely seriously &amp; indeed wants to be taken very seriously which is sort of it's downfall. The basic story is interesting for a while but it takes ages to get to where it's going &amp; the straight faced nature of all the mumbo jumbo nonsense is a little hard to take seriously. At well over 2 hours in length the film outstays it's welcome, for a film with a fairly simple plot &amp; little on screen action it sure takes it's time &amp; I have to admit I was starting to lose interest in it. I didn't like the ending either, the ambiguity surrounding the identity of the woman is frustrating to say the least, I had sat through over 2 hours of this to get to a resolution but if anything the end just poses more questions. In fact on the IMDb 'FAQ' page for The Ninth Gate the only question asked so far is 'Who was the girl?' &amp; every vague response is different which says everything about the mess of an ending. Also, if Balkan was prepared to kill people for the other two books so readily why did he need Corso? Surely Balkan could have just have the people murdered in the first place &amp; steal the books, does that not make a bit more sense instead of letting Curso wander around Europe with his copy &amp; indeed the only one in existence? Having said that I thought the film had some interesting ideas &amp; the basic story behind it was solid &amp; could have made for an exciting supernatural thriller which to be fair it almost is. The character's are pretty good &amp; the dialogue is fine but it's just a bit too slow &amp; hard to stay with.Director Polanski returns to the horror genre for the first time since The Tenant (1976) &amp; The Ninth Gate is a surprisingly bland film, it's well made &amp; there are one or two little touches of style &amp; imagination but not many. The film is very grounded in reality until the very end &amp; tries to pile on the paranoia &amp; mystery which is alright but at the expense of being scary or frightening, in fact until the final few minutes there is no indication anything supernatural is going to happen at all. There's no blood or gore &amp; few special effects.With a supposed budget of about $38,000,000 (which sounds a lot considering how the film turned out) this is well made with that big budget Hollywood look, shot on location in France, Spain &amp; Portugal. Depp made this before he shot to mega stardom as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean flicks, the rest of the cast are pretty much unknowns to me.The Ninth Gate is a straight faced supernatural thriller which could have been better but then again it could have been worse, some of it works while some of it doesn't. I liked it, just about, but I doubt I'll ever want to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All that keeps Polanski from descending into the pitiless depths of self parody are the acting talents of Johnny Depp and excellent cinematography. The plot, preposterous as it seems, does fascinate the viewer, as long as one ignores the illogical sequence of events. The movie opens with a book collector hanging himself in his library, and then introduces Depp as an amoral book appraiser and "detective." After swindling an incapacitated collector, Depp is summoned by an enigmatic and powerful collector. Depp's task is to authenticate a rare and sinister demonic text. The chase is then on! Depp's sometimes partner is ritualistically murdered for a mysterious purpose, and Depp then heads to Europe. On the way, Depp bumps into a passionate, dark haired woman; an other wordly attractive blonde; a host of other strange book collecting characters. At this point it becomes difficult to discuss the movie in familiar terms of storyline and climax, and one has to start deconstructing sub-text and symbolism. In other words, this movie fails to deliver as a movie, and has to resort to literary tricks and intellectual subterfuge. Slowly, the viewer comes to the horrifying realization that this movie has functioned mainly as a vehicle for Depp and provides further proof of Polanski's cinematic irrelevance. The underwhelming final scene should come as no real surprise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I viewed this film without reading any reviews or information about it beforehand. In other words, my mind was clear and open. I also made the mistake of watching it on a non-premium cable channel, which means it got cut with commercials. At 2 1/2 hours in length, I didn't see much difference in this and the legion of other films of the same genre. It was too long(yes, I adjusted my attitude for the commercials) and just kept taking us all around the world looking/searching/finding/not finding what Johnny Depp was looking for. There were too many unnecessary/marginal characters that made the film drag on like a political speech. And the ending was, to use an old latin expression, non-sequiter. This was a waste of my time-don't waste yours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Possible spoilers)  I'm not sure what Johnny Depp was thinking when he took this part, but he must have not been thinking too clearly because this is easily one of the worst films in a long time. Now to his credit Depp isn't bad in "The Ninth Gate," quite the opposite, he's actually good. It's just that the rest of the film isn't at all. A short list of problems are, the story which makes next to no sense, the rest of the acting is horrible, the climax is one of the worst in cinema history and there's no real direction the movie is going in. I'm glad turkeys like this may be a dying breed of film, I don't know how many more of these stinkers I can take. 0 stars.</fullReview>

The end has to be one of the most anti-climatic, poorly directed I´ve seen in many, many years. It feels like they didn´t have enough cash to finish it properly... and you just want to go to the box office and ask for your money back.Please, trust me. Don´t waste your time and money.

		<fullReview>lousy, boring movie that just dragged on and on only to finish with an ending that made no sense at all. All I saw was a cigarette smoking Johnny Depp. Don't waste your time on this, you'll be disappointed for sure. The acting was second rate, Depp has done better, its obvious he didn't like the movie either, he was probably forced to take this role. It starts out interesting and you expect more, but it never comes. There's no climax, except literally, the plot is lousy, the general mood of the movie puts you to sleep faster than you can say pentagram. This is one movie I wouldn't even save or have in my library, it reminds me of one of those low budget movies that people put together just for the sake of it. 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Polanski spends all of it's time being an almost B-Genre horror suspense movie then decides to try tag on a philosophical tinge at the end with the ambiguous ending.The ending really is pitiful. I have seen movies that leave things up to the viewer, that are based on individual interpretation but this is just weak.The whole movie is a rather simple mystery but you go along because you expect something else. You wait for it to get complicated or throw you a new twist. But it doesn't. You know everything five minutes before it happens.The performances and the beautiful photography keep it going...barely.But the movie is obvious and just plain adolescent. It doesn't explore any kind of religious ideas. It doesn't offer anything scary and it sure doesn't give you anything new as a suspense film.It only offers an interesting lead character and that's it.You wait and you wait for an explanation of why everything is so simple and obvious. It never comes.And the more you think about the ending the more it seems like the screenplay was written by two high school kids. Or worse two grade schoolers.Could of been good. Should of been good.Polanski has done some great films. And some really bad ones. ("Pirates" anyone?) This is probably his laziest film.Why on earth did everyone involved agree to do this after reading the abysmal story is just as puzzling as the ending.Oh yeah and Dubois did some horrible CGI work on this. I've seen better special effects on Star Trek.If the fake backgrounds while driving were an homage to Hitchcock then he should of done them with a bad bluescreen instead of expensive CGI.Ugh...what a waste. Hopefully someone will see all theses bad reviews and save themselves two hours and watch something else.You were warned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: some may consider this a spoiler!This film is two and a half hours of build up to ... nothing. The movie just stops. I don't ask that movies be tied up in a neat little package at the end, but it is nice for a movie to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Two out of three isn't enough.Combine that with sub-standard (and oddly placed) special effects shots (I've seen better in Japanese monster movies), cheesy character hooks (Balkan's code is 666 -- please!), and a bad script (why did Corso take a personal interest in the books?), and you're left wondering where your eight bucks went and pining over the near three hours of your life that you'll never get back.The score sounds like my four year old niece pounding randomly on the piano keys. On top of that, the music clearly telescopes with it's 'danger music', neatly removing any tension that might have once existed.The direction feels like a first year film student trying to make an 'art' film. The resulting product firmly places Roman Polanski in the crowded niche of under-talented, self-important directors who appeal to crowds who believe, 'if it doesn't make sense, it's art.'Unfortunately, the otherwise talented cast is dragged down by the incompetent direction.Flush eight bucks down the toilet. The end result is the same, and you won't waste three hours of your life doing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERSSo my parents and I went out to see a movie last night. I was not in the mood to see something deep and tear-jerking on my first day of Spring Break, so we decided we would see the Ninth Gate, figuring that my dad would like stuff that got blown up, and my mom and I could sit there and drool over Johnny Depp.The first major hint of the evening was that these people were cutting in front of us in line. My dad made sort of a deal about it, and the people were surly and not very forgiving. It wasn't until after the movie that we realized these people were trying to tell us something, like guardian angels or whatnot.So the movie starts out, and yummy there's Johnny Depp, and he's looking for some books about Satan. And then he looks for the books some more. And then some people die because supposedly someone else wants these books. As the audience and I sat there for what seemed like at least one full term of pregnancy, only more painful, the movie started revealing that someone had dropped something on the script and that all the major plot points had been destroyed.So finally, we find out there's something to do with the pictures in this book, and if somebody puts all the pictures together and says some Satanic incantation, then he or she gets invincibility or some such nonsense. So this guy steals all the pictures, and Johnny Depp finds him in a castle saying the incantation, and then the guy sets himself on fire, and he dies. Um, okay. After that, Depp steals all the pictures, then goes outside while the castle is on fire, and has sex with this demon/angel girl on the lawn. (This girl pops in and out of the movie, but nothing ever explains why.)Here's the kicker, and I have no qualms about telling you the ending because none of you will ever see this movie if you value your sanity, your health, or your $9.50. The people writing the script got to a challenging point, that point being that there was absolutely nowhere left to go since all the main characters except Depp and this girl had been killed off. Someone obviously said, "How are we going to end this movie?" And someone else said, "Let's just end it." Thus, Depp is riding along in the car with this chick, and he says, "Why did the guy not become invincible?" And the girl says, "Because one of his pictures is a forgery." And he says, "Where's the other one?" The girl says, "At this place in Spain." Depp says, "Okay," and goes there.Depp is in this place in Spain. He doesn't look for the picture, because it falls of a bookshelf at his feet. He picks it up. Then goes back to the castle. The castle has a lot of light inside. He goes inside the castle.END OF MOVIE, CREDITS START ROLLING"NO!" screamed the audience. "NO! YOU CAN'T DO THAT! WE SAT THROUGH THIS ENTIRE MOVIE, HALF OF THE AUDIENCE NOW HAS BEARDS, AND THAT'S THE END? NOOOOOO!!!!"I seriously want to hurt someone. Maybe Roman Polanski who directed it. Who thought this movie was a good idea? My favorite part, I must say, is that this angel/demon girl has no explanation for being in the movie. Somebody said, "Hey, dude! Let's have this chick, and she's sort of an angel or something, and she can be pretty, and like, dude, at the end! She can have sex with Johnny Depp while this castle is on fire! Heh, heh! Fire! Fire! Sex! Destruction! Heh, heh!"This movie gets 7 out of 10 Picnics at Hanging Rock. The movie was fine up until it just ended out of nowhere, only because I was expecting some big finish. Also, yummmm, Johnny Depp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had the potential to be a great movie, the start is quite adequate, but you keep watching in the hope it builds up. (spoiler) It doesn't, it just doesn't. It reminded me of The Omen, the way it unfolds more and more about Satan and his followers but then it turns into a lame Eyes Wide Shut with no orgy. Eyes Wide Shut may have came out after it or around the same time so I don't know who ripped off who, or if it was a coincidence but this film sucks, to put it bluntly. It also contains one of the worst fight scenes ever, I am not a director or film student or anything like that but I wish I could have worked on this film as a producer or whatever, there are some watchable bits in this film, not much though. I would do a complete rewrite on the ending and last scenes because they stunk. Maybe they didn't have a good budget or something and that's why the films so weak, like the effects on the fire in baronesses flat and the final final minutes of the movie which are horrendous. Time spent watching this is time wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film did hold my attention for the first half hour. I wondered if Johnny Depp had bothered reading the whole script as it became more incredulous as the film progressed. He appeared at first to be quite streetwise but lapsed into total naivety by the end. The book's owner was like the baddie in a poor pantomime. The film was classed as a supernatural thriller but I have seen more frightening scenes in Postman Pat. It is the sort of film that could be shown on weekday afternoons as it is in the same league as 'Murder She Wrote' apart from the ridiculous nude scene at the end. Speaking of the ending, did the cinematographer get a copy of Photoshop that Christmas? There could have been so much more done with this story as it did have elements of menace and danger that were waiting to be explored. Sadly as I watched all of it I was disappointed.

		<fullReview>The Ninth Gate: swift in movement, slick in dialogue, funny in setups, is a fairly brilliant comedy from the era. It has a nice rhythm: punch punch punch... bam bam bam... funny funny funny.Best line: "Even the paper sounds kosher." Disclaimer here: I watched this film on IFC. No commercials. What that means is: when you watch a movie at home, you need time to have a whizz and grab a nosh.So, back to the film...The contraposition of contemporary and period: architecture, lighting, hair styles, costumes and characters; with mood music of serious and funny to accentuate transition of scenes, the picture builds the continued rhythm of punch, bam, funny superstructure.As the film develops and deepens on this superstructure, it comes to a place 35 minutes in to, "canned corn" comedy. Then, continues on to go so far as to be "canned creamed corn"! "Canned Corn" is over-the-top comedy. "Creamed Canned Corn" is so over-the-top, it enters the very very delicate zone of "you-better-be-the-best" or "you-will-fall-flat-on-your-face". (Best canned creamed corn film: Mel Brooks 'Young Frankenstein')Polanski takes the leap from canned corn to creamed corn. A brave act by a brave director. Someone who took the brave leap to pluck the fresh flowering bud of a girl who just opened to womanhood.Did he succeed in plucking the flowering bud? Did he succeed in leaping from canned corn to creamed corn? You are the best answer for that question. For my part? I started reading about Russia and China's agreeing with the UN on criticizing Iran's nuclear program while waiting for Polanski's wrap-up conclusion to his offering in The Ninth Gate.Just to say, a tired Hollywood style pretty girl with tits and a suggestion of forever ending. Sorry I'm so damned demanding, but I just saw the Cohen Bros: A Serious Man...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful artistry, disappointing message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many splendid aspects of this film. As a musician, I noticed the prevalence of tritones in the score; the tritone was considered during Medieval times to be the musical interval of the devil! A clever detail. The photography, acting, dialogue, effects, pace, scenery, and suspense were all masterfully executed. However, I think that good artistry + bad message always= bad art, no matter how well done it is. Anyone with even the weakest moral compass should have been offended by the message of this film, which we do not fully receive until the very end.The cast is full of despicable characters; there is nary a kind selfless person who plays a main role. The protagonist (Depp's character), whom we are led to empathize with through the film, is at first solely motivated by money. However, he finally contracts the obsession of the other main characters: to pass through the "ninth gate" and behold Satan, himself. As the plot develops, we realize that Corso is unknowingly the only one worthy (worthy for an unknown reason--he is certainly no better a person than the others, just poorer) to achieve this goal. At the end, after we see how Satan has mercilessly and cruelly destroyed the lives of his devotees, we expect the protagonist to receive the same torture and betrayal the others received from their master. Yet we see him walking into a brilliant light, almost heavenly in its hue. Admittedly, the ending is somewhat ambiguous, but the style of the film leads us to feel a sense of relief and triumph that Corso finally attained the treasure at the end of the hunt-- and that is purported to be a blessing. I enjoyed this film until the end, when I realized that it truly is a devil-promoting film, even while cautioning us about his destructive evil power. As if being "worthy" to see Satan himself is something we should aspire to! This is a message I cannot see any reasonable person swallowing, even when candy-coated with good acting, good directing, good effects, and the like.To my mind, this film displays a lot of fabulous talent gone to waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant horror-thriller from the winning combination of Depp and Polanski</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Johnny Depp is a fantastic actor, and Roman Polanski is a fantastic director. These two have proved this fact time and time again and there is no disputing it. In this film, the latter directs the former who plays mercenary book dealer; Dean Corso. Corso is hired by a mysterious book collector to find the last two copies of 'The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows', a book reportedly co-written by the devil. What follows is a film-noir style mystery, fleshed out by a generous helping of Polanksi's trademark offbeat characters and general weirdness.The euro-Gothic style of the movie, which is reminiscent of such horror classics as Suspiria and Inferno, lends this movie a great style and one that you don't see too often in the more recent horror movies. Roman Polanski is well known for creating the more off-the-cuff type of movie, and this one firmly fits into that mould. Polanski gets to show his wicked sense of humour a few times in this movie too, which is always good to see. The more obvious humour is shown when the truck driver gives Depp a hand signal, but the more absurd humour is at it's best with the fire and wheelchair sequence, which is absolutely delicious and maybe even the best scene in the movie. As mentioned, the movie plays out much like a film-noir mystery. Like other films of this ilk, such as Angel Heart, The Ninth Gate draws you into it's mystery, and is a mystery film first and a horror movie second. This is definitely true of this film, as despite a few scenes of horror; such as the scenes with dead bodies, the film stays in mystery mode for a lot of it's duration and rarely goes over the top, which is much to it's credit.Johnny Depp takes the lead role in this movie. I am a big fan of Johnny Depp; he's a great actor, and he has more than enough about him to totally carry a movie on his own. This is without a doubt Depp's movie, but he is lent support courtesy of a great support cast which includes Emmanuelle Seigner (Polanski's wife and the actress that starred in Frantic and Bitter Moon, two other Polanski films), Frank Langella; who is delightfully creepy, although a little camp in his role as the mysterious collector that hires Depp and Lena Olin, a fine actress that starred alongside Depp in Chocolat.The characters in The Ninth Gate don't undergo that much of a change. This is true for all except Johnny Depp's character. Like any good film-noir, the focus is firmly on the lead and the film is mostly about him being lead deeper and deeper into the film's dark underbelly. The fact that the other characters don't develop much, hardly matters; the story and central character are more than interesting enough to keep the audience interested. The supporting characters that don't develop are already given a defined character anyway, and therefore don't need to develop in order to develop the story. The story is most definitely the most important aspect of this film; it meanders and is as unpredictable as you would expect a Polanski story to be. For the most part, the film stays much within the realms of reality, and it only really ventures out of the realm of logical possibility towards the end.The ending of the movie features a sex scene that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the movie, and it is never really explained exactly why it's there. By then, however, you will have already spent two hours enjoying your ride through Polanski's twisted mind, and this won't be enough to spoil it, but I do feel that this scene should have been cut from the film as it is unneeded. However, towards the end, the film does feature a deliciously over the top ceremony. Although this also goes against the flow of the movie, it does do it justice as it shows us, basically, what we have wanted to see all along. It is a shame about the very end, as it is rather anti-climatic; but when I think about it, it's the only way that the film could have ended without becoming really silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't come close to Polanski's earlier work but still enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was pretty enthusiastic when I heard Roman Polanski was preparing a new film about my all time favorite topic : the obscure and alternate religion. For a second there, I thought he was going back to his most primitive roots and masterpieces like Rosemary's Baby and Repulsion. Of course, the quality of The Ninth Gate doesn't come close to these titles but it stands as a decent effort in the genre and it certainly is one of the top horror stories of the nineties. I don't even think Polanski is to blame for the fact that The Ninth Gate doesn't reach the same level as his early work. The story and the production values were a lot more "mainstream" and a much larger audience was intended. Polanski did the best he could with it and his style is clearly present in the movie. A lot of credit should go the perfect cast as well. I don't think it was possible to put together a better cast for this type of movie. Johnny Depp is outstanding as the arrogant loner who tries to clarify the secrets behind 3 copies of the diabolical book "The Nine Gates". He plays his character like it was intended to be played...vicious, brutal and mysterious. Frank Langella is excellent for the role he plays here. He's the rich collector who sends out Depp to investigate the background of the books he lives his life by. I can't give enough praise to Lena Olin neither...she's one of the most sensual, mysterious and macabre actresses alive and no other woman could have played her role better. Her character is much like the one she did in 'Romeo Is Bleeding' ...an irresistible - yet very dangerous - stylish woman who you can't help but to worship. And of course Polanski couldn't resist to cast his very own wife ( at that time at least ) Emmanuele Seigner in a raw but very erotic role. Well, I don't have a problem with that...She sure can act and the look in her eyes keeps you close to the screen constantly. She's at least as attractive here as in that previous Polanski movie "Bitter Moon" ...expect for the fact that she was the only good element in that movie. There's a lot more to enjoy about the Ninth Gate. Especially the first half of the movie is a success. The terrific opening scene and credits ( through nine gates ) immediately set the right mood and atmosphere. The first 45 minutes of this movie are a macabre and fascinating excursion into the more dark side of religion. This part of the Ninth Gate really keeps you focused and very close to the screen. Too bad this level of quality isn't held up the entire movie. Too many twists and illogical sequences weaken the movie and the finale is - as usual in this kind of movies - way over the top. A real shame but not a complete disaster...By the time the movie starts to lose his grip and power, you already gave it a high rating in your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now don't get me wrong, I like Johnny Depp, but this is definitely not a movie his biographer's will consider anywhere near one of his best. I can say the same of director - Roman Polanski. For a start, the plot is just about strong enough for a 30 minute bed-time story, not a 130 min+ Hollywood production. Secondly, is fails to scare, anyone, anywhere nearly enough. Thirdly... oh, no need to go on. Suffice to say that I guess Johnny tried his best but Roman failed to deliver. If you like the idea of watching Johnny smoking his way through a weakly satanic-hinting story that never delivers, then fine - watch it. In fact I always advise everyone to watch every movie because that way you appreciate the better ones more. This movie really helped me appreciate many others.Oh, and if anyone can explain to me how you can pour gasoline over yourself from a 5 gallon container and ignite yourself from flames one meter away without any gasoline reaching the remote flames or even wetting the floor where your standing, please let me know. The director seems to believe its possible.Johnny - wherever you are - please be more discerning with your choice of scripts (and accomplished directors?). We love you ... but this? No.I expected and wanted more from this creative partnership.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts off well and begins to tell of a story about devil. This is where I begin to loose it as I am not a believer in such things. The action of the movie is poor to say the least and character development is non existent apart from johnny depp. The long length might have provided twists, but there are none, i worked out the ending after the first 15mins. And to mention that the ending is the worst of any movie i have ever seen. Its almost as if its been building up to nothing and he reached god or something, when in reality its been all about the devil. Another point to mention are the breasts of the heroine, which also helped to swing it to a 2 star rather than a 1! don't watch this movie, go and have a bath instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it's just that Roman Polanski has made so many good movies that we expect too much from him. Most of "The Ninth Gate" is pretty interesting, but the ending makes no sense. Johnny Depp, as a rare book collector who uncovers a satanic plot, should have been able to make much more of the character. Instead, the movie doesn't really explain anything.Granted, the movie wasn't a total waste. Those two guys in Portugal were neat. As it is, any movie about satanism should be neat. But this one just never really makes the most of its potential. Most of the people involved have done better than this, especially Depp and co-stars Frank Langella and Lena Olin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A supernatural thriller about the devil starring Johnny Depp and directed by Roman Polanski. Perfect combo, right? Wrong. Dead wrong. This was an awful film. Johnny Deep plays a book dealer who is hired by a very rich book collector played by Frank Langella. This takes about 10 minutes of boring dialogue to get to. Langella has hired Depp to find two other copies of a book he has called "The Ninth Gate" which was possibly written by the devil. There are three copies in the world and Langella wants to know if his is authentic. This is when murder and mayhem run wild. This is a drag on film that just when you think it's over it goes on. There is hardly any supernatural elements in this film at all. It's just a bad murder mystery. The special effects aren't too good and the acting is over done. The film just has long boring conversations. This is one thriller that could pass off as a bad teen horror movie. Not even Depp's performance can save this one. Don't waist your money. It's not even worth renting. I give it a 3 all on Depp's performance. The Ninth Gate, not worth watching on cable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dean Corso is a collector and hunter of rare books. When he is approached by private collector Boris Balkan to ascertain if his copy of a satanic book is genuine or if one of the other two copies in the world are the real item. When Corso begins to hunt down the other two books he finds that they each differ in slightly different ways ? each having a different scribe for the different pieces. Meanwhile those holding the books start turning up dead.From the start of the film and throughout, Polanski avoids the `shadows at the windows' approach to making a supernatural film. Instead the film goes for a more straightforward approach, sidestepping the clichés so often seen in this type of film. The downside of this approach is that it is quite slow at times and the pacing is too off. It still kept me interested but I would have happily seen it cut by about 20 minutes to make it tighter.The odd suggestion of the supernatural that the film allows before the end doesn't really work ? Seigner's wire-fu stuff doesn't look right, although, in fairness, it would have been hard to show it any other way and still be suggestive enough. The plot of the film flows well (if slowly) but the ending threw me a little bit. It will require more thought from me, but my first impressions were `what?' The ending seemed to come out of nowhere and lacking in meaning and suspense. I would have much preferred a bigger ending, although the low key, mysterious one works reasonably well in the context of the wider film.Depp is very good in the lead and suits the `ordinary' delivery of the story. He remains the same all the way through the film and is a good main character. Langella is excellent ? his voice suits his mostly `over the phone' character. Seigner is interesting but her character requires interpretation while Olin is good (mainly because I don't trust any characters she plays since Alias!).The film was enjoyable despite being too slowly paced to be a tight story. The film has atmosphere without resorting to the clichés that generally come with this type of thing. If I had complaints it would be over the length and the fact that the ending was too sudden and too unclear to be a satisfactory reward for sticking with the film.</fullReview>

Normally I like all the stuff that Johnny Depp does, and I think that he is a truly brilliant actor, but in this movie he just stinks.

		<fullReview>A small film with a rather big budget travelling from New York to Spain (more or less not famous places) and to France, Paris of course. A film about the Devil or Satan or Lucifer had to be produced in the satanic year 1-999, just before the diabolical new millennium.Apart from that the plot is so light we could think it was bought as a premium in a barrel of washing powder. The only interesting element is the suspenseful editing that makes the film have good rhythm. But the rhythm of the editing is not enough to make a good film. Clichés upon clichés. The best ones are the baroness in a wheel chair with a "secretary" that looks like a prison warden and goes out in the morning to buy oranges. The younger desk clerk in a four or five stars hotel in Paris who is authorizing a woman to go to the main character's room because she claims to be his wife. The concierge will apologize later on but it will be too late. I guess that younger desk clerk had not gone through the proper vocational training.The best cliché is the fact that the devil is a woman, white of course and blonde of course again. She is s devilish person obviously since she can move around without any means of transportation except thin air. But she is the excuse for Polanski to put some female flesh on the screen. He is a lot more modest about male flesh. Why did he get Johnny Depp then? A fatso like Depardieu would have been just alright, and a lot more impressive.Johnny Depp is underused indeed. He is static, inexpressive, cold like a slithering snake, badly dressed and hardly human. Well enjoy it if you can. I guess with a good shot of vodka maybe. . . Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ninth Gate starts with a striking scene of a suicide that made me expect a much better movie than I got.Depp stars as an unscrupulous book dealer who gets involved in a nourish quest to verify a book in which he deals with Chandleresque types like a mysterious blonde, a powerful, obsessed man and a not-so-grieving widow (beautifully played by Olin).Sounds pretty good, doesn't it? And certainly it's a nice looking, well-acted film, but it is also quite slow moving, with little moments of pseudo-suspense that have little impact and a predictable story.Still, I would call the movie a watchable time killer if not for the ending, which neither explains the mysterious blonde's role nor offers any sort of visceral satisfaction.I've always found Polanski pretty hit and miss, and in terms of the suspense/mystery/horror genre, I would consider this far weaker than The Tenant, Repulsion or the over-praised Rosemary's Baby. About the best I can say is, it's better than Fearless Vampire Killers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a very odd film. Roman Polanski's at the helm, Johnny Depp gives it his all, we start with a lot of hi falutin' tho' under the circumstances reasonably classy guff about Satan and Lucifer, the whole thing gets off to a cracking pace with mysterious twists, then it degenerates into a made-for-TV movie and not a very good one at that. The only mystery here is, given Polanski's undoubted talent and back catalogue, that The Ninth Gate isn't substantially better. But it isn't. It is very ordinary indeed. As usual, and you can't blame them for this, IMDb headline their viewers' comments with the most positive reviews, and there you will be informed that this is 'a masterpiece', 'Polanski's most underrated work', there is even a serious claim that this is some kind of intellectual examination by Polanski of what movie-making is all about. Well, I'll take that claim with a large pinch of salt, and if, by chance, it is true, Polanski is kidding no one but himself. This is a potboiler, nothing more and nothing less, and I'm not at all sure that Polanski didn't have his tongue firmly in his cheek. The recurring theme music is oddly and insouciantly jaunty, and not at all in keeping with the deadly, deadly serious business of raising the Devil. I suspect that Polanski is having a good laugh at those who engage in that kind of hobby and quite possibly at those moviegoers who are prepared to take this kind of hokum seriously. Most of it is nicely filmed, after all, Polanski knows what he is doing, but the last third of the film, in all sorts of ways seems oddly rushed. In the end, The Ninth Gate is a disappointment. We are served up an interesting first course which promises several delectable subsequent courses. But all we get is a burger and Coke. The only place you will catch this is on late-night telly, which is where it belongs. And if anyone is inclined to bend your ear with tales of 'Polanski's forgotten/underrated/misunderstood masterpiece', find something else to do rather than waste a minute giving credence to twaddle like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess I can start with the only redeeming quality of the movie : Johnny Deep's performance. I'm not a great fan of him but I think that here he gives one of his best effort. Oh but are those efforts wasted ! Emanuelle Seigner is so beautiful it's almost distracting. But I guess distraction is what we are craving for watching this sluggish borefest. Even simple actions scenes are weakly filmed with bad editing and laughable dialogs ( like when Seigner is impressed by Deep smashing of a guy's head : I didn't know you had it in you... ). Polanski co-wrote the script but there's not one ounce of originality in this contrived piece. Some scenes are also inexplicably long like when Deep crash his car in a river and takes forever just to find a gun. And I don't know if Polanski tries to demonstrate something by his overuse of blue screens but it gives the whole movie a tacky feel that doesn't help us enjoy it more. I guess with The Ninth Gate he tried to regain his former glory by delving in the genre that made him famous with his masterpiece Rosemary's Baby ( judging by the camera work it's clear that he attempts to create something powerful and engrossing )? Well he failed and you would do well to avoid it. Unless you are the slightly masochist completist that I am.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heavy spoiler action here.Great premise for a really good movie. Maybe someone should actually make it next time. This movie was not scary at all. Not even creepy. Every time the "hero" gets close to the truth, he gets beaned in the back of the head and almost killed as the building burns down while he regains consciousness. He's not smart enough to buy a helmet. And what the heck happened at the end? Couldn't they make something scary happen somewhere in this movie? Of course not. Take The Haunting, delete all the freaky special effects, the old lady talking about how there will be nobody from town to come and help in the middle of the night, and replace the sexy Catherine Zeta Jones with a toothless hobo. You would still have 10 times the horror movie the Ninth Gate was. At the end of the movie, the bad guy puts all the 9 pictures together to form the "spell" that will grant him ultimate power. The jerk had one of the wrong pictures and the spell kills him. Then the "hero" finds the right picture, does the spell, and presumably gets the power. But I didn't see how the spell was any different using the right pictures. I suppose what I would really like is for someone to pick up the ball here and try running for the other goal line this time. It's truly a sad thing. This one had a lot of potential, but only at the conceptual level. It's like hearing a 5-year-old mess up a joke and laughing at the joke your mind rearranges from the idea he gave you. To make this movie good, you would have to start over with a blank piece of paper, and maybe keep the bad guy and those weird devil drawings. An actual appearance by the devil (or at least see the clawed foot of an underling demon) would have at least added some fear of the consequences of this foolish undertaking they attempted to portray in the Ninth Gate.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp's character, a book dealer, spends the movie looking for some books and comparing them to each other. There's a couple of rather bland action scenes and a tiny bit of completely gratuitous sex, but none of these scenes are worth watching.The storyline, the types of characters, the subject matter all seemed like movie cliches. Even the soundtrack seemed to be lifted from Ghostbusters.The ultimate purpose of the books Depp is looking for and the reason for the existence of most of the characters is never actually explained. There's just nothing deep about this film, nothing to grab your mind and hold your interest.By the end of the film, my only interest was to warn others to skip 9th Gate at the video store.</fullReview>

The plot summarised is a book collector (Depp) stumbles upon some copy of an ancient manuscript fabled to be the entrance to the gates of hell. He soon realises the pieces don't fit so the rest of the film is spent trying to locate the original text. I know on the movie box it says something like 'Jonny Depp discovers the Gateway to Hell' but I don't think that ever actually happens.

What I got was almost two and a half hours of Dean Corso sitting around drinking coffee , asking for directions , drinking wine , asking for more directions , receiving a phone call and drinking more wine . There are supernatural elements to the story but these take up a minute fraction of the running time . Roman Polanski might not be a very good human being but he`s not a bad director . THE NINTH GATE is lit very moodily and is very well edited . However I have call into question the decision to cast his wife Emmanuelle Seigner in a very important role for the simple reason that she`s an absolutely awful actress . It`s not just in this film she`s hopeless , everything I`ve seen her in - Which strangely were also directed by Polanski - proves she`s hopeless . " Are you going to take me for a ride ? " she asks Corso which led me to shout at the telly " Polanski`s taking us all for a ride if he thinks you`re an actress "</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very minor Polanski indeed. This is mainly because the story is not very inventive and never goes beyond the limitations of the genre, ie the protagonist (Johnny. Depp) has trouble finding out was is going on (the Supernatural, strange coincidences), events which the viewer accepts and does not find strange at all. At times you feel like you have to help poor Johnny Depp, because he obviously is a bit on the slow side. His acting performance is very poor, simply because there is nothing to act. The script makes him behave like every other human being would behave in his place, without caracterizing him any further. The same goes for every other caracter in the film, they are just present to fulfill a function rather than give us the impression of a human being made of flesh and blood (in most of the cases anyway). This film is the exact opposite of "Rosemary's Baby", no ambiguity about the subject and the events, just pure what you see is what you get. In short a very eventless overlong (132 min.) genre film which is only made watchable by the superb work of cinematographer Daruis Khondji.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the advert for this, I thought it would be quite interesting, but I don't think it's a film I'll be seeing again, from director Roman Polanski (Chinatown, The Pianist). Basically Dean Corso (Johnny Depp) is a rare books expert and dealer, and he is seen by rich book collector Boris Balkan (Frank Langella) who hires him to validate his newly purchased copy of The Ninth Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows by 17th century author Aristide Torchia, one of only three that exist. The book supposedly summons the Devil, and Balkan claims it is a forgery, he has hired Corso to find the other two copies, and find out if it is genuine or not. So as you'd expect, the film sees him travelling a lot, finding the two books, and spotting the differences between them and Balkan's copy, this is probably the only interesting bit in the film. I could hardly concentrate towards the end, and I can see what the critics mean by a disappointing hallucinatory climax, for example, Corso and Liana Telfer (Lena Olin) having sex on the grass in front of a burning building, I must have missed him going through the Ninth Gate. Also starring Emmanuelle Seigner as The Girl, Barbara Jefford as Baroness Kessler, Jack Taylor as Victor Fargas, Tony Amoni as Liana's Bodyguard and James Russo as Bernie. I can't believe I waisted just over two hours of my life to watch this film, I mean it was okay in places, but definitely not as good as I'd hoped. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent But Disappointing When You Consider the Talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ninth Gate, The (1999) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Johnny Depp plays Dean Corso, a rare book dealer who is hired by a client (Frank Langella) to track down a mysterious book, which is said to contain the power to allow one to communicate with Satan. Along his journey the dealer keeps running into a mysterious woman (Emmanuelle Seigner) who might know more than any other person who has come into contact with the book. Polanski, Depp and Satan should have meant a sure fire masterpiece but sadly THE NINTH GATE ends up a major disappointment, which is a real shame considering the talent involved and the story itself. I think the idea of a book that allows one to connect with Satan has so many interesting aspects to explore and for the first hour Polanski keeps your attention but soon after that it becomes rather clear that we're just wasting our time and none of the build up is going to pay off. One of the major plot points has Langella owning one of three copies of the book and he wants Depp to determine if only one is the real thing and the other two are fakes or perhaps all three are correct or perhaps all three are fakes. It's not really clear what the end point is going to be because is communicating with Satan a bad thing or is it going to be a good thing? The first half of the film keeps us guessing as to what's going to happen but it dawns on you that information just keeps piling up and Polanski isn't doing anything with it. Instead of the mystery playing out it just offers more and more questions without even trying to answer any of them. I won't ruin the ending but to say it adds up to a big fat nothing is just the start of things. I'm really not sure what went so wrong with the screenplay but three people were credited and it looks like someone would have tried to do something different or at least make sure the movie kept moving in a good direction. There are some truly wonderful moments here but sadly they are few and far between all the decent if nothing special moments. The opening title sequence is quite an eye-opener and the first scene between Depp and Langella is quite chilling. The atmosphere is actually quite good throughout and the stuff dealing with rare book collecting was quite interesting and the dialogue surrounding it added some credibility to the film. Depp's performance was pretty good even if he is a tad bit too low-key in certain parts. I thought Langella was terrific in his role and Lena Olin has a lot of fun as one of the book's former owners. Seigner, who also appeared in Polanski's FRANTIC, easily steals the film as that mysterious woman. The actress does a rather remarkable job with the part because she just has a certain something that makes us worry about every little thing she does. The actress is quite good making us believe how tough she is but she's also sensitive enough to draw us in. The final thirty-minutes of the film starts to unravel and loses all credibility as the brains seem to be left out in favor of some silly special effects. There's a black mass sequence that is way too familiar of that in Stanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT and those wanting a better film with a familiar storyline should check out John Carpenter's CIGARETTE BURNS, which is about a rare film print instead of a book. THE NINTH GATE is mildly entertaining and it has some very good moments but sadly the film has to rank as a disappointment. Considering the build-up you can't help but wish Polanski had pulled everything together and delivered something more.</fullReview>
