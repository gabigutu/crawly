		<shortDescription>A Contemporary "Jude Suess"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Artistically, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is quite well made... I do recall several media reports at the time of the film's release that led to contrary impressions, supporting the deliberate attempt by the filmmakers to do a hatchet job on the setting of this film. The first was Billy Hayes himself, when he first arrived on native soil, having pulled off his alleged escape; he said on TV, "I like the Turks...it's the prison I had a problem with" Easy to understand; few prisons are a joy ride, regardless of nation of origin. From this, I gathered he personally didn't have an animosity against the Turks, although MIDNIGHT EXPRESS goes out of its way to make everything negative about the country and culture. Only the "Western" characters are good and attractive, and the folks selected to play the Turks are corrupt, physically ugly and basically sub-human. The exterior scenes in Turkey itself have a grayish tint, implying the land is a hell-hole, and even the near-universally acclaimed cuisine gets a black eye.The second thing from the (film's release) period I recall was a discussion on radio that claimed the prison Billy served time in was relatively modern, built in the mid-sixties... and not the Devil's Island PAPILLON setting depicted in the movie. (A 19th-Century British barracks in Malta was used for the prison.) Naturally, some artistic leeway is allowed here, since the movie's purpose is to paint a picture of a living nightmare.I recall reading the book years ago, and when our hero got his unfair sentence, naturally he was in despair... but at that moment, he felt an almost gallant, resigned acceptance. In contrast, when Billy gave his courtroom speech in the movie (which certainly was a defining moment of the film's ill-naturedness... to quote part of the speech: "For a nation of pigs, it sure seems funny that you don't eat them! Jesus Christ forgave the bastards, but I can't! I hate! I hate you! I hate your nation! And I hate your people! And I f**k your sons and daughters because they're pigs! You're all pigs!"), the three ugly judges actually hung their heads in shame. I wonder if there's a courtroom in any nation that would permit such a prolonged and loud outburst.The August 30th post mistakenly referred to Turkey as an Arab nation.... so the user must not have seen "Lawrence of Arabia," where the Arabs were the heroes and the Turks were the villains. It's interesting that in the rare Hollywood film where Arabs are portrayed "positively," Turks still come across as barbaric.A Turkish-American friend has told me, contrary to what others here are thinking that the film couldn't really prejudice the viewer, that the film has achieved one of its purposes, to leave a sore, anti-Turkish taste in mouths. Keeping in mind that Americans are generally ignorant of the ways of many foreign nations, this film continues, even today, of being the only source of information most Americans have about Turkey. As cinematically effective and wonderfully made this film is, there's a disturbing side to MIDNIGHT EXPRESS that makes it mildly resemble a contemporary "Jude Suess," or THE ETERNAL JEW ("Der Ewige Jude").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie but keep in mind a near total fantasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie a lot. I believe it is well done and is a movie that can be watched several times. However, as a person who has spent time in Turkey and read the book upon which the film is based, I know that it is a fictional story. It begins with a caption "a true story" but the only thing true about this movie is that someone named Billy Hayes was caught trying to smuggle a lot of hashish out of the country and was sent to jail. The events that supposedly happened to him in prison are fictional. I'm not saying that being in a Turkish prison is a good thing but the brutality presented is just plain fiction. Before you feel sorry for this guy remember that he was trying to smuggle drugs for re-sale in the US. Before you condemn Turkey remember that at the time Turkey was being pressured by the world community, particularly by the US, to do something about the drug flow coming out of the country. This is one movie that infuriates the Turkish government whenever it is shown and I believe rightly so because it caters to the notion that Turkey is some type or barbaric nation with a population that is incapable of human emotion or decency. Having lived in Turkey I know this to be totally false. In addition, with the exception of the skyline of Istanbul in the opening scene, none of the movie was filmed in Turkey. All of the Turks portrayed in the film, with the exception of the prosecutor, are Italian actors. The language spoken in the movie is not even Turkish for the most part. There are some phrases which are indeed Turkish but the majority of what is spoken is some other language. As I said however, I like this movie, in the same way that I like Star Trek; a great story but fiction none the less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the propaganda: Film shows errors of both sides</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe that so many reviews of Midnight Express have degenerated into exchanges of opposing political views that skirt over the film itself. While this may be based on a true story, like any good filmmaker, the director Alan Parker has shown the shades of gray here. The film's message, as far as any fair-minded viewer should discern it, is that the individual and the state (whether one's own or a foreign country) exist in a fragile state of consent with each other which requires fair and proportional responses on both sides. Neither side is totally in the right or the wrong here in Parker's film.Billy Hayes is not a guiltless, red-blooded hero here and Parker doesn't portray him as such. Hayes committed what would have been a crime in any country-- smuggling heroin-- and he was caught and rightfully prosecuted. He has broken laws and must pay the price.Just to be on the safe side---------------MINOR SPOILERS HERE-----------------------Hayes is initially handed a sentence by the Turkish court-- approximately 4 years-- that would probably be considered fair in any civilised society for his activities. The prison is tough (it's not supposed to be a cakewalk), but Hayes accepts his punishment and overall stays out of trouble while in the prison. Then, with little more than two months left in his term, and the prospect of release dangling before him, a higher Turkish court-- for obscure and apparently contrived reasons (making someone an example)-- suddenly comes back basically saying he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison for his one earlier slip. At this point the moral compass, as it may be, shifts to Billy. He's done his time, he's behaved, he's accepted his punishment and it's hardships, and suddenly the rug is pulled out from under him. To all the hot-bloods here who say Hayes was a rich American who deserved what he got-- have you ever heard of the concept of proportionality in law? Hayes did not commit a violent crime against anybody (both in terms of his initial act and up to the time the appellate court extended his sentence), he did not even commit a property crime like stealing or burglary. This is what Parker is saying-- Hayes was in the wrong for smuggling and was justly punished for those four years, but the arbitrary extension of his sentence close to his release, and the sheer length of the term (pretty much a lifer), are grossly disproportionate and unbecoming of a civilised society. In many if not most countries, even many killers are usually sentenced to far less than the 30 years that were suddenly tacked onto Hayes's term, and they don't experience the sort of sadistic torture meted out by the wardens in the jail in this film. It had the stink of scapegoating, and the rest of the film shows Hayes's desperate attempts to survive and escape a system that has become corrupt.For what it's worth, I'm not an American and I don't in any way harbor illusions of superiority on the part of the West or East. One might make similar criticisms of things like the "3 Strikes Law" in the USA which are also pretty arbitrary. Parker isn't commenting on which civilization(s) is/are superior-- he's saying that there are some universal civil liberties that any civilised society should strive to, and societies both west and east fail when they deny them to the most vulnerable people, namely those sent to prison and stripped of even the freedom to mix with the general population. And note, furthermore, that the Turks in the prison (the vast majority) suffer as much as the foreigners. (BTW, to the commentators who've stupidly claimed that this film is merely "American propaganda"-- Alan Parker is British. If you're going to hurl an accusation like that, at least get such a basic fact straight.)BTW I've been to Turkey and I've found the Turks to be among the world's most generous and kind people, esp to strangers. And sometimes I do wish that Parker had included more Turkish characters with more agreeable qualities, which (even in a prison) one would be likely to find (and I also found the "comparison to pigs" comment in the courtroom to be inappropriate). But Parker wanted to make this a gritty film with an air of desperation throughout, and for this reason alone one should be careful about extending what's seen in this film to the Turks as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haven't seen this many ugly people in one movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. This was disturbing. I live in Nottingham, I have many Turkish friends who study here. If I didn't know them, I'd probably think that there wasn't a single Turk who is nice and pleasant... Some parts were actually funny. The judge (in Billy's hate monologue scene) was sounding exactly like Jabba the Hutt! I've heard people speak Turkish around me, so I knew the language which was supposed to be Turkish in the movie, wasn't. Come on people... Feels like this movie was made to make Turks look bad in every way possible. I've read an interview and I learnt that the real Billy Hayes was truly disappointed with the portrayal of Turkish people in the film. Anyway, this movie was fun to watch but would be ignorant to believe. Have a good one</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a tense movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to note the comments on this movie. I saw it on TV last night, not for the first time, and I noticed how the Turks in the film are all one-dimensional bad people, and physically ugly to boot. I also read that many of the scenes are completely fictional. I am not one of those people who think that a "true" story must be completely true; I think that the purpose of movies is to entertain, and this one certainly does that, if in a harrowing way. But, given the politics of our time, if the author of the screenplay wanted to create a demon people for dramatic effect, perhaps it would have been better to have set the story in a fictional or unidentified country. The other observation I would make is, we are not much better than they are. We regularly sentence people to ungodly amounts of prison time for drug offenses, both on a state and federal level. Our prisons are no picnic, either, with many of the same sorts of things that were portrayed in the movie happening right here at home. So, go check "the man in the mirror" before you condemn anyone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interview with the real Billy on YouTube!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie claims to be based on a true story but just like many other Hollywood productions, it warps the truth to an unrecognizable mess. If you want to hear the real story behind the movie, you should see the interview with the real "Billy Hayes" on YouTube at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TweU77cDrgEhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqPMI6BnINI&amp;mode=related&amp;searchThe real "Billy Hayes" even says that he'd like to go back to Turkey to visit Istanbul. Now that's a slap on the face of the producers of the movie who have demonized all Turks for their personal gain of a statue. They would have received more Oscars if they portrayed the events in realistic terms as "Billy" explains in the interview.In my opinion, the story of how the real "Billy" made it to the border after he ran away from the prison, would make a wonderful action/adventure movie. Of course, that's where the movie ends, having achieved its purpose of slandering a complete nation. Down with Hollywood!! Long live YouTube for giving a voice to the suppressed truth!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you're busted for drugs over there!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film is entertaining to watch and has its level of suspense at various points it is not a truly `true story' much of it according to the real Billy Hayes never happened and his eventual escape is very different from what is depicted in this motion picture. It also tends to demonize the nation of Turkey and presents a distorted view of its people. Is it possible to have sympathy for the main character? He was fully aware of what he was doing and knew the consequences should he be caught so sympathy is on an individual basis. You may have sympathy or may not. A number of years ago a public service commercial narrated by actor Hal Holbrook frequently ran on Television, which told of Americans being held in foreign prisons. He spoke of one American held in a Turkish prison. Was it Billy Hayes? The commercial ends with the line `When you're busted for drugs over there you're in for the hassle of your life' That's the message this film was intended to send out irregardless if the events in it were true or fictionalized for dramatic purposes. As always purchase or rent a copy to see the uncut unedited version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thrill-Ride Of Fictional Proportions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be fair, the movie does what it's supposed to and that's giving the audience a horrific thrill ride. You'll spend your time watching the movie in sheer horror and at the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. As with all Oliver Stone movies such as Salvador, Born On The Fourth Of July and Platoon, Midnight Express is brutal and merciless. Oliver Stone it seems, has made a habit of making money and getting Oscars from controversial and/or little known events in history and dramatizing on it to a point of making the story haunting. The only downside is, for the sake of awards and "art", a culture was demonized beyond redemption and any limits over a fictional story (Oliver Stone himself wrote the story for the movie). *The following is not a spoiler from the movie but points out an event from the plot* In reality, William Hayes it turns out, was arrested at the Turkish airport for trying to smuggle packs of drugs attached on his body into the U.S., and he was held for a time before being given to the American authorities for deportation. William Hayes and Oliver Stone themselves it turns out, have already apologized to the Turkish people for the overly dramatized and fictional parts of the movie and the book. It's funny actually how a movie can create so much on a true moment in life to a point of fiction and still call it a true story. The Turks don't get any breaks in the movie. All their people, cops, judges, lawyers and inmates are shown in such extreme way as ugly, merciless, demonic and sadistic people that one who knows nothing about Turkey would think that its population consists of demons and ugly merciless sadists. Actually this can be compared to movies which have been made about the Russians in the past which always seem to show the Russian women as ugly people with facial hair and nothing attractive while in reality, Beautiful Russian women dominated the modeling business in the world. While apologies have been made, the damage has already been done on the image of the Turkish people. People who are anti-Turkish love praising this movie and insisting that it's a true story all the way while the Turks keep getting rightfully offended. Be aware however, that %80 or some more of this movie is purely fictional. Even just logic would tell you that at a time where the U.S. and Turkey had such strong relations during the cold war, something like what is shown in the movie would have been unthinkable by the Turkish authorities. For a person who just wants to watch a good thriller movie and doesn't care nor wants to get involved in any dramatic flame wars or political discussions on this board or any other, it's worth watching at least once. If you don't like the movie, at least you'll see what all this fuss has been about over the years since the movie was shown in the theaters.Keep the pop-corns popping' and the good movies rolling' :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Poor and Racist Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Turkish citizen I came to the US this year to study. After several persons asked me about this movie, I decided to watch it. I am not a nationalist at all. I have never been proud (or ashamed) of being a Turkish as i wouldn't be proud (or ashamed) of being a member of another nationality.It would be absurd to deny that there was and is torture in many prisons in Turkey, especially to political prisoners. Justice system is not perfect either.Yet, i have been very disturbed by this movie. It is full of racism and hatred. At one point, the actor speaks of Turks as a nation of pigs. All the Turkish people in the movie are portrayed as ugly evils.Some reviewers say that if you forget about the propaganda, it is a good movie. Other than the acting by the main character, i didn't see what makes this movie a good one. The screenplay is very simplistic and unrealistic. Simple good against simple bad. Nothing about the complexities of human nature or social life. It is unbelievable that this movie has won so many awards. And it is a shame that such big names as Oliver Stone and Alan Parker have their signatures on this crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Powerful Film, Despite Several Distortions of The Real Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Express tells the story of a young American, Billy Hayes, who was arrested in 1970 for possession of Hashish in Istanbul Turkey. The film chronicles Billy's journey into the nightmarish hell of the Turkish prison. Slowly, the viewer begins to see how Billy's personality begins to change from a fun-loving individual, to a decaying vegetable as the justice system betrays him. Originally sentenced to 4 years and two months, the head prosecutor successfully appeals the verdict to the Turkish Supreme Court, forcing the trial court judge to resentence Billy to a minimum of 30 years.The torture scenes involving Billy getting sadistically beaten by the prison guard Hamadu are very painful to watch, especially a scene early on in the film where Billy is strung up by his ankles and beaten on a rack for taking a blanket without permission. Billy and his inmates escape plans provide great dramatic tension in a terrific narrative style. Ultimately, Billy engages in a brutal fight with an inmate named Rifki, whom everyone hates, especially Billy, because Rifki rats on all of the prisoners. Rifki likes to make life even more miserable for the inmates. As punishment, Billy is sent to the prison's Section 13 for the criminally insane.Billy is given bribe money by his girlfriend Susan who comes to see him in a heartbreaking scene. Almost all of Billy's inner-strength is taken away by the harsh realities of the prison. However, he is able to say "I love you" through many tears.The head guard Hamidou refuses to be bought, and takes Billy to the Sanitarium where he beats him, and tries to have sex with him. Billy charges the guard, rams the guard's head into a spike on the wall, killing him. Stealing his uniform, Billy escapes the prison and shortly afterward we learn that he arrived home with his family 3 weeks later.I have actually read Billy Hayes' book, Midnight Express. In reality, Billy did not have any major quarrels with the Turkish people. The film shows the opposite. There was really only one guard that treated him badly, but nowhere near what Hamidou did in the movie. In reality, Billy never was transferred to the insane part of the prison for fighting. He had one minor altercation with an inmate. The book talks more about the unsanitary conditions of the prison. (There are many instances in the book that will make you want to surrender your lunch, unfortunately.)The biggest distortion is that in real-life, Billy Hayes never killed any guard as a part of his escape plan. He simply got out one night and swam across the boarder into Greece and that was it.There are differences in how the film was made as well. The Turkish Government was outraged at how this movie distorted the real Billy Hayes case and refused to allow the movie to be filmed there. Most of the film was shot off the island of Malta. A good deal of the language spoken in the movie is NOT Turkish, but Maltese, which to the untrained ear, is often mistaken for Turkish dialect.Nevertheless, I rate the film highly because it is still a very good movie with great acting, music, and dramatic tension. Amazingly, the actor who played Billy Hayes, Brad Davis, died of AIDS. He did an excellent job as the real Billy Hayes. In my view, many scenes had to be changed for dramatic effect. You will remember this film forever. It will undoubtedly make you think twice about doing something stupid in a foreign country! Despite its flaws, when compared to Billy Hayes' real-life story, Midnight Express is still a very emotional film that withstands the test of time. It would be a 10/10 if it were closer to the truth. However, the film is still excellent and is strongly recommended viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty, Gross and Downright Fabulous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Express can be compared to the likes of Mississippi Burning, Schindler's List and Midnight Cowboy - people who see it love it or hate it - no in between and it inspires a great deal of conversation. I have never met anyone who has seen this film and does not carry a strong opinion of it one way or another.I love it. I do not consider it a depiction of Turkish life or an accurate retelling of the whole truth. In fact, the truth of the William Hays story is deeply lost in this picture. I consider Midnight Express to be a primarily fictional prison drama, bases largely on real events. The bottom line is that it is a great film.Politically, I am quite conservative and have a "don't do the crime if you can't do the time" attitude. I had very little sympathy for William Hays in this movie, a young American caught smuggling hash out of Turkey and imprisoned in an absolute hell-hole. Instead, I am fascinated by his adaptation to prison life, the politics among prisoners and officials, the relationship with Brad's family and lawyers and all the other aspects of the films.The film is very gross, quite violent and filmed in a dark, depressing. atmospheric manner. It is not for the faint of heart or anyone looking for a pleasant experience.If you are a Randy Quaid fan then Midnight Express is a must see. So much of Randy Quaid's fame arises from the ludicrous Vacation movies and Independence Day, his true talent is unappreciated. See this (an The Last Detail) if you are a Randy fan.There is a completely unnecessary and inane scene in which the lead character delivers a speech in a Turkish court - cut this scene short and you have a perfect movie.Midnight Express is controversial and though-provoking. I cannot guarantee that you will like it, but I can guarantee that it will make you think.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely biased, dishonest and one-sided movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the movie has inaccurate portrayal of the events and it is dishonest, more violent as a national hate-film. Many hearts were broken in Turkey" due to this film. Although the film is set largely in Turkey, most of the location work was done in Malta, using local actors along with some Greeks and Armenians playing Turks. At some occasions in movie, people supposedly speaking Turkish are, in fact, speaking Maltese. Moreover most of the supposedly Turkish dialogs are so inarticulate that they cannot be understood even by natives. Throughout the whole film, Turks figure as brutes, militarists, bloodthirsty, stupid and evil torturers and sadistic, in brief as true "bastards". Their image is a real caricature: ugly, with a mustache, badly shaved, suntanned, with eyes and hair very dark. They are stereotypical persons, who, even when they are killed in the film, they always have the lot they deserve! In an interview in 1984 producer David Puttnam admitted that the film is based on a "dishonest book".Billy Hayes reveals himself 20 years after his release, that what is presented in the movie is a very exaggerated and fictional version of what happened to him in the prison in Istanbul, Turkey.Finally, after 25 years, Oliver Stone has apologized to Turkey for this film in 2004 when he visited Turkey. He admitted that he did not do any research about the so called "true story" of Billy Hayes before he wrote the script. This hate-film has been definitely affected the relations between Turkish and American people as well as Turkish tourism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm Billy Hayes, well at least I used to be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Express is directed by Alan Parker and adapted to screenplay by Oliver Stone. It is loosely based on Billy Hayes' book of the same name. It tells of American Hayes' (Brad Davis) arrest and subsequent conviction for trying to smuggle hashish out of Istanbul, Turkey, for which he was sent to a hellish Turkish prison to serve his time. It also stars Randy Quaid, John Hurt, Paul L. Smith and Irene Miracle. Music is scored by Giorgio Moroder and cinematography is by Michael Seresin.Although controversy followed it due to its portrayals of the Turkish people, Midnight Express is today still a raw and uncompromising experience. In fact if we strip away Moroder's Oscar winning electro bubbling score, the film holds up as a fresh and pertinent piece of film making. Parker doesn't cut corners or attempt any sort of Hollywood gloss, he keeps it grimy, oppressive and harsh in its telling, whilst the hand-held camera work keeps things jittery, harmonising with Billy Hayes and his fellow cons' state of mind. The narrative unfurls from Billy's POV, and it's mostly in a downwards direction, with that it's hard to call the picture essential entertainment, we are after all observant to mental and physical abuse, with the disintegration of the human spirit front and centre. Billy's alienation is deftly crafted by Parker, where the non use of subtitles for the Turkish characters helps us to feel as isolated as Billy was. However, there's the odd glimmer of hope and humanity, courtesy of Billy's interactions within the few friendships he forms, and of course there's the overriding urge to see him escape his hell.Stone won the Academy Award for his screenplay, and even though it has been frowned upon for some of the perceived bile unleashed on the Turks, it mostly excels on a human's under duress basis. The interactions between prisoners is often solemn and edgy, due to the characters being from different walks of life, while much of Hayes' outpourings of emotion have conviction by way of the words; even if one particular "speech" is ill advised and over the top. Cast are excellent, where Davis calls on the sadness in his real life upbringing to give a performance of real intensity, while Hurt and Quaid are beaten down by drug fuelled resignation and tempestuousness respectively. It has flaws, and the over dramatising of certain events tends to deviate from a real story that hardly needed extra oomph, but always Midnight Express remains a harrowing and potent piece of cinema. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's not dismiss Hamidou too quickly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read all the posted comments and am dismayed to see how little attention is paid to the importance of the Turkish characters in the movie. I trust it will not be a "spoiler" to note that the individuals who inhabit the Turkish criminal justice system in this movie are as important as the backdrops, musical score and camera angles, for they provide a critical context for the prisoners' character. I certainly would not characterize any of them as "pigs" -- not even Hamidou, artfully played by Paul Smith, whom I will come to in a minute.(Spoiler) The judge who sentences Hayes and then has to resentence him has the furrowed brow and slumped shoulders of a man who should be king of his courtroom but who is in fact a pawn in a corrupt system. Corruption is not unique to one country's justice system -- it is a perennial factor in any "human" system. Hayes' attorney is practically indistinguishable from shyster lawyers the world over. He is wonderfully recognizable. The bored and burned out public servants who man the airport security posts and police stations have their counterparts everywhere -- they are not paid enough to do more than the minimum to get by, and they are trained to be suspicious and to do as they are told.So it was with particular interest that I watched Paul Smith play Hamidou, without whom (spoiler) there would be no terror in the prison. His omnipresence is predatory -- he casts a looming shadow over the prison population, and there is no escaping his retribution. Smith plays this with such ominous understatement that it is hard to realize what a large physical "presence" he is among the other characters -- he clearly outsizes them, but the only item you are concentrating on is his expression, since that will tell you what is coming next. Beyond that, the sheer physical demands of the role make his performance impressive -- he must wield his body with believable force without killing his co-stars, and he does so with the grace of the athlete he apparently once was.It would have been very easy for Smith to make Hamidou such an evil caricature that his impact on the film's progress would have been negated. But Hamidou is a shark, so suited to his mission that he takes no time to muse on his next course of action. He is arbitrary, swift, and dispassionate in his dispensation of justice, and (spoiler) he brings the William Hayes character right on down to his level. When he takes Hayes' hand and leads him toward the sanitorium, you want to believe he has a heart. It makes what comes next (complete with clashing score) that much more disturbing. Smith's performance is dead on.I loved the director's visual sense -- the opening views of Istanbul are lovely, as is the texture of the prison, which HAS to be an old Maltese barracks if we are to disappear into this scary universe.

		<shortDescription>The film was shot in Rhodes, Greece (not Malta)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the film was not shot in Malta.It was shot in the island of Rhodes, Greece.With Greek actors and sponsored by the Greek government, 4 years after the war in Cyprus (1974) What a "gallant" way of taking revenge.A quote from the film: "Turkish pigs! You don't eat pigs, but you are pigs! I hate you, I hate your entire nation!!!" Obviously added by the Greek government which sponsored the film.It's also not a surprise that at the end of the film, he manages to escape to Greece (Heaven) from Turkey (Hell).The level of "art" in the film isn't as high as to deserve 2 Oscars.But perhaps the taste of "bashing the Turks" is irresistible.Sort of exotic.Lawrence of Arabesque.In the name of democracy and human rights.And as a revenge of history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whilst reading the reviews of 1999's "Brokedown Palace", I noticed many people stating how that picture was a copy of the "classic Midnight Express"-- albeit I've never heard about it before. My local videostore just bought it on blu-ray and I rented it to check what's going on. "Midnight Express" tells a story about an American drug smuggler that gets caught while arriving on Turkey, and after that, things only go worse. There are some strong scenes that prove how professional are the director and Brad Davis, such as Billy's hearing on court. Also, the scene in which he turns everything upside down and beats Rifki up proves, clearly, how far people can go in a despairing situation. The cast, made mainly of local actors, helps bringing reality into the flick, since everyone seemed to be truly Turkish. The homosexual scene, however, didn't feel very elaborated to me; they are just normal friends, and all of a sudden, they end up kissing in the shower. Maybe that lack of explanation was due to the fact that sexual diversity was a HUGE taboo in the seventies, so I won't be that critical about it. For some moments, I considered it to have the plausible plot that "The Shawshank Redemption" wasn't able to, and it feels unfair that such movie is on top of IMDb's list, when this one is barely known world widely. Besides, I can agree that the story feels pretty original for the time it's been released, but nowadays it seems to exist lot of films like this out there. The ending is relatively happy, and it makes you remember that there always has to be HOPE in your heart! No matter how bad a situation can be, people and life itself will help you get out of it, so if this movie has a message, that should be it. It's not a hidden gem, but an interesting work from the seventies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If only Billy Hayes didn't write the book. If only Oliver Stone wrote his own screenplay instead of adapting Hayes' book. If only the film was more complimentary towards Turkey.If only.Midnight Express is a flawed masterpiece. It has excellent, engaging performances; sensitive, tense direction - and an amazing score.That said, the film has problems.One is minor. At the end, the film begins to kinda drag and the scenes in the loony bin make absolutely no sense. But that's kinda the point of a loony bin.The other is quite major. The film's absolute refusal to heed to Hayes' book and its quite negative treatment of Turkish people has understandably drawn a huge amount of ire. As good as this film is, it's utter, utter bullshit. That scene where he condemns Turkey was a well-written and well-acted scene, but it does not belong in this film. It would have been better served in a fictional film, a film where there'd be little repercussions to insulting an entire nation of people.That said, I enjoyed this film very much. It was a gripping, thrilling, pulse-pounding thrill ride that I'd pay to see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating and violent prison movie partially based on true events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent movie deals with the American Bill Hayes (performedd by the late Brad Davis ) who was detained smuggling two kilograms of hashish while trying to board the flight along with his girlfriend (Irene Miracle) from Istanbul, Turkey, in 1970 . He was condemned to four years in a hellish Turkish prison on a drug possession charge, but his sentence was later extended Turkish courts decide to make an example of him , sentencing him to more than 30 years in jail . Hayes has two opportunities for getting freedom : the appeals made by his advocate at law , his father (Mike Kellin), and the American government, or the "Midnight Express¨ . Meanwhile, Hayes suffers incredible cruelty and sadism before his escape in 1975. It deals upon horrible conditions of prisoners and grueling efforts of the meager captives to survive ,confrontating mistreats, rampage and continuous violence with punches , lashes, knocks and incredible tortures . The most part of the movie takes place into four walls of a jail , criminal court ,yard and sewers involving and executing the preparatives of the escape . The picture tells the authentic experiences of convicts who live in a brutal Turkish prison that is a hell on the earth , reflecting the hardship existence of the inmates . We have seen men tortured , harassed and humiliated in a gaol where rules the strongest law . The film narrates physical mistreats , tortures and the preparation and execution of the getaway , but also friendship and comradeship . Later on , Hayes erupts in an explosion of self-defensive violence in some breathtaking scenes.This powerful prison movie well produced by prestigious producer David Puttnam contains thought-provoking drama , thrills , chills and lots of violence . Sensational performances from the magnificent starring Brad Davis who suffers an emotional brutalization and perfect support cast as the junkie John Hurt , the nasty sneaker Paolo Bonacelli who causes in Hayes an explosion of violence and Paul Smith as sadist warden who uses unthinkable tortures and brutality. This is a superbly crafted film though is also intensely manipulative and xenophobic . Interesting screenplay deserving an Oscar by Oliver Stone though full of offensive stereotypes against Turks and not faithful to Bill Hayes's true deeds . Evocative and dark cinematography by Michael Seresin . Unforgettable score by Giorgio Moroder with excessive use of synthesizer and electronic music. Skill and riveting direction by Alan Parker with some sensationalist touch ; this is his first big success , subsequently he made other hits such as ¨Fame¨, ¨The Wall¨,¨Angel heart¨, ¨Missisipi Burning¨ , among them. Rating : Very good , above average . Worthwhile watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Biased Movie and its naive fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Hayes decides to visit Turkiye once again, but he is afraid of the Turk's reaction. He regrets the insults made to Turks, and feels a great sorrow for the distortion of his book to this extent. If he is right, we have to think about its directors' and actors' bad will, for, only ill-willed people could commit such a crime by making this movie. I want to explain the reasons of making this movie. You may think that the followings are boring, but if you really want to learn the truth, keep reading it. Do you, guys, believe in everything that somebody else shows you? Let me put it in another way, do you believe that the whole story narrated and the portrait of a nation depicted in a movie is completely true?And having been influenced by the striking scenes imposed upon you by the movie, do you call a nation "Nation of Pigs."? Do you scream like "You, nation of pigs, Christ forgave the bastards but I will not forgive you"?Brad Davis was very good in his role as if he was really instead of Billy Hayes. But accepting to play in such a movie this great actor has insulted himself. Someone, whose mind is illuminated by the scientific way of thinking which is the result of hundreds of years of endeavors of those who gave their lives so that we can learn thinking freely, without having our minds contaminated and our reasoning abilities prejudiced by someone other's thoughts, hatred, and condemnations, will conclude that this movie does not reflect the truth but having been qualified by the above peculiarities, he/she will not stop and search the reasons lying behind the distortion of a book written by the prisoner himself, to make such a movie. Adding the most important human characteristics that should exist in every human being, justice and fairness, the one that I tried to depict above will see that this film was made for the sole purpose of screaming to the world the abhorrence and the hatred that have been accumulated for 150 years in the hearts of the Armenians and the strong dislike against the Turks for they compelled the Armenians in 1915 (During World War I.) to immigrate from the east of Anatolia to the north of Syria since they were supporting the Russians and destroying the eastern Anatolian villages and killing their inhabitants.But you will be shocked when you find out that the Armenians were called, among the whole nations that constituted the Ottoman Empire, "The Faithful Nation/ Millet-i Saadika", since our ancestors have lived in peace with them and respected the human rights of each other and so many Armenian people have served the Ottoman Empire during her sovereignty, without changing their religion. Some Armenians will recognize the name of Tatyos Efendi who composed the best musical masterpiece in Kurdilihicazkar mode which is a mode in Traditional Turkish music. But as you know, the French revolution gave birth to nationalism and many other principles, and UK and Russia bore the role of guarantors of the rights of Christian peoples of the Middle East and encouraged many nations under the rule of the Ottomans and the Austrians to rebel and establish their countries, of course with some pieces of land being taken from the countries once they belonged. So, you will search and find the reasons and purposes of depicting a nation in such a way and condemning it to the state of sub human beings. You will also find out that we have cured the insane people with music when the Europeans were burning them. (In Adrenople/ Edirne to the north west of Istanbul there is a hospital that was once used for this purpose.) At last to be honest with you the film was good in its transporting its message to the world, that we are ugly people, that we rape foreigners, that we are Sodomists, that we live like pigs, that God has forgotten us when he spread the beauty and the good human characters, and left us as an exemplary of his omnipotence in creating subhuman creatures. OK. I got the message. One more film of this kind will suffice to create the new Nazi-like wave here in Turkey. I hope not. But I cannot stand seeing my nation humiliated in this manner by those who commit millions of times more brutal and catastrophic crimes. Our doors are always open to anyone of you. We forget the crimes some people have committed against us but we never forget the favors. And our wrath is just sudden and short lived. before watching the film, do some research about us, if possible come and see our beautiful country, see our contribution to the development of the civilization and then see what I am trying to tell you. Excuse me for this history lesson, but someone had to say it.One out of ten points goes to this wonderful!!!!!! movie. (1/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all im turkish and i have seen this movie for several times. I LIKE it and i simply know what other people think about this movie. If they are turkish, they simply hate the movie and tell that its giving the turkish nation a bad name. If they are not turkish then they start to think about bad things about turks. And thats normal. BUT!!!! The main problem of the movies is not that its not showing true things. The main problem of the movie is that it tells the things that happaned to the main characters happened cause he is AMERICAN. I think thats the wrong thing about this movie. If bad things happen to americans in turkish jails then bad things happen to turkish people in jails too. I dont think that they would harras someone MORE just cause he is AMERICAN. Im turkish and i know that turkish people dont hate americans, like most of the other muslim countries. Also, this movie is 20 years old. I think many things changed in Turkey in this past 20 years. Come to Turkey, then you can Judge as much as you can. truth or fiction. I! LIKE! THIS! MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows us there is an archaic country in the east which is making suffer for strangers. There is ugly and bad people lives which we can say them simply; Muslim Orientals. There is some prison like hell and every one inside them are gay. That people shows respect their great leader by put his picture on every toilets wall. This is what movie told us. And I will tell the truth.In 1970's Turkish people demanded some democratic rights by actions. Like every growing country, 68's were energetic and full of ideas for their country. They wanted a liberated country of law. They weren't use drugs for peace, peace must have to be earn! In the same time, there were CIA agents too. They trained some bad people (we know them as counter guerillas) for torture to that young and hopefully people. Many prisons fulled with thinking prison. This movie is very weak to show suffer that people had. In addition there weren't any American citizen, only Turkish mind prisons and American torturers. I know Alan Parker and Oliver Stone are both left minded cinema makers. But obviously they didn't care their friends in this movie except Greek and Armenian lobby in USA. I don't tell this movie is lying, but doesn't tell anything about truth either. The real truth is Oliver Stone came to Istanbul after made his movie 'Troy' and danced in all night clubs, ate dinners in some elegant restaurants and had a boat trip with beautiful womens. He newer try to learn something about ordinary people in Turkey. This is just a movie, yes. But after all, art must be kind for different cultures. Even cultures in the east. I will finish with a great phylosopher Mevlana Celaleddin-i Rumi (14th Century Anatolia); 'Come in. Come in, without limitation of what are you or who are you. Muslim, Christian, Jude, Pagan, come in. Our home is not home of desperation, come in.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Work Of FictionI read the book MIDNIGHT EXPRESS many years ago , but didn`t actually see the film untill it was broadcast on network TV in the mid 90`s . Of course any film adaption of any book will be the inferior article but the problem with this film is .....It`s entirely made up !!!!!The film follows the book untill Billy is arrested then for some unexplained reason the script decides go its own way!!!MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!First of all Max is a composite charachter. He`s several people rolled into one and none them were beaten half to death and left to languish in the psyciatric hospital.Nor did any of them have a cat that was lynchedBilly biting the Turk`s tongue out. Hard hitting scene. Didn`t happen.Hamidou. A sadistic and sexually deviant prison guard. Entirely based in the realms of Oliver Stone`s imagination. His attempted rape of Billy and being Killed by him is fictional.As irritating as these inventions are , the worst aspect of the film is Billy`s whining self pity. The Billy Hayes of the book is brutal in his honesty , never ever forgetting that he broke the 11th commandment: Though shalt not get caught; an attitude he still carries to this day. The Billy of the film seems to have given into victim culture and therefore doesn`t deserve our sympathy. If you can`t do the time ,don`t do the crime.Strangely Oliver Stone won the best adapted screenplay oscar for his script. Surely he should have won it for ORIGINAL screenplay.But despite its flaws MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a tense ,involving, tough film. Just make sure you read the book AFTER seeing the film.</fullReview>

Do you really care about him? I watched the movie and I could not find it realistic, every Turkish guy seems to be disgusting, unworthy of living.

		<shortDescription>This movie is a scandal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I live in Turkey. I speak Turkish. The book I'm reading now is the Turkish translation of Ulysses. I'm a rocker. I listen to some American and English bands, which most of the American and English rockers have never heard of yet. And by the way I'm one of the best science-fiction authors and song writers of all time, you'll hear about me in a few years :) Also I'm a funny guy, better than most stand-up comedians. I'm from Turkey.We, the Turks, are modern people. We have the best poets, stand-up comedians and barbers in the world! Beautiful girls, sun, snow, shadows and dust: The most beautiful city of the world: Istanbul! (or call it whatever you want, Konstantinapolis or something)Most of the Turkish women don't hide their hair like most Arabs do. And they are beautiful! (So are the Arabic and Indian girls, or all women let's say) When a few years ago you asked me about the beauty of Indian girls, I would say "Well.. You know.. Easterners.." I was a kid than. As fascist as a kid! (Or AS HIS OR HER PARENTS! The hidden thoughts..) But we surely have some beautiful girls here. (By the way I'm in love with one of them. Green eyes.. Blond.. But she does not love me. And I'm afraid, she never will :((( )This movie is a scandal. There's nothing about Turkey and Turkish people in this movie. I'm not talking about the usage of light or things like that, which are also 'not so well-done', I'm only talking about the 'meaning' of the movie. This movie is disgusting. They despise the word 'Turk' in this movie. My beautiful mother is a Turk, my funny father is a Turk, my beautiful and funny sister is a Turk, all my friends are Turks, all my lovers, all the people I see everyday, in the bus, in subways, in night clubs and bars, they are Turks, those nice people, THE PEOPLE I mean, not Turks, actually they are human beings, human beings.. After seeing this movie I just don't believe in anything in those Hollywood movies about South American countries or whatever.. And the anger of my youth whispers to my ears: "Make movies like this about US and some European countries!"Or should I say other European countries?! You know, United States is in Europe, or isn't it? After all Turkey is an Arabic country! :)))Most people which comment on this movie in these pages are Greek people. I just don't understand why.. Most probably these are fascists and most Greeks don't think in that way. I guess this is the truth, because we the people in Turkey don't even think about Greek people and actually we don't care, except few people who are interested in politics. Newspapers seldom write something about Greece. The only thing which may interest us can be their art, their history or the scientific improvements they make.Or maybe the Greek girls.. (OK, don't misunderstand this now! :))) )This is a movie about Turkey and that's why I wrote about some facts about Turkey when I commented on this movie. I personally enjoyed this movie when I watched it, the sounds the so called 'Turkish people' made and everything! But I just can't stand the thought that the people who watch this movie really believe that this really is a movie about Turkey, even if they are Americans, you know ;) This is unacceptable! An insult to Turkish, the language that our poets use, the language of Orhan Pamuk's or Yasar Kemal's books. An insult to the most beautiful (and yes, the most dangerous, but not in that way) city of the world, an insult to Istanbul.Disgusting.And you really believe in this s***, don't you?Well, well, well, my droogies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Express is one of the worst films ever made. It's an unrealistic portrayal of Turkish prisons and it's obviously not true. This film is a scandal! And simply another example of propaganda. I was shocked and disappointed. The directing is bad, the acting is really pathetic, the editing is horrible and the script sucks big time. It was really hard to watch this painful nightmare. What was director Alan Parker (Evita) thinking? He did manage to make a complete disaster. The score, composed by Giorgio Moroder is probably the only positive thing about this film. Moroder was also responsible for the magical soundtrack of Scarface. Try to catch the beautiful soundtrack of this blunder. If you are interested in bad films, then go see this one! But you are allowed to skip it.RATING: 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 40+ in town should find Giorgio Moroder's powerful original music very familiar. In their teenage days, their most frequented discos must have played this music. And the very first thing about "Midnight Express" I got contact with was this music. It's modern, it's sinister, it's tense. Listening to it with eyes closed, you can imagine a frantic chasing scene: a cold quiet killer running after a frightened sweating guy in any sleazy areas of any big city. Running, yes there must be some running.Watching stalwart Sir Alan Parker's movie, viewers need to be psychologically prepared for the dark elements he often employs on the, to some degree, shocking scenes. I still cannot stomach Bob Geldof's "suicide pool" (Pink Floyd The Wall).Crime and punishment, humanitarianism, use of drugs, liberal and repressed societies etc can all be discussed after one has seen the movie. I watched this one when I was about 15. When the Turkish jailers wanted to rape Billy, I was so silly to ask my brother (who is five years younger than I am) what they were doing and he told me their intention. Shocked. And I more or less have very little interest in prison movie afterwards. Later I have a chance to read a little of the book, not a very well-written one, more like a report. The movie, at my viewing, somehow reminded me of "Papillon", another escape from a foreign land. That one is less nauseating.Seeing west Turkey some ten years ago, I talked with some Turks about the movie. Quite a number of them watched it outside the country. The truth is that they don't mind how ugly the west portrays their prison or even their country because the movie only told partial truth, and this has already confirmed by B Hayes himself. According those Turks, the Turkish jailers would rather have women than men because they are not that easily available. The west still conquers the world mass media. Viewers have to keep their heads clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Alan Parker film : One of the most controversial films about life in a prison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is generally believed that "Midnight Express" is one of those rare films which must have had a long life of maximum television reruns in USA thanks to its disputatious content.Those who have seen it will have no qualms in affirming that even after 30 years of its release, Midnight Express continues to offend Turkish people as it had portrayed their nation as a barbaric third world country which has scant respect for human rights.All the fuss is created due to the shocking yet sympathetic portrayal of an American citizen William Hayes who is put in a Turkish prison after his arrest on drug peddling charges.It is true that director Alan Parker and script writer Oliver Stone have done a good job by showing that some prisons can turn out to be absolute hell.What did not work in their favor is the fact that most of scenes related to prison life and William Haye's treatment by Turkish authorities have been grossly exaggerated. To state that British director Alan Parker's film Midnight Express is a highly controversial work of art would be akin to twisting history.It is a film entirely based on perceptions.One must watch "Le Trou" by Jacques Becker if somebody is looking for a commendable film based on prison life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok I'll try not to be subjective as the movie itself while judging it, whereas it'll be hard. Now, it has its pluses and minuses like all the movies ever made in the history of cinema. Nothing wrong with that for sure. What's wrong, though, is that, the minuses override the pluses in this movie BIG TIME! Life in a Turkish prison might not be anywhere close to a vacation in Hawaii, but the situation is exaggerated 5 million times in this movie. First of all, foreigners are always treated nicer than locals in Turkey, in all aspects of society, including the prisons. Second, this Hayes guy wasn't imprisoned just because everyone in the prison was ugly and the prison needed a handsome detainee, he was imprisoned because he was trafficking DRUGS! Even in Holland, where the law permits the use of hash, trafficking so much stuff would be enough to make one look at the world through the jail bars. For those who don't know: There was another American guy who went to prison in Turkey at about the same time as Hayes, for the same crime. And upon watching this revolting movie, he wrote a book about his experience in the "tourist cell" of a Turkish prison, and he clearly states Hayes is a big time BS thrower and his life in the Turkish prison was exactly as good as a life in any prison could have been. So one could easily tell that the storyline on this movie is not necessarily imaginary, but an absolute exaggeration of the reality.Enough about the story, now let's talk about the cinematography itself. Well.. It's BAD! The Turkish lawyer and the Turkish prisoners speaking Turkish with an Italian accent, the Turkish judge speaking Turkish with an American accent, the Turkish prosecutor played by an Armenian terrorist speaking in a terrible Armenian accent.. That's hillarious! Also, everyone who plays a Turkish role in the movie is ugly as hell. Women all wear ninja-suits. Well, what else? Or do we need any other reason to say this movie is a failure? It's so obvious that the director is tearing up his rear to make Turks and Turkey look bad. And if it takes such an obvious try to do that, it means his filmmaking skills are not good enough to manifest his message. If you want to see a movie that's showing things 0 out of which are the least bit real, and if you want to lose all your respect to director Alan Parker, go watch this movie right now! But if you just want a good movie, avoid it at all costs, it'll make you nauseous. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the most gruelling prison film in existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As bleak as most prison dramas usually are, MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is probably one of the most harrowing of all time. The reasons for this are that a) we watch some totally appalling things go on, b) the acting is exceptional and makes us care for the characters, and c) the realism of the film means that it's easy for the viewer to think "this could happen to me...", as it wouldn't be the first time drugs have been planted on an unsuspecting holidaymaker. The prison in this film is definitely the dirtiest I've ever seen, miles away from the hi-tech surveillance compounds of Britain and America.Brad Davis has the central performance, as the film follows his teenager right from his arrest to his eventual escape (seven years later!). He's excellent, creating a believable character who goes through a realistic change as the years progress. In one scene, Davis memorably snaps and goes insane, a haunting and extremely powerful moment. Supporting him are John Hurt, who gives a memorably twitchy performance, and poor young Randy Quaid. The things that happen to Quaid will make you cringe.This is definitely an adult film in nature, containing as it does some very explicit and horrible violence. The prison guards in Turkey have a thing about whacking their batons against the soles of the feet of offenders, scenes which are nearly as difficult to watch as those in MISERY. In other graphic moments, a man has his tongue bitten and ripped out of his mouth, and a prison guard gets his just desserts when he falls against a coat hook with fatal results. For a film so depressing and harsh, it's a must to have an uplifting ending, which this thankfully has, but not before Davis has undergone all manner of ordeals. MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a film that every potential holidaymaker should be made to watch as a warning, and will remain in your memory long after viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ultra version of Shawshank.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this review short. Midnight Express-1978-Directed by Alan Parker-Starring Brad Davis and the legendary John Hurt-Screenplay by the great Oliver Stone. This film is a 9/10. The film is based on the real story of a man called Billy Hayes who was imprisoned for trying to smuggle hash out of Turkey. The film really struck me on the harsh reality and how much grit was projected. The film is really a bleak reality filled with horror and violence with sadistic humans which creates true terror of a horrible place with true grit and real terror. The film is sickening and in places and saddening in others. I'm not sure what to do. From a sweaty, enclosed prison to a horrifying mental asylum where the talk of 'machines' rules and the slow demise of Billy as he discovers his meaning and sexuality and the power of his mentality is sometimes heartbreaking as he plans his escape to normality."if I stay here I'm going to die!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brad Davis is effective playing American Billy Hayes, who is caught smuggling Hashish out of Turkey at the airport and is arrested, tried, and convicted to several years in a harsh Turkish prison run by sadistic guards. Billy learns to trust no one, though befriends a fellow American played by Randy Quaid, who is even more of a hard luck case than he is. Billy gets more desperate as time passes, though his infrequent visits with his father &amp; girlfriend do help. Billy must hang on despite his bleak situation if he is to survive, even if he has to kill...Alan Parker creates a bleak and harsh atmosphere in this true-life account, though sympathy is limited since Billy was guilty of a serious crime, though whether he deserved his nightmarish prison is of course another matter. Film is so relentlessly downbeat for two hours that it wears the viewer down. Not really an inspirational story of the triumph of the will, more like a cautionary tale about drug smuggling, and that may be its sole lasting worth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This star-making vehicle for Brad Davis, he of the more-carnal-than James Dean school, has elements of real tension and hopeless Turkish jail atmosphere.There are flaws, however, including a script that isn't entirely faithful to Hayes' story and a no-doubt-studio-inspired "no, I cant kiss a dude, even in prison" moment that Mr. Hayes (to say nothing of Mr. Davis) never quite experienced in real-life.And the booby-thru-glass-partition scene is just plain silly. (Did this happen?!?) Also, the film gets a little draggy with its one-atrocity-after-another approach to telling its tale... not always to the greatest effect.Still a decent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alan Parker is a very versatile director and I've enjoyed most of his films. Over the years, I've heard a lot about 'Midnight Express' and how it's one of the most disturbing films. The film was at the centre of controversy mainly for its portrayal of the Turkish people and corruption and the graphic violence.However, in all fairness, Parker's intention was to depict the prison as a harsh place (by portraying the policemen and wardens as cruel and even sadistic at times) and thus he took some liberty. I don't think he was thinking about how to make the Turks look bad but at the same time there were places he could have avoided this. For example, one can question whether all the Turkish inmates hated foreigners. The use of washed out colour certainly gives the film a grittier look but was it also necessary for the scenes outside the prison? As a result, they look very similar which might give ignorant people the impression that the entire country looks like a prison. I'd like to stress again that it doesn't imply all Turks as barbaric inhumane pigs (the judges were portrayed as sympathetic), maybe just the ones working in prison.Putting that aside, 'Midnight Express' tells the harrowing story of Bill Hayes, who was arrested at a Turkish airport for the possession of drugs and locked up in prison. Parker does a fine job of telling this story through the protagonist's perspective. It couldn't have been an easy movie to shoot but Parker and his director of photography Michael Seresin get it done. I only found two sequences to be a little over the top. One being Hays's outburst in court to which the judges respond sympathetically when in a real courtroom he wouldn't be allowed to go this far, swearing and cussing. The other scene was the death of one of the policemen which was unintentionally funny. Saying more would be giving out spoilers.'Midnight Express' has got solid performances from the American and British cast. Brad Davis does a superb job with a difficult role. John Hurt and Randy Quaid are great too. The actors playing the policemen and Turkish inmates were either wooden or caricatures. On a side note, the use of Maltese as Turkish was quite funny.The score deserves special mention. The instrumental tracks are simply amazing and they contribute brilliantly to the scenes.Parker's 'Midnight Express' is gritty, harsh and even uncompromising to an extent showing that the filmmaker can handle almost any complex subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great prison drama.Loosely based on a true story (many details are changed), the movie revolves around a man, Billy Hayes, who is imprisoned in Istanbul for drug possession/smuggling. Director Alan Parker and writer Oliver Stone slowly ratchet up the tension, scene by scene. Initially Hayes' predicament does not seem so bad - the Turkish police are depicted as harmless, almost buffoons - but as the movie goes on it becomes more and more claustrophobic as Hayes' position becomes more and more dire. You wonder if he gets out at all...Oliver Stone got the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 1979 for his screenplay - his first Oscar.Good performances from Brad Davis and John Hurt. Hurt got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. However, Randy Quaid is a bit over-the-top and irritating in his performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spiral Into Madness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Express is one of Alan Parker's greatest cinematic achievements and it talks about the ruthless prison environment in Turkey as well as the corrupt and ineffective Turkish criminal system. Almost forty years after the film's release, this movie is very strong and relevant and it ranks just behind the Shawshank Redemption in my favorite prison-escape films. A very powerful film about a man's descent into madness as he tries to escape from his harsh reality.Alan Parker's film is about a college student named Billy Hayes who is detained at a Turkish flight due to possession of hashish. Originally sentenced to four years in prison, that gets changed because of the stronger smuggling laws. Now Billy must find a way to survive and board the midnight express.The acting gave the film the sense of powerfulness. Brad Davis is fantastic as Hayes. He gave some powerful speeches during the courtroom scenes that just might stay with me for awhile. John Hurt delivers a good performance as one of Hayes cellmates who specializes in medicine. I also liked Randy Quaid who brings a sense of optimism to his character and provided the will for the attempt to escape.Overall, Midnight Express is a very powerful movie about a harsh criminal system in the Middle East. One thing to note is that the movie does not shy down from the brutality, and that may be the criticisms this movie receives. Hardly any Turkish people are seen in a positive light, so that was a little odd. But one cannot deny the ineffectiveness of the court system in Turkey. A very good film with strong acting and a wonderful score by Giorgio Moroder.My Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Istanbul Blues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was with some interest that I sat and watched an interview with the real Billy Hayes before writing this. Two interviews in fact where Hayes admits this film does not tell the whole story. Above all he states that this was not a first offense for him, it was only the first time he was caught smuggling hashish out of Turkey. Had to happen sooner or later and Hayes was sent to Turkish prison.That does not lessen in the slightest the impact that Midnight Express has because jail is jail no matter where you go. And jail except for a few western countries like the USA is rough. What it is is not as squalid as what you see in Turkey. And of course those rights that are in the Constitution that one takes for granted here just aren't there in most countries. It's only in countries with their legal system stemming from an Anglo-Saxon tradition that you are innocent until proved guilty. Good reason to deter people from doing what Billy Hayes did.Midnight Express is probably the best of a tradition of Americans in foreign prisons films like Breakout or Brokedown Palace as other examples. Brad Davis in a breakthrough role gives a powerful performance as our protagonist Billy Hayes. His fellow western inmates include Randy Quaid, Norbert Weisser and Academy Award nominee John Hurt. Each of them adapts to Turkish prison in their own way and they all mentor Davis.The real Billy Hayes said that the portrayal of the Turks was unjust and that we shouldn't judge Turkey by the Turks we see here. I wouldn't do that either, but who do we see but Turks involved in the criminal justice system so different that our's and Turk prisoners in the same jail that Davis and the rest are in.Jail is jail and no jail is complete without it's officials finks. Paolo Bonacelli is the stool pigeon planted in the same cell with the foreigners and he gets a rather just comeuppance for his activities. Most powerful of all is the head guard Paul Smith who has made Davis a particular target for torture. Inadvertently also he's means for Davis's deliverance.Midnight Express got two Oscars for Best Music score and best adapted screenplay and other nominations including the one John Hurt got for Best Supporting Actor. Prison films never date and Midnight Express is as powerful as when it was released in 1978.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping Story But Way Too Offenisive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight Express" tells the true story of a young American tourist named Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) who is visiting Turkey. While there, he steps over the line of himself by smuggling huge cartels of hashish out of the country. Without hesitation by the Turkish officials, Billy is sentenced to four years in prison.At first glance I had absolutely no sympathy for Billy as I felt the Turkish government was more than fair in Billy's sentencing. But as the movie progressed I started to take pity for Billy when the Turkish officials decided to expand his sentence to thirty years instead. The worst part is that they changed their minds after Billy was near to being discharged.At that moment I really thought hard and felt that though Billy committed a crime and should face some jail time, but I didn't think it was that bad that he should be jailed for thirty years.Sadly, Billy is very vulnerable. Even people who are fighting to get him out of prison like his father (Mike Kellin) and his Turkish lawyer had made the effort, but couldn't convince the Turkish authorities to get Billy out. So while on the topic of Turkish prison life, "Midnight Express" exhibits what goes on behind the walls in it's most graphic depictions you will ever see in your lifetime. The raping, the beatings prisoners endure and the #$%$ food are just some of the nasty routines that prisoners in Turkey face everyday of their lives. While in jail, Billy makes friends with some inmates like a frantic American named Jimmy, a gay Swede named Erich (Norbert Weisser) and a perpetually doped up Englishman named Max (John Hurt). The trio is seen together quite frequently, but violence rages on when Billy with the instincts like a wolf, actually annihilates another prisoner and literally rips the flash off the man's face.A lot of scenes are quite offencive and definitely not for the faint of heart. In one such case is when Billy's girlfriend (Irene Miracle) comes to pay him a visit. Though they were glassed apart from each other, Billy asks her to do remove her shirt so that he can bate the bishop. Nudity comes sporadically in the scene but it's only from the woman. The prison scenes feature more exposed nudity. The fighting displayed in the movie are quite graphic and at times over-the-top barbaric in its content. As you would expect in prisoner stories the language and profanity is often times gratuitous. In a rather disturbing scene that might not be for everyone involves Billy and Erich as they're in the shower together and they engage in the kiss, but you could clearly see that Erich wants to go beyond just a friendly kiss. Billy rebuffs the idea of taking it beyond. I for one don't have a problem with homosexuality, but for those who do might be disturbed by that scene.There are a lot of good thing about "Midnight Express" that make this movie special. The script was brilliantly written by Oliver Stone who won an Oscar for his achievement, and the movie was very impressive at the box office, but still I feel doubtful that this movie should be recommended. If you have never seen the movie and are curious about it don't let me stop anyone. I just felt very uncomfortable the whole time sitting through and was taken back at how cruel humanity can really be especially to those who go punished. Just be advised to those who would like to see "Midnight Express", there are images that are graphic to the max.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Davis Makes You Pull for Billy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underwear model perfect Brad Davis (as William "Billy" Hayes) gets caught trying to smuggle hash into America, and is terrorized in a Turkish prison. This is based on the true story, and a very good one. The real Billy Hayes authored book "Midnight Express" that led to this film was responsible for alerting millions of people about the dangers of attempting to smuggle drugs out of a foreign country. Generations thought twice about pulling a stunt like this, after hearing Mr. Hayes' account. A quick comparison between book and movie will reveal much of what occurs in this film is fictionalized...The tongue-lashing and final rape attempt never happened, though they sure command your attention. The weird, almost "Zen" romance did happen - but, this story leaves you the impression no actual sex acts occurred (one tiny edit would change the relationship to absolutely sexual, given surrounding scenes). That, and the otherworldly psych ward are too mystical. Despite faults, "Midnight Express" was nominated for six "Oscars" (and won what seem to be the unlikeliest). While he's burdened with serious deviations from the original character, Mr. Davis really makes you pull for Billy.******* Midnight Express (8/31/78) Alan Parker ~ Brad Davis, John Hurt, Randy Quaid, Paul Smith</fullReview>

		<fullReview>breasts that launched a thousand skits. If you've ever seen the movie, you'll know what I mean. If you haven't, wait for it. It also sparked AIRPLANE (8/10) quotes including "Ever been inside a Turkish prison?"Based on his biography, this is the story of Billy Hayes who was sent away for 30 years for smuggling Hash. Not heroin, but hashish. Bloody idiot. He should've tried it out of Amsterdam; at least the prisons would've been more comfortable. The depiction of the prisons as an unrelenting horror zone and a random justice system, irritated the Turks no end at the time with them threatening to stop the export of Turkish coffee and the misnamed Turkish delights to the US. And who else to do the irritating but the most maverick of the mainstream; Alan Parker. While you have lots of individualist directors, they tend to be limited to a very art house crowd. And spread their messages in the most doom ridden, clichéd ways. (Sorry, Mike Leigh). Alan parker, on the other hand, has done what the hell he likes; taking unfilmable works and making them his own in an original, accessible way. Think of BIRDY (8/10), BUGSY MALONE(7/10), PINK FLOYD'S THE WALL (7/10) and even EVITA (8/10).It's not surprising knowing his background; he was an advertising copywriter before joining the pantheons of the film gods. So he knows how to make a difficult concept saleable. In this he was joined in the script writing by none other than Oliver Stone, another maverick and conspiracy king, who later helped him with writing EVITA. (Yes, sort of like finding out that your macho gym teacher wears Victoria's Secret.)Scattered throughout are some great performances by Randy Quaid and John Hurt (already looking sixty at the ripe old age of 38) but the star performance is by Brad Davis as Billy Hayes; a tortured, realistic performance. He went on to be one of the first and best known stars to die of AIDS. Truth be told, Midnight Express was his greatest role and the one he will be remembered for.Even though it was made in the late 70's it is a pretty timeless piece, give or take a polyester suit, which is the way those prisons are.The brutality exhibited would make a dominatrix squeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do jails exist? To keep prisoners away from us or the other way round.We have classes of criminals: the mentally insane and sane. Insane criminals do not know right from wrong. Sane ones do, but commit these acts to defy law or are in a business prohibited by the law(prostitution,gambling,extortion,car-jacking,drug-peddling etc.). This film is based on the true story of Billy Hayes, a young American student sent to a Turkish prison for trying to smuggle hashish out of Turkey.There because of America's relationship with Turkey at that time, Billy's sentence changes from 4 years to 30 years.Billy has no option but to escape any way he can.This 1978 film won two Oscars Best Music, Original Score (Giorgio Moroder) and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium (Oliver Stone).The casting is superb. Brad Davis being the undisputed star of this film. Fans of John Hurt will be in ecstasy over his portrayal of Max, an English heroin addict. Peter Jeffrey is par to par with John Hurt and he puts an awesome performance in the small role offered to him.Other notable stars are Randy Quaid, Bo Hopkins, Paul L. Smith, Paolo Bonacelli &amp; Norbert Weisser. Randy Quaid portrays Jimmy an eccentric American who was put into prison for stealing candlesticks from a Mosque. Paolo Banacelli needs no introduction. His acting is perfect in the role of the stoolie. Paul L. Smith plays the sadistic warden of the jail and who is a homosexual and molests any of the prisoners he takes a fancy to. Norbert Weisser plays a gay Swede who was also convicted for smuggling hashish.Bo Hopkins has the smallest role of all but plays his part with finesse. Well? What more to add but to say this is one of the best films about suffering in a prison along with Papillon, The Great Escape &amp; Escape From Sobibor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame the movie version of Billy Hayes' experiences weren't very much like the book. I commented on this movie a few years back, but have had second thoughts. The real Billy Hayes was not like the one portrayed here and took it a lot better and realized he had to pay a price for his smuggling attempt. I would be willing to write the screenplay and send it out for a remake and have it 100% like the book, nothing sensationalistic, emotionally manipulative, or sentimental, but simply tell the story like it was and use authentic Istanbul locations. So many differences to include there was not some "alien" head guard who gave horrible beatings for any little thing, Billy didn't have a girlfriend with him on his trip, and his stay in the insane ward was not as a result of beating a trustee to death, but rather for a request to a judge. And his escape, well, I won't spoil it, but it would be exciting for a movie. And a final not, I think Brad Pitt would be a great choice for the role of Billy. Just my 2 cents worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but flawed in character depiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Express is an excellent prison drama written by Oliver Stone of Platoon and Born On The 4th Of July fame. It follows American Billy Hayes, who gets arrested in Turkey while trying to take drugs over the border. The officials make him a scapegoat by giving him a life sentence, and he spends the next few years facing the brutality of the prison guards and making ill-fated plans to catch `the Midnight Express` (escape).Midnight Express' biggest problem is that it's really not all that shocking. Someone gets beaten up occasionally, there's a few scuffles in the exercise yard, the prison's sort of grimy, and one of the characters takes drugs. This isn't helped by the stylish, glossy lighting. It's really nothing that modern audiences won't have seen in a much gorier format already. Where it really excels is in the acting department. Brad Davis is excellent, and Randy Quaid and John Hurt provide good support. Also, the Oscar winning score is fantastic.The opening scene, with Hayes trying to sneak through customs with 2 kilos of hashish attached to his torso are wonderfully tense, even though you know he has to get caught at some point (it wouldn't be much of a prison movie otherwise). From then on, the film takes the same philosophy as Fight Club - to escape from his life in prison, get redemption, and start again Billy has to completely hit rock bottom and pay for his crime. Max the Englishman doesn't face up to this responsibility and escapes the reality of his situation through a drug-induced stupor, and so he doesn't get the same chance.Although many have (rightly) derided the film for it's demonisation of the Turks, it wouldn't be an Oliver Stone movie if it didn't take at least a side-swipe at America as well. In this case, Billy is clearly portrayed as a Turk-hating racist, making him a less sympathetic character in my eyes, and his father is constantly talking of ways to cheat Billy out of the legal system so he can escape to Greece. He seems to completely ignore the fact that his son is a criminal and takes out his anger verbally on the Turkish guards. And of course, it's only the Turks being portrayed negatively because that's were Billy got arrested in reality. This is a mainstream Hollywood film, so of course it needs to have clear cut bad guys to appeal to the masses. If Billy had been arrested in any other Eastern country, it would have been them shown in this negative light. It's not Turkey's fault that they happened to arrest him, but the film obviously wouldn't have had much success if the story was: Billy Hayes gets arrested in Turkey, everyone treats him nicely, he gets out and goes home. It just happens that he got arrested in Turkey, so it is the Turks who are portrayed in a bad light in order to make Billy in to some kind of `hero'. That's the way Hollywood moviemaking was, and still is.It's not quite a ten-out-of-ten bona fide classic, mainly because of the overly simple portrayal of the Turks, but it takes a disturbing look at issues of escape, redemption, and punishment, and doesn't take the overly straightforward standpoint that a major Hollywood prison film might be expected to take. Personally, I preferred Midnight Express to that other great escape film, The Shawshank Redemption.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Expression For "Midnight Express"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying that I hold no prejudiced views of Turks or any other culture in this world and I know that not all Turks are of a violent nature. We shouldn't take what Hayes said at the time and the things shown here as gospel.By the same token though,I also don't defend Hayes or anyone else who deals in illegal activities. Hayes himself,in the the short film extra that accompanies the movie/DVD,looked back at his ordeal at age 30 and stated his regret. He's 56/57 now and this is all water under the bridge.The truths told here are that prison systems in other countries and Turkey at that time in history were archaic,ruthless and unforgiving. Not to mention crooked and corrupt. That said,I finally saw this movie for the first time last night. I recall the ads back in 1978 but of course,I was too young too see such a thing. Spotting a copy at the local library I decided to finally watch it. Since the storyline has been told here before I'll simply state that in terms of telling a true to life story,this movie at times excels and at other times seems just slightly over the top,but most Hollywood movies take creative license that way anyway. Hard as the violent scenes are to watch,it would not have done justice to the film to sanitize these realities. I'm just glad they didn't actually show the children getting their feet struck with a heavy board,that would have been too much. Hayes hatred of the Turks that he states in the courtroom is not something he came into the country with,he was justifiably angry and at his wits end with their supposed system of justice. While it's wrong to break the law there should always be a limit and a measure of what is the suitable price one should pay for their actions.Davis was a fine actor and his performance is spectacular. Had I seen this before Jim Carrey was famous,I would have not laughed unintentionally every time he said "Max". Davis &amp; Carrey look somewhat similar and though I haven't seen what Carrey did in "The Cable Guy",I know it had to be a great send-up. Davis is absolutely electric when his character goes on a rampage and ends up in the insane asylum.The actors playing the Turks who run the prison don't budge an inch from their roles as virtual monsters who revel in the violence and cruelty they are allowed to get away with. Randy Quaid gives one of the best performances I've ever seen him in and I really felt bad for his character who is sent into the "sanatarium" twice and beaten senseless. The Georgio Moroder score certainly punctuates every scene that it's used in.Again,putting aside political views and without any prejudices,I can honestly rate this movie 10 stars. I recommend it 100% but only for those with a strong skin and mind that can tolerate the violence depicted. Lastly,it's wise to remember that not "all" people of a given country or culture/group think and believe or do things in the same way. There are countries that control it's citizens' thoughts and actions but eventually time and the resolve of independent thinking wins out in the long run.Midnight Express though based on fact,is still after all,only a movie.(END)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I can understand any criticisms geared towards Midnight Express. Some might say it has a sympathetic depiction of drug traffickers. Some might say it has pitiless violence. Some might say the representation of the Turkish jailers is stereotypical. Some might say it had an over-simplistic approach to the key issues that greeted it upon release. Those who say that are in some ways right, this film does have those things.However, while they are hard to counter in a way, I actually don't consider them flaws. To me, Midnight Express was still a superbly staged film. It has atmospheric cinematography and lighting, while the direction from Alan Parker is powerful and intelligent. Giorgio Moroder's electronic score is wonderful and unforgettable, some people may think it too strident perhaps, but I loved it and thought it added a lot to the film. The film also has a very good screenplay, a very effective and iconic opening sequence and a harrowing yet gripping story.The acting is outstanding, especially Brad Davis, while Randy Quaid and the underrated John Hurt are also excellent. So all in all, Midnight Express is a great film. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Express</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great, exciting movie about an American young adult, Brad Davis, getting caught red handed smuggling drugs from Turkey to the United States. I loved this movie and could not keep my eyes off it. I recommend it to everyone but the reason i gave this a 5 instead of a 10 was because this movie portrays nothing of life in Turkey. Turks are known as very kind people and this movie portrays them all horrible. Even before in prison, you see all the men in Islamic skull caps and women with head scarfs. Turkey is not such a religious country, this is not realistic. Nor do the people even have good Turkish. The actors in this movie are Armenians, and it is filmed an old prison in Malta. In reality he was in a modern prison in Turkey. He even admits to the story being over-exaggerated and not portraying what he wanted. He wanted to show people to follow laws in other countries because once you leave America you do not have the same rights. This could happen in any country. Instead this movie portrays the Turks as evil people and Turkey as hell. Unrealistic, but a great movie that sent out the wrong message. This is Americas main source to information about Turkey, a false source. Therefor i gave it a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd first like to say that this is one of my favorite films. Oliver Stone wrote a masterpiece for the screen for which he received the Oscar. The movie from beginning to the end pulls you through one of the darkest and most intense stories about one man's struggles in a Turkish prison. Anyone who likes happy movies need not rent this. The controversy over the movie depicting Turkish people as pigs is ridiculous. Their in PRISON! What would you expect to find in prison, nuns and priests? Its like saying Turks who saw The Shawshank Redemption think all American's are like the warden. Anyway, see this movie if you like good storytelling. Rating: 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter how many times I've watched this, I invariably shake like a leaf for Billy Hayes as Alan Parker makes us follow him through the passport and customs control in the film's majestic expository first minutes. And I always hope against hope that he'll make it to that aircraft and fly off with his loot. But no - each and every time, they get to him, he raises his hands in the air and that precise moment Giorgio's electrifying pads kick in like a tidal wave.Proceed through for a disturbing, serious, harrowing, multi-layered mega performance by Brad Davis, a sadly missed icon if ever there was one, impeccably directed by Alan Parker and beautifully coloured by Giorgio Moroder at his big screen best. And yes, "The Chase" is in there - ever heard the 12" version on a dancefloor? You must.This film plays hardball with you and will inflict psychological pain on you like you'll never forget.

		<shortDescription>Full Of Intensity, But Lacking In Accuracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let me say that this is a great movie. It kept me glued to the screen all the way through. Having said that, the biggest disappointment in the movie is director Oliver Stone's own admission that he took great liberties with the story of William Hayes, the young American sentenced to thirty years in a Turkish prison for trying to smuggle hashish out of the country, and the reality is that what we see in the movie isn't much like what actually happened. (My understanding is that the language used in the film isn't even Turkish. It's apparently Maltese, because the movie had to be filmed in Malta, since Turkey refused to allow filming there because they considered the script so anti-Turkish.) The portrayal of the Turks is also a bit of a problem. I'm not trying to suggest that life in a Turkish prison is easy. But the purpose of the movie seemed to be to try to elicit from the viewer sympathy for Hayes' plight. I'm not defending brutality, but the fact of the matter is that Hayes did this to himself. The Turks didn't force him to smuggle hashish out of the country. If he had obeyed the law there would have been no problem. I suspect that the Turks weren't as bad as Stone depicted them (although I'm sure it was no country club.)I really liked Brad Davis in the role of Hayes. He seemed to capture the character perfectly (which is probably why it is the role that defined - and probably in the long run hurt - his acting career.) He quite literally carried the movie. No one else particularly stood out to me. The scenes in the psychiatric ward were extremely disturbing, as was the scene in which Hayes is visited by his girlfriend Susan (Irene Miracle).The movie left a lot of open questions (unfortunate for a supposedly true story.) We aren't told what happened to Hayes' friend Max (John Hurt), who he left behind in prison after promising to come back for him (I assume Hayes never helped him, but I have no idea), and although Stone does a good job of depicting Hayes' escape from the prison, my understanding is that the story of his escape to Greece is quite dramatic, but it isn't even dealt with by the movie.I have no problem stating that this is a great movie, but it certainly loses points for its questionable reflection of reality and for leaving so many loose ends.8/10</fullReview>

This film's depiction of Turks is one sided to the extent of being racist. To the extent that one thinks it was not a coincidence and was financed by a lobby that had an agenda.It may have been understandable if it was only the prison guards and policeman, and the soldiers etc, who were represented as pigs. OK, in that case we see the world from the eyes of the individual who is quashed by the legal system and enforcement of a state for a petty crime of smuggling some weed... It would be OK if the target here was the "State".However in this movie any Turk is a bad guy, filthy guy, a rapist, a liar ...How could any audience find this believable? To think that this movie got two Oscars, one for screenplay... Anyway the link above is an interview with the guy that wrote the book which Oliver Stone's screenplay is based on.

Also no people in Turkey was wearing fess and they do not wear Arabic clothes. Because they are not Arabic. There are no prison in Istanbul like the one was shown in the film. Homosexuality can not be accepted by Turkish people. The homosexuals are isolated from the public.

People might say, that it is just entertainment, but this movie comes up with the ambition to show the world, how brutally corruption in mid-east countries exist.The problem of the whole storytelling is the one-sided point of view. I'm telling this, because you can't approach seriousness and afterwards when the audience, i think especially the Turkish, is getting angry at your spoiling work, turn around and save your butt by telling, hey it's just entertainment. This is cheap recreancy.The movie itself is driven by known feeling-games, portraying "bad-good" skirmish without any draft to endorse the story. After some certain point it's getting boring and annoying, since there is too little atmosphere in the movie, and that leaves a cheesy aftertaste.It's a pity, why Olive Stone didn't go deeper into the characters, because then the audience have had some knots to cling to some interesting aspects.

		<shortDescription>The true story of American Billy Hayes' nightmarish prison stint...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight Express" is the type of movie that stays with you, that makes you think about the things that you have in your everyday life, and makes you cherish those things. The movie opens with our "hero" William "Billy" Hayes wrapping himself up in aluminum folded hash, as he is preparing to attempt going through customs with the drugs around his waist. It's Turkey in 1970, and as the movie points out, bombs are being planted on aircrafts like flies on syrup. Right off the bat, we can see that Billy does not have the "cojones" for such a task, as the recurrent heartbeat that becomes the movie's trademark, along with its Oscar-winning score by Giorgio Moroder, gets stronger and stronger to the point where that nervousness and lack of cool costs him his freedom. He is searched before boarding the plane, and is taken away into a nightmarish ride.There's a problem that I have with a character played by "American Graffiti's" Bo Hopkins, who comes in and is very fluent in Turkish, and introduces himself as "sort of a representative from the U.S. Consulate". The problem that I have with this character is that we are never told his name, or why he is even there, but he is certainly a key element in the film, since he is the one who put Billy behind bars after a stupid attempt to escape.Now, I do agree on the fact that the punishment must fit the crime, and at the beginning, the 4-year sentence that Billy's given seems to be just about right for a federal offense such as trying to smuggle drugs from one country to another, but our "hero" never seems to be able to understand the severity of his crime, and never seems to regret his actions, even coming close to demanding that his father "get him out of there". After his sentence is changed to Life in Prison, Billy goes berserk, and starts a monologue against Turkish justice, and even its people that must have caused quite a controversy back in its day.The supporting characters are all brilliantly played, namely John Hurt in an Oscar-nominated turn as an English prisoner who has been half eaten by drugs and prison life, and who is left behind by Billy at the end, but we never are told what became of him. Randy Quaid is equally good, albeit, in a more thankless role as a fellow American who was imprisoned for 7 years after stealing a candlestick from a temple.The movie is not easy to digest, but is realistic enough to make you feel for the leading characters, especially Billy, even though we know that he deserved to do the time, we don't feel like he deserved Life Sentence, and so, that is why the ending is so rewarding in our hearts. Rewarding not in a "Shawshank Redemption" fantasy type of a way, but in a true sense, because unlike Andy Dufresne in "Shawshank", Billy's escape is purely random, and we go along with him for the ride towards freedom, not like Andy, who snuck out the back door, and left us wanting for more. Don't get me wrong, I do believe that "Shawshank" is one of the top 5 movies that I've ever seen, but "Midnight Express" stays with you a little longer. They don't make 'em like this anymore. By the way, this was Oliver Stone's first script to be turned into a movie.I highly recommend this movie, as it is one of the true jewels of the golden era of Hollywood in the 1970's. Check it out.</fullReview>

I wish such an outstanding directors would focus on the bad system that resulted in a bad experience in Turkey like in many countries so that everyone would have gained a lesson;instead he(Stone) preferred to reflect Turks as bad, non-human and dirty. Even Bill Hayes told that "I loved the movie, but I wish they'd shown some good Turks. You don't see a single one in the movie, and there were a lot of them, even in the prison. It created this impression that all Turks are like the people in 'Midnight Express.' ... I wish they'd shown some of the milk of human kindness I (also) witnessed."

		<fullReview>Based on his book, Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) tries to smuggle hashish out of Turkey and is caught. He is eventually sentenced to 4 years and 2 months. The conditions are impossible and he faces physical and emotional trials. He makes a few friends with the foreigners in prison which includes John Hurt and Randy Quaid.While the ordeal is harrowing, I don't see how anybody could root for the guy. He's a drug smuggling idiot. That is not in dispute. He is by no means innocent. And 4 years seems like a light sentence. He didn't get caught with a joint. He was packing a lot of drugs. The fact that they're trying to play him as a sweet kid only made him look stupid.It is one of Oliver Stone's early screenplays. There is some arguments over its accuracy. I will go back to my usual expectation that this is not a documentary. I'm sure much of it is fictionalized.The ending seems a little bit unrealistic. But it's a good prison movie overall. There are some surprisingly original scenes in this. Oliver Stone probably had something to do with that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I say this movie recently I had mixed feelings: on the one hand, prison conditions and brutality of wardens were really awful, but, on the other hand, the main hero was not wrongfully accused (unlike in the film Papillon, for example). Although the events took place in the 1970ies, I presume that conditions in Turkish prisons have not generally improved. And nowadays prisons in Europe are, in fact, guarded holiday homes, where inmates tend to enjoy better life than their law-abiding, but poorer countrymen...Directing and script are excellent, but the main character Billy Hayes (played by Brad Davies) is overshadowed by his countrymen Max and Jimmy (played by John Hurt and Randy Quaid, resp.). It is also pity that Turks were played by non-Turks and that only the first steps of escape were shown. However, the movie is still worth watching, as tensions are high and events unpredictable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot to like about MIDNIGHT EXPRESS. Based on a true story, it stars Brad Davis as Billy Hayes, a young American arrested and imprisoned in Istanbul, Turkey, for attempting to smuggle hashish out of the country. The harshness of the prison conditions displayed in Parker's film are a bit over the top, but the one thing you can't call this film is boring. And I never understood why it didn't make a major star of the late Brad Davis.Davis is miscast; dark and stocky, he looks nothing like the real Hayes, who is tall, blond, and slender. But looks aside, Davis delivers a sensational performance in a film that purports to tell the true story of Hayes's ordeal but which fails in several key places to do so.For starters, Hayes's book didn't tell the whole story (he has revealed this recently, claiming rather ambiguously that it was necessary to fictionalize certain things "to protect certain persons."); neither the book nor the film tells the truth about Hayes's smuggling: it was not a one-time thing; he had been doing it for several years and the only reason that he was caught this time was that security at Middle Eastern airports was increased in the aftermath of a recent bombing in the region (I forget where). On previous occasions he was able to board the plane carrying several kilos of hashish because the airport officials barely noticed him; on this occasion they were frisking everyone and that's how he got caught.But I digress; the film, like the book, is primarily about Hayes's experience at Sagmalcilar prison. And here's where the most egregious dishonesty is to be found in Parker's film. All the Turks are depicted as stereotypical sadists who take delight in abusing the prisoners. In Hayes's book there was one such individual, but in the film the whole prison staff appears to be cut from the same piece of cloth.The film's depiction of Hayes himself has problems. For one thing, he never threw the legendary temper tantrum in the courtroom; neither did he bite off a prison guard's tongue. And what may be the film's most famous scene is also a lie: a fellow inmate makes sexual advances towards Billy, who gently but firmly rebuffs him; in fact Billy and this inmate had a love affair that lasted until the other inmate left the prison.Despite all these plot holes, the film is eminently watchable and Davis throws himself into the role of Hayes with an intensity and abandon that should have gotten him an Oscar nomination. It must be said, however, that while this film tells its story very well, there are good and valid reasons that the Turkish people consider it insulting and offensive. A pity, because what the film does well it does exceedingly well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film that launched a thousand "turkish prison" jokes into the 1980s, this sees young American smuggler Davis tossed into a cruel foreign jail. Attempting to bring a bunch of dope stateside, he's busted at the airport, which begins a hellish five year ordeal.Being a big "pacing" hound, I usually enjoy films that quickly get into their plots. But somehow, here, it hurt the film for the most part. We know nothing about Davis, and when he's subjected to vicious conditions in the prison, there isn't a lot of sympathy. If he, perhaps, was a smuggler driven by some sort of debt that his life depended on, then I may have felt more. But at the heart of things, he is a criminal, and has only himself to blame for any time he must serve.Davis carries the film well enough, but it was the people that surrounded him, that added more character. Quaid's rambling crusader, and the perpetually stoned-out Hurt, make for more interesting personality studies. All the business involving Davis' father and lawyer and courts, etc, just had an absent tone to them. Throw in your obligatory band of ruthless prison guards, and everything is sort of unoriginally standard.Another glaring frustration is the lack of subtitles. At the front, it was mostly effective, as we feel what Davis' feels when hearing a bunch of incomprehensible jargon barked out in ominous tones. But once Davis learns the language (and can communicate with it rather effectively, as seen later), we needed to be privy to what was being discussed. Otherwise, it's just more blather.As far as the close goes, it was entirely too rushed and inadequate. After all that build (to a confrontation you knew would come), things sort of jump to a conclusion that isn't really finished. And the homecoming wrap-up involving black and white photos was a very peculiar choice. And I'm sure a vast majority will disagree with me, but Davis almost suffers too little. Sure, there's beatings and mental decomposition, but most of Davis stay is clouded by attempts at escape and legal boloney (punctuated by the embarrassingly rambled courtroom tirade).In all, the film can still shock with its more seedy sexual subject matter and third-world environment, but the sum total isn't equal to as good a film as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Express is an involving thriller focusing on the plight of a young American drug smuggler imprisoned in Turkey. This controversial film has been accused of being anti-Turkish, while simultaneously serving as a potent warning to those who want to smuggle drugs across borders. The truth is, it is a mixture of the two.The most involving character in the film is the prison itself, which as a society seems to form a living organism in its own right. Isolated from the rest of the world, the prison develops its own economy and mores, in essence becoming a type of microcosm. Indeed, at times I found myself wishing the filmmakers would go into more detail on the functioning of this captive community.Although there is a great deal of brutality in the film, at times the Turkish prison comes across as more humane than its Western counterparts. Inmates are allowed to keep their own clothes, and do not appear to be put to hard labor. This does not excuse the brutality depicted, but does provide a counterpoint to accusations that the movie is uniformly anti-Turkish.Furthermore, contrary to statements by some reviewers, there are actually some sympathetic Turkish characters in the film. For instance, it is made clear that the judge only sentences Hayes to a long term because of the inflexibility of Turkish law. The accusations seem to stem from the fact that many of the villainous characters, such as the guard Hamid, are underdeveloped. We do not see their motivations for cruelty, so that they seem to be caricatures.One flaw of the film, a symptom of the time it was made, is its squeamish treatment of homosexuality within the prison. Although it is clear that prisoners resort to homosexuality, the film refuses to go into any detail, other than a rather clichéd implied romance between Hayes and another prisoner. Ultimately though, the film's main flaw, aside from those mentioned above, is the rather histrionic script from Oliver Stone. The bombast overwhelms the film at times. Nevertheless, it is still worth a view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only just heard about this movie.. though it came out long before I was born. I'm planning to add it to my Netflix ASAP.This true story really interests me. I love traveling, yet that fear is always in the back of my mind while I'm abroad, that "what if something were to happen?" This man's story is amazing. I have been to Istanbul, and can honestly say for myself that my experience was not pleasant, so I can relate to how the film portrays the country of Turkey. Like any place you go, you cannot simply judge an entire population based on the actions of only a select few, though it's human nature to do so. This is not fair to the possible millions of other citizens who could be the kindest people in the world. I feel for the people of Turkey, I mean how would we like it if another country released a movie in which all Americans were seen as fat, rude and impatient? Though I see why this country would be upset, I am merely playing devil's advocate here. Like I said, I have been to Istanbul, and during my visit, my friends and I were cornered into a shady area in town. Three women, including myself, and a male, who was later conned into buy a 250euro t-shirt. I did not feel comfortable or safe at all for the first time in my life. It really opened my eyes to the vast diversity in this world. Therefore, I am very intrigued by Bill Hayes' story and hope to see past my own experience to appreciate the Turkish culture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of romantic notions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film first run 29 years ago. Although I didn't need it, it would've scared me straight, I'll tell you. This is the true story (first as a book, followed the film a mere 8 years after the real events) of a young man in 1970 who was stupid enough to try smuggling hashish across the border out of Turkey. He was busted. "Midnight Express" is his story about "life" in Turkish Hell. It's an incredibly graphic, tortuous, painful, sad, and frightening depiction of what much of the world does with its criminals. The film is MUCH better than I even remembered. The acting by all, including lead Brad Davis and main support roles by young John Hurt and Randy Quaid, is superb. Scoring is not Giorgio Moroder's best, but it's good. Screenplay is by Oliver Stone, who I DO like? when he's NOT screwing around with serious historical events. It's a tense, flinch-filled, brutal film that will drain you of any lingering romantic notions about how much you think you can withstand.</fullReview>

I haven't read the book or anything like that, i put the DVD on play only knowing that this a film is based on a true story about some guy that tried smuggling drugs across countries. I think the movie has a great start, the kind that prepares the viewer to what he is about to witness in the next two hours. It will make you laugh, it will make you want to interfere but it wont make you cry unless you're very sentimental. The musical score is fantastic and definitely had its recognition by winning the Oscar award in 1978 for 'the best musical score'. There is one scene in which i was like is this "Apocalypse Now" or "Midnight Express" I'm watching, so it also reminds you of a great movie you once have watched... One thing i didn't like was everyone being so homosexual, i know its logical that in a male prison house this will occur but not with the children or the officers, it made me think strangely of the Turk's. Ill sum it up as a powerful picture that wont disappoint you, so if any of you missed it throughout the years like i did, you better start moving yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you think that there is nothing worse than death, then you have not seen Midnight Express. Midnight Express tells the tale of a young American who gets caught smuggling drugs out of Turkey. The film pulls no punches in showing the experiences of the captives in the Turkish prison. It's intense, gritty and, at times, downright disturbing. It seems like everybody in Midnight Express is covered in dirt and then coated with a layer of sweat. It's this kind of realism that makes Midnight Express a great film. It's too bad more films today don't follow its blueprint. Midnight Express didn't worry about how much the audience could handle. They wanted to show prison life for what it is and succeeded. Studios today are too worried about scaring away the audience, when they should be more worried about making a great film. Midnight Express deserves to be placed on any list of great prison films, along with The Great Escape, Papillon, The Shawshank Redemption and Bridge on the River Kwai (yes, it's a prison film, not a war film.) It perfectly depicts what a person goes through in prison both mentally and physically. There are truly some things worse than death, lets just hope you won't have to visit a Turkish prison to realize that fact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not exaggerating: I can't recall any other movie that would match this masterpiece. This movie is so genius and powerful that it can't be fully understood by trying to rationalize it. Many think the movie is racist or not based on real facts. What these people fail to realize is that IT DOES NOT MATTER. The movie is about something so big and fundamental that it can't be judged according to the criteria used for some stupid 'good guys - bad guys' Hollywood nonsense. This is about the eternal evil of human nature which does not fit our definitions of 'good' and 'bad'. While smuggling drugs may be 'bad' and illegal, Billy Hayes had to deal with the evil so enormous that it made him a saint. This kind of evil can be encountered anywhere if you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is not about 'bad' Turks and 'good' Americans: the events of the last decade clearly demonstrated that Americans can be as evil as anyone else. Try to look beyond stereotypes - that's what the creators of 'Midnight Express' managed to do like nobody else before or after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brad Davis goes to a hellhole of a prison on a dope conviction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood biographies generally are not accurate accounts, and there's no point in evaluating a movie on that basis, in my opinion, unless it be to praise its unusual accuracy. My rating rests on this film as a film. On that score, it's a long, dreary, dismal, unsuspenseful slog, in which the viewer is put through the mill as much as Brad Davis is in prison. That seems to be the point, to punish the viewer and show us how bad a prison can be. They are bad in America too. Is there some other theme to it? And it's because the film is such a slog, in which artistry is mainly to show the darkest, dankest, dirtiest, most depressing, prison possible, the role of artistry is minimal.Brad Davis does a decent enough job with a role made difficult by a below-par script that seems to make him adolescent and everyone else too, John Hurt being the exception. The script is lacking and the direction is lacking in building up side characters. In a 120 minute movie, there should have been more of that. We get some feeling for the frustrations of Brad Davis, what with his sentence extended arbitrarily and due to politics, but not that much sense of his character, other than his love for his family. The darkness of the prison is the star of the movie. It causes hopelessness. After that comes the hulking main guard who likes to beat people's feet, but he's a one-note sadist. Randy Quaid comes and goes.My main memory of this movie will be the pitch blackness or close to it of many scenes. This prison had a scarcity of inside light.If you are a fan of prison movies, you may like this. It depicts a lot of callousness of the authorities. It depicts poor tattered men penned up. There is some homosexual embracing. There are the obligatory escape scenes, but I cannot praise them for their execution, story telling and suspense. The story is mainly about hopes being dashed. Oh, yes. Don't get caught for drug offenses in countries that have stiff punishments for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very well made with some great visuals on show; you really get a feel for the place. I can't say I was enamoured with the music though, yes there were a few Turkish themes but then there was this electronic music that seemed to cut right across the grain. How the music won the Oscar in 1979 I will never know! All the performances were very good; Brad Davis does a decent job in the lead roll as Billy Hayes without being particularly outstanding. Randy Quaid did some great scenery chewing as Jimmy Booth, John Hurt was excellent (as ever) and Max and Norbert Weisser did a decent job as Erich. Of the bad guys, I thought Paolo Bonacelli did a very good job as the slippery Rifki and Paul L. Smith did a great job as the brutal head guard Hamidou. Finally honourable mentions go to both Irene Miracle as Billy's girlfriend, Susan and Mike Kellin as Billy's father.For a film that won two Oscars; 'Best Music, Original Score' and 'Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium'; I found it a little disappointing. Other nominations included 'Best Actor in a Supporting Role' for John Hurt which I thought was well deserved. I think what lets it down is the performance of Brad Davis in the central role. He doesn't quite carry it off and, because the whole film hangs on his part, it suffers because of it. It's almost like he's trying just a little bit too hard at times and you can see it on the screen. Even so, it's an intriguing tale with some nice touches; for example the use of the sound of Billy's heartbeat as he's going through customs as the beginning of the film; very effective. Over all, well worth a look but not particularly for the central role; there is still much to admire though, hence my score.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight Express" is the best prison brake flick I've seen by far. Although It's very loosely based on the book by William Hayes, and twists the reality quite some, the story brings to light the most important aspect into light - being lost in another world.Going behind bars is tough. I haven't had that pleasure yet and I honestly hope I won't be getting it, but one can only imagine how hard is to find yourself in a world without freedom, privacy or any commodity. Furthermore, being locked up in such an inferno on the other side of the world makes one feel like being on a different planet. And that's a binding fact which is present both in the book as well as in the film. For known reasons it wasn't filmed in Turkey, and yet, the substitute Maltese surrounding Parker chose managed to project the atmosphere of an oriental prison in full. Personally, I admire Hayes's courage to withstand all the hardships during all those years. I'd probably end up like Max...Parker has generally shown a great deal of talent as a director. It's a pity such talent wasn't applied on the silver screen some more. Acting - one of the best Anglo-American co-ops on screen. John Hurt brilliant as ever, Randy Quaid in the role of his life and finally the refreshing Brad Davis, whose talent never got to shine as bright as in "Midnight Express". The "Turkish" (Maltese-Italian) cast did their job just as fine. Still, "Midnight Express" wouldn't have been nearly such a success without Giorgio Moroder's soundtrack. It's a perfect example how each segment of a motion picture makes up to it's role, thus creating a full cinematic experience."Midnight Express" is a timeless classic, an action drama which will keep you focused until the last minute, no matter how many times You watch it. Do watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film that won Oliver Stone his first Academy Award, 'Midnight Express' is an exercise in what not to do when visiting a foreign landscape: extract illegal narcotics. The landscape here being Turkey, circa 1970. While the film is most remembered for it's Oscar-winning score, it's message carries on throughout the years.By no account is this a perfect film. The flaws are few and far between, but one stands out far more than any other. It involves a gay romance inside the Turkish prison that seems forced, almost laughable. The story could of done without it all together, nothing would be missed.But the good greatly outweighs the bad. The script is very compressed. Maybe the best Stone's written in his vast career. The opening scenes at the Customs area would impress the master of suspense himself. Brad Davis, the actor who plays Billy Hayes, the main character, is nothing short of spectacular. It's really a sad thing when a young man with so much potential dies so young.Give this movie a watch, but don't expect a mindless popcorn flick. This movie is a life lesson.

		<fullReview>"Midnight Express" is one of the most daring and original prison films ever made. It starts simply with a story of a foolish and immature student William Hayes (who Brad Davis plays brilliantly) trying to smuggle two kilos of hashish out of Turkey and being caught by Turkish guards. Then what follows is one of the most harrowing and horrific prison experiences ever put on film. I won't spoil the plot, except to say that the remarkable scenes that follow show Director Alan Parker and screenplay writer Oliver Stone at the height of their creative powers. The actors are also great too. John Hurt is excellent in the role of a doped up Max. Randy Quaid is hilarious as the mischievous schemer Jimmy. Paul Smith is incredibly evil as the Turkish captain Hamidou the bear. In the background to this feast of pornographic, drug-induced, sadistic nightmare fantasies are great disco synths from Giorgio Moroder (who is most famous for the lead song for "Flashdance").

Billie Hayes was not treated that badly, and admitted it, many years later.This is a man who smuggled drugs into Turkey, was caught, sentenced according to their laws, and then escaped. He's not a hero by any definition.The movie Fargo, by the Cohen Brothers, sold its incredible events to the audience by claiming it was based on a "true story". After they won the Academy Award, the Cohen Brothers admitted this was a lie, and the story was fiction. But the movie was so darn cute the audience forgave them. Would they have forgiven them had they known the truth at the time? Would the audience have forgiven Billie Hayes for his stretching (breaking) of the truth in this film had they known it as the time? As a work of drama, it's effective.

		<shortDescription>The Message Is: "Don't Smuggle Hash Out of Turkey!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>British director Alan Parker depicts the traumatic ordeal of an American citizen seized for drugs in a Middle Eastern country whose laws make an example of him for the ills visited on them by U.S. Foreign policy in "The Midnight Express," (**** out of ****) one of the most powerful and important films of 1978, starring Brad Davis and John Hurt. According to the film's closing credits, on May 18, 1978, "Midnight Express" was shown to an audience of world press at the Cannes Film Festival . . . 43 days later, the United States and Turkey entered into formal negotiations for the exchange of prisoners. Initially, the Turkish government tried to prevent the film from being produced. Indeed, even after the "Midnight Express" came out, the Turkish government banned the film from being shown in theatres.Based on a bestselling autobiographical account by Billy Hayes, a tourist arrested in 1970 for trying to smuggle hash out of Turkey, the film traces Billy's descent into the hellish oblivion of Turkey's penal system and his miraculous escape. Not surprisingly, "Midnight Express" stretched the truth and even Billy Hayes has admitted that the filmmakers took advantage of dramatic license to heighten the dramatic impact of the material. As directed by Alan Parker and scripted by Oliver Stone, "Midnight Express" indicts Turkish law for its cruel, inhuman treatment of prisoners and celebrates Hayes' courage and will to survive. Billy expresses the film's theme: "the quality of mercy is measured in a society by its sense of justice.Briefly, American tourist Billy (Brad Davis of "Querelle") tries to smuggle $200 worth of hashish out of Turkey. The authorities catch him, however, during a routine search before he boards a commercial airliner, arrest him, and sentence him to prison. This sequence is pretty harrowing stuff. Six months later, Billy stands trial and receives a three-year sentence. The prison that they stick him in is a version of Hell on earth. With only 53 days left of his sentence, Billy learns to his horror that the authorities have scheduled a new trial for him. The sentence this time is life imprisonment commuted to 30 years. During his incarceration, Hayes befriends an Englishman, Max (John Hurt of "Heaven's Gate"), and a fellow American, psychotic Jimmy Booth (Randy Quaid of "The Last Detail"), and contends with one of the cinema's most sadistic villains, Hamidou (Paul L. Smith of "Red Sonja"), who loves to wield a paddle and beat the daylights out of unruly convicts. Undoubtedly, "Midnight Express" ranks Smith's most memorable role. You'll never forget the scene when the barrel-chested Hamidou marches out with a chubby little child clutching each hand to inflict torture on an unfortunate inmate. He snaps his head one way to remove the sweat from his brow and starts swinging with a vengeance. Imagine Bud Spencer of "Trinity" fame in a foul mood and you will get the picture.Parker and Stone have reconstructed the events of Hayes' book so they follow a logical progression. Otherwise, apart from two scenes, the film generally keeps the book intact. Those scenes include the movie's ending, which differs drastically from the book's ending. And there is a brutal fight scene in which a prison informer is killed and his tongue bitten out. Another slight difference is that the book had no central villain, but the film provides the sadistic guard Hamidou who beats prisoners on the feet with a two-by-four. Credit director Parker with vigorous, imaginative direction. There is not one bad minute in this exciting film. To enhance the realism of the action, Parker has shot it in semi-documentary style with occasional narration. The editing also deserves mention; much of the film had to be lensed outside of Turkey, and the filmmakers have smoothly integrated shots of Turkey with location shots made on the island of Malta.One of the best surprises in "Midnight Express" is Giorgio Moroder's electrifying music. He captures effectively the atmosphere of the film and the hostile Turkish setting. His use of pulsating music during an early chase when Billy tries to elude his captors exemplifies his great talent. "The Midnight Express" is not a film for the squeamish; the language is harsh and the content is frank with some homosexuality. One of the most depressing scenes occurs when Billy's girlfriend visits him in prison. A thick glass wall separates them. Billy begs her to press her breasts again the glass and he masturbates with one hand on the glass where her breast is flattened out and the other . . . while she cries in despair and humiliation. The finale when Billy tangles with the evil Hamidou will have you on the edge of your seat. If it has a fault, it may be that it is too reactionary and paints a biased view of Turkey. However, one that "The Midnight Express" makes painfully clear: when you're busted over there, you are in for the hassle of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a great movie but it's also VERY depressing...perhaps too depressing to recommend. Whether or not it's a "true" story doesn't really matter...director Alan Parker and screenwriter Oliver Stone have created a real work of art. Expertly cast Brad Davis is Billy Hayes, an American doing hard time in Turkish prison. Davis has just the right mix of hardness and vulnerability. The supporting cast is superb: Randy Quaid, Paul Smith (as the sadistic, nearly silent warden), and, best of all, John Hurt as a cat loving hash head. It's brutal, ugly and scary. The excellent music is by Vangelis. With Bo Hopkins, Irene Miracle as Davis's unlucky girlfriend and Mike Kellin as his father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For Billy Hayes 1970 was a horrifying year it was the year when he tried to smuggle 4lbs of hashish from Istanbul back to his home in America. It was the year when he was arrested at Istanbul airport, tried, and sentenced to eventually thirty years in a Turkish prison. For five years he suffered the filth, brutality and degradation of imprisonment in an environment of hellish squalor, while his family fought in vain to secure his release. Finally in desperation he made a daring escape bid and incredibly the bid succeeds. This is the astounding true story of Billy Hayes in living hell and of the harrowing ordeal to get out of there. Vivid, realistic and at times morbid, a classic story of survival and human endurance, told with touch of humour, intelligence and total honesty. Most of this film was made in Malta when i would say we were practically off the map because they even used our own language pretending it was Turkish at times. A great movie with master performances by Brad Davis and John Hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..difficult to enjoy..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I was fascinated with this movie when it was released, it truly WAS difficult to watch - the only enjoyment one could get from it is the strong comment on how inhumane humans can beI've read every comment - I understand the Turks' anger over the exaggerations and criticisms, however I suppose there are awful prisons like this all over the world. The point that ALL overlooked is, being in ANY jail for ANY reason is not a holiday. Turkey, because of human-rights violations has been refused Eurpoean Union participation for years: see the comment made by "Tillie Gokbydak". It's not the only nation guilty of that. It took many years for USA prisoners to win freedom by use of DNA. Although they are set free, no guarantee their life can pick-up where it took-off, almost impossible.AND - we are now hearing of human-rights violations by American troops in Iraq. This only proves the point that you cannot take very young men and women, turn them into dummies to "follow orders, no matter what", teach them to be killers and not expect them to kill - whether they were disposed to this crime or committed it out of anger. Now, tell me that any nation which had "colonies" wasn't guilty of being a tad ruthless. Has no one else heard stories that Turkey and other Mid-Eastern nations can be fanned to anger from ancient crusades over Christianity, fanned by influence from The Vatican? "Holy Roman Emperor" wasn't an empty title - "Rome" wanted revenge because the crusaders seldom won. We must consider those Mid-Eastern nations are much older than other nations.......they arne't dumb.However, I must inform you of an annual event that takes place in Los Angeles. Blocks apart, Armenians are still protesting - in large groups - over their genocide, and the Turks are protesting that they are protesting...."it ain't true". History will bear-out it is. The law-enforcement brigade for this protest is huge. But, nations today don't want to be shackled by their ancestors' foibles, and that is understandable. Think about African-Americans and slavery......I've never heard of a Turkish Mafia, but there is an Armenian one....."Midnight Express" is a shockingly beautiful movie. One doesn't have to look extremely hard to see its message. True, Hayes was a criminal - I agree with those who make that point. My question is how he thought he could get past customs in the USA ? Double-dumb, don't you think? The true story is just as many have discovered, being in such a degrading atmosphere for many years is enough to make anyone insane. I think Brad Davis' acting was brilliant - I knew him.....he was a very nice man with a lot of humility, trying to be successful in his career, cut-down by AIDS. That should tell you a story - he was bisexual. The prisoner who wanted to make love to him WAS his friend - they did exercises to keep sane, together. I don't think Davis would have objected had that scene progressed to sexuality. For those who commented on rape in prisons, it is seldom one-on-one: it involves a gang. We must be truthful and also admit that sexual repression will cause heterosexual prisoners - or soldiers - to "use" what is available.I also read the book, and agree that it wouldn't have made a very good movie, as written. We tend to forget that movies are seldom factual, as many commentators have written. Too dull - we wouldn't enjoy them....movies are an escape from realism, or can make very important statements. No one should be overly influenced by their plots - it's wonderful to become engrossed in a film, but it's going to end....no matter what impression you get, let it end.Commentator "Egozalan" from Turkey confirms Turkish prisoners were brutalized. It is fact that Turkey imprisoned 20,000 political victims. Every country is guilty of that. "Midnight Express" expresses how the frailty of the human body and emotions can stand only so much. Although it took half of the film for Hayes to come to that victimization, there is little doubt that Davis played the role with conviction. How we would like for humans to treat one another doesn't always happen - we are too naive.As for the other actors, I think they all were brilliant - Randy Quaid was the kook he was supposed to be, no matter what he stole (same guy in "Brokeback Mountain"?). Paul Smith must have done some deep research to make his role so brutal. John Hurt delivers total devotion to any role he has done. Mike Kellan's father broke my heart for "if I could be where you are"; all parents suffer and grieve for their children in such circumstances. "Rifki" was a monster. Whatever language those supposedly Turkish actors were speaking is of little importance, but their acting was just as brilliant as the featured players: they did their job by convincing us. More than any other reason, the film was made to make money - good-ole American capitalism.....if Hayes didn't realize his book would be cannibalized, then HE was naive. He took the money and ran, whether it came from Armenians or Hollywood........and we must admit there are films denigrating Americans. We have to accept that.....they are films. The Mid-East is centuries older than we are - it was the seat of civilization, so you may ponder those people were our ancestors, too.I gave this movie a 10, although it is near torture to watch. If you thought it was trash, watch it again - perhaps you'll discover things you missed the first time. Bravo for Davis !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembered seeing this movie in the 80s. That was when I was around 10 or so. (Oh yeah, I do remember movies. Already been watching epics like GANDHI and OUT OF Africa when my other friends were still watching those M.A.S.K. and Transformers cartoons).Anyway, this film was screened at a local community club. At first it was like any other regular movie but the airport scene started to get a little harsh. Having Bille Hayes ended up getting caught by the authorities, that was pretty uneasy I might say. The film got even harder to swallow when Hayes was thrown to prison. In there, his life was really miserable. He had to endure all those hardship. I was like saying to myself, "Get out, Dude. You don't belong here". Throughout his life in prison, I couldn't bear to see Hayes getting tortured even more. If I were him, I'd find any means necessary to get out.All in all, this movie does deserve all those accolades and good reviews. Alan Parker did a great job. The music too was so incredibly moving. At last when Bille Hayes finally got out of prison, that was such a relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie quite a few times, since we were kids (seems like hundreds of years ago!), and have always enjoyed it, especially as a lot of it was made in Malta, where I'm from. Yes, that's the tiny island in the Mediterranean. I keep reading reviews about how the Turkish prison and people don't sound realistic enough, it's because most of the extras were Maltese, and are in fact speaking Maltese. The prison is a wartime fort, again, in Malta. It doesn't make much of a difference for English speaking people, as it all sounds the same, but as some Turkish people have pointed out, some of it doesn't sound Turkish. I hope this doesn't spoil anything for anyone, as it's still a great movie, sad yet still enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The criticisms concerning the political correctness of this film don't really concern me. PC is not something that I knew anything about when I first saw this film as a teenager, nor now as an adult concerning matters between the USA and Turkey.This is a story about a guy who tries to smuggle a couple of kilos of dope but without planning events or thinking about the consequences too well. He gets caught and the engrossing story ensues.There are all sort of moments in this film that will stick with me forever. The terrible pronunciation of the name 'William Hayes' by the Turkish official trying to write it down; the very affecting role by brilliant John Hurt; the corrupt prison warden and his obese, wobbling along kids; the excruciating but almost funny "s'il vous plait" pleading at his girlfriend to reveal her breasts in the private interview booth; the very dislikeable mental patient and his comments about being broken machines and not knowing that they're broken. Memories that are ingrained in my mind forever.The film looks and feels a bit grainy by today's standards and maybe some of the prison conditions are no longer up-to-date or relevant, but the story relates a series of events that any one of us could have found ourselves in if we had made the same misguided decisions in the past. After the initial airport arrest, events start to spiral downwards, at first clinging to hope that release would be imminent, getting legal counselling and paying bribes to reduce the sentence from smuggling to mere possession, ultimately leading to life incarceration, giving up on life itself and leading to madness.The friends gained along the way, including the decision not get involved in gay activities, the attempts to escape and the enemies made in certain quarters are a fundamental part of this terrific tale.It's in my list of 20/30 favourites, I guess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alan Parker's "Midnight Express" tells the story of Billy Hayes, a young American imprisoned in Turkey for a drug-smuggling offence. Conditions in the prison are deplorable and the machinery of justice is slow to move in his favour. Considering this state of affairs, Hayes begins to eye escape as his only chance for freedom.The film is based on a true story but Parker freely acknowledges that several adjustments were made in the process of adaptation. Not being familiar with the actual events, I found the proceedings to be realistic in spirit and not having the feel of Hollywood fakery.That being said, Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning screenplay does venture into hyperbole from time to time. Luckily, the few missteps are made up for by as many (if not more) memorable scenes. Also, while the script is often bashed for showing a one-sided view of the Turks, I think that any level-headed individual will recognize that this film is not meant as an indictment of the Turkish people in general.When it comes to the acting, the standout is John Hurt, who collected his first Oscar nomination for his supporting performance. Surprisingly, leading man Brad Davis was passed over for his performance, though he did snag Golden Globe &amp; BAFTA nominations. As for the rest of the cast, Randy Quaid is a bit of a weak link but the majority of the cast is dependable.Alan Parker's Oscar-nominated direction is impressive but the film's distinctive look may owe as much to Michael Seresin's attractive cinematography. Meanwhile, Giorgio Moroder's electronic score ended up winning an Oscar but timeless it is not.In the end, "Midnight Express" delivers a satisfying viewing experience despite not completely finding its groove until roughly the halfway point. After 30+ years it holds up well, with little besides the Moroder score to betray its age.</fullReview>

As I read about the movie I concluded as others have, that this movie isn't based entirely on reality. The author himself has said the movie has little to do with what actually happened to him. Yeah, it's a bit racist against the Turks as well. Yet, it's a movie and you have to accept that this isn't the true story at all. Based on these criteria I would say that this is a very decent movie but it's not exactly great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a relevant story. I also read the book. Yes there are some stereotypes and some truly haunting scenes in the prison. The effects are there. The starkness and horrific conditions of the prison are visually indelible.Sympathy for the character? Well, you may have more if you read the book. Mike Kellin portrays Hayes' father, a world weary insurance salesman from NY who will do whatever he can to get his son out. The problem is that international law has no application here. Hayes has committed a crime of drug smuggling in Turkey, it will take more than an American attorney or even the embassy to protect Billy Hayes.Brad Davis is very good as Billy, John Hurt a the resident drug addict (rather annoying and hard to understand, mumbling alternate lines). Randy Quaid also as another imprisoned American. Overall it is an interesting, if depressing story and cautionary tale. One which people should take heed of, before traveling. When you are in a foreign country, you follow their laws, as being a tourist will not protect you. Recommended if you are up for this type of story. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One word completely describes this film. Powerful! The movie itself tells the painful and disturbing story of young American Billy Hayes who, in 1970, was convicted of being in possession of one kilogram of Hashish while attempting to leave Turkey. Billy is made an example for others by the Turkish High Court, and is subsequently sentenced unjustly to thirty years in a hellish Turk prison.Alan Parker's shocking film, based on a true story, uses powerful drama and extremely effective imagery to both hold you in and consistently hit you hard. Brad Davis is spot on as the desperate Billy, and John Hurt amazes with his talent and versatility. It all makes for a must see film.Wednesday, June 19, 1991 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At times gut-wrenching prison drama from UK director Alan Parker, director of 'Birdy' later on, about an American's gauntlet in Turkey's justice system. Surrounded by heated debate over its way of dramatizing the original book and consequently over the film-makers' motives. In other words, this is great film-making at the expense of accuracy in the portrayal of what happened and at the expense of hurting Turkish national feelings.(You may find a minor spoiler in this paragraph, suggested rather for those in the know.) In my view, the main message of that most controversial part of the movie is that while it is neither right, nor wise to talk at a Turkish court about how, unlike you, Jesus (?) might forgive the 'nation of pigs' you name Turks to be (especially since they aren't, of course), you might consider doing just that after spending a couple of years in a Turkish prison (and that prison term of yours should be in the 1970s, for that might make a difference). So the film-makers' point is: under the circumstances you might do things that are not right. Trivial, isn't it? Too trivial, I think, for it to generate all the 'we, this'-'you, that' talk seen on message boards. Just think of how the Turkish judge even apologizes to a degree for the sentence he has to read out after the above cited remarks that could be very offending to him. The judge understands what Hayes is going through and why he is saying what he is saying ? and the judge's character is the film-makers' creation. The rest of the changes to the original story are, I think, not a deliberate offense to, rather only ignorance of Turkish feelings.As far as circumstances in Turkish prisons are concerned, one certainly wouldn't be right in citing another movie such as Yilmaz Güney's 'The Wall' ('Duvar', 1983) as proof of anything, but its picture of Turkish prisons is no less brutal. As to what the situation is nowadays, if you're really interested, read human rights reports, judge for yourself.</fullReview>

It's a story of the price you pay for ignorance, in this case it's Billy Hayes' drug-smuggling. Some say that the speech to the judge is racist and crude but you have to realise his character had been subjected to harrowing punishment and cruelty. The performances by John Hurt and Randy Quaid are simply astounding. SPOILER Brad Davis gives it his all, none more so than in the scene where Rifki uncovers their escape bid slips into madness, destroying the plumbing while trying to get his hands on the traitor. Brad Davis deserved the Oscar for such a performance. Midnight Express is a brilliant film that explores the fragility of hope, courage and strength of the mind.

The sound design used to intensify scenes was a brilliant idea and the cinematography was great. Not to mention the acting from Randy Quaid was surprising, I guess he was good in his early years.The only bad thing I have to say about the movie is that the audience is dealing with a character, Billy, who did commit a crime, which can make it hard to root for him. So when the court changes his sentence after serving three years it almost feels like that is the director's only way in getting the audience to feel for the character. There was also a quick scene of homosexuality, which I thought the film could have done without, especially since the other character wasn't even one of Billy's close friends. Other than that it was a very engrossing movie from start to end.I just have to mention that there are two intense scenes that come out of nowhere and surprise you (trust me, you'll know them when you see them).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say that I am Turkish. But I will try to look on the film from the eyes of a few sides. If I were not Turkish and watched the film I would really feel that Turkey was a bad country and I hate Turkish people.. Because the film was shot so depressingly, and the scenes were so suffocating that there is no way that you cannot get affected by that.. I would have a lot of prejudice against Turks and the country and would never want to visit Turkish people maybe.. Because sometimes as people we tend to be prejudiced without trying to get information and some knowledge.. Now as a Turkish person having watched the film, I can say that I found it so judging and exaggerated.. The 1970s were not good years of Turkey maybe, maybe there were some violations of human rights but I don't think that it is up to this extent.. And what I found so bad in the film is that Turkish people are all dirty, ugly,wearing some king of black clothing and the sights are really bad..Is it real Turkey or is it the Turkey that is wanted to be shown to the world? Everybody knows that we are a developing country but we are not like that at all.. Yes, it is true some parts of Turkey are not developed and we have some uneducated people but not that much as shown in the film.. We look like you, we look like the others in the world.. I never see myself , my family, my friends, and as a teacher my students like the way it was represented in the film.. In order to make real judgment you should come and see this country, the people and the places... I think that's the best way to decide.. And I strongly recommend you to watch the interview with the real Bill Hayes and talking about the film, his experience, the Turkish prisons and etc.. You may change some of your ideas maybe..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm tired of reading about the injustices of this film. It's a movie. It's an exaggeration. You know.....you weren't there in Turkey actually spending thirty years in jail....so it's up to the director to convey the actual fear one might have felt. The dark portrayal of Turks in the film isn't to say to us, "hate the Turks," it's more about conveying that sense of homesickness and culture shock. If you watched this movie and were afraid of the Turks or felt hostile towards them, then you're probably the type who refused to swim in waters after Jaws came out. Basically you were an idiot, and this movie shouldn't have been made differently to accommodate you bastards. This piece of film is excellent, and is probably my favorite.By the way - they do show some Turks in a positive light if I'm not mistaken....isn't a lawyer sympathetic and hoping to help Hayes? Or one of the first Turkish interrogators who tells Billly he "shouldn't" be afraid? Or the Turkish judge who shows sympathy and tells Billy his "hands are tied," implying that he feels sympathy for Billie's unjust sentence? EVERY single Turk in a negative light my arse. Get over it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>S10 Reviews: Midnight Express (1978)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) is your average American kid in the 70's. Sex, drugs and rock n' roll are his lifestyle but his whole world comes crashing down when he is busted at the Turkish airport attempting to smuggle drugs out of the country. But his youthful indiscretion turns into a living hell as he becomes a game piece between two governments as he is forced to rot in the bowels of a Turkish prison. 'Midnight Express' is based on a true story. (Also stars: Irene Miracle, Bo Hopkins, Paul L. Smith, Randy Quaid and John Hurt)Thoughts: It's been said that the fact based 'Midnight Express' was an over-exaggerated account of the real events. But that doesn't stop the film from being in any way less powerful. This early Oliver Stone script (based off the book co-authored by the real Billy Hayes) lays out a powerful, social-political drama that nabbed Stone an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The fine musical score by Giorgio Moroder also won an Oscar (it also received nominations for Picture, Director, Film Editing and a Supporting Actor nod for John Hurt). The cast wonderfully do their parts with Brad Davis' first major role and John Hurt's role as one of Billy's prison friends. Alan Parker (Fame, Pink Floyd The Wall) shows us his knack of gritty film-making that he would use so effectively in the supernatural thriller 'Angel Heart'. "Midnight Express' is an excellent and superbly acted and written social drama. S10 rates it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An incredible movie, if you can see beyond blatant racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few other movies capture the amount of emotion as this film so successfully does. However, in the way the film villanizes the Turkish guards and public officials, it seems inherently racist. Sure, the events depicted in the film happened, but prisons in developing countries all over the world have similar or worse conditions. I am sure that what we are doing in Abu Garib and Guantanimo are far worse. If you can look at this film as a depiction of actual events that happen in countries all over the world, not just Turkey, this is an excellent movie.I would recommend this movie to anybody who is willing to endure a very disturbing depiction of "justice" in the third world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look guys. I definitely recommend this movie. It's one of the best ones I've ever seen. No kidding though I'm from Turkey.Surprised?You should be because as a movie this one deserves 9 out of 10. Well flip side of the coin is of course about my country. Don't take the junkies at the movie serious.Watch this as you watch Shawshank Redemption.This isn't and wasn't Turkey.I didn't even understand what those Turks(?) in the movie were saying. Ah yeah they were Armenians who tried to speak Turkish.Somethings may have happened 30 years ago in that prison but this is not different than what happened in Robert Redford's Brubaker.And what about the court scene in this one. "You Turks don't eat pig but you are all pigs, your food suck, let me .... all your people women blah blah blah" Nobody blamed American culture in prison movies. Nobody made any generalizations about any culture in any prison movie but this one. So, from a cultural standpoint this movie is nothing but a manipulation, provocation, scandal, illusion and a total lie.Mentioned earlier, watch this so-called true story as you watch Shawshank. You will simply love it. Do you know more than half of what was said it happened didn't really happen? Well, anyways, enjoy the ride! Again, fantastic movie, Hollywood at its finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best movies I've ever seen. Emotionally gripping. I really like the music. Very atmospheric. As I think about it, there were some great "movie faces" in the picture. What I mean is, faces with a lot of character and expression. Billy's Lawyer, his dad, the Turkish judges, the trustee, the sadistic guard, etc. It bothers me that the truth of the real story was distorted. Oliver Stone wrote the script, and I heard him say that sometimes things need to be changed for dramatic purposes. I believe him, but I also think it's used to convey a personal point-of-view. It's still a great film. I read that there's talk of doing a remake. I don't know if it's just rumor, but Hollywood is remaking EVERYTHING these days!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the average movie in the genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to movies about Americans who have been caught in some remote country and ended up in a filthy jail after they tried to smuggle drugs, I'm always very cautious. The main reason for that is because too often this kind of (TV-)movies tries too hard to show what a good guy the smuggler actually is and how bad and corrupt the people and the justice system in that particular country are, that a great injustice has been done to that poor man/woman, that this person didn't know that he/she was smuggling drugs because some bad guy switched bags without telling,... I'm very sorry, but I don't like that kind of drama's. It's not believable and it's my opinion that when you do the crime, you'll have to sit the time. However, I'm also convinced that not all movies in the genre are as bad as that and this "Midnight Express" may well be the best example to prove it.When the young American tourist Billy Hayes is about to return home from his holiday in Turkey with his girlfriend, he's caught smuggling drugs out of the country. The prosecutor wants to make an example of him and asks a life sentence, but thanks to some bribes and a lawyer who knows his way in the court rooms, he gets a much smaller sentence. However, the prosecutor isn't all too happy with that and goes into higher appeal. Because the government wants to set an example, they decide to change the previous four years of jail time - which he already has served except for 53 days - in at least thirty. Hayes isn't able to cope with that extra setback and starts to decent into complete insanity, also partially caused by the severe treatment given to him and his 'friends' by the jailers. Because he can no longer count on any opportunities for a swift release, he sees no other but to take 'the Midnight Express', which is jail-slang for escaping...If you are looking for some nice images about Turkey or want to learn something about its culture, its people,... than this isn't the movie that you are looking for. This certainly isn't a nice documentary about the country, but should be seen as some kind of warning to all people that think about smuggling drugs out of the (often Asian and / or Muslim) countries where they spent their holidays. If I read some other comments, than I get the feeling that this isn't alway very clear to some people. They believe that this movie doesn't show the real Turkey, that the country has a lot more to offer than what we see in this film. I couldn't agree more with that statement, but this is still a prison movie, showing prison life, not the daily lives of the ordinary Turks. This movie shows how drug smugglers were treated in Turkey in the 1970's and it has to be said that it does a good job. It has become a surprisingly powerful movie that isn't too corny or too black-and-white. Sure, it shows that life in a Turkish jail wasn't a pleasure (and for as far as we hear over here, still isn't - one of the reasons why they aren't allowed to the European Union is because they don't care all that much about human rights), but it also shows that Hayes wasn't just a victim. If he hadn't taped those drugs on his body, he would have been able to get out of the country as a free man. He chose to take the risk and he lost.Next to the interesting story, this movie is also worth watching for the very nice performances by Brad Davis, Paolo Bonacelli, John Hurt, Franco Diogene, Norbert Weisser,... They all did a very good job, lifting this movie even more above the average in the genre. Take for instance Franco Diogene. He's really excellent as the corrupt lawyer who can arrange something for a little price. The man does not only act like a real one, he also looks like such a lawyer. Really very nice.All in all this is an excellent movie for all those people who don't mind to see a not so nice view on Turkey and who are looking for something extra in the average court room / drug smuggling drama. I didn't expect it before watching this movie, but I really liked it. That's why I give this movie a rating of 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie last year when I rented the movie from Blockbuster.Elements of a decent movie is often excellently assembled and integrated into a great structure.But underlying logic of making a heroin transporter into an american hero who could escape from turkish prison with his great efforts was awful and ethically unacceptable.Whichever country you carry drugs you would be punished in a very bad way.Besides,people identified as turks in the movie even could not speak Turkish properly.They are the armenian people who speaks turkish as secondary language and were behaving so badly in order to give all world worst turk impression.Indeed,they succeeded that.Views of the istanbul and treatments of the turkish cops(although they are usually not nice) against people were totally imagination of the directors feelings combined with common prejudice against eastern countries.This great piece of art conflicts with its inner manipulated content.I wish we see both great art and great truth at the same time in a movie, but unfortunately with the influence of the lobbies and companies providing support for the movies, this seems very utopic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awfully bad scenario, awfully bad movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can hardly imagine that two great directors like Alan Parker and Oliver Stone started their careers with such an awful movie. If anybody thinks of watching this movie referencing these famous names, she will be greatly disappointed. This is a primitive prejudice show, made in order to humiliate the Turkish nation on purpose. 'Midnight Express' reminds me of a very similar movie called 'Arctic Heat' (Renny Harlin, 1986). However, 'Arctic Heat' is not used as an anti-propaganda movie against a whole nation. Just a simple example from the cast of 'Midnight Express': The parts of Turkish characters are played by actors (?!) who cannot speak Turkish properly at all. Anyway, they must be proud of serving their country by helping in an anti-propaganda movie against their biggest rival (whatever this means to them?!). Every single incident is hopelessly designed to prepare the audience to the judgement scene close to the end. In this scene, the poor American citizen bravely expresses his feelings about Turks in front of the Turkish judge. Undoubtedly (?!), the audience agrees with our hero in every word he says. Nevertheless, our hero as well as the director of the movie admitted years later that they did not reflect the facts and it was their fault to mislead the audience to such a prejudice against a nation. The movie is greatly exaggerated as a successful one. It is a total failure, not only due to its ill nature, but also because it is an awfully bad directed movie based on an awfully bad scenario.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the films ridiculously underrated on this site. This is more than just a (boring) classic movie. This is a milestone to all films that are going to depict human struggle in the environment where nothing human exists. I found this film more fascinating even than 'Shaw-shank Redemption' regarding many things. The latter even though made 20 years later is much more sweetened and it matches the seventies more than Midnight Express. On contrary, for the time made, Midnight Express is being served to the audience without any softeners never attempting to underestimate life in the place as Turkish Prison. Extremely direct and expressionistic this film is playing with your hope moving it up and down never underestimating a power of faith of one most likely lost individual. There is much more in that Turkish prison than just a jail, there is much more in movie hero than just a drug smuggler. Giorgio Moroder theme is more than excellent. 10 out of 10 for the work of art. Must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joey, have you ever been to a Turkish prison?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years after Midnight Express caused an international stir, Captain Oveur asked Joey this unforgettable question which always puzzled me until I saw this movie. Fortunately, I have never been to one, and I can honestly say that despite the comments on this site that they are the next best thing to Club Med, I am in no hurry to visit one!Which raises the question, how do all these Turkish commentators know that prisons and prison life in 1970s Turkey is not how it's depicted here? Either IMDb is populated with Turkish ex-cons or they don't know and are wrong (seeing that no one ever is freed from a Turkish prison). And if Billy Hayes was such a threat to the kind, gentle Turkish society and deserved a life sentence, why didn't the Turkish gov't deport him?I guess I could criticize the character development of the prison guards as shallow and one-sided. I am sure they had many redeeming qualities that if more fully explored would explain that the torture was just symptomatic of deeper, inner pain experienced as children.At any rate, I am sure Joey knew that Turkish prison guards and Captain Oveur's suggestion couldn't be any good, even without seeing this movie or reading IMDb comments from Turkish ex-cons!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FIrst of all, I think the context of where my criticism is coming from is important to know for those who read this. i have never been to prison but I have spent most of my life alone. The film was touching but was not very intense, and it should have been since it took place in a Turkish prison. In fact, I thought the prison wasn't bad at all. Not imprisoned in cells but something life a living apartment. The director or writer should have used more details to really give a feel for what the problems were at the prison because I wasn't bothered by the setting. The main character mentioned be lonely or something like that but that didn't seen effective either in communicating the feel of the prison. Only did the conditions seem radical later in the film when he is transfered. But up till that point it wasting striking me as a horrible experience. Other criticisms are the abrupt homosexual sequence and the 70's soundtrack. The story moved along well but the suddenness of the homosexual encounter was too abrupt and could have been built up better by the writer. Also, the music had it's strong moments but was also distracting sometimes because of the distinct outdated 70's tunes. But I wont say much about that because the 70's were awesome and it was a 70's movie. Too bad all the 70's songs don't last. Otherwise, the film was good and had enjoyable acting but still not enough character development.</fullReview>

When he's caught, the movie becomes an absolute prison nightmare. You can actually smell the rotting cells and unwashed people.

		<shortDescription>The greatest prison movie ... sublimated by an unforgettable score ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The iconic score from Giorgio Moroder still echoes the sound of an eternal moral battle between hope and desperateness, about standing against adversity, or dying slowly when the light of hope is weakening. And "Midnight Express" communicates these emotions through one of the greatest male performances ever, from Brad Davis, as Billy Hayes, a stranger in a hostile country.And this is the point to be cleared first, for intellectual honesty's sake. Till now, the movie is held responsible for having paved the way to a whole misconception about Turkish prisons in general and Turks more particularly (ironically, this is how the movie lurched so fast into Pop-Culture). But I don't think we should blame the film for having depicted a population in such an extreme way for two reasons. First, it's against the system more than the people. Secondly, dramatization is a key element, had the movie been more politically correct, it would have probably been less impacting without gaining more accuracy. Dramatization is affection : like many men thought twice before having a mistress, after they watched "Fatal Attraction", I'm sure the movie was a lesson to drug smugglers.And as ludicrous as it sounds, a sincere inaccuracy is better than a hypocritical tolerance. After all, aren't we all biased, too? And aren't the others? If you put the film into perspective, Turkey had a very bad reputation because of men like Billy Hayes, and he was chosen by destiny to take all the punishment, to set an example. Billy had to commit this mistake to realize that. And we put ourselves in his shoes, we follow Billy in the toilets where he desperately tries to hide his anxiety, we feel our heart beating as fast as his. Alan Parker's direction perfectly emphasizes the whole paranoid feeling, it's like we got so high everything became suspect. When the eyes of Billy betray him and the guards search him, we feel like carrying hashish too, then, when Billy raises his arms and the ring of guards point guns at him, we know the doors of a hellish journey have just been opened. The empathy between the viewer and Billy is so strong that from this point, both feelings are combined, including, the hate against the Turkish system.I insist on the word 'system' because Billy is indeed the scapegoat of a system where corruption and legality flirt together in an obscene masquerade, like the funny but meaningful image of a judge staring at a girl's sexy legs in the press room while Billy's is pleading for his cause. It's a crooked system disguising Billy's punishment as a victory in the war against drug smuggling. Billy accepts the punishment after a heart-breaking leaving scene with his father; he's ready to wait for four long years. He befriends Jimmy (Randy Quaid) a hot-headed American who's got only one thing in head, escape and Max, the English (John Hurt), a smooth talking, pot-smoker and detached intellectual. During this time, as I said, we ?as viewers- feel a strong attachment to Billy, we can't wait for him getting out of prison as we're embarked with him in the same hell. And we see Turkish people the way he does, yes, they are vile, and corrupted, but don't forget the movie sitting in the throne of IMDb's Top 250 doesn't feature the nicest warden and chief guard in the world either. Again, my point is to put things into perspective, Billy's hate is a reaction to the hostility aimed at him. Billy's considered as "Ayip", impure, from the start. We can't perceive the brutal Hamidou and the sneaky Rifki's with other eyes. This is the power of "Midnight Express", something I don't think any other prison movies achieved, making us feel exactly like the central character whose emotions are magnificently expressed through Moroder's unforgettable score, my favorite after "The Godfather"."Midnight Express" is definitely one of these films where the score and the story are inseparable: the iconic chase theme is like the rhythm of our own heart pounding as we're running with Billy. Also take the scene with the Swedish prisoner, despite the disturbing intimacy, the music helped me to empathize, to wonder how I would have handled these four years without expressing some feelings. Beyond the music, "Midnight Express" is one of these great cinematic achievements where everything is so perfectly combined we don't watch the film, we feel it. The prison's ugliness exudes from a beautiful cinematography and the hostility of Billy's world is so masterfully directed, you can feel the dirt on the beds, and smell the sweat of other prisoners, not to mention the perfect acting that made the realism of the story even scarier.The only element that seems to disturb is the script, but if the music is the heart of the film, the script is the soul. Yes, it's politically incorrect, yes after his sentence was extended to perpetuity, Billy delivered one of the most racist rants ever said, but this is not where the movie sinned: as I said, this is the movie's sincerity speaking. It's a gut wrenching speech, because this is not Billy talking, this is the desperation of someone who's got nothing to lose, who played the game and lost it. And more than that, this is Billy's turning point from which, he and Jimmy and Max will try to catch the Midnight Express, the metaphorical train leading to freedom, while they are already standing on a less imaginary stairway to hell, preparing Billy for one of the most chilling, and realistic descents into madness, ever portrayed in film. So sad, such an amazing actor and promising career had to leave us so soon."Midnight Express" transcends its setting, and sublimates any critical aspect into an intense story about the power of human spirit struggling in a hostile environment ... a misunderstood masterpiece, the greatest prison movie, and one of the best of the 70's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harrowing and powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Loosely based on the true story of Billy Hayes (collected from his book of the same title), Alan Parker's "Midnight Express" contains some of the most effective and rightly iconic scenes in all of film history -- the opening with the heartbeats devoid of any soundtrack; the "Oh Billy!" segment; and of course the entire idea of Turkish prisons being terrible and abusive.Hayes' story was elaborative to begin with and Oliver Stone -- not exactly one to be known for sticking close to the truth -- exaggerates it even more; so far, indeed, that it almost becomes fictional. The real Hayes had no girlfriend, was not raped in jail, DID have a homosexual relationship with another inmate (the film shows him denying the advances), and escaped at night by sea.However, as a film this is probably one of the great motion pictures of the 1970s. Parker ("Angel Heart") is a brilliant visual director and uses much of the same imagery he would use later on in his career. For example, take note of the fans in the sweltering heat inside the courtroom. They'd be used again in "Angel Heart." Brad Davis gives a wonderful performance and convincingly devolves from a naive American student to a crazy lunatic by the time he enters the insane asylum. John Hurt's performance was also worthy of its Oscar nomination.Overall, this is very much a product of its time -- it's depressing, bleak, and almost painful to watch; and because it's a Stone screenplay, there's a lot of politics at play. However, the overall film is breathtaking, thrilling and unpredictable (to a point) -- it's definitely worth seeing at least once in your lifetime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a child when I first saw this movie, and I wasn't remember the movie much, except exaggerated scenario about Turkish people. Then I watched this movie a few weeks ago, again. I was shamed and got nervous because of this movie, a product of a racist mentality. Turks have been shown as wild tribes, and even the best Turk is as good as a pig! Indeed, the whole walk-ons and main characters are Armenian or something. Anyway, the atmosphere of the movie is gloomy and depressing, but Billy Hayes and his friends in prison had a good performance. But in conclusion; i didn't like and didn't enjoy the movie. I sometimes laughed at most of Turkish portraying. This movie is a product of a racist mentality and full of stupid fiction...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, But Stereotyping and Not Completely True</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a book by William Hayes, we follow him, as played by Brad Davis, on his trip into a Turkish prison and his eventual escape. Alan Parker does a wonderful job directing, and, from an artistic point of view, Oliver Stone wrote a truly good and unique script.There are some problems, though. Hayes himself said some time after this film that most of the bad things that happened to Davis in the film never happened to him. One of the guards was mean to them, and he got in a fight with another prisoner in his first week, but that was it. Stone greatly exagerated the truth here, although if you've seen anything else Stone has done, you know that's normal for him.This is also very stereotyping. The real Hayes was not a racist, and even though there aren't many gay people in Turkey, it isn't banned. All the Turkish characters are also ugly and mean; they could have at least made one of his cell mates to humanize them a bit. Turkish prisons are also no as bad as this; to get a more accurate picture, see Yol (1982).Regardless, this film is a classic and enjoyable if you're not Turkish. The acting is superb, and Peter Jeffrey as Ahmet is fantastic in his cameo. The film is done well, we're with Billy all the way (he broke the law, but suffered far too much for it), and the fight scene with Billy and Rifki is the most realistic and violent fight scene in the history of film in any country, ever. That fight scene will haunt me at night for the rest of my life.</fullReview>

They are the most generous people for their guests in the world. They treat very well to Tourists or foreigners. How can a film blame a nation for untrue things. Even the director of the film came to Turkey last year. He welcomed by a minister of the Turkish government. He stayed and welcomed by also Turkish media. The Turks didn't get the revenge from the director. The director said that he really regrets shooting Midnight Express in this content. He said"If I knew the Turkish people are how they are nice, I wouldn't make this film". Please don't watch this film. Sincerely yours.</fullReview>

I mean you are convinced by what you saw. Turks are bad. Why? How can you comment on a guy without knowing him? In conclude I recommend you that please don't believe what they said, research for yourself. And believe in what you want to believe than. Apart from that it is a good movie.

		<fullReview>Midget hippy gets caught at Istanbul airport attempting to smuggle out a ton of hash. Film details his time spent in prison paying off his debt to Turkish society.What is with Alan Parker? I don't understand this movie. The guy gets busted for smuggling hash in a Muslim country, and this film is played for sympathy? Things must have been a lot looser when this was made. Granted, Turkish prison conditions can't be the best, that much I'm sure is true. Yet it would seem simple to honor their laws and stay out of one. Its like jaywalking at a drag race. The film takes the stance that because he's an American he should receive some sort of special treatment? Gimme a break. And all the offensive anti- Turkish rhetoric that runs throughout the movie, wheeew! Alan Parker these days I would bet the ranch is a multi-cultural fanatical nutjob and must be justifiably embarrassed by this piece of work that looks down the elitist Western snob nose at the cultural differences between East and West at virtually every turn. Even when this guy is in jail, he lives to score more hash. Then we are supposed to hate the prison lackey who rips him off? Hash is not addictive folks, and wouldn't you want to maybe take the good behavior route? Parker makes watchable movies. This is extremely well made, if not legendary. But I abhor the absolute nonsensical message. I love his speech to the tribunal. Its so whacked out there, it sums up the whole thing.</fullReview>

Plus, before that movie, I had watched the incredibly great 'SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION', and didn't get any racist ideas about Americans at all. So, if you wanna see a real movie, with real things&amp;a real story, then go and rent SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION immediately, and forget about the movie which is our case here.

The movie was produced by two fanatical Armenians who hate the country. And the fact that is not as famous as the movie is that in 1981, Oliver Stone and Billy Hayes himself gave a press conference in which they have said that they have exaggerated the story.

There are many known occasions around the world (and in USA) where people pass years in prisons for the crimes they have not committed.In the movie, things about Turkey are totaly fictitious. They did'nt even try to find a real Turkish name for one of the important characters."The Turks" say meaningless things, with an awful language that is NOT Turkish.For me the movie is a "Much ado about nothing!".

		<shortDescription>as a story and emotional experience in and of itself, it's depressing, manipulative, and highly charged drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been to Turkey, or Istanbul, and I can hold no claims as to what it must be like for a person, American or otherwise, to endure time in one of their country's prisons. But the job of the filmmaker is not necessarily to get the facts down pat and present them as such. It's to present a story and make it appropriate for the dramatization. Oliver Stone, who wrote the script for this and went on to controversy in bringing the true story of Jim Garrison's trial of Clayshaw, Morrison's life with the Doors, and the late president Nixon, knew at 31 that taking what was in the source and bringing it to a life that any audience could understand emotionally was what was important. And he, along with director Alan Parker, deliver this with conviction, if not greatness. The story of William Hayes is ugly, as depicted in the film, and despite the fact that the real Hayes has said the depiction of some of the characters in the film is not as it was, it does not deter it for myself in the pure emotional intake.The story at first does not sound like it will have a happy outcome- Hayes (Davis, a shattering, torn performance) tries to smuggle Hash for friends back on long island, gets caught, and is thrown in jail 'as an example' among others in a Turkish prison. He's abused, and witnesses multiples abuses of prisoners young and old, and once he realizes he won't get out nearly as soon as he thought, he and a couple of other prisoners (Randy Quaid and John Hurt, both superb in supporting roles), plan to escape, or rather 'take the midnight express'. What occurs from there is what makes up the bulk of the drama, the hurt, and a 'version' of the truth in the Turskish prison system.The thing to keep in mind in dealing with a film like Midnight Express, is that in cinematic terms, Parker and Stone pull off their goals whether or not they depict the 'truth' to its fullest extent. They follow the book, and on that count they try their best to bring an adaptation. From that end, I found that it was compelling, if at times almost too heavy and, oddly enough, masochistic. But what comes through strongest, after the outright point of view of the script, are the performances. Hurt is one of only several truly convincing screen junkies in movie history. The actor that plays the burly guard in the prison is absolutely terrifying. And Quaid and Hayes fill their roles finitely. The music, ironically to me, is the one Oscar-winning drag, which sometimes adds pre-80's sounding music that doesn't fit as maybe it could've. But besides that, Midnight Express is overall a work of concentrated drama, that tries to not affect just the American collective conscious, but the world's as well. Years from now, people who have no idea what the prison system in that country or others was like, can at least have an idea, if not altogether to the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Drug Trafficking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Hayes is a dumb American man trying to make a fast buck, thinking he can get away with murder. How could anyone take the chance of smuggling the drugs taped around his belly? How stupid could this guy be, acting in such an uncool way, as he appears so nervous going through passport control? He was a dead give away, as we see him perspiring profusely in front of the local authorities. It's unfortunate that some people see Billy Hayes as a hero, when he is nothing but a misguided young man trying to capitalize on what he thought was the perfect scheme.What happens to Billy Hayes is chronicled by English film maker Alan Parker. He, and his screen writer take the main idea of the book and change it to give us a horror story, and in the process, he makes the fatal mistake in thinking that by giving the viewer a glance about what Billy has to endure in prison doesn't fit the crime he committed.Mr. Parker and his main collaborator, Oliver Stone, have created a film that has the tone of a documentary; the emphasis is on the cruelty experienced in prison. Actually, the director and the screen play, place the blame in the Turkish prison system, but actually, they succeed in making a hero of this idiotic man.Hayes was a coward and an opportunist who believed he would be able to get away with his crime without being made accountable for it, as he would get a profit from the sale of the drug. Mr. Hayes never took into account what he was doing or that the drug he was smuggling would do to other people. He deserved much more time in prison, or if he was going to deal in drugs, he would have been better off doing it in his own country, where maybe, with the help of a power attorney, he wouldn't even have served time for his crime.While the film makes thrilling film making, it's not realistic at all. Look at how the inmates live within prison. Compared to other countries, life in that prison was not so bad! The prisoners can get food from outside, pay their way for basic necessities; it was almost like living in a flea bag hotel in a foreign country.Brad Davis makes a puzzling Billy. At times, he is up to the task, but at others he is not convincing, in my humble opinion. The multi national cast is excellent. Much of what goes in prison is depicted in full detail.Perhaps "Midnight Express" made a better impression when it came out than right now. It's still worth a look at it and to watch it as a thriller, but nothing to do with reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good movie, but did they have to demonize an entire nation?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me say that I think this is a very good movie--riveting, controversial, thought-provoking. I've seen it a couple of times, and I've never been able to forget it.Brad Davis gives one hell of a performance, and much of the success for the movie goes to him. He had to take an unsympathetic character--a drug smuggler, albeit an extremely amateurish one--and make him sympathetic, and he does so. Oliver Stone deserves some credit here too, since he wrote the script, and successfully characterizes Billy's smuggling as the foolish mistake of a callow young man rather than the plot of an evil mastermind.The film challenges its viewers to care about some unappealing people, and to watch them persevere through some harrowing experiences. It raises questions about crime and punishment, the possibility of redemption, and what the human spirit can endure. It's too easy to think the film is only trying to say "don't get involved with drugs" or "Turkey is evil". There are much bigger questions being raised here.That said, I remember being aware during my first viewing that there were no sympathetic Turkish characters, and that the entire country was being portrayed in a light so dim you'd be hard-pressed not to bump into your own prejudices. American movies have never been good at portraying Middle-Eastern cultures positively. I can't think of one that does, in fact. Yet even the most simple-minded movies of recent years take steps to portray at least one sympathetic foil to the villainous culture of the piece (True Lies comes to mind). Oliver Stone, however, never does that here, and it's what keeps the movie from being great. I don't know what there is in Stone's history that made him hate Turkey so much, and maybe I don't want to know. I've been to Turkey, and loved the country and its people; I fully intend to go back there one day. I found most Turks to be overwhelmingly friendly, gregarious, and open of both mind and heart--especially outside the bustle of Istanbul. Turkey is one of the most forward-looking and liberal of the Arab nations, and prides itself on that fact. No, it's not perfect--their persecution of the Kurds particularly rankles--but no nation is. I'm not proud of my own country's record when it comes to aboriginal rights, for example. Frankly, the movie would have been much MORE successful had it shown that even in such a welcoming and friendly country, the worst side of human nature can still emerge--especially in the dark crevices of society which few people care to examine, such as the prison system. Do you really think similar abuses don't take place in American or Canadian prisons? Come on.I can still watch and enjoy this movie (although I'm not sure "enjoy" is really the right term, but anyway...). But only if I shut out its demonization of all things Turkish--which is, of course, not entirely possible. I recommend it, but watch it with a very necessary grain of salt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong in many areas, but it's Brad Davis' excellent performance that really sticks in your mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Express follows the true story of college student Billy Hayes (Brad Davis) who ends up imprisoned in a brutal Turkish prison after he attempts to smuggle drugs out of the country.Midnight Express was good on many levels, but I'll begin with Brad Davis; his acting performance in this film was superb - from the beginning when he's just an everyday cocky college punk, to him having to toughen up and adapt to the brutal way he's treated in prison, to then seeing him deteriorate and become more and more disillusioned was tough to watch, but also very realistic. Davis handled his character well and managed to be convincing across all the various stages of the narrative. There is a scene later in the film involving his girlfriend which was so touching and harrowing and further demonstrated Hayes' desperation. That scene really touched a nerve with me.Davis is well supported by the likes of Quaid and Hurt (although Hurt was particularly good in his respective role). Their characters become friends with Hayes and once Hayes is introduced to their characters the meaning of the title 'Midnight Express' soon becomes obvious.Those of a nervous disposition should be careful when watching this film as there are some scenes in this film that are quite tough to watch. In fairness though, the brutality isn't over the top and some of these scenes are shown off camera. I think that the writers did enough to show the brutality of the prison without being excessive or seemingly revelling in the violence. The balance was just about right.Despite the fact that Hayes was a criminal, I still found that I could identify with him and actually found him to be a fairly likable individual. There's no condoning what he did, but I just saw him as a na?ve young man who was just out to try and make a quick buck back in the States. He stated that he was only going to sell the hash to his friends so it's not like he was a major drug kingpin. I was worried that I wouldn't care for his character because he was a criminal, but I did care and I could see that he wasn't a bad person deep down.All in all, Midnight Express is a wonderful film that is harrowing, moving, brutal and there are also some wonderful acting performances (notably from Hurt and Davis). Definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Journey into the heart of brutality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Billy Hayes was just an American, trying to get home to his family. He and his girlfriend were vacationing in Turkey for a while. But, Billy decided to smuggle hashish out of the country. Before he boards the plane, he is stopped by the Turkish airport police and is caught with the hashish, strapped onto his stomach and body. This is only the beginning of a story that is filled with spellbinding terror and sheer bravery. Midnight Express tells that kind of story. The movie is based on the real-life Billy Hayes, who was caught smuggling hashish across the border from Turkey. Risking his life and his dignity, he tries to escape from the authorities, but fails. Knowing that he will face the consequences, Hayes is sentenced to prison for 4 years. In those 4 years, Hayes suffers through a series of unflinching, excruciating torture. When his parole is denied, Billy decides to escape from prison with the help of two other fellow prisoners. The movie has an amazing array of great performances by Brad Davis, who plays Billy Hayes, and also John Hurt as the Englishman, who's befriends Hayes during his prison sentence. Randy Quaid also plays a supporting role in the movie as Hayes' other fellow prisoner. Quaid is spectacular, showing us that his star power is expanding since his supporting role in The Last Detail.The only performance that I really cared a lot was Brad Davis. Davis is a newcomer in the film industry at that time during the making of this movie and he is very convincing as Billy Hayes. Whenever he was placed under such extreme violence, I cared more about his survival and especially his willingness to escape from this hellish prison. Since Davis is new to all of us, that's very important to the movie because it creates authenticity for the story. If Davis was not cast in the movie, then the movie would've never been effective as it is now. Most movies tend to star big-name actors because the director or producer thinks that we can relate to these big-name stars as realistic characters. Sometimes that does worked. But, here, the acting is very effective and honest.The music score by Giorgio Moroder is also effective since the music doesn't have a triumphant orchestral feeling to the movie. Moroder's score illustrates a world that's filled with danger and hostility. His synthesized music score is well done and like the acting, it brings something new to the table. When audiences listen to certain music scores in movies, they tend to listen to something that can coincides with the look of the movie. Here, the score is played directly toward the audience's involvement. Imagine if you were put inside this movie. This score would never been done if it wasn't for the acting and also, the story.Midnight Express takes us into a world where the only thing that can keep you alive in a world of hurt is bravery. Some people might think that sympathizing with Billy Hayes is something that we all can't do. What I say to that is place yourself in this environment. How would you feel if you had to undergo such extreme torture? What would you do? Would you escape? Or would you embraced the harsh brutality of human despair? That's what makes Midnight Express great. It's honest about human nature. Hayes isn't just a typical movie hero. He is a everyday person who's makes the fatal mistake of smuggling drugs. His story is so emotional and shattering that we really understand what he's going through. The movie is played for sympathy. We can care for him or despise him for his actions. But, the true heart of the story is the willingness to move on and go where your instincts tells you.One thing that I would like to say is I didn't care about was the representation of Turks as being bad people. I know that isn't true. Similar to The Deer Hunter, where the critics blasted it for portraying the Vietnamese as killers and racists, Midnight Express tells a honest story about human nature in a sub-ordinate environment. People do get hurt both physically and emotionally by other people. Just because they hurt people doesn't make them bad people. The movie isn't just a routine prison movie. The movie is about a human story. This is the same set-up with The Deer Hunter. It isn't just a war story. It's a human story. That is a big misunderstanding. The violence in Midnight Express is not glorified in any way. The scenes that showed the torture is very well-directed by Alan Parker. Parker, at certain times during the movie, cuts away from the brutal sadistic activities. With his idea of turning away from the violence, we can actually see what it would look like. But, I'm glad he didn't overboard with the torture scenes. I know that people might think that the scenes involving the violence is too much to handle. Some might say that it's over the top. I believe that the violence illustrates the Turkish prison as Hell. It paints a unhappy world of cruel people who do inhumane activities to others. Yet, it isn't glorification. It's honesty. And that what makes this movie worth watching. It's the craftsmanship of what movies are all about. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly vivid and powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "Midnight Express" again after many years, and I understand why it stayed with me over the years. This is a very powerful story of pain, endurance, injustice, and the human will to survive. Reviewers who are angry about the portrayal of the justice system in Turkey MISS THE POINT. I have heard very wonderful things about Turkey and people I know who have traveled there loved the country and the people. Whether this young man is telling a completely truthful, objective story about his treatment in prison in Turkey or not, the point is that this movie is a work of art, and a GREAT WORK OF ART. The acting is awesome, as are the sets, the costumes, dialogue, photography and the action.Nobody is defending drug smuggling here, the movie is showing how unfairly this particular young man was treated because the punishment he received far outweighed his crime. And the focus is on this young man's struggle to stay sane, deal with his loneliness, sexual desires, and fears. Brad Davis is perfectly cast in this role. The focus is also on other prisoners and their struggles. The character played by John Hurt is particularly compelling and pathetic, and Hurt's acting is top notch.I highly recommend this film. It is, of course, not easy to watch at times, but well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Engaging Thriller.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American citizens traveling overseas to certain destinations can be assured of hardships and hassles...this was true even prior to the hi-jacking days. Those who were dealing in drugs and contraband were really living dangerously. In some countries it is a death sentence merely to be caught with such contraband. The facts about Hayes are not fully explained as to his motives...we can assume that it was financial motivation. That, coupled with his inexperience and his up-bringing in what was still sheltered middle or upper middle class America at that point in time, kicked in to make his downfall all the more difficult. He is busted with hash at the airport as he leaves Istanbul. His girlfriend travels on to her destination, and spreads the bad news to the family at home. This film was, at the time, one of the first of the realistic prison shockers, knocking down the old images of Cagney and Bogart, and replacing them with as near to the real world as would be permitted by the censors in the late 1970s. Prison life is no game in America...and in Istanbul it appears to be almost completely Darwinian. A four year sentence gets overturned, and is replace by a 30 year sentence. By then, Hayes and his cohorts feel they have nothing to lose by trying to escape, and they almost succeed...until they are turned in by one of the snitches. Hopes are consistently raised, and dashed, and raised again, and dashed again. Finally Hayes manages an escape...one that I will not spoil in case there are late arrivals to this film, like myself. It is a bit hard to follow, and you must pay close attention. They speak in what appears to be Turkish dialect in many of the scenes and not all scenes or sentences are well translated, so you must use your powers of deduction to realize what is happening at certain points. But it is power packed, and is a film well worth seeing, though if you let your kids watch it, be there to help them along...or maybe in today's world, some parents may need to have the kids watching with them so that the kids can make an accurate social assessment. Either way, see the film. It is more of worthwhile watch than I first imagined.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Just another prison movie'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not the biggest fan of prison films (apart from the masterful Shawshank Redemption.) They all seem to be the same, do a crime, go to prison and then escape. Midnight Express is no exception to this.The film is based on the true story of Billy Hayes who was sent to prison in Turkey for trying to smuggle drugs back to America. Billy gets caught at the airport and taken to prison, the story is very predictable from there, you seem to no what's going to happen next which takes all sense of mystery and suspense out of the film. Billy suffers four years inside the torturous prison and is about to be released when his parole is denied. Billy gets angry and with persuasion from his other inmates he decides to catch the 'MIDNIGHT EXPRESS' (prison code for escape.)Further on in the film after Billy's failure to escape he is sent to another prison for the criminally insane, from there he goes on to escape. For me the film ended rather suddenly and I felt very unfulfilled and disappointed. Its a nice movie to watch but in the end its 'just another prison movie' and when watching it don't be expecting anything different. The film is rated 18 with scenes of nudity and vivid violence!Its worth a watch sometime but 'its nothing to write home about.' I am giving this film a 6 out of 10.Sam Micel</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I just don't see how this movie pictures only Turks bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, as a native speaker I should say that no Turkish dialog makes any sense in this film.My review will be relatively short. I just want to tell that I really do not understand how R&#x131;fk&#x131; is the most hated character in the movie, the plot goes like this (no spoiler though, it's not very important) First they burn R&#x131;fk&#x131;'s money for no good reason, and when R&#x131;fk&#x131; tries to get his revenge by simply blaming one of them with smuggling, the HERO beats the hell out of R&#x131;fk&#x131; and even though R&#x131;fk&#x131; doesn't come back at him he goes after R&#x131;fk&#x131; and rip his tongue off with HIS TEETH! That is how one pictures the Turks bad, right?Sincerely, I don't see where the exaggeration is. I mean, I know torture isn't very humanistic but it is everywhere, apart from the cultural mistakes in the plot, it seems very realistic to me. But I don't see how beating one's feet is so extreme that everyone starts hating Turks. Of course it is a terrible thing to torture, but torture is also a fact and hell, 35 years ago from now, every single country must have some dishonour like these. And about the torturing scenes, they are not worse than Shawshank Redemption's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An undying classic of hell behind the bars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some shockingly bad reviews here, in my opinion, Midnight Express still remains a great movie, an unforgotten classic. There's no way around, saying it's a bad movie. Today, with people who still carry drugs across the country (idiots) it's a crying shame these people won't learn. Watch this movie to see what happens if you get caught with stuff in an unfamiliar and hostile country, cause this is what exactly happens here, where the late great Davis who plays, drug trafficker, Billy Hayes gets caught with hashish strapped around his body. From the opening scene, a screen shot of Turkey we know the scene is set for a great movie. Too in detail, we see Davis strapping the thick foiled bundles to his chest, while also priming himself not just at the airport in the bathroom, but in the mirror here. When caught, so begins a trapped hell in a sh..hole of a prison, where one brutish thug warden Hamoui (a fantastic Paul Smith) rules the roost. Randy Quaid, delivers a good performance like he usually does, as the angry, hyped and unthinking inmate while Hurt is unforgettable as the crazed and funny prisoner, Max, who eventually loses his marbles, reduced to a mumbling mummy. Let me tell you, there are a couple of heavy scenes to watch, involving beatings, and Stone has told a true story well with his great and detailed screenplay which is a much enjoyable read, all though I didn't read all of it, where small chunks were cut of the script, throughout, much so after the ending, that has him pulling a sham as a guard going home, before running and leaping up into a pause shot. The talented Stone knows how to write scripts, and even if it didn't win best script, in my opinion it's still a winner. Did I mention too Rifkie, a prisoner who bunks with Max and Billy, who a plays dirty, crawling prisoner, one scene forcing Billy to lose it, where he ends in the nutter section of the prison. The film is well shot. I really did love the shots with Billy making an escape from authorities where he's cornered by Hopkins. And when seeing Billy in the dock, receiving the ugly news about his fate, where his case is reviewed, again it just shows you what a stupid thing smuggling crap in is. I love a true story like this, when it's translated well to film, and Stone has a great grip on the handling on this story. It's a heavy and grim film, but emotionally powerful, if by the brilliant and sincere performances, like Hurt, David, and the guy playing his father. One homosexual kissing scene involving Davis is confronting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read the book MIDNIGHT EXPRESS many years ago , but didn't actually see the film until it was broadcast on network TV in the mid 90's . Of course any film adaption of any book will be the inferior article but the problem with this film is .....It's entirely made up !!!!!The film follows the book until Billy is arrested then for some unexplained reason the script decides go its own way !!!MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! First of all Max is a composite character. He's several people rolled into one and none them were beaten half to death and left to languish in the psyciatric hospital.Nor did any of them have a cat that was lynched Billy biting the Turk's tongue out. Hard hitting scene. Didn't happenin reality Hamidou. A sadistic and sexually deviant prison guard. Entirely based in the realms of Oliver Stone's imagination. His attempted rape of Billy and being Killed by him is fictionalAs irritating as these inventions are , the worst aspect of the film is Billy's whining self pity. The Billy Hayes of the book is brutal in his honesty , never ever forgetting that he broke the 11th commandment: Though shalt not get caught; an attitude he still carries to this day. The Billy of the film seems to have given into victim culture and therefore doesn't deserve our sympathy. If you can't do the time ,don't do the crime.Strangely Oliver Stone won the best adapted screenplay Oscar for his script. Surely he should have won it for ORIGINAL screenplay ? But despite its flaws MIDNIGHT EXPRESS is a tense ,involving, tough film. Just make sure you read the book AFTER seeing the film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best prison movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie on DVD five months ago at home, and I was completely blown away by it. This movie focuses on the story of a man named Billy Hayes. Those of you not familiar with him, he is the guy who tried to smuggle hashish out of Turkey in 1970 but he gets thrown in prison as a result. A lot of the stuff that happened in the movie, did not happen in real life, (eg. Hayes biting out a guys tongue). But despite that, I did find it entertaining nonetheless. This is a movie that is not for the faint of heart. There are some scenes of beatings and torture. This movie will shock you and change you forever. Be warned. The films title "Midnight Express" is prison slang for escape attempt, hence the films title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While this film is very intense and the real story is very intense as well, it is lightly based on the truth. For one, Billy was traveling alone... there are many things that are incorrect, check out this and see the real story if you can, web search "Locked Up Abroad - Billy Hayes" I was quite surprised as I really thought the story was all truth, I had seen it when I was young and it had first come out. I was excited to see the Locked up Abroad series featuring Billy Hayes's story. I ended up feeling like I was duped. The true story is not as severe, he never killed anyone to get out of prison, so many things are incorrect it is hard to believe they actually call it the story of Billy Hayes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Express</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Alan Parker (Bugsy Malone, Mississippi Burning), I noticed this film for being five stars out of five, and having two good stars. Based on a true story, Billy Hayes (BAFTA and twice Golden Globe nominated Brad Davis) is arrested in Turkey trying to smuggle drugs, and the Turkish authority sentence him to four years in prison, to make an example of him. While in prison he meets fellow inmates Jimmy Booth (Randy Quaid) and Max (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated John Hurt), who have plans for some sort of escape attempt. Hayes does have two opportunities to get out of prison: appealing with his lawyer, family and the American government; or the Midnight Express. He does attempt to escape from the prison with Booth and Max, but after it backfires, Hayes ruins his chances of getting out by biting the tongue off a prison informant. He is placed in a insane/mental asylum, and after another escape attempt involving bribing, he is nearly raped by a guard. He kills this guard, accidentally, steals his uniform, and manages to walk out the front gate, and the final text says that he managed to cross the border of Greece and get home three weeks later. Also starring Golden Globe nominated Irene Miracle as Susan, Bo Hopkins as Tex, Paolo Bonacelli as Rifki, Paul L. Smith as Hamidou, Norbert Weisser as Erich, Mike Kellin as Mr. Hayes and Franco Diogene as Yesil. Davis is magnificent as the prisoner you can sort of sympathise with, Hurt and Quaid are also fantastic support, it is a very hard-hitting drama with some impressive controversial material that keeps you watching. It won the Oscars for Best Music for Giorgio Moroder and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium for Oliver Stone, and it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. John Hurt was number 27 on The 100 Greatest British Actors. Very good!</fullReview>

Davis is perfect as well as Hurt (Best Supporting Actor nominee) and Quaid as his long-suffering fellow inmates. Oscar nominated for Best Picture, Director (Alan Parker) losing only to Michael Cimino and "The Deer Hunter" and winning for Oliver Stone's engrossing screenplay and Giorgio Moroder's scorching score.

		<fullReview>After trying to smuggle Drugs from Turkey into America, Billy Hayes is sentenced to over 30 years in prison for only smuggling a very small amount of it in.For a true story i actually quite liked it. I find this film fun and sad to watch because there are scenes and elements that go way over the boundary, but that's what I like about this film. I'm a pretty huge fan on Prison film, and this one is absolutely top notch.In my opinion, I think Midnight express deserves more than just a 7.6/10, I think it fully deserves 10 because for a True story, this film does it's job really well in how it expresses it's feelings about what Billy Hayes is feeling and about what he's going through with the corruption around him.This is honestly a great film.

		<fullReview>This film is probably in the top three films I've ever seen. Okay, so the "true story" is only BASED on truth (which is Hollywood speak for "we needed to spice it up a lot"), but it's still a roller coaster ride of pure emotion. I cannot think of a movie in which I've been so filled with empathy for the lead character, the injustices he has to face for what is a relatively minor crime and the increasingly desperate attempts to free himself from the spider's web of difficulties that crime leaves him in. I told my girlfriend about this superb film and after watching it she confided that she didn't see what the fuss was about, and suggesting that it was a film only guys would really get absorbed in and maybe she had a point. Anyway, the acting is excellent and the main character is played with such passion and emotion you cannot help but be moved by his plight. I urge you to watch it (especially if you're a guy).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Book and Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First Off, I write this after 1) Just watching the movie and 2) listening to Genesis' "Land Of Confusion" so please forgive me if my point of view may be a little skewered.I first read the book as 6th grader, cause I needed a book for mandatory reading time during school. The teacher never checked the book for content, so I read it anyways. I must say as 12 year old this was definitely "heavy reading". However, this book really opened my eyes to a lot more than I was ever exposed to. I didn't even know what "hash" was at the time, I had to ask my Mom what it meant. And she was the one who bought the book at a garage sale. She of course never intervened with my reading either. Of course the book was very descriptive, but mind you as a 12 year old reading this, I couldn't quite paint the same picture as and adult reading it. After a couple years, I finally managed to rent the movie and see the pictorial representation. It definitely helped me understand a lot more, but also made the movie easier to follow after reading the book.My personal opinions on drug usage and sales are not for it at all. However, this story has made me understand a more universal truth, which is that "we all make mistakes....some bigger than others" I don't condone what Billy Hayes did, but then again what he had to endure surely wasn't commensurate with his crime. Yes, I know it was smuggling drugs out of a country, but being that I live in a more civilized nation (and I'm sure Turkey has changed also), I can't fathom the torture and mental damage it must have caused. Perhaps the movie may be a little of a stretch, but nonetheless I'm sure it was not a pleasant stay by any means. Had I not read this book and seen the movie, I think my outlook on life would not grant as much mercy and sympathy for unfortunate circumstances. I think this is a value we all need to feel and pass on to others to make our society a little less tense. I'm not saying let hardened criminals off easy, but I think some people deserve that second chance to right their wrongs and make better of themselves and society.If you have not read the book or seen the movie, I highly recommend doing one or the other, if not both. It will move you one way or another guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this movie after seeing "Return to Paradise." Both are about an American getting caught in a foreign country with Hashish and the trials and tribulations that ensue. The similarities stop there, however. For one, this is based on a true story, unlike Return to Paradise. That makes it even more heartwrenching/suspenseful/terrifying when you know that the brutality you see really happened. The acting is first rate, especially by Brad Davis, the main character. Pretty much everything is first rate: the score, art direction, etc. Furthermore, there is no wasted film. Almost every scene moves the story along in some way. There are many symbolisms and metaphors that you have to watch for. This is a rare breed of movies where you actually care about the characters. Like Roger Ebert said, some movies transport you out of your body and into the screen. You forget you are watching a movie and you are totally involved. This is one of those movies. You become Billy Hayes. You feel his pain, his hope, his hate, his alienation, his loneliness, and his longing for freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can bet there are many Turks who register multiple accounts to give the "strengh in numbers" look to their lost cause. Turkish denial is legendary especially to those who do research into the Armenian Genocide where the Turks systematically murdered millions of Armenians and others on a scale never before seen by man.The bad news though is Oliver Stone has gone on to make subsequent movies that were fictitious made to look like fact. Two prime examples include JFK and the more recent Alexander. However it is very important to note that Midnight Express is an accurate account of Turkish culture. In fact, Midnight Express was made well before Stone learned that controversy generates income. Midnight Express wasn't even meant to be controversial but the standard issue Turkish denial made it so. This could be a good thing in the long run since more and more people are starting to realize the crimes against humanity and start to ignore the denial.</fullReview>

I have some comments for it.-the real story and film are different.Accorning to real story.There was a man who dealt with drugs comes to turkey and buys a high amount of hasis and earns extremely much money by selling it .But police chatchs him and Turkish government gives him 20 years prison sentence .Then a mafia in turkey takes him to U.S again .When he has reached to U.S .He wants his money which he had earned by selling hasis from Turkish government .Turkish government rejects this and he treats Turkish government by making a film about this subject.And they do .They really exaggerated this story in the film they wanted to prevent people to come to turkey and buy hasis .In those years Turkish people were producing hasis only to make hasis breed.-Who is the behind of this film.Armenians. All actors are Armenian in the film and they are speaking in Turkish with their Armenian accent.Why Armenians tiring to do something else like that.Because they want to make propaganda against turkey.FOr example Armenian discrimination is a part of the propaganda.Its totally lie like this film.BUT !!!! Unfortunately!!! In those years there was torture in the Turkish prisons.Even today in the 2006 physical and psychological torture is being made in the Turkish prisons.This is the shame of the Turkish society. I have never been to a prison thank god.I say this torture comment as I read from news papers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Artistically excellent, but utterly, inexcusably prejudiced</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a hard time even talking about this film, much less giving it an overall rating, but felt compelled to. My rating of 2 is somewhat arbitrary, but it certainly represents my overall opinion of this film when considering both purely artistic/film-making elements and the disgusting bias of the film. My discussion is thus in two basic parts that do not really interrelate, but I think that anyone must consider both these aspects of the film.Artistically, this film is for the most part simply excellent. The cinematography, visuals, acting, etc. are all top-notch. The use of shadows, perspective, lighting, smoke, etc., are incredible and excellent for creating a strange, surreal, and utterly frightening impression. Even here, though, there are some problems, though not with the visuals, etc. My main problem for a cinematic point of view, and the one that does tie into the other overarching problem with this film, is how it portrays the main character, essentially a none-too-bright, low-life drug smuggler as some sort of victimized hero. Even if he does not necessarily deserve the treatment he is shown receiving in the film, it is hard to feel much sympathy for such a character. The film even goes so far as to try to evoke sympathy and care for another loser character who complains that he was put in prison for stealing candlesticks or something like that from a mosque. How is one supposed to empathize with scum like that? In the US, that'd be like stealing from from a church and I don't think most people here would view such conduct very highly. It is especially hard to sympathize with such a character when he portrays no remorse for what he did, but instead turns it around on the supposedly "evil" Turks.This segues into the fundamental problem with this film, which is so inexcusably, thoroughly, and groundlessly prejudiced that this aspect of the film almost utterly negates its artistic value. Not only are the events at least somewhat fictionalized in a way that makes the Turks look worse, but every element of this film is bursting with what seems like simple disgust and hatred for Turks and Turkey without any foundation. Every single thing about the Turks is used to make them look monstrous and inhuman, while the city of Istanbul, an enthralling, beautiful, and vibrant city (although admittedly, the 1970s was something of a low point in the city's life and status), is shown as scary and bizarre. An example is the story about stealing from a mosque, mentioned above. The film even goes so far as to imply that stealing candles from a mosque isn't that bad because, after all, it's "just a Turkish mosque," which is utterly ridiculous and disgusting. Even anti-Turkish racial/ethnic slurs are bluntly stated as if they are totally justified. No culture in the world, now or ever, is even remotely as bad as the Turks are shown here, and I can't think of another film I have ever seen that makes any other nation, ethnic, or political group (not even Nazi-era Germans) look so demonic. I am not a Turk, but I have also been to Turkey several times and I can say from personal experience that Turkey and Turks bear absolutely no resemblance to the nation portrayed here.I want to emphasize that I am not trying to use this as a soap box to espouse political or social views about any country, etc. My discussion of Turkey and the bigotry and falsehoods in the movie are only intended as a discussion about the merits of this film. I touch on the accuracy, etc., of any film that is supposedly about "real" events, people, places, etc. I would have made the same criticisms had it shown any people or nation the way it shows Turks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure racist garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie can be classified as one of the worst movies ever in history of cinema. It is a shame for America to allow a movie like this. This is because it creates a hostile attitude against the turks which were intentionally depicted as vile psychopaths. If you like this movie, watch "Kurtlar Vadisi" and see that aggression comes back to the aggressor. By the way I must mention that a Turkish jail is not worse than an American jail where prison rape is everyday's business. Inmates serve their terms under very humane conditions and government does not have the right to kill someone just as the American government does. American bigotry at its best. This movie is a waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oliver Stone sorry for Midnight Express</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Hollywood writer and director Oliver Stone has apologized for offending Turkey with his Oscar-winning film Midnight Express, which featured powerful images of appalling prison conditions and brutality that have haunted the country for decades. Visiting Turkey for the first time since the movie was released in 1978, Stone admitted "over-dramatising" the screenplay, which he wrote. It was one of his early forays into cinematography for a film that was directed by Alan Parker.The script, which won Stone an Oscar in 1979, was based exclusively on interviews with Billy Hayes, the American sentenced to 30 years in prison for smuggling drugs into Turkey.In the film, Mr Hayes, who was played by the actor Brad Davis, eventually escapes."It's true I over-dramatised the script," Stone told reporters in Istanbul before holding talks with Turkey's culture and tourism minister, Erkan Mumcu. "But the reality of Turkish prisons at the time was also referred to ... by various human rights associations."Stone said he had been fearful of visiting Turkey for a long time because of the effect the hard-hitting movie had had on the country. "For years, I heard that Turkish people were angry with me and I didn't feel safe there," he told the mass selling Millyet daily."The culture ministry gave me a guarantee that I would be safe, so I feel comfortable now," said the American, who went on to direct Born on the 4th of July, Platoon, Evita and, most recently, Alexander.Echoing the view of diplomats who said that, if anything, foreigners were often treated better than locals in Turkish jails, Stone said that the country had improved greatly since 1974, when a brief visit to Istanbul had given him the impression of being in a "very Ottoman" place.In Ankara yesterday, Stone's remarks were greeted with relief. Turks have long accused the film of exacerbating racist attitudes towards their country.Many expressed horror and hurt at the way the prison drama had formulated views of Turkey, despite the evident progress it had made on human rights in recent years."It was an awful movie and very humiliating, especially if you were a Turk living abroad," said Harvard graduate Banu Revan."Whenever you said you were from Turkey, Americans would automatically say, 'Oh yes, I've seen Midnight Express. Isn't that the place where they cut the hands off people who are caught stealing?' as if we lived in Saudi Arabia! It was ridiculous."Stone's apology came with just days to go before the EU's crucial decision on whether to launch membership talks with Ankara.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong film against drugs and justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a manifesto in many ways and will remain a classic. A manifesto against drug trafficking. This activity is absurd, silly, only dictated by greed at all levels for something that has no justification whatsoever. And yet the real cause of the drama is in the tolerance some ? like the father or the girl friend ? have in front of the moderate use of such substances. But it is also a manifesto against the only answer that is leveled at that problem, in this case in Turkey, but it is not better anywhere else as for that, and that is repression. Repression makes the activity dangerous, hence all the more attractive because it becomes pure sports. What's more it is a manifesto against the cruelty of the punishment. The only objective of it is to make the person suffer physically first of all and to enjoy the slow and brutal degradation of the person. It also creates a social microcosm among prisoners that aims at developing fear and hatred. At the same time the surrounding microcosm of the prison wardens is a descent into a sadistic hellish cloaca that cannot in any way be redeemed. It is finally a manifesto against justice, and not only Turkish justice. The representative of the US consulate, or the lawyers, local or not, are not better. At the end we just wonder what we could do to really avoid the sadistic spiral of that vengeful vision of social management. And the only answer seems to be "escape". As far away and as fast as possible from justice, prisons, drugs and all the rest, maybe even humanity itself.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Getting caught smuggling is a no picnic. But if your in a foreign country like Turkey, don't even think about it! Billy Hayes(Brad Davis) learned the hard way in "Midnight Express". Billy Hayes gets some "hash' for his friends back in the States when he goes to the airport in Turkey, he gets caught and is sentenced to a Turkish prison where he gets tortured big time. To me that's not bad, but for over 30 years? That's a nightmare! Endured psychological torture and physical torment you can go crazy there. He gets a visit from his father before the sentencing which is good. The real deal is when his girlfriend Susan(Irene Miracle) comes to see him and she tries to feel him. All he wanted to do is to see and feel her. He wen to extremes by making her undo her top and place her breasts on the window. The real kicker is when he did that brutal guard. When he tried to rape him, he speared that guard and killed him by impaling his head on that peg. Emotionally gripping, this movie is a gemstone!5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a fantastic rendition of the real life story of billy Hayes,which haunted me since i first saw the film. After watching The Learning Channel about great prison breaks,i had to go and rent this movie. Oliver stone delivers as always the sheer magnetic horror of how a persons life can be turned upside down through one mistake. Getting caught at the airport with hash stuffed in his boots and shirt billy was sentenced to an original fifteen years until it was overturned to thirty. This made an all too clear idea to billy Hayes that he was going nowhere except insane in his mind. But as history tells it,he was the very first human prisoner to escape a Turkish prison. Making him the all time number one escapee. Making it to Greece he was almost turned back to turkey until an agent spoke on his behalf to the American consulate,giving him his freedom once again. He never stepped foot back on Turkish soil,and he also had given speeches about his plight back home in schools and drug rehab centers,hopefully opening the eyes of people who dwell on the idea of trying to make it big in the drug trade. I think we can learn a lot from billy Hayes and why the only prison left is one without a key,and sanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert Midnight Express is the story of Billy Hayes, a man in his very early twenties who stuffs hashish under his coat in Turkey, trying to get back on the airplane so he can get back home and make some money. Billy is sentenced to three years and two months in prison with possible parole. During his stay there he learns how to become and act like a Turk. He befriends Max, an englishman, another American, and a Sweedish man. The prison is like a living thing, leeching all the life out of Billy, but that doesn't matter because Billy is getting out in thirty two days to go back home and get away from this living hell. Billy is told the judge has repealed his sentence, and now he must face thirty more years in jail with no parole or bond. Billy loses part of his mind, his reason starts to slip, and his love for life is quickly diminishing. Billy, Max, and the American remove limestone rocks from the shower room and slip down a shaft, which will lead them to catacombs and out of the prison. Unfortunately the catacombs have been sealed and all the characters go almost completely mad. More conflicts from inmates and guards continue. Eventually Billy beats an inmate within an inch of his life and is sent to the sanitarium. Billy's mind is now completely gone, his words don't make any sense, and he has a blank stare in his eyes as if he is just living a nightmare. After seven years total in jail Billy's old girlfriend who boarded the plane in the beginning encourages him to escape, giving him hundreds of dollars to get to Greece. Billy finally pulls himself together, kills the cruel head prison guard who tries to rape him at the end, and gets out of the prison complex.Oliver Stone has made a true masterpiece here. The heartbeats at the beginning are truely unique and electrifying. The mood is great, the jail is always full of sorrows, no one is happy. Midnight Express would have won Best Picture had not the magnificent Deer Hunter been made the same year. This one will have you clapping at the end. It is truely a masterpiece about human triump under impossible odds, and better yet it's a true story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truly masterful film, must viewing for any aspiring filmmaker or fans of the political thriller genre.Far too much talk has been wasted on the accuracy of details portrayed in the movie. Obviously, this is part and parcel of basing one's script on real events, but it's a shame that it all takes away from the public's appreciation of a milestone work in film art.Turkish elites fond of turning a blind eye to much that is feudal and thuggish in their (wonderful) country will never accept any single aspect of this story as having any basis whatsoever in fact. Nonetheless, they, along with the vast majority of their countrymen who deal with harsh authoritarianism and humiliation day in and day out, can at least be thankful that this film played an undeniably enormous role in keeping Turkey from becoming a major destination for druggie tourism a la Holland, Goa, Nepal, etc. Alan Parker did them no small favour in this respect... They should build at least one statute of him for that, if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Proves Fiction Is Always Better Than Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADFiction should be a very easy thing to understand - you can't believe in it! It's as clear and straightforward as that. So it baffles me why there's so many people criticising this movie for distorting the true story of William Hayes. It's a movie, and whoever believes it word for word isn't sane. That said, no movie should be criticised for not respecting reality. Any adaptation of real-life events must be fictionalised for the sake of drama... otherwise, it's boring. And quite simply, William Hayes' faithful account of his imprisonment in Turkey was boring and hardly the material for drama. A good dramatist will change facts to achieve maximum dramatic effect. Shakespeare did it every chance he get. Go through his 'historical' plays with a good history book and try not fall into the giant historical holes. And yet no one complains about Shakespeare. Well, I'm not going to complain about Parker/Stone's amazing movie because it's one of the most dramatically powerful movies I've ever seen in my life! Each movie creates its own reality and logic within the story itself, and in the Midnight Express the Turks were pure evil, Hayes was brutally treated, he killed a man for vengeance, and made a fantastic escape back into the USA. And there's nothing wrong with that... at least within the movie's logic, which is what one should pay attention to.Midnight Express is the straightforward story of one man lost in a cruel world that wants to destroy him physically, but especially mentally, who triumphs against great adversities and overwhelming circumstances and odds. Basically, it's your typical uplifting, feel-goody movie.The first ten minutes of the movie are excellent in themselves... it's practically silent as we're shown everything visually: from Hayes hiding the hash in his body at the beginning, to him 'hiding' himself under his shades, chewing lots of gum and sweating a lot to shows he's pretty nervous. In fact this weakness immediately tells us he's not going to succeed in getting inside that plane. And for all accounts, we should hate Hayes because he's a drug dealer. And yet he has a girlfriend - Susan - more importantly he has a girlfriend whom he tells to get into the airplane and leave him behind for her sake. He cares for her... and this behaviour is repeated again with his cellmates - especially with Max. We can't hate Hayes: he just put his girlfriend into safety. He's the good guy in the movie. The first ten minutes shows us that we're supposed to be rooting for him for the rest of the movie, and I do. More importantly, we must root for him because he's one man against a whole corrupt, backwards legal system that has no feelings. Do I think Turkey is portrayed accurately in this movie? Absolutely not! But this isn't Turkey; this is an abstract, Kafkaesque antagonist that's set out to create conflict in the movie, as rules of drama demand it - and throughout the movie this antagonist is personified by the chief guard prison guard, Hamidou. And the conflict is so overwhelming it makes Hayes struggle even more interesting to follow. As the legal system manipulates his sentence Hayes goes from a peaceful man to a resourceful, desperate man willing to do anything to escape Turkey.In prison he meets interesting characters: his cellmates Max, the junky, Jimmy, angst-ridden guy, and Eric, a Swedish inmate who first helps Hayes setting in. Hayes shows the same commitment to them as he showed to Susan, and yet one by one he sees them all disappear: first Eric; then Jimmy, arrested after a foiled escape plan; and finally Max, brilliantly played by John Hurt: he's backstabbed by Rifki, the local snitch who turns Max to Hamidou on the fake grounds of selling hash. Rifki is the sort of character in fiction one just loves hating... there are actually two moments in the movie where one feels victorious over him: the first when Hayes and Max destroy his money, the only thing he cares for and for which he'd sell out on inmates like Jimmy. But the second instance is just about one of the most righteous, semi-cathartic scene in any movie wherein the viewer feels rewarded for waiting so long just to get sweet revenge: as Hayes loses his last friend, Max, after Rifki turns him to Hamidou, Hayes goes crazy and brutally attacks Rifki like a real madman, culminating in the infamous scene where Hayes bites Rifki's throat off.It just feels so good!But the heartbreaking moment in the movie comes at the end, when Hayes finally escapes. It's ironic that after so many mad schemes to escape prison, including through catacombs, Hayes just manages to escape through the front door. As we see him walking away from the prison to the sound of Giorgio Moroder's beautiful score, one can't hope to feel emotional. There's a sense of righteousness in seeing Hayes make it; after all, he wasn't bad enough to deserve a whole life in a Turkish prison. The Midnight Express is a fantastic movie that explores Man's best qualities: perseverance, self-determination and love. The point of fiction is tell stories like this, as distorted as they may be, and I give this movie 8/10 for showing me raw human nature triumphing over impossible odds. And it's great to see Billy triumph especially because the odds are impossible... that's what makes the whole movie great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a powerful story, but at times terribly told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a powerful story. A young American spends years in a Turkish prison for attempting to smuggle hashish. He is beaten and degraded, he witnesses the beating of children, and it's a bad scene all around. Most of the other prisoners are Turks. Turkish is spoken, and is shown without subtitles. This is great. It puts the movie viewer in the shoes of the main character, who doesn't know Turkish either.The main character, William, pals up with two other guys, a bombastic American played by Randy Quaid, and a timid bespectacled Englishman named Max (played well by John Hurt). Randy Quaid's character is so over-the-top as to be annoying. He's also so unbelievable as to almost have ruined the movie for me. The last 1/3 of the movie is better than the rest, I think.I won't ruin the ending for you by telling you what happens.Suffice it to say that this is a rough movie about an American imprisoned in Turkey. The style of moviemaking itself is very sentimental and emotional. The music is a bit over the top also. The music could have been more subtle and a bit lighter, rather than pounding the viewer.Fans of prison movies should definitely see this. I can't recommend this without strongly insisting that this movie is not for children, though. The scenes of torture are just too brutal.veloc</fullReview>

The story of how one american was sentenced to life in a turkish prison just for trying to smuggle hashish back to the united states is fabulous. The beginning scene perfectly captures the smuggler's horror and nervousness as he's passing through customs and trying to get on the plane without being caught. There is a loud and fast heartbeat on the soundtrack that gives the scene a triumphant effect on how one person must feel when they are terrified. The rest of the film depicts the smuggler's torturous life in the prison, his tolerance, courage, strength, and eventually his chance to finally escape.

		<shortDescription>Great true life prison drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't go into this film with massively high hopes - but I don't know why, as Midnight Express is surely one of the best 'hidden gems' that I've seen! The film is almost three decades old now, making it strange that it hasn't turned up in this decade with a better reputation. Starring Brad Davis and directed by Alan Parker, this British production follows the frightening idea of being trapped in a foreign prison. Adding to that is the fact that it's actually based a true story. The real life Billy Hayes (Davis' character in this film) wrote the book 'Midnight Express', from which this film takes it's inspiration. The idea of being caught breaking the law in another country is handled well in this film, and Alan Parker always ensures that the prison environment is dark and claustrophobic, with the focus being on the state of mind of the main character at all times. It's very easy to get into this film, and the linear plot helps this massively. These days it's customary to mess around with plotting in an attempt to be as original as possible; but Midnight Express proves how a straight story can allow the audience to connect with the characters.Midnight Express benefits from an array of great actors in the central roles. Brad Davis, as mentioned, takes the lead role and manages to capture just the right amount of naivety and self-preservation to make the role believable. He is joined by big name actors Randy Quaid and John Hurt, while smaller name actors such as Bo Hopkins, Paolo Bonacelli and Mike Kellin give it their all in their respective parts. For justice to work the crime must fit the punishment; and this is something that makes this film obviously based on a book by the prisoner himself. We never seen the main character admit that he's done anything wrong, and the focus is always put on him wanting to get out of jail. This is wrong in a way, as if people were allowed to get away with crime; there would be no law - but on the other hand, it allows us to get into the accused's head a little more, and this ultimately makes the final payoff far more rewarding. Overall, I'm not saying this film is without problems; but it's definitely well worth seeing. The acting and directing are fabulous, and this film also benefits from being based on a great true story. I'd maybe even label it 'must see'.</fullReview>

Well, I believe it has great acting and good cinematography. It stimulates discussion, and intellectual of the type. I seriously want to see it now that I have read the comments.The plot line is Billy while trying to smuggle hashish out of Turkey gets caught and falls to Turkish prison and is abused in the latter. The demonization of Turkish prison and in turn its people are part of the clear cut Hollywood style. If I have seen this film I obviously wouldn't want to go to Turkey but I am from Turkey. So in that case I don't think I have much choice. I don't think I will have a nationalistic reaction to the film if I see it. Because it is a film and entertainment and should be considered in that framework. The odds are that something similar to this happened and that it is hard not to feel sorry for the person who has gone through all this trouble for smuggling drugs. Anyway, lesson learned no more drug smuggling from the third world. It is like me going to U.S. and not paying my taxes and getting penalized in turn and getting, feeling sorry for myself and angry at the law enforcement officers and don't understand why they punish me so dearly. Because in my culture bribe and corruption is common place and therefore I see it that way anywhere. Nope it is illegal, there you go bill, I have said it finally, it is like talking about killing the president in the United States it is illegal. I have learned as a kid that it was bad to do illegal stuff, and has been avoiding prison ever since whether it is good or bad for me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The cinematography in this movie is trully excellent, and it portrays the hell-hole that turkish prisons are perfectly. It has been said that the scenario did not follow the book. This doesn't detract from the truth in that turkish society is solely based on corruption, bribes, and despite what turks say is still rooted in the islamic traditions of centuries past. Also, if turkish jails are so wonderful, why were there all those prison revolts some months ago, with many inmates dying from hunger-strikes or being murdered? Maybe because they're even worse than what the movie showed? As a final note, I tend to agree with the main character's courtroom speech, it hit the nail right on the head. And I do not forget the missing POWs from the 1974 turkish invasion of Cyprus, some of whom are still languishing in turkish prisons.</fullReview>

He never hit the same heights but what heights he hits in this film. Such a shame he self-destructed with drugs alcohol and promiscuous sex. The film is graphic - do not rent this if you are squeamish. The violence is a little over the top but the director obviously wanted a film that would shock.

		<shortDescription>Funniest prison comedy since Laurel and Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I met this girl in Utrecht, Netherlands named Paula. We briefly shared an attic. I've met and known a lot of pretty girls in my life but none were prettier than Paula. She was just about to begin a job working as an usher in a local movie theater. The film playing that night was MIDNIGHT EXPRESS. Now I must tell you that the Maxter once did a six month bit in a North African prison. I was surprised to find out that Paula did two and a half years in Algeria. I went to visit her on her first night of work not knowing what the film would be. When we came to both the trial and especially the prison sequences we both couldn't stop laughing. It was more like summer camp than a North African prison and we knew what some dank pestilent hole in Turkey would be like. I'm afraid my roaring - "Oh Billy" while he wanks off in the prison visiting room - set her off so much that she was fired. Oliver Stone won an academy award for the script which is a different sort of laugh maker, and hey, Alan Parker was one of my favorite directors but its just so much crap, like a piece of crap under twelve coats of automotive enamel with chrome do-dads. It looks good on the screen but take it home and to heart and you've been poisoned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Impressive Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is strong, impressive, shocking and takes the watcher to Turkey of 1970s. Most of those who criticized the movie here are turks and hence they are biased and speak out of nationalistic point of view.In the 1970s, Turkey was a BIG prison.Political opponents, criminals, etc..had filled the prisons, during the military regime of Kenan Evren, the press used to indicate that there were about 50, 000 political prisoners alone and the prison conditions are really very bad.So, this movie presents a REAL story within this historic context. The prison guards are cruel,they use primitive torturing methods and of course the famous rape...I agree with the movie-maker that the country was a backward place, corrupt prison guards, torturing, political unrest, drug trafficking, etc.Those who feel offended should do some self-evaluation and work towards improving Turkey's human rights conditions instead of bashing a movie and denying historic facts such as the Armenian Genocide and the occupation of Cyprus and persecution of the kurds, and the torturing of prisoners.Reality hurts, a movie will not make a difference except for mirroring a certain situation in an artistic, "hollywoodean" way.I give this movie 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two men are in charge of this movie and neither one is an actor.Alan Parker and Oliver Stone were experimenting when they made this. Stone was starting his "excess method" that has lasted to today. Parker began making films about layering one image on top of another. At least he's had a competent editor.This isn't as charming as 'Great Escape'. Not as quaint as 'Papillon'. But you can still find some interesting stuff in here. Hurt, one of our grand men of science fiction, tries acting here. Randy Quaid, before his stereotype, tries being Steve McQueen.So, since Parker isn't strong enough, Stone takes over and throws in his trademark brutality, boring sexuality, racism, and narcotics. One must wonder why HE didn't do 'The Wall' instead.Notice how Moroder sticks to Parker like a stray dog. He would learn the method soon enough. He'd take Adrian Lyne and Tony Scott and send the MTV method to its highest point in American cinema.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deja vu</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dramatic and harrowing experience depicting the conditions of Billy Hayes' incarceration in a Turkish prison. People have criticized this movie for its racist portrayal of Turks. However one should remember that this is a PRISON MOVIE-hence the likes of Hamidou and Rifki portray prison life at its worst. Most other Turks, eg. airport officials, and other prison guards are simply INDIFFERENT as opposed to sadistic, as you would generally expected. It was also criticized for its exaggeration/falsification of certain events. Perhaps. But once again this is a MOVIE, hence the dramatic impact necessary in order to carry the story. The real Billy Hayes had actually admitted to screenwriter, Oliver Stone, that even though he never gave that "Turks are pigs" speech in real life, he nevertheless FELT EXTREMELY UPSET upon receiving 30 years,&amp; hence reflects his true emotions at the time. Overall a must see movie, that will leave you thrilled as well as portray the concept of miscarriage of justice. Incidentally, the recent complaints by Amnesty International on the alleged continued use of brutality and torture in Turkish prisons, reflects how the movie wasn't made for nothing. Somewhere at this moment Alan Parker is probably saying "I told you so"- deja vu.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well scripted, but ultimately misses the mark.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight Express" is an incredibly famous movie. Everyone I know has either seen it or mentioned it at one time or another. It also has a big reputation as being one of the harshest prison movies ever. So after many years of hearing about it I decided to hire it out. The beginning is a great sequence is suspense and expectations. However the ordeal the main character goes through after this is greatly hampered by a few factors. "Warning Spoilers Ahead" 1.The main character chose to smuggle the drugs of his own accord for no apparent reason (e.g His family didnt seem to greatly need any money neither did he given how supportive his dad is throughout) 2.The Main character seems mostly unrepentant of his actions throughout the whole film (At one point giving a speech in which he expresses his hatred of the whole of Turkey) 3.Although the prison sequences are tough alot of the worst things happen to other characters. Except for the very end where things then start to fall down on him. The saving graces of this movie are the performances of John Hurt and Brad Davis and the great Opening and closing sequences which really come to the heart of the story. Other than that the rest of the film is too lopsided and too many scenes miss their mark for this film to have the impact the makers of it obviously desired for it to have.All up not the classic its billed as.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A youth decides to smuggle some hashish out of Turkey in his return back home to the U.S. Unfortunately, he is caught at the airport and placed into a Turkish prison which is anything but hospitable. He is sentenced for a couple of years, but, when his sentence has expired, he is informed that it has been reconsidered, and he now faces a life-sentence. After several escape attempts fail, and he is severely punished for these, he realizes that if he doesn't find a way out soon, he won't be able to retain his sanity.The fact that the Turkish spoken in prison by the guards was not subtitled lends to the suspense; you feel like you're right there with him in prison. The suspense is boosted also by a great musical score by Georgio Moroder. Based on a true story. Oh yes, and be sure to watch this on an empty stomach! (10 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grossly exaggerated, pathetically idiotic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is based on the true story of a drug smuggler named Bill Hayes who was jailed in a Turkish prison. While I was studying in Europe in 1982, many people I had met had mentioned this movie upon understanding that I was Turkish. Almost 10 years later, I was able to see it on a private Turkish channel ironically. I will not dwell on demonizing an entire nation issue but would like move on to some serious flaws in the film. First, if the language spoken is Turkish, then I must have been taught Sanskrit or Urdu as my native language. Hardly any native speaker can understand a word that guardians and the police speak here. Second, when delivering the verdict, the judges in Turkey never say "Gecmis Olsun" (let it be passed),which is a word of consolation spoken only to people who are either recovering from an illness or who may have had an accident. Moreover, the prison looks more like a demolished Spanish hacienda rather than a prison. As for the homosexuality issue blamed on Turkish people, hardly have I seen an American prison movie without scenes of either homosexuality or homosexual rape. Examples are plentiful: The "Shawshanks Redemption", "American History X", "The Glass House", "The Butterfly Effect" etc.. The director and/or the producer may have wanted to do some hate mongering, after all it is their right. But when they do it, they should it cleverly without compromising the quality as in the "Never Without My Daughter" or as in "Tears of Sun".</fullReview>

No special effects,gratuitous sex,violence or vulgarity. The last 10 minutes are burned in my memory. John Hurt,Randy Quaid and Brad Davis are what actors ought to be nowadays! Stunningly brutal,frank and riveting from the first frame. You can't help but cheer for Billy all the way in this movie. A timeless classic that will never lose its allure,its honesty or its message,even when the times do change. Movies like "Midnight Express" are how they should be done today. No holds barred but simple to understand and thought-provoking. You'll talk about this one again and again. I guarantee!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessentially American movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was truly surprised when I learned that it was directed by a Brit, who also shot some pretty good movies. It presses all the right emotional buttons and I expected it would be correlated with the likes of Black Hawk Down ? wrong again. Maybe I just did not get something about the movie. The thing which amazed me most it the plot ? the film is about an American, which went to another country, broke the laws of that country, got himself caught, received a severe punishment as a result of US pressure on Turkey to fight drug trafficking. While serving his sentence he breaks many rules, customs and regulations, tries to escape, gets caught again and finally escapes killing in the process a law enforcement officer. And he is a HERO ? the director skillfully employs every trick in the book to make us feel for the guy and rejoice at the ending. To me it's a must-see movie for those of us who were born outside the US of A and seek to understand how the natives think, feel and relate to the outside world. It might also help to understand the recent and past LIBERATIONS of ungrateful nations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film showed what we all know since we were raised and trained. The Turks are bastards! I know as I am a swede and we have had roughs and riots with those people since the viking times no to mention the 17th century. Turkey runs under a dictatorship and it also wants to get into the European community. That's a big joke! The movie showed how the justice works in a corrupt country. There is no justice only bribes and bribing. It was so good to watch the movie to get the opinion finally canalized. If Hayes are a bad, spoiled brat, that committed a crime, doesn't really matter. Some claim that Oliver Stone wanted to make a martyr of Hayes but that's only one side of the film. What turks stand for did he show with great brilliance!</fullReview>

The closet i have ever found to this is BROKEDOWN PALACE (same thing only 2 girls)in Turkey apparently the prisoners run the prison and the guards just sit in wait. I wonder how many guards have been shanked in Turkey? There is a Method to their madness. Their laws are...PIGISH. CLEARLY. BUT their RETURN RATE is ZERO. think about it next time you pay taxes for a rapist with a toothache in Somewhere USA. You bet he gets a dentist with 24hrs or less. Hell i don't even get that.

		<shortDescription>My all time favourite movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an unsurpassed cinematographic achievement that leaves you breathless. The lead actor did his job extremely well and the others were very convincing as well. The music by Giorgio Moroder is definitely a classic from 1970s.The director (Alan Parker) and screenplay writer (Oliver Stone) slowly but surely paint the gloomy picture of unimaginable atrocities and horrors one can expect in a Turkish prison. As the movie proceeds you can almost physically feel what the personal hell of Billy Hayes really felt like. The direction and storytelling are masterful, and you are instantly immersed into this twilight zone of brutality which normal people can hardly understand, let alone condone. Some say it was OK to punish him because he was smuggling drugs. What? This type of reasoning and justification never ceases to amaze me. That's completely besides the point. The point is that a man was treated with unimaginable brutality, while his "crime" was obviously used just as a pretence. Oliver Stone doesn't want to waste his time on those who cannot understand such a basic thing, that the punishment in sick societies often has nothing to do with the "crime".Unforgettable moments in the movie? There are so many, but if I had to choose, I'd single out all the scenes with the main prison bully, Hamidou, and when Billy walks in circles with the other prisoners like a lunatic, realizing he would go completely mad if he stayed there any longer. The moment when Billy gives his speech before the Turkish judge, is heart wrenching to say the least and represents the climax of the movie. I first saw this film in 1993 on a local TV station, and although I realized immediately that the movie was crafted very well, I thought to myself: "oh, it can't be that bad in Turkey. They must have exaggerated things a lot". I was wrong. I was still young and naive and believed that people are generally pleasant everywhere. NOT! I went to Turkey on a holiday, and albeit I didn't have any problems with their law, many of their hotels are like portals to Hell and much like the prison from this film - they are totally ridden with the nastiest toxic black MOULD, horrible food and often extremely rude Turks. My health was permanently damaged and I still suffer the consequences. Some of my friends had similar experience this year, after visiting Turkey. I guess not everywhere in turkey is so bad, but some places and people are definitely Hellish! I will NEVER go there again and I would not wish my worst enemy what I had to go through in Turkey.In this age of sickening political correctness it is absolutely refreshing to watch a film like this one, a film that doesn't mind throwing the blunt truth right before your eyes, no matter how it might seem to any arrogant nationalist offended by the perfectly candid review of the repressive policies and practices, or by the representation of the repulsive dangers that can befall anyone who is unfortunate enough to experience the dark side of this country.And for those Turks who are offended by this movie, I have to say only this: Why oh why don't you at least wash your hotels and remove the toxic mold that makes susceptible people extremely sick (but isn't pleasant for anyone for that matter). The toxic mold which some of your hotels are infested with can cause severe diarrhea, vomiting and even permanent neurological brain damage when touched or inhaled. People want to travel, not to become poisoned for life, you know? Why don't you serve food that won't make people sick? (if you didn't know, flies aren't good food for humans.) Why don't you treat holiday makers with some respect? Of course, there are good Turks, I'm not generalizing, but the number of rude, dirty and impolite ones, which for some strange reason were put in charge in many Turkish holiday resorts, is just mind-boggling.Kudos to Oliver Stone for not giving a damn what some might think about his beliefs and work. And for all of you who think this movie is biased or exaggerated - just go to tripadvisor dot com and do a search for "turkey and dirty". You'll be amazed with the number of reviews from various people that confirm exactly what I experienced. Why is this so, and why is it tolerated is beyond me. I guess people will go anywhere even if they get sick or get harassed by the locals, as long as it is cheap. Geez.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie ever..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever seen, in my whole life. It is ignorant, racist and perverted. It can be compared with Nazi propaganda films from the 30s and 40s. Allthoug the real Billy Hayes girlfriend made lots of Turkish friends in Turkey who helped and comforted her, the film shows not one compassionate Turk. The Turks in the movie are portrayed as sadist, dumb,greedy and evil. And to some facts: The real Billy Hayes admitted in 1998 that the film is highly over exaggerated comparing with his own real experiences, in the Istanbul Prison 1970-1975. And he also admitted that the movie could be evaluated to be almost a fictional story. Make also notice of these facts: The guard Hamidou, who is probably the most sadist person in the movie,"Paul L. Smith", is in fact an Armenian,his real name is Anam Edel. Likewise, the prosecutor, an Armenian, named Kevork Malikyan. Those who is not ignorant, knows that most Armenians hate Turks. Off course not all, but most of them. I also believe that 80 % of the positive comments written on this site, about the film, is written by Armenians.10 % by Greeks and 10 % by ignorants.In the film, an Englishman, is jailed for stealing some candles from a Mosque! Muslims do not keep candles in any mosques, at all! The Turkish inmates also play baseball in the prison yard. Baseball arrived to Turkey in the mid 90s. Brad Davis admitted shortly before his death in 1991, that he had an heavy drug abuse while filming the movie. This is another proof that only a junkie could play the head role in such a film. Davis died of AIDS at the age of 41. My final conclusion: This film is probably one of the most dangerous movies produced ever, and has damaged the reputation of Turkey, and the Turkish people, more than anybody can think of. There is no such thing, as a good people or a bad people. There is only such thing as good or bad persons. Exampel: one "Turkish" prisoner "Rifki" (italian actor, there was no Turkish actors in the film, likewise there was no good Turks in the film) murders a Cat, and hates Cats... Well I am of Turkish heritage, and I love Cats, and have had several as pets. Like millions of other Turks have had Cats as pets. My only hope for the future, is that people in the western world, would get more intelligent,in time, so they can see that, they should not build their information about Turkey and its people, just on this sick propaganda film.</fullReview>

If he was stupid enough to get busted, he should take his punishment like a man. Prisons are not nice places anyway, and rape etc is common in US prisons for example.The movie is in this case biased and was financed heavily with some anti-Turkish propaganda.

This could be an excellent movie.But the purpose of the movie which is to show only the "not-existing" bad side of a nation made the movie to be commented only on the political side and totally wasted the cinematic efforts. One should start criticizing on this movie by asking himself the question:"How real can this be?". In fact this question can also be "Is this real?" but the events that happen in the movie are not totally fictional.These events can happen, but not in the way that they're told in this movie. Can it be real for a country not to have a one single member who is "not" evil and bad? Another point that should be thought about is the idea or ideas that this movie supports. Alan Parker and Oliver Stone could make a movie in which the place and setting could have been totally anonymous.How about the book of Billy Hayes then, right? Well the movie could just depend on the story, not "being" the story. Nowadays it is really easy to claim that a piece of literature is real.But it is never proved.Since I am only commenting on the movie not on the book I won't get into that subject.But all in all two masters of motion picture Alan Parker and Oliver Stone could have made a much better movie if they didn't rely so much on their personal political thoughts and ideas.This movie is just not real.Period.</fullReview>

The only other thing that bothered me about this film was Irene Miracle (Susan). I mean that woman couldn't act if her life depended on it. What a BAD performance, really. Who chose that chick? She was awful in my opinion and in her last scene (not the photo's at the end) she nearly ruined everything. It was a MIRACLE that she got the part and yet another that she received a Golden Globe nomination, though I must admit it was a miracle Brad Davis didn't get an Oscar nomination as well.

		<fullReview>I saw this morning when it first opened in London in the late 70s. What an absolute gem in all respects. As a youngster, drugs was definitly a no-no after this movie. I finally got a chance to own the DVD recently and it still evokes incredible memories. The book is obviously not followed in the movie but we should accept it as a piece of pure Hollywood. Brad David should have won the Oscar indeed. Turkey was rather flamed by this movie which should never have happened. Nevertheless - a brilliant movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally speaking, I have a problem with westerners who travelabroad, brake the law, insult the country, and expect specialtreatment because of their citizenship, yet this is pretty common allover the Middle East and Asia.This being said, prison stories are are always exciting, andMidnight Express is no exception. It's a very well-made movie,except for the cultural mistakes (mosques don't have candles;Muslims don't pray the way they're portrayed to, and Turkish, Arabic-and apparently Maltese (languages)- are confused). I don'tunderstand why everyone describes this prison as hell though:they're not confined to a cell, they smoke up as much as they want,they're allowed packages from outside, they get to hang out in thecourtyard, read, etc. I was expecting more violence, but theprisoners are actually 'punished' only when they screw up, they'renot randomly tortured. I'm not saying it's fun; this is a prison afterall.Before watching Midnight Express, I knew that the music wasfamous but had forgotten what it was. It was funny to hear it, Icouldn't take it very seriously. Amazing performances from everyone, and the mise en scenewas great too. Yet, no matter how political Alan Parker's moviesget, there's something missing. There was something missing inMississippi Burning and there's something missing in this one aswell. He and Costa-Gavras should team up together, Parkerwould give CG a sense of aesthetics, and CG would give Parkermore umph to his movies. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is so good, even after 25 years it is as good as I remember it when it was originally released. It does not sink to the unnecessary blood and guts gore to create the feeling of fear and loathing.The acting and directing are first class - so real and believable all round. This should be a must for film schools.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best prison movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was almost as good as The Shawshank Redemption. It starts off unbearably suspenseful, and from then on it's a bleak, emotionally powerful, and excellent drama. Some scenes are repellent and depressing, especially the scenes in the insane ward. But if you can hold on until the end you will be left extremely satisfied. Brad Davis won a much deserved Oscar for his portrayal of Billy Hayes, and so did Oliver Stone for his screenplay. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why some other people would hate this movie because it under-represents Turkish people, but I cannot understand why anybody would interpret any fiction as political allegory and take it seriously. Who goes to a movie theatre in search of 'the truth'? This movie was made in the seventies, but the political situations have changed since then, and so has the general American xenophobia. I don't think any American viewer nowadays would go see this movie and then be lead to think all Turkish people are pigs. Loneliness and suffering of the human soul and body can have any other setting, either realistic (Nazi concentration camp) or fictional (King Lear's palace). I have never seen in cinema a more realistic and honest--almost to the point of crudeness at times--portrait of a tortured human being and his anguished, desperate struggles against a sick, twisted, perverse world--any imaginary or real one. The performance of the entire cast (especially the Turkish characters) is impeccable. John Hurt is cut out for the character. The only flaw of the movie is the surprise ending, a classic deus ex machina; so are the black and white family reunion pictures which struck me as mush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the sensitive goons who cant enjoy this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To all the Turks who hate this movie, maybe you should make a movie of your own to depict how great you are. If you can turn poverty, intolerance and despotism into beauty, more power to you.Ignore those goons. This is an excellent movie. Characters are deeply developed, and you can feel, and even be creeped out by, Billys descent into a world of hell. You can feel his insanity, and it will get to you. Some of the best parts are when he beats the life out of that little human cockroach, Rifki, and when he makes the speech depicting the Turkish people as pigs.This is an excellent movie. Ignore those sensitive people, who, for the most part are the offenders themselves, and watch this immediately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>come on!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally sat down and watch this movie when I caught it on AMC. I have heard in detail about how it depicted my nation as evil pigs so I was not really surprised with (1) Extremely funny prison.(I assure you even in 70s prisons in Turkey have actual concrete buildings with water, heat and electricity and beds for prisoners.) (2) Constant depiction of Turks as fat sweaty pigs with no good in their heart. (3) Funny use of "Turkish" and especially long speech the prosecutor (4) all other stuff.So I was not surprised but it is still horrible to watch your country being humiliated with lies. But it was OK, I was able to take it. UNTIL...Until, Billy's father said "Turkish Food sucks" -or something like that. I could not help screaming to the TV: "F. you." Come on, this is Turkish food, a thousand year tradition that brings Mediterranean and middle east food together, one of world's two intercontinental cuisines(alongside french) And an American- from a place with no cuisine, just stuff from all over the world and burger and steak- says it sucks.I know it is silly to get angry over this kind of stuff, but it was the point I could not help it. It shows how Stone and Parker are biased and ignorant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films I've ever seen... I recommend it for everyone :o)... Especially on account of the Davis' play and the atmosphere of Turkey, that is completely different than in prospects from travel agencies! Although brutality, the film is watched with the great attention... And, what's characteristic, we cross our fingers about the major hero, even if he's criminal... This film help us to imagine what can happen when we don't think about what we're doing - even if we have a good, happy life it always can change into a horror because of one short while of stupidity... And moreover it's still warning for taking drugs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a masochist's dream come true...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bearing little resemblance to the book, or in fact to real life, "Midnight Express" exists in a sadomasochist bubble, completely removed from anything concrete. Even on its own terms, it makes no sense. With heavy homosexual overtones throughout, our hero (played by Brad Davis) turns down gay sex as if he's above it, yet director Alan Parker revels in the sexual imagery (what with Davis standing spread out in front of the law or being pawed at by sexual brute Paul Smith). Are we to believe that this American tourist in Turkey, jailed for attempting to smuggle out hashish, is some kind Arc Angel, remaining pure throughout the carnage? Oliver Stone adapted the non-fiction book, and won an Oscar, but he waters down an already taut account (or maybe it was watered down for him). This is not to say the film doesn't have horrifying or fascinating passages (it does command attention), but the "plot", as such, doesn't hang together. The movie has a dated look, and dated music, causing it to resemble an old porny picture, and the performances are variable. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1.Before I write anything,a few comments on the criticism here on IMDb: For the Turkey defenders: which one of you has been to a Turkish prison of that time period?Aha, I thought so. Neither have I.And even if you had some historical knowledge that would contradict some of the aspects of this movie...rape,violence and grim facilities ARE features of almost any prison.And anyway,it is through the subjective eyes of Hayes that we see the whole thing,it is not a news report. So I do not understand why you are so defensive about it. For the "this is not what really happened" commentators:I am really surprised that you can watch some propaganda junk like "The Patriot" and ravel about how real it is, and yet attack this movie for not sticking with the real story of William Hayes. At least it got the atmosphere right,which is more than enough for its purpose. The nationalist comments that I read here are pathetic. If you are a Turk and you are offended by this movie you are either a fanatical idiot or just maybe you recognize yourself in the characters. Please don't this comment personally.2. This movie is stunning. Not because of the story but because of the WAY the story was told and because of the acting.John Hurt was so convincing and transposed ! Because at the time I first saw the movie I was not familiar with any of his movies, I didn't realize that it was John Hurt until 10 years later, even though by then I had seen lots of movies with him. Quaid was also incredible. As for Brad Davis, no other could have been better.No matter how many times I see this movie, the emotions of William Hayes are there with me (and I have watched it at least 50 times).In particular, the masturbation scene is one of the gutsiest scenes I have ever seen in movies. The movie does succeed, in the most convincing way, to turn you into a voyeur of William Hays' torments. Parker and Stone made an excellent team,and the actors were equally matched.Drama at its best.If this movie would come out now,it would be a disaster at the box-office, I would think. Who would want to see a REAL movie like this one when you can watch Vin Diesel driving cars for 90 minutes or Ben Affleck shooting Japanese and German planes and managing to f*** the prom queen in the same time?

		<shortDescription>Powerful Movie...reflecting 1970s Turkish prisons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strong, realistic movie. It describes the situation in Turkish prisons in the turbulent 1970s. Some of the critiques here tried to be apologists by saying that in "any country" drug traffickers will be punished harshly such as USA or Holand..but come on guys, will you be raped by the prison guard in USA or Holland? Is that part of the "punishment" in USA? Therefore movie talks about a particular environment that existed in 1970s throughout 1990s. Those of you who defend Turkey by saying that they traveled (as tourists) to Istanbul (the modernized largest mega polis)in the 1990s and 2000s cannot judge objectively. First you should go to eastern turkey, south etc...to towns and villages, second you should visit public places, prisons, government agencies to see what the movie wanted to tell...and not lay down on some tourist resort and promote Turkey on this post. Then, this movie was made based on a 1970s story..and you comment in 2004 based on your recent visit to Istanbul!!!Second, why picturing the movie in Malta would be a problem for some of the critiques here? Aren't most of Hollywood movies that talk about Europe, Afghanistan, Cuba, Iraq, etc pictured elsewhere? Aren't historic movies like Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, Lawrence of Arabia and many many more movies were pictured in places like Morocco or Spain? Does that make a difference? In general its a good movie. It has a message...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie that made director Alan Parker really famous tells the true -if somewhat exaggerated - story of Billy Hayes (Brad Davis), who got thrown into a hellish Turkish prison after he was caught smuggling hashish. The movie starts off by setting up the historical context. The first thing that you see is Billy and his hubby Susan (Irene Miracle) reading about Janis Joplin's death in the paper. But once he gets arrested, then things get ugly. You'll need a strong stomach to watch this movie. That of course means that they did really well with it in every way. Oliver Stone was one of the screenwriters. Also starring Randy Quaid, John Hurt, and Bo Hopkins.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brutal masterpiece with powerful performances all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely Alan Parker's best film to date which was blessed with Oliver Stone's well-deserved Oscar winning script and an unforgettable soundtrack. The film follows the true and amazingly frightening story of one American William Hayes who was busted in Turkey for trying to smuggle lousy two kilos of hash and was jailed right into the living hell of the Turkish prison. What I liked about the film is its serious political tones that are all dealt so expertly and really got to the bottom of this true event. The acting by Brad Davis was perfect (why did this actor, could I say, vanished?) and is supported by strong actors like John Hurt and Randy Quaid. With one memorable scene after another, this film is unforgettable experience all the way through the brutal (but happy) ending. Don't miss this classic. Highly Recommended 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Speaking from the experience of someone who lived in Turkey for 3 years, this movie in spine-chillingly accurate. Brad Davis does an Oscar-winning job portraying Billy Hayes and his experiences in Turkey, and though I never had any run-ins with the Turkish police, their attitudes and slovenliness are very true, as well as their stupidity. This film is so good that it should be required viewing for anyone between the ages of 15 to 35 who is planning a trip to the Middle-East as a warning of what can happen if you violate a foreign country's laws. I recommend this film highly!!</fullReview>
