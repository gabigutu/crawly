		<shortDescription>Why anyone would not like this movie is beyond me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. I laughed so hard during this movie. I've heard a lot of bad reviews for this movie, and I can't believe what some people have said. Apparently some copies of this movie were taped over with that godawful Jennifer Aniston debacle "Picture Perfect", because that is the only explanation that I have for the people who have said those things. Seriously, Old School has some of the funniest scenes in movie history...and I've seen a LOT of movies. Mandatory for all movie fans to see. One of the greatest movies ever created! If you haven't seen this movie yet, go get it NOW! Buy it, rent it, borrow it, steal it, whatever, just see it somehow. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Welcome return to Reckless Abandon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caught a preview showing last night, and I'm a little surprised myself to report that the aptly named Old School is actually a welcome return to a formula all but abandoned by Hollywood for much of the past couple of decades - that of the unapologetic, raucous, cheap laughs for cheap-laughs sake, male-bonding fraternity picture. It is Animal House. It is Porky's. It is every cliche one comes to expect from such a picture - from wild frat house parties to girls wrestling in KY jelly. And, strangely enough, it delivers... with a good cast and a fresh twist. For the group of guys that assemble to start the fraternity that is the heart of Old School are all in their early to mid thirties. They are family men. They are husbands. They are fathers. They are boyfriends involved in serious relationships. They have all grown up.Or so thought Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson), the "Godfather" of this return to the dorm comedy. When Mitch returns from a business trip to find that his girlfriend (Juliette Lewis) has been hiding from him a rather unnerving secret sex life, the guy begins to question the choices he's made in his life. And his friends are there to help. Best friend and self-made successful businessman Beanie (played with perfect comic timing by Vince Vaughn) suggests they take advantage of Mitch's new found freedom and start a fraternity. And it isn't long before every disillusioned and disenfranchised thirtysomething wants to join - to either recreate their days of reckless youth, or finally belong after years of being an outsider.Among such misanthropes is Frank the Tank, a character that Will Ferrell makes his own. Literally baring all for the camera, Ferrell, like Saturday night live alum John Belushi before him, plays the wild but affable frat brother - the sad clown, the loveable loser. Ferrell gets all the best lines, but a few are reserved for the sardonic Vaughn. Wilson, to his credit, plays it straight, and the supporting cast (including Leah Remini, Artie Lange, and even the usually annoying Andy Disk in a hilarious cameo) is quite good.Certainly, Old School is not Oscar material. It's not meant to be. And it makes no pretension to comedy of the kind that My Big Fat Greek wedding brought back into vogue. This is not a feel-good romantic comedy. But it is also not to be dismissed as some insipid throwaway college romp. Old School is intentionally sophomoric (all the more so, as it is director Todd Phillips' second big studio comedy). It is genuinely funny in parts, and a healthy hour and a half return to those days of reckless abandon that many of us dreamt we either had back - or had had in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raunch Supreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like the tradition of the raunchy flicks of the 80s, Old School encompasses the age old tradition of tactless and tasteless film creation. Buy the oddity of the situation, this is one of those films I can tolerate. Mid-life malaise couldn't have been drawn better in the lives of Mitch, Frank and Beanie. Men who serve no purpose in society, especially to their significant others. But that's the significance of the frat house. No, it isn't about being drunk and hitting on 19-year-old girls, its about reaffirming your role in society and making the inner soul feel good and relaxed. So, say what you want about the random nudity and cussing, this film is a life affirming film for all men hitting their 30s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can you not like this??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank (Will Ferrell), Beenie (Vince Vaughn) and Mitch (Luke Wilson) three men who form a fraternity to legally stay in the house Mitch just purchased. This movie is jam packed with endless comedy of course it's Will Ferrell you can't help but laugh at the dude every time you see him. Old School when it hit DVD was the number one rented movie in North America thats quiet good for a movie anyone barely heard of when it first came out. But this movie caught the eyes of many fans. It should have a higher rating but I guess some people thought it was average. but to tell the truth it kicked some major comedy's to the curve. Not using so much of a teenage scene they conquered the mix of adulthood with college students forming a fan base for both a younger and older audience. By younger I mean 16 and up but usually movies either aim for 16 to 25 years of age. But this movie provides an entertainment that everyone can enjoy yes even your grandma. This movie definitely deserves a 10 and I have the power to do that. Buy this movie for god sakes it's a great movie to add to the comedy collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but a solid comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others, I heard a lot of buzz about "Old School" before it was released. Things like "it's the new animal house" or "an instant classic". Well, unfortunately that didn't turn out to be the case. However, that doesn't mean its a bad movie. In fact, I loved it and would highly recommend it.As someone in the same age group as the main characters, perhaps I related too much, but the idea is great: Three 30-something guys who are solidly on the path of a normal, mature life (marriage, kids, real job, etc...) decide to start a fraternity and recapture their college glory days. No, there's no real reason to do this, and no, its not realistic at all. But who cares? Anyone who has ever been to a raging college party, done a few beer bongs and whippits, screamed along with some loud music, and hooked up with a random coed can immediately relate to this film. Not to mention there really are some gut-busting funny scenes throughout. Luke Wilson is the perfect actor for the steady, reserved professional guy. Will Ferrell is hilarious of course, and Vince Vaughn does what he does so well, playing the instigator trying to help a best friend have fun again. Unfortunately one of his funniest scenes only made it to the deleted scenes section of the DVD.Which brings me to my main gripe with this movie: what was left on the cutting room floor. The deleted scenes, which can be seen on the DVD of course, aren't just trivial sections that you can understand were cut, some of them are classic. The movie was only an hour and a half long, and for the life of me I can't figure out why the 10 minutes of deleted footage didn't remain. I think some of them really would've changed the entire feel of the movie. The last act kind of changes into this "Rushmore"-ish Wes Anderson knock off, and I think at least a few of the deleted scenes would've helped it make more sense.Despite that, this movie ranks alongside Dumb &amp; Dumber, Meet the Parents, Kingpin, and American Pie as one of the best comedies of the last decade or so in my humble opinion. No it's not a classic, but it will stand the test of time as a very good comedy that you'll laugh at with each replay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Comedy in the past 5 years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best comedy since Tommy Boy. Every college educated male between the ages of 25-50 knows someone just like Frank and Beanie. Absolutely hilarious. Will Farrell is perfect as Frank but Vince Vaughn steals the show. Half of everything Beanie says in this movie is just classic. The plot goes a little off towards the end, but it doesn't matter because my friends and I have been repeating some of the lines for the last 2 years. With all the really lame comedies that have come out in the past 5 years it is nice to see something that will stand the test of time- a modern Animal House. A little too cheesy towards the end but still a top 10 comedy of all time and a must own on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An hilarious comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Old School yesterday night on a french channel completely by chance. I knew nothing about it. It's a wonderful movie. I hadn't laughed like this since years. The main characters are caricatures but hilarious (especially Franck the tank...), the story is completely stupid (but fantastic) and the parties these thirty year old men who don't want to grow up organize are contagious and push you to go back to university with a good beer... Some celebrities make successful appearances (Juliette Lewis, Sean William Scott...) playing completely deranged characters, adding energy and fun to this well rhythmic comedy.Old School reminds me Fight Club for the notorious "Godfather" as famous in this high school as Tyler Durden and a lot of incredibly funny sequences of this movie would be adopted by Monty Python themselves.And above all, Old Scholl spares us an horrible ending like : "Well, I was a child, making mistakes, but now I understand a lot of things, honey, and I want to go back with you, our house, kids, dogs, canaries and God knows what else...". This film remains faithful to its principles and THAT'S GREAT!! What else can I say : see this movie and be in a good mood for the rest of the day; I'm gonna see it once more now.Thank you Todd Phillips.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast turns old material into fresh laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Slight Spoilers*Is this a classic? No, not even in the "frat comedy" genre, but it *is* funny! And, for a comedy, that's enough.Some jokes are worn, and some set-ups will make you groan. But there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments thanks to the fantastic cast.The material may be old but you understand immediately that Vaughn, Wilson and Ferrell are having a blast making this film. Their energy permeates the movie. From their delivery to body language to timing, all three are on target. The supporting cast of unusual characters adds to the joy.My favorite is Vaughn. Though the movie revolves around Wilson's character, Vaughn is the glue that keeps it all together. Leah Remini has a too brief turn as Vaughn's wife and steals her few scenes. Jeremy Piven is a wonderfully hateful Dean.Lewis' character was the only weak point. I know she was meant to be one of the mechanisms leading to Wilson's new "house", but it seemed weak and out of place.If you're not offended by raunchy comedy, this movie will satisfy! Rent it, grab some popcorn and enjoy! Be careful drinking your cola though, you may end up snorting it out your nose.6 out of 10.</fullReview>

With the help of his friends Frank (Will Ferrell)and Beanie (Vince Vaughn); whom help Mitch start his own frat house. Mitch is now promoted to The Godfather. After they round up all the members and make a 80 year old do push ups. The Dean Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Priven) tries to shut them down. "Old School" is a smart comedy with tons of humor. Todd Phillips who directed Road Trip and Starsky and Hutch based on the 70's show all three are funny, has done a tremendous job packing plenty of good/bad humor. My final rating 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the ultimately guy comedy of all time. I'll be quoting this movie until i'm 80 years old. The plot is original and hilarious and you can watch it from front to back 10 times in a row and still laugh every time. I'm a huge Will Ferrell fan and he doesn't disappoint. As Frank "the tank" he manages to be one of the funniest characters in movie history. This is a movie that most guys can relate to. If you've ever wanted to get back to the days of partying and girls, yet are stuck in the boredom of everyday life, then this movie will have you rolling around. Hecks, i'm even contemplating starting up my own fraternity. I can only hope that there will be a sequel to this one. I'll be the first in line to see it when it opens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old School- Same Nonsense *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would expect this film being created by lower functioning junior high school students.The premise of three guys opening up a fraternity home near the school where they graduated from is absolutely ridiculous to begin with.The only good thing here is Jeremy Piven, who has personal reasons for wanting to break up this nonsense. As the dean of the school, he tries but the writing is so bad and inane that his reasoning soon falls off the charts.The film also follows the love lives of these 3 jerks-Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell and Luke Wilson. Each story is more absurd than the other. Well, Wilson falls for the boss's daughter. That could have been played up more as far as the reaction of the boss finding out. The boss doesn't even find out that his daughter has been sleeping with the Wilson character.The picture defies logic. Having an 89 year old frat member dropping dead in the middle of exercise is just too stupid to discuss. At his funeral, Vaughn's comments that all old people die, said in front of an elderly woman is heartless and in poor taste.How much longer must we be subjected to Hollywood's goal of trying to satisfy the youth by coming up with films that lack sanity?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man in his mid-thirties is restless, disheartened, and fed up with life in general after breaking up with his longtime girlfriend. He moves into a house on a college campus where, against his better judgment but with the persuasion of his equally depressed, unhappily married buddies, he starts an unofficial fraternity. To their surprise, the fraternity turns into a huge success that allows the three of them to recapture the spirit of their beloved college years. Intentionally goofy, college-oriented comedy from the director of Road Trip is uneven at times, but the cast is good and there are often some very funny moments. **?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Luke Wilson (as Mitch), Will Ferrell (as Frank), and Vince Vaughn (as Beanie) star as three dumb old dudes who open a "frat house" and act stupid. But, this is no "Animal House". Think frat, fat, and fag jokes. And, they're not even funny. Snoop Dogg and James Carville appear as lame versions of themselves. If that's not enough to turn you off, be forewarned - the performers you'd least like to see naked take off the most clothes, with Mr. Ferrell's bare ass hanging around for an interminable length of time. Apologies are in order.

		<fullReview>A group of middle aged guys with various problems in their life decide to try and relive their college days by forming a new fraternity composed of the aged, the misfits and the discontented.That's the basic premise behind Old School, which is a pretty standard comedy. There are some laughs in it, perhaps more than in several comedies I've seen recently, but it's a rather uninspired story. The characters are fairly stereotypical and not well developed, though I guess I shouldn't expect too much from this kind of movie.I didn't dislike this movie, and it is a reasonable watch when you want a few laughs and don't want anything too heavy, but it's nothing really special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame and pointlessly vulgar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with, why make a comedy that is for the most of it not even funny? If your idea of a good laugh is Will Ferrel showing off his white fat ass running naked in the streets this film may be promising. But something is really wrong in this screaming advertisement of "male freedom" of brainless vulgarities parading as "real men, untamed and free" to go get ass drunk and something really wrong with imposing the idea that for men to have a good time must exclude marriage and children and certainly should include blow jobs as the utmost desirable form of sex.This is not a comedy; this is mental birth control with the target audience being the white race already on its way to extinction.I may give this movie more than it deserves on its own right, I might have tolerated it a bit better if this was the first of this kind, but then again, it was such a condensed "piece" that it definitely blew the fuse with me.I simply refuse to be manipulated by something this unoriginal and tediously forced. Ever sat in a company where you had to keep smiling too long when no part of you felt like and had to laugh at gross jokes of a boss afraid of the repercussions? This is how this movie felt like.I quit after half an hour ? too late.</fullReview>

This film has so many wee lines and scenes which you may not even notice the first time you see it but become hilarious and unforgettable after several viewings with your friends over a few beers. One example is the way Ferrell reacts after (SPOILER?) taking his first beer at the party and there is of course the well known brilliant consequences of these beers, not to mention the scene with the tranquilizer dart!

		<fullReview>Usually i try to write reviews about movies i don't like. Cause its just more fun. But since this is my favorite comedy i've decided to make an exception. I think that this movie has been under rated by the voters. This is by far the funnest 'teen' movie I've seen. The characters are classic, the plot ingenious, and the comedy hilarious. Its a movie of great quotes, which have been taken and adopted by many people. The acting in this movie is excellent. I strongly advise that anyone who calls themselves a fan of true comedy to watch this. It is definitely worth it. MY personal favorite part of the movie is just about any part which includes Frank the Tank, especially the part where he goes to the part and hits the beer bong, goes absolutely crazy and ends up going streaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the better if the not the funniest of the 'frat pack' movies. I love 'animal house', and this movie basically pays tribute to it. It's probably the closest thing to a sequel to 'animal house that we're ever going to get. It's definitely a great movie to watch with your college friends even if you hate fraternities. The movie starts out funny but it loses steam. Most of the characters are funny, and Will Farrell is probably the funniest of the cast. Cuthbert is smoking hot with her cameo which is alright by me.The director has some funny jokes but it's not enough to reach a full potential (like 'road trip'). If he took more time with the jokes and the plot then this movie could of been a classic 'frat pack' movie.This is definitely a guilty pleasure with some laugh out loud jokes and funny situations. The movie loses steam when the plot balances itself between being serious and being funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a non-teen movie, '' Old School'' contains the ingredients we didn't like in teen movies, i.e. vulgarity, obscenity and poor jokes. This movie is even worse than American Pie 2 and 3. Don't see it, it's not funny and can make you totally idiot. If you live in the U.S., this movie was rated R for strong language and nudity. But if you live overseas, be cautious with your children (if you have) because the movie was allowed to all audiences (in most of European countries). Prevent them from watching this awful and very vulgar recipe. All you will find in it is rubbish at all levels. Not even a piece of laughter. In the same category, avoid movies like ''Not another teen movie'', ''American Pie 3'', ''Van Wilder Public Relations ''. Rate : 1 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is not very original but it fulfills its purpose as a comedy, since one just can't stop laughing through it.It is based on the common fraternity comedies, but with a little twist that the main characters are now in their 30's. The movie doesn't go too much into detail, but it isn't supposed to be believable either.We get a bunch of different kinds of characters who all are funny in their own way. Besides the main characters I really liked to see well known actors playing small parts, such as Simon Helberg, Juliette Lewis and Jeremy Piven.I like how this movie mainly sticks to the comedy and keeps the dramatic, learning moments to a minimum. Just as I love that at the end not all of them decided to "grow up" but Will Ferrel's character keeps on having his fun.

		<fullReview>Old School (2003): Dir: Todd Phillips / Cast: Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Juliette Lewis, Jeremy Piven: Plays like a followup to the superior National Lampoon's Animal House celebrating the decay of human decency. It is a comedy about carefree memories of generations gone by. Luke Wilson arrives home from a business trip and discovers his girlfriend engaged in an orgy. He moves out and finds a place near university campus. Vince Vaughn runs a stereo store and believes that he has the answers to their problems. They will start a fraternity and relive years gone by. Will Ferrell is their recently married friend who streaks naked through the neighbourhood after a drunken celebration at the frat house. Directed by Todd Phillips in the same vein as his Road Trip. Wilson plays off the doormat disposition while Vaughn throws out one-liners. Ferrell steals the film with a hilarious performance but we sympathize as he gradually wrecks his marriage. Juliette Lewis plays Wilson's ex girlfriend in a role that is hardly broad. Jeremy Piven plays the young snotty Dean but he has none of the comic conviction of a Dean Wormer. The humour drains when the climax involves settling down and studying. In National Lampoon's Animal House the fraternity is kicked off campus and they wreck the home coming parade. Recalling past events deserves more than a hopeless outlook on life. Score: 7 ? / 10</fullReview>

Only 1 of the 3 leads has any comic sensibility and his part (will ferrell) is played so over the top that it's almost pathetic. Vaughn and Wilson prove again they have no business in a comedy, Piven, usually funny is also wasted.The plot and screenplay, if you can call it that is something a 6th grade lunchroom could've come up with. But it's obvious that this movie is not about plot, but about jokes. The only problem is the premise is so pathetic and just down right stupid that the jokes fail.I know I am in the majority here, but I have seen the movie 3 times now, and have not so much as chuckled once, let alone laugh.

		<fullReview>This is one of the movies that started off the "Frat Pack". Director Todd Phillips made a hell of a comedy movie. Although not consistently funny, the movie does have its iconic moments that can be compared to later comedies.It had funny characters, great chemistry between the actors, quotable lines, a true classic comedic gold.Sean William Scott's cameo was one of the funniest scenes in the film, it would be awesome to see him more often in more "Frat Pack" movies.Will Ferrell was definitely the star of the film and had the best scenes. One of his funniest performances yet.I cant really say much about the film, the movie speaks for itself. If you haven't watched it yet, then what are you waiting for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can you not like this classic?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it is impossible to not like this classic comedy, jam packed with action and funny jokes from the get go. Of course Will Ferell plays a huge roll in this movie being amazing, when paired with Luke Wilson, who is not cracking jokes and being funny all the time, makes up for a perfect comedy movie. Maybe it could have had more party scenes, since it was a movie about a high school fraternity made by 3 grown men after all, but nonetheless the movie is a great watch if you like Will Ferell and comedies in general. A major upset for me, however, was the fact that Luke Wilson's character didn't actually try to make a move on his bosses daughter, which he previously had hooked up with, that would be a cool part that could have been incorporated into the movie to make it even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK comedy near being kind of good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-6/10Old school is a funny movie with a funny cast, maybe not the funniest movie ever but with a nice plot and a film that doesn't have to make you laugh to be good, this is worth a watch. I did think maybe I overrated this at first but the film is actually pretty good with some nice jokes added into an ever revealing storyline, and with some physical comedy actors to go, this is film has quality. I felt the film was Solidly OK and here below is why I felt that about it all.The story is a college fraternity type film, and you may be thinking " we have had this all before" ,but this has a twist, the main characters aren't college students, they have jobs, families and they never get to party, well until now. The pacing is good, the movie not too long and the although the jokes aren't a plenty and takes along time for the first funny thing to be said, it still manages to be kind of funny by the end. The story end's in a smart way as well with hints of more high school films coming in but it still remains the working dad's and there house.Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn are the main guys in this and without them I would have rated this poor, although none of them are at comedy best, they still manage to churn out a respectfully funny performance. I did enjoy there support too and the characters that hang around there house are all fun guys, I didn't quite appreciate the acting of the Dean Jeremy Piven, but he doesn't ruin it too much at all.Todd Phillips in a sense runs the whole thing and contributes to the script but also directs, and I felt without the firm direction of Phillips, the film would suffer more so hats off to his contribution to the film. Some funny stunts they do can be hilarious and make you genuinely chuckle, one such part is at Vince Vaughn's sons birthday party when Ferrell(MAYBE A SPOILER HERE FOR SOME) get's well, darted by a zoo keeper and I won't ruin the sequence but it made me laugh more than at any other time in the movie.The film's main bad point is that it isn't all THAT funny and jokes do occasionally miss the mark badly, it doesn't make this film bad at all but contributes to it's lower mark. I also felt maybe the characters could have put more back into it as although they are funny, people such as Ferrell should be much more funny and do a lot more of what we have seen before of him. Finally the script isn't all so solid but I won't mention too much about it because that would just drag it right down, which is doesn't deserve.I think those into these kind of early 2000's college comedies should enjoy and although it is a different type crudeness wise to things like American Pie and such (mainly because they main characters are mature adults), it may not please everyone, but should overall. Same again for people who shouldn't watch, the film isn't afraid of being itself and letting it's hormones go so if you dislike crude, better stay away.Overall I give it a 6/10 meaning it is Solidly a OK movie but offers very little more than this, my rating is stretching it to it's highest point, maybe I felt nice on the day. If you a teen watch it because it has all the hallmarks of teen moves today, but another thing is if you were a teen or in college in the early 2000's, it should be a massive nostalgic trip back to them day's, oh and might make you laugh.</fullReview>

So Mitch's buddies Mitch (Will Ferrell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) decide to start a fraternity at the house. That doesn't stop the dean from trying to kick Mitch out.This is the break out movie role for Will Ferrell. It's always funny to have a drunk naked white guy on the loose. It's also a break out for director Todd Phillips. It's charming. It's hilarious. It's stupid, and it's got its heart in the right place. The three guys have great fraternal chemistry.

		<fullReview>Written and directed by Todd Philips, Old School is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. Starring Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughn, three middle aged men decide to begin a fraternity at the nearby college in their hometown. As they try to relive their college glory days, they have to convince the Dean of the school (Jeremy Piven) that they are qualified enough to start their own chapter. As the movie advances you see that the guys must find a balance between their busy home and work life, and then their new re-born college life. A comedy throughout this movie has a great ending and is a must see for anyone who is looking for a good laugh.</fullReview>

So when I am in Antarctica hanging out with Kiwi's and one of them shouts "You're my boy Blue!" after downing a shot, you know this movie is great. We didn't make it to streaking through the quad, but we talked about it. :) See it if you haven't. Also there is a 10 line minimum, which means I will tell you about a boondoggle. So it is Saturday night and I am at the bar because it is cloudy out. So I get to talking to Phil and he works in the fire department. He has never seen aurora so he wants to drive out of town to see them. But the thing is, you need a permit to get to the cool areas over the hill and see some real aurora. I actually have a permit and can take guests, so I say, yeah sure lets go. It is cloudy so I don't think we will see much. So everyone is tipsy but Phil so he drives, we get a flat tire on the way up. Have to go fix that...which was a PITA, multiple stops, like an hour in -20deg F, then we get up there, like a 2 mile drive on volcanic rock and everyone is speechless it is so amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inferior recipe for a good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are comedies that rely on cleverly placed wit, comedies that rely on characters, raunchy comedies that try to construct a new set up with likable characters, or ones with a familiar set up with likable characters. Then there are ones that simply compile caricatures to aimlessly wander around their screenplay of odds and ends. This is the primary formula for Todd Phillips' Old School.Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) is a successful attorney, who is perhaps too consumed in his work. This becomes evident to him when he returns home to discover his girlfriend takes part in wild sex orgies. They obviously break up, Mitch is upset, and then goes house-hunting before closing the deal on a house not too far away from Harrison University. His best friends, Frank (Will Ferrell) and Bernard (Vince Vaughn) get the ingenious idea to relive their college days, reelect themselves at the top of the social circuit, and drink, party, and have sex as much as possible. This, of course, becomes crucial to their already well-constructed home-lives, where Frank has just gotten married and Bernard runs a successful chain of electronic stores.While its main characters are adults, Phillips' gives the screenplay of Old School a "frat-boy comedy" injection with frat-boy comedy humor. There's a distinct lack of humanity within the characters, who talk mostly to service the vague plot and not at leisure, and for that matter, they are so dense and unsatisfying one questions whether or not they are the ideal kind you would like to see in a comedy in the first place.Old School is yet another modern-day clone of a more successful seventies comedy that doesn't need to be named. It's the kind of movie that was amazing in its heyday, still relatively holds up today, but has been done so many times by inferior works that some jokes may seems tired and worn. That film is a great work of comedic timing and characters. Old School is just a vague guide on the recipe for a good comedy.Starring: Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Jeremy Piven, and Elisha Cuthbert. Directed by: Todd Phillips.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old School is a comedy that stars stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell as three thirty-somethings who seek to re-live their college days by starting a fraternity, and the tribulations they encounter in doing so in order to avoid the problems of the present.The story was written by Court Crandall and directed by Todd Phillips.Old School has a premise wherein three men relive their carefree college years by killing off as many brain cells as possible in this movie. Mitch returns home from a less-than-pleasant business trip one evening to discover his wife, Heidi is involved in a threesome with two blindfolded strangers. Feeling less than welcome at home after this, Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college.Two of his old college buddies,Beanie and Frank, stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at Mitch's place, despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa,while Beanie and his wife, Lara, are busy with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch, and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living, he's able to trick out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the school's leading party spot, which raises the ire of Mr.Pritchard, a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch, Frank, and Beanie's abuse when they were all students.Mr.Pritchard arranges to have Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district, but Beanie and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their headquarters. Mitch, however, is not enthusiastic about the idea, especially as he's trying to impress Nicole, a beautiful divorcée who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's "care-free" lifestyle. Old School is an definitely an over-the-top comedy that is not totally hilarious although it had some funny moments.The theme about escapism was somewhat not really that impressed me about the movie since the premise about the trio of buds who yearn to go back to the past in order to avoid the present only brings them to more problems.Aside from that,most of the humor involved is that's somewhere below the belt.And most of all,it became an exercise of laughs,whether funny or not,in the course of the film.Overall,Old School is a comedy that tries to help you escape from the present troubles of life but it nevertheless fails to deliver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never quite gets off the ground . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most distressing thing that happens when you're watching a comedy with a talented cast is to arrive midway through the movie and find yourself asking: 'Why am I not laughing?' That was the point I reached while watching "Old School", a raunchy comedy, with a wonderful cast that works hard but just can't seem to get the material off the ground."Old School" is a college frat house comedy, a far descendant of National Lampoon's Animal House, but focusing on a group of guys who are pushing 40 and can't seem to let go of the thrill of their college fraternity days. They are likable guys. There is Beanie (Vince Vaughn), a family man who feels trapped. There is Mitch (Luke Wilson), whose life changes after he catches his nymphomaniac girlfriend (Juliette Lewis) hosting an orgy in their bedroom. And there's Frank (Will Ferrell) once known as "Frank the Tank", a once-legendary party animal who is about get married and settle into a life of hanging curtains and picking through carpet samples.What lies at the heart of these guys is that they can't (or won't) let go of their glory years of wild parties, beer bongs and easy women. They refuse to grow up and move on. Mitch, who owns and appliance store with Beanie, buys a house near Harrison College, his old alma mater. However, after a particularly successful party, he is informed by the college's Dean Gordon Prichard (Jeremy Piven) that the house is zoned specifically for college social functions. He also reminds Mitch how he and his buddies use to pick on him back in college and with that, he happily presents an eviction notice.What to do? The guys come up with a plan to keep the house and rekindle their campus lifestyle. Through an administrative loophole they find that they are able to form a fraternity, which they do out of misfit student, middle-aged co-workers, and an elderly retiree who is somewhere north of 90. Many of these guys (including Mitch, Beanie and Frank) are not even students at Harrison, but that's part of the loophole, you see.What follows is suppose to be a raucous college campus comedy but the movie is so erratic that it never finds its center. Director Todd Phillips, who has made better films than this like "The Hangover" and "Starkey and Hutch", missteps here because his scenes don't come together out of characters or situations. They are a series of gags built out of raunchiness and bad taste. That's not a bad thing, but when the scenes don't come together, it just feels like a series of sketches.The lack of drive keeps the movie from building any kind of momentum. Plus, the characters, especially Mitch played by Luke Wilson, is so laid back that we never really understand how he got his reputation as a legendary party animal. Vince Vaughn's Beanie is believable as a party animal but he is so angry that you wonder how he ever has time to have fun. And Frank is such a genial good guy that we want him to break away from this pack and live his own life, or his own movie. He's the butt of embarrassments, especially when he gets drunk at a party and streaks down the middle of the highway. He has a scene late in the film when he is hit with a tranquilizer dart and ruins a kid's birthday party that is so labored and so mean that I found myself feeling sorry for the kid.I know I sound like a grump. I realize that I'm suppose to just sit back and enjoy these guys, but the movie never really goes anywhere. For me, I just didn't laugh very much. Wait! I did laugh at one gag involving the pledges who are required to tie cinder blocks to a certain portion of their anatomy and then drop them off a ledge. The payoff was so unexpected that I laughed. It was the one genuine laugh in the whole movie. If the screenwriter could have built on that, they might have had something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of "Old School"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Hangover" Director Todd Phillips delivers a sort of "Animal House" throwback with "Old School". The film tells the story of Mitch, played by Luke Wilson, whose life basically falls apart before his eyes. He then decides to move in to a house on a college campus. Mitch's friends Frank and Beanie, played by Ferrell and Vaughn, convince him to start a fraternity within the college campus. Hilarity, of course, ensues. I found myself laughing a fair amount in this movie. There were a couple moments that were made me laugh hysterically, but overall the laughs came pretty moderately for me. Luke Wilson is great at playing. . .well the straight man - I feel that that's all he plays in movies unfortunately. And Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn are excellent as Wilson's flawed but fun friends. Overall I found the movie pretty darn hilarious. Even though some of the subplot stuff was rather annoyingly predictable, the movie still managed to make me laugh a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather dumb movie with some very funny moments...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You do not watch "Old School" if you are looking for intellectual stimulation. Also, while it's got some very funny moments (such as the CPR scene), it really isn't a very good film, as the plot really makes no sense and the movie is wildly uneven.Three irresponsible jerks (Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell) have lives that are either a mess or they're about to make a mess. All three characters (especially Wilson and Vaughn) REALLY make no sense--like their characters are only about 50% written. For example, Wilson is supposed to be a really nice and decent guy--so why does he always agree to do such immoral things?! Vaughn is married and spends most of the film being a major jerk and encouraging his friends to be man-whores---like he's vicariously living through these guys. Huh?! Well, the three WHO ARE NOT STUDENTS decide to start a fraternity(?!) but Dean Wormer (or whoever) is a kill-joy who wants to shut down this den of debauchery. And the rest of the film is basically "Animal House" and "Revenge of the Nerds"--just not as original and not as good.What is good about the film? Well, a few bits here and there are quite funny--and most involve Will Ferrell. In fact, Ferrell came off best in the film because his character was purely comic relief and didn't need to make sense! So, when Ferrell runs naked through the campus, it is funny because it is appealing to a low-brow and primal sense of humor. 'Blue' was also quite funny, as this character was purely for comic relief. But as for the rest of the cast, they often tried to bounce between comedy and drama--and it just didn't work. They came off as incomplete and clichéd. Not a bad movie if you just want brainless raunchy comedy but it could have been so much better...easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Todd Phillips trumps his rookie effort of Road Trip with his sophomoric effort in Old School. He shows that he can really push the limits of his actors, especially his three leads.Luke Wilson play Mitch Martin, who just broke up with a girlfriend and needs a new start. Wilson plays Mitch brilliantly, making him a feeling awkward type of guy. Will Ferrell pushes his limits as Frank Ricard, who gets married and turns back into his old self becoming the crazy frat boy. Vince Vaughn is more responsible as Beanie Campbell, who owns an electronic store. This is when Vaughn becomes the fast talking character that he is now known for these days. The three leads all have great chemistry and play off of each other real brilliantly making these characters funny but believable.Ellen Pompeo, Leah Remini, and Perrey Reeves do fine jobs at playing the female counterparts to the male leads. While they do fine jobs, they are not given that much to do as they are all supporting performances.Director Todd Phillips shows us how he can make a movie funny, believable, and tell the story. He is not afraid to push the limits of his actors. I think he has shown some great mainly with this movie, along with The Hangover and Starsky &amp; Hutch, shows us that he can make good comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Luke Wilson gets others to pledge to keep his home safe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Todd Phillips usually does good stuff with comedy material and Old School remains one of his better efforts, thanks largely to the interaction between the three main leads (Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell).Wilson plays Mitch Martin, a man seeking a major change in his life after finding out about his partner's infidelity. This change begins with his new home that just happens to be near a university campus. That's not a problem until, somehow, it is rezoned to be classed as actually ON campus and so needs to be an actual fraternity house. With the help of his friends, Vaughn and Ferrell, Wilson gathers a ragtag bunch of students who really only help create the numerous parties that the guys throw as often as they can. But things take their toll as relationships are affected, students put at risk and the dean (Jeremy Piven) tries to oust them from their comfortable zone of irresponsibility.Alongside the main actors mentioned, Phillips also gets the likes of Juliette Lewis, Andy Dick, The Dan Band (yet again), Elisha Cuthbert, Seann William Scott and many other familiar faces to take part in the proceedings. This is very much a film all about fun, nothing more and nothing less, and everyone gets their turn. Wilson may not be the most charismatic leading man but he's likable enough and reacts well to the situations that he's put in by fast-talking Vaughn and dumb but sweet Ferrell (Frank "The Tank" is a definite highlight, whether he's streaking or disrupting a children's birthday party).The pacing is just fine and the script is peppered with just enough laugh out loud moments to keep you happy in between the multitude of minor chuckles so comedy fans should really enjoy this one. Yes, it could have been a LITTLE tighter in places and the finale is a little bit lame compared to preceding events but it's all still good, cheeky entertainment from a director who knows just how to give audiences what they want.See this if you like: The Hangover, Road Trip, Animal House.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Similar to the later Wedding Crashers, about guys who don't wanna grow up, but the joke here that three miserable guys who wanna have a little fun is kind of funny.Luke Wilson does his usual routine as the kind of slow guy who gets a horrifying wake up call. He's got the nice guy routine down pat but it must be kind of stifling. Will Ferrell gets to go completely insane but you don't mind it as much because it is counterbalanced by the fact that he is basically playing a more realistic person and not some sort of parody like he did in Anchorman.Vince Vaugn is actually why you should at least look at this as a quite successful comedy. He gets to play all variables, the motor-mouth, the guy who says the most inappropriate things and ultimately the brains of the outfit. Like him or not, he does make an impression.The movie in itself is pretty tame, as I thought that it would be a tribute to all things apolitically correct. The first half hour is hilarious but it gets a little watered down by the end, where you get the obligatory underdog vs. evil plot that is as old as the frat movie itself. There is surprisingly little explicit sexual situations in the movie as well, although a sequence with Andy Dick, some women and root vegetables almost made me wanna say: Oh, come on! So, almost worth the rental and definitely funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You forgot your birthday, didn't you?"; This party is overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Todd Phillips' most recent movie, The Hangover, has been getting really positive reviews (Roger Ebert gave it ***1/2), is already for the IMDb users one of the top 250 movies of all time and well for me it looks quite attractive (liked a lot the stuff with Mike Tyson from the trailer) and thankfully it will be released in my country just some months after its release in the US (not sure but I think it's coming in August). So I will be seeing The Hangover on the big screen, meanwhile I decided to give a shot to this Todd Phillip movie, the 2003 Old School. I always see the Old School R4 DVD on offer, I liked the other two movies from Todd I saw before (I have desires to re-watch Starsky &amp; Hutch and I hope it is still really good for me and School for Scoundrels was a good if not special entertainment) and it has Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell starring so yes, it was about time to check this movie, I bought its cheap DVD and saw it just today?Old School is never hilarious, quite a disappointing (and overrated ? it has 7.0 in the IMDb user rating) party. Wilson, Vaughn and Ferrell stars as Mitch, Bernard and Frank the tank respectively, the first of them just discovered his girlfriend (sexy Juliette Lewis) in the middle of not her very first orgy, Frank the tank just got married and Bernard, well he has already a family. These three will be partying as soon as the silliest stuff begins, I mean as soon as Mitch gets a new place rapper Snoop Dog will be there, the tank will be running naked through the neighborhood, etc. Both Ferrell and Vaughn have some funny bits (as the movies goes on Vaughn's funny stuff is less and less) but there's nothing really memorable about the fraternity, and in consequence the fraternity vs. the dean stuff doesn't delivers a damn memorable thing. So I saw Old School and I can say it is not something I would like to see again, still Sean William Scott has a cool look as Peppers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never tiresome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favourite comedy of all time.It is filled with so many classic moments. For those old enough you will recognise the style of the numerous 1980s frat movies that you loved as a teenager. The pure genius of the movie was to bring that genre back and age it with you. So the main characters are not spotty teenagers and early 20s undergraduates but 30 somethings looking to recapture a part of their lives where the days were spontaneous and unpredictable, the nights long (with you awake), and the parties drunken.Will Ferrell is awesome in this! My all time best scene is the cameo of Sean William Scott! Love it, love it , love it.In those times where you are drunk just back from partying you will turn this on time and time again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie.I really do - I like the story, I like the characters, I think it's well acted... I really can't find any faults with this film! I can understand that it may not be to everyone's taste - gross-out comedies certainly do have their particular 'target audiences', but compared to some films put into this genre it's really not too bad (White Chicks for example...) This also has the rare distinction of being one of the only films I've seen where Will Ferrell doesn't make me want to rip my own face off, he's actually quite funny here! The birthday party scene with the 'tranq. incident' is hilarious!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best comedy movie ever. It is a clever comedy with clever plot as well. This is a classic for its genre as I've rarely seen something clever as this other than "Accepted-Justin Long", "Orange County-Jack Black" and some classics from 90s and 80s. Any fans of Fight Club should watch this movie because i recommend this movie at the highest degree. Where else can we see something clever but with lot of jokes inside?You may expecting "rules", few twists and of course hilarious jokes from Will Farell, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson.

		<shortDescription>Amazing Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old School is one of my all-time favorite movies. I am a huge fan of Will Farrell an Vince Vaughn, and they were both hilarious. Farrell plays a man who suffers marital problems because he isn't mature enough, making the college life perfect for him. Vaughn is a very successful business man and refuses to fail. He takes running a fraternity very seriously which puts his marriage in jeopardy as well. The movie shows you a very stereotypical view of what college and fraternity life is. The three main characters, Wilson, Farrell, and Vaughn, start up their own fraternity so they can continue living in a house on campus. The entire process is hilarious. They have a very racially and age mixed pledge class. In order to remain as a fraternity, they are forced to pass a series of tests. This just caps the movie off and makes in immensely fun to watch. It is a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old School is full of hilarious scenarios and lines. It's a film which lets you be a part of the fun because of the way the actors just seem to be having such a good time. The story doesn't flow perfectly, but this almost works to the films favor. It tends to make the craziness of some of the scenes work better, in that they come from almost nowhere.The three leads are perfectly cast. Will Ferrell plays one of his most realistic characters to date and still manages to put his unique stamp on it brilliantly. Vaughn is his usual sarcastic, bitter but likable, self. He plays it well and it works in bringing a nice touch to his films. Luke Wilson wasn't quite as likable as he usually manages to come off and this was off-putting to an extent. He doesn't cause huge laughs either but holds his own between two giants of the comedic acting world. Seann William Scott is a nice addition to the film and steals the scene in his one and only.Old School doesn't stand out from other comedies, but you get the impression it never intended to. It is simply another great chance for this fine team of filmmakers to put a different scenario out there for these talented comedians to work with. If all you're looking for is a lot of laughs then this is a film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old School Will</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Old School" is a 2003 comedy from writer/director Todd Phillips ("Road Trip") about a group of middle-aged men who open their own fraternity in hopes of reconnecting with their youth, via copious amounts of booze and girls. It's got a cast that, today, reads like a "Who's Who" of the so-called frat-pack. Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn, namely, re-invent their respective careers by appearing in this movie. Andy Dick shows that he has even less self-respect that we could have ever imagined, but is gut-bustingly hilarious, never-the-less. About a year prior to fading away, Seann William-Scott has a brief role as a pony-wrangler, giving way to one of the most memorable scenes of the movie. Leah Remini actually does something besides "King Of Queens". And Elisha Cuthbert looks really nice in boy-cut underwear.But no one in this film can match the intensity or the sheer hilarity of Will Ferrell. To say the character of Frank -- "The Tank" -- stole the show would be an understatement. Ferrell single-handedly makes the movie worthwhile. Before you could count on him to churn out film after film -- all varying in quality -- every few months, he was still just that guy from "Saturday Night Live" who was relegated to peripheral character status in movies such as "Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery" and "The Ladies Man". That all changed when he stepped into the role of Frank "The Tank" and made "Old School" the hit it was, and the millennial comedic milestone it is today. It's no coincidence, then, that the film just drags without him. Each scene that is missing him, makes you miss him. Really, everyone is playing themselves, but Ferrell is the only one who seems to be willing to go to the limits to deliver. And the great thing about his kind of humor is that it isn't polarizing. no matter who you are, it's hard not to at least snicker a bit at his rambling or antics. His out-of-control boozing, therapy-session outbursts, drug-induced hallucinations and knack for streaking account for 99.99% of the humor in "Old School". What could have been just another throwaway, "Animal House" rip-off, college film, is elevated to classic status thanks to this one character and the actor portraying him. If you want to see Will Ferrell in his prime, where he really started gaining momentum, this is the place to start. I suppose since this is a review of "Old School", I should go a bit more in-depth about the movie itself. But why bother? I already told you about the best part.</fullReview>

Unless you one of those girls who like movies like The Break up.Old School delivers endless comedy from start to finish. But it loses a point for the drop in quality towards the ending.

The mandatory sad emotional parts in the movie are kept to a minimum and don't detract from the rest of the fun. The storyline is tight but without taking itself too seriously. It is obvious that every single one in the cast is having a great time making this movie. Vince Vaughn delivers the best performance of his career, Will Ferrell is awesome as always, and even Luke Wilson who can be annoying at times in movies, is just great all the time.

It was only a 7/10 because it isn't going to go down as a fantastic comedy and I probably won't go out of my way to watch it again. It was a light hearted comedy, very typical of Will Ferrell.Although the film was funny, it wasn't good enough to stand out from the crowd, as did American Pie amongst others.

		<fullReview>This is one of those comedies that requires you to disengage your brain before watching. It doesn't try to be smart or cute, it just tries to be funny ? and I was quite surprised by how well it succeeded. Given that laugh-free comedies such as Wedding Crashers and Bad Santa are considered modern classics, it's difficult to understand why this isn't as highly regarded. I laughed more times at this than I did at those other two combined. There's a nice little take on the Fight Club milieu throughout, the song from the band at the wedding is hilarious, Will Ferrell manages to be only mildly annoying and self-indulgent (back in '03 he wasn't quite as big a name, I suppose) and, while Vince Vaughn is perhaps wasting his talent a little here, he's good in anything he does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun simple comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically this is a great comedy to watch late at night. It's nothing too fancy or original but it's basically good quality entertainment, from a great genre director and a real solid cast, filled with some of the best actors currently active in the genre.The real most surprising thing about "Old School" is its cast. It's not only filled with some great leading actors but also lots of famous faces in small roles and cameos, such as Juliette Lewis, Elisha Cuthbert, Seann William Scott and Harve Presnell, among others. But of course the movie gets carried by the three main leading men; Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. Will Ferrell is such a show stealer! He has the best moments and lines in the movie. And Vince Vaughn once again shows that he is a great actor actually.Perhaps the concept of the movie called for some more and better thought of jokes but nevertheless the movie doesn't feel as if it's not entertaining enough already now. In the end not all of the plot-lines get wrapped up properly or satisfactorily but you know, in a comedy you just tend to forgive this sort of storytelling flaws.What I liked about the movie is that it greatly mixes the comical and the more dramatic and personal elements of the movie. The one doesn't distract from the other, which is I think due to the professional genre directing of genre specialist Todd Phillips, who also directed movies such as "Road Trip" and "Starsky &amp; Hutch". It's probably not a comedy that will go in the books as the most hilarious or best one of all time but the movie serves its purpose and that's to simply entertaining the viewer, with more than a couple of good laughs.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank is about to get married! Mitch has just gone through a bad break-up! And Bernie is married with kids! So what they do is start a fraternity at the local college, and use Mitch's new house as headquarters. They have many pledges, some from the college, and some are just guys wanting to have fun. The fraternity starts out well, but is compromised by the dean, an old rival of the trios from when they were younger.The dean, Pritchard (played by Jeremy Piven), gives the boys an ultimatum. They must take a test to see whether their frat house is able to stay or go. In the meanwhile, one of their pledges dies in a KY wrestling match. Because of that unfortunate event, they do not receive the percentile they need to stay.A scandal erupts! Dean Pritchard, it turns out, has bribed the student government president to revoke the fraternity's status. In the end though, good prevails and Dean Pritchard is fired. The trio find a new location at Dean Pritchard's former residence.A great film. This is the one that started the whole "Frat Pack" phenomena, and I know we can't wait until Part 2 comes out in 2009.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Flick....It has its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old School is a solid college-themed comedy. The catch is that the main characters are all grown men in their 30's seeking to relive their hard-partying days. If you're not a big "Frat Pack" fan (I'm Not), you probably won't consider "Old School" a classic, but it's still worth watching. This film has all the raunch required by its genre, but it doesn't go overboard, as many films of its kind tend to do. "Old School" will make you chuckle quite a bit, and even laugh-out-loud a few times, but it falls quite a bit short of "Animal House."Will Farrell is very good as Frank, a newly-married former party boy having a tough time adjusting to the domestic life. Most of the truly funny moments in "Old School" belong to Farrell. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn also contribute good performances. Craig Kilborn and Leah Reminiare both great in more minor roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is the kind of thing you want to watch when you don't want anything that you have to use your brain to try to think about the plot.. (so did he figure out that that was the meaning of life) etc. but you just want to laugh... hard. The streaking scene is by far the best. My only problem is that the plot is nearly an exact copy of the far superior Animal House,with comic genius John Belushi. You would think they could come up with something a bit more original. Still, it makes for a good viewing if you want Will Ferrel's outrageous brand of comedy. I have to admit he does a great job here, partial nudity seems to be a sort of specialty of his, apparent since SNL days. A good movie in a dumb way in all, but see Animal House too.</fullReview>

There is no cheesy lovey dovey moments and I think this movie evened itself out pretty well. Although, I didn't get the love story, it was way too quick and frankly, not needed.

		<fullReview>Old School is the Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds of the new millennium, and like those movies you know pretty much what to expect. Plenty of raunchy physical comedy, bare breasts a-plenty and a dean you're meant to hate. What is supposed to set this one aside from the others, is that it's about three guys in their early thirties, who are trying to get in touch with their youth again. In some ways it does accomplish that, but to me it's just not original enough to stand alone, and thus becomes just another one in the genre. Vince Vaughn plays the same character we've seen him play in pretty much every comedy he's been in, Luke Wilson does well as the straight guy among them and Will Ferrell gets to be Will Ferrell like we know and love him. The cameos are well done, but Sean William Scott's character IS Steve Stiffler, just with a really bad haircut. It's not really a "Laugh out loud" movie, but it has it's moments, that's for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Guy Movie Castrated by Sub-Par Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old School has it all - the glorification of excessive drinking (second only to Dazed &amp; Confused), t &amp; a, college-minus-homework, the 'earmuffs' scene and Will Ferrell's ass... just like the good ol' days. Unfortunately, it also has a love story that even the biggest losers and hopeless romantics surely must see as nonsense. In a blatant attempt to make amends and court the female demographic unfortunate enough to get dragged into this movie by their boyfriends, the energy on which this movie runs (that being testosterone and only testosterone) is devastatingly compromised. No, this will not join the ranks of Wilde's comedies or even 'Caddyshack', but it does give great joy to men between the ages of 15 and 35, or at least in the moments between the lovey-dovey sap. Why ruin that? Who hasn't seen a love story just like this repeated a million times? I'll sum it up: a down-on-his-luck guy, likes beautiful girl, she kind of likes him but she's taken by some a**hole, her out-of-wedlock daughter loves poor single guy, mean boyfriend cheats on beautiful girl, yells at little daughter and makes life hard for single guy w/ some comment like, "Guys don't tell on other guys". Every moment that Ellen Pompeo is on screen is humorless, unoriginal and couldn't have possibly made any female in the audience feel validated. No offense to Ms. Pompeo... it's the fault of the writers, or whoever forced the writers to insert her weak role into this otherwise giddy male romp. So the next time Hollywood makes a movie like this, it would be best to leave out the cheesy love trash or at least make it viewable. I don't remember 'Man in the Moon' or 'Mystic Pizza' being interspersed with a random naked KY wrestling match or a sudden burst of a Matrix-style gunfight to please the male demographic, so let me put it plainly: let the girls enjoy their movies and let the guy's enjoy theirs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animal House meets Old School</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may be expecting a non-sensical updated Animal House that can't hold a candle to its predecessor, but look again. This film is carried by a not so subtle homage to Fight Club, as Luke Wilson's "Godfather" character is Tyler Durden as a wannabe Fraternity president instead of a Soap making counter-culture revolutionary. There is the whole secret society of young men reverring the "Godfather" as he gains iconic status by hosting the best on-campus parties and opening his non-conformist fraternity rolls to all men disillusioned with their displacement in society--the bored husband, displaced student, lonely senior citizen.Now this isn't Citizen Kane mind you, but it is a college age comedy that has its share of high points that hit the comedic mark, paying homage to, in no particular order: the aforementioned Fight lub and Animal House, Revenge of the Nerds, the Graduate , MASH, and Stripes.I highly recommend taking a look to see where these comparisons lie, and find that this is a pretty darn clever film that that has more legs than you may have thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not utterly original. So what? Why would you ever rent this movie and expect to see some revolutionary or truly interesting comedy? If you want something that is both funny and original you are best suited to stick with things that confront life from the gallows, where it was once observed the only true humor exists. That is, see Kill Bill, Dr. Strangelove or American Psycho for a unique and thrilling movie that is hilarious. The importance of this movie is evident by the way that it has invaded our current lexicon. I dare say all of you have heard someone at a party or on the street shout out something of the nature of "frank the tank" or "your my boy blue, your my boy" etc... My suggestion is to watch this movie with beer and friends and try to enjoy hilarious actors having fun (my guess is that much of the movie was filmed a high degree of improv). Ferrell and Vaughn are hilarious and the movie never claimed originality, so why should it be critiqued for not attaining something to which it never aspired in the first place? Watching this movie with a light heart and being prepared to accept it for what it is/what it was intended to be, can make it a truly enjoyable experience.</fullReview>

I found this movie very funny(because when Will Ferrell is in a movie, it's always funny). The funniest scene is when Beanie holds a party at Mitch's house. You see Frank, who said to his wife he wouldn't be Frank The Tank anymore, becomes Frank The Tank and does the immortal 'streaking' scene("Come on everybody! We're going streaking!"). One more of Frank's funny scene is when we first see Blue("Blue you're my boy! You're my boy Blue!").

Good guy gets the girl is always what us men want to see (especially a hottie like Ms Pompeo YES!!!). Basically it relates to men because we all want to be part of something like an Army platoon, sports team, Elks Club or other male bonding fraternity. Like most guys over 30 we don't have that anymore as we are wrapped up in jobs and family but these guys were able to create a place where men could be men. It appeals to that place that exists in all guys who want to forget all the trappings of suburbia and go back to college and drink beer and chase skirt. I gave this a SOLID 9!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old School is deffinatly one of my favorite comedy movies EVER! I mean, Will Ferrell is priceless, and hilarious... running down a street naked, classical. Vince Vaughn playing the hard-ass friend, very, very classical. And Luke Wilson playing the broken-hearted guy who just broke up with his girlfriend, after seeing her in an orgy (without him), another classic... With an apperence by Snoop Dog, and all the guys who join the fraternity, and all the stuff they have to do before they can join, like having the rope tied to their penis, and then dropped off a building so they would trust Mich (wilson), Frank (Ferrell) and Beanie (Vaughn)that they provided enough rope so it would fall on the ground, without injury...*watch out for holes*... Lets put it this way, if you like to laugh, see this movie, if you hate to laugh, and even the thought of laughter makes you want to kill, I would'nt see it! 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost perfect, but not quite [spoiler]</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OLD SCHOOL was without a doubt one of the funniest movies of 2003. It was also one of those rare comedies that was almost perfect. After seeing it several times now, I still feel it could have been perfect if not for two things. The first being that despite the movie being very fast-paced, there are times when it seems to drag [Frank talking to Marisa after a certain character's funeral, the extended Seann William Scott cameo, anytime Craig Kilborn is onscreen,etc.] and the second being there are some attempts at humor in the movie that seem out of place in a movie like this. If it weren't for those two things, OLD SCHOOL could have been perfect. ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like to start of by saying, if you liked American Pie type of humour, then you will like Old School. I'm guessing many people just expected this comedy to change their life in someway and if they never laughed at any part of Old School then they are seriously lacking a sense of humour.Anyway, I watched this with a friend and found it highly entertaining. I'm not going to say I was laughing ALL the way through it, as I don't believe any comedy does this, because like scary movies it's best to time or buildup to the funny/scary scenes.SPOILER =========================Frank the tank is just a legend, little parts like where the wedding singer blurts out the first cursing word infront of their family and friends, Franks face of amazement "did he just say what I think he said" type of look is awesome.END ============================Hope you enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old School (2003) Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Jeremy Piven, Ellen Pompeo, Juliette Lewis, Leah Remini, Perrey Reeves, Sean William Scott, Andy Dick, D: Todd Phillips. Average comedy about three buddies in their early 30s reliving their college years when one of them suggests forming their own fraternity-by bringing together middle-aged guys, university misfits, and an 89-year-old retiree-but an old foe, now the Dean of Students holds a grudge against them. Good casting, some very funny lines and situations, and the crudity is more restrained than usual, but without telling, it's simultaneously na?ve and covers no new ground as the ANIMAL HOUSE school. This movie definitely separates the men from the boys. Fact: Ferrell doesn't do well with nudity, in his streaking scene. Snoop Dog, Warren G., The Bishop Don Magic Juan, and Phillips all give cameos. Available in unrated version, which runs 2 minutes longer. Running Time: 90 minutes and rated R for strong sexual content, nudity, and language. ** ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very confused movie. It seems like the director &amp; writers took a drama about a group of 30-somethings trying to come to terms with their age, and then added some ridiculous scenes and a poorly written villain character in an attempt to make it funny.The result is a movie that isn't good at either -- there aren't enough funny scenes to make it good comedy, nor is the story developed enough to make it a good drama (or even romantic-comedy). Instead, it just floats somewhere in between, moving from forced wackiness to schmaltzy romantic-comedy scenes, and following non-believable plot lines.There are a few funny moments (the emergence of Frank the Tank at their first party is my favourite), but not enough to make me ever sit through it a second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Final Score: 8.8 (out of 10)To be honest, this movie had me from the opening credits when I saw that people like Craig Kilborn, Jeremy Piven, Leah Remini and Elisha Cuthbert would be in it - and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Director Todd Phillips has lined up a parade of great cameos from Andy Dick to Sean William Scott to himself for nearly every bit part in this movie. Cuthbert, in particular, has a show-stopping guilty pleasure male fantasy scene to rival that of Jennifer Garner's in `Catch Me if You Can.'From the director of the good natured but less then impressive 'Road Trip', 'Old School' took me completely by surprise with how fresh and gut-bustingly funny it is. Phillips shows he can rank with people like Jay Roach and the Farrelly brothers with his ability to set-up a gag masterfully and then his unwillingness to be content with the first-level laugh, and stretching gags to their outrageous and often laugh-out-loud absurd conclusion. The movie, in no time, reaches what Roger Ebert so perfectly calls `escape velocity' with its laughs. The gags can't be viewed as stand-along, but are seen best when we are given a running start by everything before and around them and our knowledge of the characters. However, unlike Roach and the Farrelly brothers and most other comedy's recently, Old School doesn't hinge it's plot on 3 or 4 big comedic set pieces. Nearly every line and scene is crammed with either some goofy slapstick from Will Farrell or a clever, naturalistic comment from Vince Vaughn. This movie has the type of script where the dialogue is so natural at times - comparable to the Cohen brother's 'The Big Lebowski' - that it just sounds funny without even needing to force a punchline on us. But, even with all that said, the single smartest thing Phillips does for the movie is just step back and allow his terrific cast to grab the scenes and run down the street with them.It may lack some originality at the primordial level, but like great movies do we hardly notice. The plot is so convoluted and brushed past one wonders if Phillips and the actors, themselves, quite get the context everything is in. It involves Mitch (Luke Wilson)'s new bachelor pad being close to a college campus and the Dead (Jeremy Piven from TV's immortal 'Cupid') with a score to settle annexing the house as college property so in order to keep their party lifestyle they jump through a loophole and turn it into a fraternity. But none of that really matters. The true joy of this movie is watching the 3 leads just do their thing: Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn (2 comic pros) and Will Farrell (one comic genius). It's obvious as the movie progresses that they aren't just comedic actors, but genuinely funny people (how many of them really are there in Hollywood?) doing a lot of improvising. Wilson is shackled to the straightman role so much of the time it's the impeccable timing and delivery of Vaughn and Farrell who get the big laughs. Will Farrell in particular comes off as someone who could be the next Jim Carrey, not in the rubber-face way, but a brilliant comedian willing to do absolutely anything and go anywhere to get the laugh. Phillips doesn't relegate him to a comic side-kick supporting role as other directors would do and as a result 'Old School' becomes the best venue for showcasing his talent - and that includes his years on Saturday Night Live - to date.'Old School' is going to be endlessly compared to 'Animal House' just because it finds itself in the "College Movie" subgenera that Animal House practically invented. While the movie does recall Animal House it does so from post-modern vantage point, running it's original characters through clichés of the genera. However, OS is more in the same vein as David Fincher's brilliant 'Fight Club' (10 out of 10). It openly homages Fight Club in moments that fit snuggly into the free-standing story. You just have to have had the elite pleasure of having seen that film to get them. It is a warranted homage though. Both movies come out of the same source and are essentially about the same thing: Men who feel femenized and frustrated in their work and personal lives trying to reconnect with themselves (using a cult-like club of male-bonding). While Fight Club satirizes consumerism, 'Old School' satirizes something a little more mainstream and, thus, more daring: marriage. Even amid the baffonish pratfalls and sex jokes the script gives us some real insight into the more human, emotional side of these 3 guys - and it does so without ever loosing it's focus as a comedy (got that Tom Shaydac). One of the best scenes in the movie is one where Frank and his wife finally have a real face-to-face discussion about the future of their marriage. Ferrell's reaction, both goofy and caring, is absolutely priceless. All of this in a movie that revels in gags around gangbangs, BJ classes, and KY wresting matches? You bet. Forget Scary Movie or American Pie, 'Old School' is one of the very few full-on comedies of late that deserves a cult following.</fullReview>

This movie wasn't meant to be this spectacular acting performance by the actors... it's just a movie that is funny! EVERY line in the movie is quotable, all the characters in the movie we can relate to , and most importantly, how can you not like a movie with KY wrestling with 2 naked chicks, Snoop Dogg, Vince Vaughn, beer, Master of Puppets, AND Stacey from Saved by the Bell ALL IN THE SAME MOVIE! In all seriousness, this is just a movie that relies on silly puns, one-liners, and all that jazz that makes MOST movies funny and VERY easy to watch over and over cause there's NO plot to really follow, just one quotable joke after another. Buy this movie is you're easily amused with stupidness like Kingpin, Office Space, or Better Off Dead... or if you like funny movies when you're drunk or smoked up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old School promises viewers all the fun of college and none of the education. Thanks in large part to Will Ferrell, that's exactly what they get: nonstop laughter and many memorable moments. As mid-life crisis hits them, Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank (Will Ferrell), and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) try to put their troubles behind them and recapture their college days by starting an all-ages fraternity. Wilson's character is questionable. In the group he works very well, but alone he is uninteresting. However, Will Ferrell is a comic genius and propels the movie into greatness. Old School may not have an involving story or a lesson to teach, but it succeeds on almost every level as a free-for-all comedy and may end up becoming the Animal House for a new generation. It's one of the funniest movies to hit theaters in years.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever seen one of those movies with one of your friends that was supposed to be really funny, but there was really only one good scene in the whole movie? But that one scene was SO funny that you and your friend came up with little jokes and about it and quoted it when you're together and stuff? Well, for this movie at least, the scene is about 4 minutes into the movie and it's only about 1 hour and 28 minutes long... and if you count the videos during the credits that may add another 3 or 4 minutes to it. So obviously this movie isn't that funny.. IT'S F*****' HILARIOUS!!! I'm serious, this movie is hilarious from the beginning to the end... sure it has it's slow points, but I've yet to see a movie that didn't have at least one boring part in it. There are cheap jokes and some stuff that has been seen in other movies, but there are also plenty of original moments and Will Ferrell really makes the movie what it is. Vince Vaughn could have had a much bigger part, but what he does have he plays perfectly. And Luke Wilson... well he plays his role good, but it's really not what makes the movie funny. Unfortunately this movie also has the same weak points, as do other movies that could have been way better. As far as I'm concerned a comedy and romance do not mix. Love is not funny no matter what you do and the stupid little thing goin' on between Mitch and the girl I can't even remember... the movie would have been just as funny with out it, but then I guess Craig Kilborn wouldn't have been in it and that would have been a shame because I think he is one of the best late night hosts ever. All in all "Old School" is a movie you will never forget while it's because you loved it or you hated it or you thought it was the most offensive piece of trash you've ever seen... either way you won't forget it. See it and love it!!!!!NOT A FAMILY MOVIE!!!!</fullReview>

And the star behind these moments was Will Ferrill. I can imagine that the director gave Will extra takes to improv and to have free reign. And man, it paid off bigtime. This is some of his (or anyone else's) finest comedic moments.So for those who would scoff at such sophomoric dribble... man, take a hit from a beer bong, go streaking, and chill out dawg!</fullReview>

Piven as the evil dean...its great to see him play the exact opposite of his role in PCU. Plus Craig Kilborn as an arrogant jerk (it flows so easily for him). Finally, Ferrell, now I usually don't find him that funny on saturday night live....but in this movie he is HILARIOUS! Much credit has to be given to the writers for giving the Frank character such great lines (even subtle ones like fitting in the lame white guy expression "good stuff", just wonderful writing), and Ferrell nails each and every line!It isn't winning any oscars, but hey, 'Shakespeare in love' and 'Chicago' won a bunch of them so that shows that oscars aren't worth very much. *** (out of 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious and Intelligent Gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unexpected gem comes from the makers of Road Trip. During times where the regular teenage movie is as unfunny as it is boring, Old School bucks the trend and provides one of the most hilarious films since Friday. What makes it so great is that it has appeal not only to the "love to get f*ck*d up" youth of the nation, but adults that used to get down in the 60's and 70's and want to re-live those great times that they can't really remember (too much drugs and alcohol).Honestly, this is one of those movies where, so long as you dont dislike any of the actors involved, you will laugh from start to finish. I saw the previews and was not planning on seeing it, but when a friend saw it and dragged me to it, was I ever glad. Will Ferrell provides some of the best lines I've ever heard, and Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn also come in clutch (earmuffs, the Godfather, its all great).For anyone that has ever had a zest for drinking, or finds these types of movies enjoyable (From Animal House to Friday to Outside Providence) do yourself a favor and see Old School! It is a hidden gem in every meaning of the word.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can I sum this up? The acting is awesome, the script is brilliant, and Will Ferrell is downright, well, remarkable as a comedian. I have never laughed so hard than when I saw this movie. Trust me, see it if you still can, you will not regret it, this film has some of the funniest stuff ever put into a film, EVER. 9.5/10 (Just on a comedy scale). And by the way, this film is so different compared to the recent comedy crap which has been coming out and disgracing the name of Hollywood (Legally Blonde and Kangaroo Jack, just to name a few).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, I went into this movie mostly because my friends told me it was funny and I'm a pretty big fan of Will Ferrell's humor. I was just hoping that it wasn't another stupid college-humor type movie (see Van Wilder). So, yeah, some of it was kind of stupid, but it had enough parts that I found hilarious to be worth seeing. Will Ferrell was great. In all, I was pleasantly surprised, and I really think that despite what most people are probably expecting, the humor in this movie is a lot different than its "peers."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so it wasn't such a great movie. It may even have been a bad movie. But one question - did you laugh? I thought so. The story goes nowhere, the characters learn nothing, it conveys a negative message, but, goshdarnit, it managed to include some very funny scenes. That's no small feat. So if you're looking for great cinema, look elsewhere. If you want a stupid comedy (and some people do), check out 'Old School.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write comments because I think it would be a better use of time to watch a good movie twice, than to try and pick apart its "imperfections".Personally, I think Old School was a great flick. I don't see how someone can sit back and try and rationalize the use of certain cliches, which blend together very well, and then complain about them because the stereotypes actually made sense and formed a movie.If you try and make a movie, and don't have an audience in mind, then you're probably not any good at making movies. Are the individual characters in this movie believable? Maybe not all, but they're based on life, and believe me, crazier s*** happens every day than what panned out in Old School.I guess what I want to say, is that this movie had good actors, good scenes, and good lines. It's not a movie you think about for hours, you just laugh at what's funny, and then make jokes about what's not funny, so in the end you're always laughing.Is this the first Fraternity based comedy, I don't think so, but it better not be the last. Animal House was a good idea, and it should be stolen and re-made til the end of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very funny and ranks along with my favorite comedies of all time. The Actors in this movie all bring humurouse traits that have made them famouse from other movies into this one - IE - Will Farrells self parodying suttle yet off the wall humor, Vince Vaughn's smooth talking, borderline annoying persona made famouse in Swingers/Made. People compare this film to Animal house, and Porkies, however, I thought it was a Far Cry from both. It brought to the table an original kind of Comedy, that I look forward for future films to be inspired by.funniest moments... 1) Wedding singer's constant use of F word 2) streaking - alone, wife and freinds catch him 3) House warming gift 4) Physical fitness evualation 5) Blow Job Class? 6) Divorce Talk 7) Simon and Garfunkle in the pool</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gloriously Stupid Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something to be said for stupid comedies. Not necessarily the ones that are centered on large men getting hit in the head or crotch. Or films that climax with pie fights. Or any film where a wild animal plays some kind of pro sport. Or any film where Rob Schneider transforms into something and learns that life is indeed tough from a different perspective.As you can see, the stupid comedy has a very dubious history but when it succeeds at creating those hearty belly laughs, the kind where your face is sore afterwards from laughing so hard, few movies are as entertaining. Billy Madison is every bit as perfect in its humor as the more critically lauded comedies Rushmore and Raising Arizona.So then, is the crass college comedy Old School funny, stupid or both? It's safe to say its makers did their homework and admirable achieve an unrepentantly uproarious stupid comedy.Mitch (Luke Wilson) is a real estate numbers cruncher who catches an early flight home from a business retreat only to discover his girlfriend (Juliet Lewis) blindfolded and ready to engage in an orgy. Mitch moves into a house on a local campus with the help of his two friends, smooth talker Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and man-child Frank (Will Ferrel). The trio of thirty somethings comes up with the idea to start their own fraternity and relive their youth. Their rebellion from adulthood leads to wild parties, underage girls, KY Jelly wrestling, drunken streaking, birthday party tranquilizers, eulogies featuring White Snake songs and, of course, taking it to the man that just won't let these kids have their fun.Wilson is relegated to the role of the straight man, which means he pretty much gets to make faces at the antics of Ferrel and Vaughn. Wilson is the "nice guy" of the film, which in comedy terms means he's the individual tortured by others. And in other terms, means he's normally quite bland. Consider both checked with Wilson in Old School. Wilson is a very capable actor but he's more or less backdrop.Ferrel is like instant comedy, just add water and he can make anything funnier. Much has been made of Kathy Bates strutting around in her 54-year-old birthday suit (which may have led to a Best Unsupported Actress nomination) but Ferrel equally jogs around jiggling his goods with glee. Ferrel is hysterical as the film's biggest party animal. He takes everything to another level of comedy. Stick around during the end credits just to see him kick some woman's shopping cart. I'm telling you this simple action is one of the funniest things in the movie.Vaughn has made a career of playing fast-talking louts that would normally incite people with his caustic remarks if he weren't so damn charming. What happened to ole' Vince and his oodles of sex appeal? Circa 1998 or so he was going to be Hollywood's next leading man, especially after massive exposure from Spielberg's Lost World. Yes, starring in the very ill conceived remake of Psycho (now with masturbation at no extra charge!) was a bad career move but it shouldn't have been a killer. I mean, Anne Heche went on to other films after it and this was before she was communicating with aliens with her made up language. Heck, I'm just kind of glad to see Vaughn in films again. His running gag with a bread maker is great.The plot of Old School is really nothing more than a paper-thin device for the jokes to spring forth from. There are only stock characters in these kinds of films. There's the nice girl (the lovely Ellen Pompeo) that will eventually get together with our protagonist in the end. There's her smug boyfriend played by the smug Craig Kilborn. Jeremy Piven is a stuffy dean trying to shut the boys down to settle old grudges with them.The women of Old School are really left with nothing to do. Either they are there to have sex with the men or, when older, marry and control them. Lewis is the opposite of the good girl as the oversexed former flame of Wilson. Leah Remini has a very brief role as Vaughn's wife who knows when to lead him by a chain. 24's Elisha Cuthbert is a naughty schoolgirl that could get Wilson in trouble after one unexpected night. The ladies of this world are really tools for the guys, but what kind of feminist analysis is needed for a film that features Snoop Dog and not one, but two correspondents from The Daily Show?Old School is from the director and co-writer of Road Trip, a crude yet very entertaining and lively comedy. Old School is kind of a big brother companion to Road Trip, and while not rising to the level of Animal House (as every college comedy wishes to be now) the film is indeed a pristine example of a gloriously stupid comedy aided by a very game cast. See it and be prepared to laugh a few pounds off. Class dismissed.B</fullReview>

The demographic which voted most highly for this film was women in their twenties. Knock me down. The film was great because it took chances in a way that few movies do. This courage inspires the small ammount of fear in the audience that is required for real humour. It took guts to put the blowjob class in this film. It took producorial mox to have the KY jelly fight.This film was outrageous, and it worked. It surpasses films like, "Road Trip" because it takes these risks (all due respect to Mr. Green, another Ottawa native).

		<shortDescription>OK collegiate comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following in a long tradition of college comedies that stretches back, believe it or not, beyond the memory of pretty much anyone living, comes this movie which has a pretty good concept but doesn't exploit the comedic or filmic possibilities enough to make it a good film. My friend and I saw this movie at the drive-in theater in Sacramento, CA, and we were in a proper state of mind for a film of this type, so it did sustain our interest fairly well. There were one or two really funny scenes, mostly thanks to Ferrell. Artie Lang -- were you really in this movie? I think you had, like, one line.There were a lot of people in this movie -- Vince Vaughn, Juliette Lewis, Craig Kilborn -- who I could really say "what are you doing in this movie?" I know what Artie Lang and Jeremy Piven are doing in this movie, they have nothing else to do!To be fair, Piven is a genre pro, having appeared to somewhat equal effect in a similar movie, "P.C.U.", in which David Spade played the role he plays in "Old School". Better luck next time, guys, but thanks for the memories. fans of this genre will have to wait for next time for a really good movie.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is relatively funny. The masses, of course, all loved it. Ignorance IS bliss, apparently. For most of the people who see this film don't realize that is basically a combination of several other things. Take ANIMAL HOUSE, STRIPES (minus the military stuff), an aged Trent from SWINGERS, and some Will Ferrell SNL antics, add in straight man Luke Wilson and you've got OLD SCHOOL.The college scenes were obviously heavily inspired by ANIMAL HOUSE, however, the blatant rip-off was of STRIPES. In STRIPES, a fat guy (sorry Mr. Candy!) mud wrestles hot chicks. In OLD SCHOOL, an old guy KY Jelly wrestles hot chicks. Hmmm. Just watch SWINGERS and you can see that Trent will probably end up something like Vaughn's character in this film...I mean, movie. I don't think I even need to comment on the SNL remark because it's so obvious.Well, folks, there you have it. You can see this movie, and will probably enjoy it. But don't forget the things I've said here. If we allow studios to continually do this (don't get me started on The Hunted aka First Blood) than the truly original talent might get lost. And don't let yourself cop-out by saying "everyone rips off everyone else," because there is some true original talent out there. Try and find it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard some bad reviews for this film. I finally went to see it and I was really impressed with the comedy that just kept coming and kept me laughing. This movie is vulgar, so if you like that sort of non-PC kind of humor, I recommend this film.This film also pays homage to some great movies and television shows -- I am sure that some people don't understand that or didn't get it and they don't have as much respect for this film as I do.While the cinematography wasn't spectacular and the script not brilliantly written, the actors are hilarious. The cast is comprised of Will Farrell, who really carries the movie and is one of the funniest guys alive; Luke Wilson, another great actor; Vince Vaughn, who I didn't think could really be that funny, but he's definitely getting up there with the comedy roles (We'll probably see a lot of him soon); The guy from the Upright Citizens Brigade, Matt Walsh; and Laura Remini, Jeremy Piven (who should have his own damn show), and that cute girl from 24, Elisha Cuthbert (her part was a waste of screen time as far as the storyline goes, but I think it was worth it putting her in). It's such a great cast!This film is one of those funny movies you just don't have to think about while watching it. If you did, it'd ruin your fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Animal House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know some people will find my one line summary blasphemous, but I just don't think Animal House is a sacred cow. I'll get back to that in a minute.This is probably the first movie in a long while to make me laugh as much as it did. It's also the first in a long while that makes me want to buy it when it comes out on DVD. I'll spare you the redundant plot summary to say that Old School is not the thinking man's comedy - if you want that, go rent a Woody Allen movie. Will Farrell, while not the main character manages to deftly steal almost every scene he is in. Vince Vaughan gives a great performance as a very jaded, cynical person who's blind to his own hypocrisy. Finally, in the lead role, Luke Wilson cemented his growing reputation as a formidable comedic actor. He is one to be watched, as well as his brother Owen (i.e. "The Royal Tenenbaums"). But the great cast doesn't end there - look for great turns by Andy Dick, Craig Kilborn, and Elisha Cuthbert (rrrow!).Getting back to the Animal House comparison (which is everywhere I look for reviews or any kind of movie information about Old School), I argue that this is the better movie. Perhaps it's just my own opinion, but I never found Animal House as funny as people claimed it to be. In addition, it's outdated (released in 1978, set in the year 1962), and Old School is a better reflection of today's college campuses and today's greek houses. In the end, maybe I prefer Snoop Dogg to Otis Day and the Knights, but I give this movie 4 stars out of 4 stars (obviously this is not the same scale that I'd put The Godfather on, but you get the idea).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The party was chaperoned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*So Luke Wilson gets a house near a college. His buddies Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell come up with a plan to start a fraternity so he can keep the house. Then the movie kind of spins off in about ten thousand different directions. The story of old guys partying down on campus gets pushed aside for talk of divorce, infidelity, death and other somber topics that threw ice water on my genitals and stopped the laughter.The big question is: Did I laugh during "Old School"? The answer is yes. Will Ferrell was easily the funniest guy here. Luke Wilson played the straight, boring guy and that's exactly what he was, straight and boring. Vince Vaughn had some funny spots. The cinder block scene had me laughing.But where was the old school party madness? So these guys start a fraternity to party down. Where's the party at? I counted two. Wasn't that the point of the movie? To see 30 somethings get wild and crazy on campus? Be young! Be Free! Wasn't it? Instead there is a storyline about the dean wanting them off campus, one about a new girl in Luke Wilson's life who may or may not like him, one about Vaughn not liking marriage although we never see why as he never interacts with his wife, and many others that have nothing to do with getting drunk with college age women.Take Will Ferrell's character. So he gets married at the beginning of the flick. Sure, we're expecting some tension between his new wife and the fraternity. So he gets drunk at a party and his wife tosses him out. Later in the movie they have a serious scene where they talk about divorce during a funeral. Now I ask you, A) Why are they getting divorced after one drunken night out? and B) Why is this scene in the movie? To show the effects of partying on 30 year old newlyweds? Why go for such a serious turn? Get back to the K Y Jelly wrestling. Now that was a good scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought "Old School" was a very funny movie. It had three great comic actors in it and the jokes were hilarious. I love Will Ferrell. He is one of the funniest comedians out there and I love anything he's ever been in. I was saddened when he left Saturday Night Live and I still miss him being on there but if he hadn't of left then he wouldn't have made this movie. I know that this wasn't a very good movie and it's not Oscar material but that's not what Will Ferrell is about. He just wants to make people laugh and he succeeded with "Old School." I loved the story line and all the characters were great. (Except the cameo by Craig Kilborn, he was a jerk.) Luke Wilson was cute and he had some great lines and Vince Vaughn kept me laughing. But I'd have to say that Will Ferrell was my favorite because he had the funniest lines and he just stole the show. His actions and facial expressions are just so funny. Anyways. I thought "Old School" was a great movie for those people who love to laugh and smile and if you're not one of those people then don't go see it. Well, thanks for reading my review and Will Ferrell rules!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old School-7/10 is a fun, crude comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible SpoilersOld School is a fun, crude comedy in the style of National Lampoon's Animal House. The plot is silly and the characters are pretty one dimensonal, but this movie is consistently funny throughout. It made me smile and it made me laugh and I certainly enjoyed it for what it is. Luke Wilson plays Mitch Martin aka The Godfather, who comes home from his dreary job to find his girlfriend played by Juliette Lewis mixed up in some wild orgy. Will Ferrell is very funny as Frank a man who is just getting married to the wrong woman and Vince Vaughn is also very good as Beanie, a sarcastic, witty guy who spends no time with his woman, but looks after their son. Mitch tries to move on with his life by moving into a new house that happens to be on a college campus. Vince Vaughn sees this as an opportunity to rekindle his youth by moving in and starting a fraternity. Ferrell, after being on the outs with his wife needs a place to crash and joins the other two. Mitch is rather conservative and resists the idea of a fraternity at first...a fraternity which gets mostly old guys who are trying to find ways to still have some fun...and none of these guys go to the school. Of course they are a hit with the students as the fraternity throws wild parties, and gets into all sorts of trouble etc. and basically do what fraternities do. The always fun Jeremy Piven plays Dean Pritchard, who naturally disapproves of the unorthodox fraternity and tries to get them kicked out of the house...he wants to put them on "double secret probation!" Anyway I found it rather amusing that Piven was in this cliche role going against type of roles he usually does as in the character he played in the college comedy PCU(1994). The fun of this movie just comes from guys like Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn and the absurd and funny situations everbody gets in to. It's a comedy that doesn't hold back on the crude humor, but it never really is gross-out type stuff which is a good thing. Mitch's love interest Nicole is played by Ellen Pompeo, who is very sweet and while watching her I realized she reminds me of Renee Zellweger. There are also appearances in this film by Late Night talk show host Craig Kilborn, rapper Snoop Dogg, 24 sweetie Elisha Cuthbert, King of Queens' Leah Remini and American Pie's Stiffler aka Sean William Scott, who appears in a very funny scene. Overall, Old School is what it is...a funny, uproarious comedy about having all the fun of college without having to go to school. It's silly, crude and fun and guys like Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn make it so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parts of this movie are laugh-out-loud funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certain scenes in this film where Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn were so funny that I was surprised that I didn't enjoy the movie more. Luke Wilson is the a straight man to Ferrell's abominable frat guy routine and Vaughn's incessant wise-cracking, but Wilson tends to rely on the "slightly stunned" look in this film more than actually emote. Not unlike "The Sweetest Thing", "Old School" was uneven in tone. That must be the hardest thing about doing comedy. You must strive to keep the tone the same throughout the whole film to be truly successful. At times in the movie issues of getting older, marriage, domestication, and infidelity were treated quasi-seriously, the closest comparison was "Peter's Friends" and then suddenly we drop back into the "Animal House" level or worse the "Revenge of the Nerds" level. To really let your audience laugh you must be specific and consistent in your own sensibility of what's funny. Too many cooks spoil the soup. I wished the film had skipped the higher aspirations altogether and stayed above the "Revenge of the Nerds" level. The funniest parts of the film were not intentionally written. The humor was derived from Will Ferrell's and Vince Vaughn's reactions to the scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the funnier "college" films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What National Lampoon wouldn't give to get their name preceding this one instead of last year's Van Wilder. Comparable to Animal House, Old School offers the gross out humor and stupidity without being too gross or too stupid. Including all-around great performances by, just about, the entire cast (Craig, stick to late night), this is likely to be remembered as one of the funnier `college' films of all time.Although only a handful of the fraternity members are actually enrolled at the college in which their frat house lies on campus, the expression `guys will be guys' reigns supreme. If you do not think Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughn grasping for yesteryear is pathetically hilarious, then do not see Old School. On the other hand, if you enjoy the straight faced humor of Wilson, the outrageous style of Ferrell, or even the show stealing subtlety of Vaughn, then you can afford to miss it as much as you can afford a ticket to an evening admittance. In other words, stick to the matinee just in case.This marks the second straight success from director Todd Phillips. His Road Trip proved to be funny even if you dismissed the few scenes starring Tom Green, which seemed to be edited in last minute anyway. It is sad when a movie's sole purpose is to make you laugh, and it does not even succeed in doing so. Unlike too many movies already this year, Old School is an absolute riot from start to finish. Just make sure it is actually over before you leave.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Old School" disappointed me. I've been a fan of Will Ferrell for a while, and he was hilarious. Unfortunately, he's the only redeeming factor in this film, a good waste of the rest of the people involved.The characters are all classic cliches of college frat movies (only older): the lovable/aloof kind of dorky guy with a heart of gold, the indominable, obnoxious, lady killer/party guy, the blissfully dumb guy who everybody loves, the anal retentive dean who can find nothing more important to do than try and shut the fraternity down, etc. (played respectively by Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, and Jeremy Piven), the latter in an in-joke role reversal to anyone who's ever seen "PCU" (airing daily on Comedy Central at 3 p.m....seriously).Mitch, played by Luke Wilson, is the main character, having recently divorced his wife after finding her involved in her kinky antics. To make a long story short, Mitch and his fellow buddies in their early 30s decide to form a fraternity to alleviate their relative crisises, and invite a wide variety of guys from all age groups to join (from 18 up to 90). Wild and crazy hijinks ensue, the dean gives them a hard time, the frat eventually prevails, ya, ya, ya...you know the drill. But then I don't expect many people going to see "Old School" wanting (or expecting) a great plot.There's also a pointless sub-plot involving Luke Wilson, a former girl friend, and her jerky boyfriend (played by Craig Kilborn). Snoop Dogg makes a cameo near the beginning of the movie in a scene that feels like it should've been at the end of the movie rather than in the first 20 minutes (as it was probably the funniest). If you're a fan of the TV show "24", you'll recognize a couple of faces, including Elisha Cuthbert and Matthew Carey, the former in a role as Mitch's boss' daughter and the latter as one of the fraternity brothers.Since I knew who was working the box office at the time, I got in to see "Old School" for free. I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you happen to be in a similar situation, in which case it isn't a bad way to blow an hour and a half. Wait for the DVD, which will hopefully have a good deal of special features, rather than pay good money to see this in the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite simply one of the funniest movies in recent years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Old School" is a classic college comedy that shouldn't be missed. It has two of the funniest and underrated comedians (Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell) at the top of their games. Vince is obviously channeling his "Trent" character from "Swingers" while Ferrell one-ups his psychotic and zany personality playing "Frank The Tank." Luke Wilson is the crazy glue that holds these guys together. This is "Animal House" for our generation. Although nowhere close to the epic of that movie, I can't recall a college comedy that just went all out to make us laugh. The love story here sucks and we all know what will happen, but the sole purpose of this movie is to make you crack up and director Todd Phillips doesn't apologize for anything in this movie. I'm definitely buying this on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer for old school I thought it was going to be another stupid movie that was not funny. But when I went go see it a could not quit laughing. That is the only problen with the movie it is hard to hear some parts because people are still laughing from the last scene. I mean Will Ferill made the movie, yes the other actors were great also, but Will was just too funny. The really only problem was a story that really did not make sense, but that is probably the point in comedy movies. But the parts at the end credits really gave me a good laugh before I left the theater. If you have not seen it please do it is really good. I give old school a 6.5/10.</fullReview>

The casting could not have been better, the jokes are great and there is even a nice little love story to go with it all. If what you are interested in is a good laugh I high recoment seeing this movie. If you looking for an academy award winning story then I suggest something in the area of "Hours".

		<shortDescription>Funny in parts...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old School is a throwback to the comedies of the late seventies and early eighties when films like Animal House, Meatballs, Porky's, etc...had America in stitches for nearly a decade. Unfortunately, Old School, despite having its share of funny moments (which is more than I can say for most of the so-called "comedies" being produced nowadays), is saddled with rehashed comedy routines and moments of tedium that keep the film from being genuinely hilarious. The cast is quite good. Will Ferrel-- who, in my opinion, is probably the funniest SNL member in a long while-- does everything possible to force a smile on our face. He does everything short of masturbating in front of camera just to get a few laughs. That sort of dedication to the comedic art form should mean something. Vince Vaughn is also very good. He plays his role pretty much straight, but with enough slyness and sardonic wit to give his character a memorable comedic twist. Old School, despite its flaws, is a pleasingly funny film. Although, its not hold-your-belly-till-it-hurts kind of funny, it is a mildly amusing film with enough wit, humor and spirit to keep you smiling throughout. Check it out. </fullReview>

It felt a bit choppy and at one point, I couldn't remember which character was dating/married to which woman. But the actors were perfectly cast, (except for Jeremy Piven-who I normally love). Jeremy Piven, was either A) too young for his role as the dean or B) just not nerdy enough. He was too cool and likeable to play the antagonist. I kept expected him to surrender and join the fraternity.Lots of random laughs. See it for Will Ferrel's sake.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Humorous to some extent, this film was so up in the air that I never was quite certain whether to enjoy it or not. No doubt, there were some funny parts, but often they were so few and far between that the film really lagged on me. The start of the film was especially slow before we really get introduced to the characters. I didn't out loud laugh until about 20-25 minutes into the film. After that point there were some real good moments, but the editing of the film was pretty poor with bad leadins, and no continuation of humor. Therefore, the humor derived from mainly one-liners and odd sexual situations. Andy Dick was annoying - I loathed the parts that he was in. The wife's character should have been dumped as well because she seemed to just pop up in scenes from time to time with no real contribution to the humor. Sure the carrot was kinda humorous, but with Andy Dick in the scene, it was basically no good. Along those lines, a host of others characters were underdeveloped. Most obvious to me was the teenage girl played by Elisha Cuthberg. At the beginning of the flick, it appears she'll be a regular character, but then she just kinda flops out and the movie ends without explaining anything. I would have rated the film a 4/10, but the scenes during the credits definately bumped it up to a 5/10. The film was enjoyable at times, but the lack of orginal material and funny gags left a bad taste in my mouth. Will was great in his scenes, but he couldn't lift the rest of the misplaced cast to great heights. If some better actors had replaced Andy Dick, Craig Kilborn, and a few more of the slumping cast, this could have been better. Overall though, the plot was weak, and even crazy gross out humor didn't provide enough entertainment for me to not miss the $7.50 that I paid for the ticket. If you want some good college style humor films, I'd recommend sticking with some of the classics like Animal House.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, although the second half drags down the stellar first half. The movie is about 15-25 minutes too short, and needs more scenes involving the fraternity and parties. The ending seems kind of abrubt, but other than that no complaints. The front three of Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughn all are excellent, especially Ferrell. Funny actions and very quotable lines. Wilson suprised me, because usually the lead/straight man is not funny, but he was. Ferrell's performance is reminiscent of the immortal Senator John Blutarski (he was influenced and payed tribute to the great belushi, without ripping him off or trying to recreate him).While the movie falls short of the pantheon of great guy comedies (fletch, animal house, caddyshack, swingers,), it is solidly entrenched in the level below (revenge of the nerds, tommy boy, stripes). Great movie, cant wait till the DVD comes out, i hope it has extra footage worked into the movie.</fullReview>

Will Ferrell was hilarious, and the cameo by Sean William Scott as the zoo keeper was the best part.The film was nothing but laughs from beginning to end, and is a definite must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am comfortable enough in my manhood to say that if Will Ferrell is streaking, I will pay good money to watch. This movie is funny. Ferrell is entertaining no matter what he is doing, Vaughn plays the type of role he perfected in Swingers and Made, a likeable jerk. And Wilson plays the straight man very well. Yes Old School is in the same Genre as Animal House, and no it is probably not as good, but why should it have to be. It is a comedy, it made me laugh, it fulfilled its purpose. Go see it, if it doesn't make you laugh only go to movies that Roger Ebert gives a thumbs up, if you do like it, good, I'm glad I wasn't the only one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I want to say that I almost threw up a couple times watching this movie. Why? I was laughing so hard that my body couldn't take it anymore. My wife and I went to see this movie this weekend and we haven't stopped talking about it. There are so many memorable moments in the movie that we just laugh for no reason when thinking about it. One memory is the therapist-waitress-underwear scene. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. I guess if you have no sense of humor, you won't like this movie. That's probably the reason that critics haven't blessed this movie. None of those guys have any sense of humor. This is irrelevant, but Will was back on SNL this weekend 2/22/03. If you didn't see it, you missed a great Will cameo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a former movie journalist you have my expert opinion, this is a very very funny movie. I went with my intellectual Yale friend and we laughed all the way through. Granted, I am a guy who was in a fraternity, but even the women in the audience were laughing out loud. Will Ferrell steals the show. Vince is Vince, which means great, not as funny as in Swingers or Made (a very underrated film) but damn close. Luke is very good as the straight man, and some of the cameos are wonderful like Sean William Scott was great as the abusive redneck animal handler. This is up there with Animal House and Caddyshack, seriously.Just go and laugh you tail off</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought I would post on behalf of this movie, since i havent laughed this hard in a movie theater since Goldmember came out. Old school was funny from start to finish. Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell gave brilliantly funny performances. Wilsons performance was also great. Along with a huge supporting cast of Cameos ( Seann William Scott, Artie Lange , and the dude from P.C.U. ) the movie was great. Im not gonna comment about any specific part of the movie due to the fact is this should be your opinion to see it, and not have some other asshole tell what is wrong with it, and diagram every scene spoiling all the fun for you. But the movie was funny. Go see it, see it twice actually, you will miss little jokes, like for instance pay attention to the soundtrack in certain parts of the movie( I.e. Vince vaughns college girl rendezvous).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is the question of the day, isn't it? Who ran away with the rest of 'Old School'?! A semi-legitimate movie was ruined by a cut-off ending. I honestly believe that it was cut short right in the midst of the climax. The timing in this movie was horrible as everything seemed to be coming at you at the wrong time. The main guy (Wilson, I think)... Seemed uncomfortable in his role and didn't really fit in at all, but then again nothing in this movie really 'fit'. The movie was great until they started doing what they promised they would in the previews, act like total idiots. It was something along the lines of 'The Little Rascals'-for grown-ups. The humor was off-beat and at times tasteless, the characters were foolish.... What more can I say; this movie flat out ate.... well it was bad. 3.5/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know the trappings of the genre: crazy parties, drugs, booze, and an uptight administrator threatening to end it all. "Old School" is sort of like college comedies like "Animal House" and "Revenge of the Nerds," but, unfortunately, the movie is simply not as funny. There are a few good bits (look for an homage to "The Graduate"), and the cast does a good job, but the movie is incredibly predictable (to the point of, "Okay, that guy is going to do this next"). As a screwball comedy, "Old School" is short on laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a quasi-intelligent montage of animal house and sandler themes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read a review in the Tampa Tribune that recommended watching Animal House for the 100th time rather than screening this movie. Although Animal House will forever be the yardstick by which all fraternity comedies are measured, I would have to disagree with the Trib. This movie is definitely worth a screening.What critics often fail to understand (or at least ignore in order to remain marketable) is that a comedy is what it is. Since moving pictures have existed for approximately a century (and the same basic formula for all comedic plots has persisted since antiquity), folks need not expect that a comedy be original. folks need only hope that a comedy refreshingly tweak old themes in order to induce frequent bouts of belly laughter, which is exactly what this flick does.The combination of will farrell, luke wilson, and vince vaughan is sheer genius. farrell's frat-boy throwback rants are priceless, and the tranquilizer dart scene featuring "stiffler," a pony, and a zany allusion to The Graduate is singlehandedly worth the price of admission. True to form, every word out of Vince Vaughan's mouth is hilarious, not necessarily for the substance but for the sheer obnoxious self-assuredness of vaughan's delivery. Just picture him standing on a diner table spouting off about Favreau being "All Growed's Up" and you know what I mean. And Luke Wilson once again works his quirky straight man magic. My only misgiving concerns the casting of Jeremy Piven as the evil dean. Not that he didn't perform adequately, but in my opinion his performances in Singles, PCU, and Grosse Pointe Blanke necessitate the casting of Piven as a somewhat "cooler" character in a movie of this genre, despite his middle age.In any event, ignore the naysayers. this movie kicks the crap out of van wilder, and is worth the price of admission, notwithstanding it's unsubtle borrowings from animal house and its progeny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't want to see this movie in the first place, but I was dragged to it. After seeing it, I should have just listened to my instincts. While Vince Vaughn turned in another fine comedic performance, the rest of the cast was subpar. Luke Wilson did not have one funny moment, Andy Dick's cameo was insanely stupid, and Will Farrell was below his normally high standards. Farrell actually goes a little too overboard here. Except for Vaughn's ability to make any scene he's in have some sort of comedic value, the rest of the movie rely's on cheap laughs that will soon be forgotten. A man running naked? Someone sleeping with his boss's high school daughter? Andy Dick playing a flamboyant gay man? All of these got laughs from the crowd, but nobody will remember these lame thrills the day after. Other than Vaughn, the only value I obtained from watching this movie was seeing about 8 insanely gorgeous women. Overall, it is a subpar comedy that should only be seen if you love Vince Vaughn's work.</fullReview>

Safe to say, it was just as vulgarly funny as "Road Trip".Luke Wilson was very good mellow balance for the crazy/zany/wacky Will Ferrell. Both are great comedic actors, just in very different ways.

		<fullReview>I haven't been this satisfied with a movie in soooo long. I can barely even write this review. This has got to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. My only problem is that it wasn't straight to video so I could watch it again. How could a movie be more perfect? Ivan Reitman and Joe Medjuck straight outta Ghostbusters working on it, an AWESOME cast, it all falls into some of the funniest movie moments ever. SO funny it's insane. See it. Then see it again!! Then, if you can wait (which I probably won't be able to) BUY it on DVD!!!!Here I go, again, on my own...;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest Movie in a Long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My biggest concern is that I might oversell this movie. That could make it less enjoyable for some. Having said that, I still haven't decided when I laughed so hard at a movie. I mean, doubled over, side-spitting laughter. And not just a couple of times. The laughs run throughout the movie. And it has a few of those moments where you are laughing and the joke continues but instead of losingsteam it builds to even bigger laughs. That is the key to a great comedy and few people can pull that off. My date actually punched me so maybe it will resonate more with men that women. Will Ferrel just bumped up his future paychecks by a big, big number as hesteals this movie and is responsible for most of the funniest scenes. But the cast solid across the board. I'm not one to bash the critics but I will say that the ones trashing this movie don't know comedy when its in their face. Sure there are some problems with the story and the ending seems rushed but I promise it is a hell of a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough with the studio plants!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost every positive comment for this film is from an obvious studio plant.This flick is what it is. A mildly amusing Animal House rip-off just like Todd Phillips first film Road Trip. The big difference is that it's not nearly as funny as Animal House and it stars Luke Wilson instead of Peter Riegert, Vince Vaughn instead of Tim Matheson and Will Ferrell trying to fill in for John Belushi. The big twist - they're all in their mid-thirties. (I think Ferrell is in his mid-forties - I mean he's only been on Saturday Night Live for hundred years or so.) Oh, and you won't ever embarrass yourself by laughing at something that no one else does because all the jokes are as old as the hills. Plus they're telegraphed a mile away so even if it's new to you you'll still know when to laugh along with everyone else in the theater. That way you won't feel like a weirdo or some kind of individualistic comic maverick. If you have time to kill this weekend and want to forget about the upcoming war and our dismal economy then by all means go to see it. But, if you have anything else to do - like maybe clipping your toenails - then I would suggest waiting for video. If your looking to get laid with a new girl you might want to ask her what she wants to see. If she says 10 Days To Lose Your Mind or whatever that date movie is - by all means go see that - because your chances will be a lot better to score. But, if you're having a night out with the boys this sure beats the heck out of Daredevil.This movie is not "Spectacular" nor "The Funniest Movie in Years!!!!" I wish these studio plants would spend more time finding a really funny script or casting some people who are funny instead of the same old hacks that their agency buddies keep shoving down our throats? In case you guys haven't figured it out - Luke is the unfunny Wilson brother while Owen is the one that doesn't play in middle America - Vince Vaughn is the drunk wiseacre that's been a proven dud in at least 10 films and Will Ferrell - well if he ever gets a decent script - then you might have something. Larry David can find amazing comic talent in Hollywood for Curb Your Enthusiasm so why can't the studios?This film will open big - not blockbuster big - but big - probably #1 - and then drop off the face of the earth. It will do well in rentals and then be forgotten. Todd Phillips will buy a new house in the hills as he and his friend crank out their next great opus - Food Fight - starring Steve Zahn - who was once a promising young actor - with cameos by John Goodman and Jim Belushi. The End.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Millenium's ANIMAL HOUSE! A laugh-out-loud riot.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Todd Phillips began his major filmmaking career with the teen hit ROAD TRIP, which is still one of the few teen sex comedies to be fairly respected, since it is one of the best ones of the new millenium. Even though filled with stereotypical characters (Sean William Scott's E.L. is exactly like American Pie's Stifler, Breckin Meyer is the regular straight man). Even so, the gross out effect wasn't at an ultimate high like today's Van Wilder and Slackers, but was similar to its role model film ANIMAL HOUSE.Phillips second attempt rejoins him with producer/Ghostbuster director Ivan Reitman and the familiar territory of the college grounds( Like ROAD TRIP and his independent film FRAT HOUSE). This time around, three thirty-year-olds are the swingers. Usually, these type of films are easy money making schemes for film companies. Though anytime three very well known actors are put into the same film, you can make a good bet someone cares about the dying genre. Phillips certainly does, and he takes his ability to tell a good joke to new lengths in the hilarious new film OLD SCHOOL.Luke Wilson (The Royal Tenenbaums, Charlie's Angels) is Mitch Martin, the typical straight man who recently broke up with his girlfriend Heidi, due to a weekly "gang bang" she has at their house when he is out on business. Not only did he lose the girl, but he also lost the house, forcing him to move into a house loacted on college campus. As a housewarming present, his friends Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell) throw a party which changed the threes lives forever. The party inspires Beanie to open a fraternity (with people from eighteen to ninety years old) and Mitch will become the Godfather. The party also reintroduces Frank to his alter-ego (Frank the Tank) and addicted to alchohol for that moment on (resulting in a hilarious streaking incident).The Dean of the college technically controls the house, and forces the fraternity to move out. This act of revenge (the Dean and the main three were high school friends) causes everyone to act against him until the main event occurs: the Fraternity tests.Usually, any sex film released in the January to March slot is instant death from it. Look at 2002: Sorority Boys, Van Wilder, Slackers, and Crossroads were panned by the critics and audiences alike. Dreamworks must not feel very confident that the film will sell well, because its quality is in place. As a film of this genre, it rises as the best of the new millenium, surprising since it isn't a summer or winter release. Maybe the competition against GODS AND GENERALS is its best chance at success. Who knows? This film will no doubt be a success with the general audience, and the critics may very well give this film good ratings. Don't let the release date fool you.OLD SCHOOL doesn't require top notch acting, nor a lead with the talent of Luke Wilson. He did a great job in the intelligent comedy THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, but after watching his most recent, one will finally realize how much of a flexible actor he really is. Within one or two films time, he can go from serious to having a blast, but most impressively however, is how easily he makes it look. He doesn't try to overact a simple role, and with his excellent line delivery and well acted facial expressions, he plays the straight man very well.Vince Vaughn is one of a few comedic actors I haven't had the pleasure of seeing in other films. Not that it is a huge deal, but a little regretful nevertheless. Within the first fifteen minutes of the film, mainly during Frank's wedding (his pleas are priceless), the audience gets the feeling he will be the big laugh getter of the film. Even though this reviewer is happy that he isn't the funniest part of the movie, there is no denying he is very good at making nearly any line funny.And, without further ado, is the ex-Saturday Night Live star. Starring in bombs like The Ladies Man, A Night at the Roxbury, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (the film itself bombed) and a hit with Zoolander, I always felt he was restricted to do what he does best: make people laugh. He never had a part overly hilarious or show stealing. May OLD SCHOOL be his first. Ferrell sure agreed to do a lot for his "Frank the Tank" character, and the risks sure payed off. Not only do we get the first of major laughs at the opening party, but his character is from beginning to end through the roof hilarious, especially during a scene with Seann William Scott as the owner of a powerful tranquilizer gun used for animals. The film should be seen for the fact is is just flat out entertaining, but two words should be enough to encourage another viewing: Will Ferrell. He is probably the most memorable character in these films since Stifler in American Pie.OLD SCHOOL is no Best Picture film. Nor is it a highly intelligent or original film. Those descriptions don't make it stupid, and surprisingly, not gross out and not fill of toilet humor and dick and fart jokes. The previews may be decieveing, as it shows it looks to be a gross out film. There is only one scene involving any bodily humor. When these jokes are done right, they're funny. It's done right. The rest is all physical humor and good, funny dialogue.Early word on this film has been very positive from a few critics and almost all of its main audience. It isn't necesarily a teen movie, since its main characters are thirty years old. The average age should be from college up, not the American Pie audience. The film is by far more intelligent than the average sex comedy, more witty, has better dialogue, and doesn't rely on the gross out affect. Great job by Phillips and co. for making one of the better raunchy comedies in a long time.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth plenty of laughs, but falls short of greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Old School this past weekend at a sneak preview. Personally, I was looking forward to seeing the film as I find Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn to be "money". Old School turned out to be worth quite a few laughs, but it never reached what seemed like its full potential. The story is fairly simple and follows three aging friends (Wilson, Vaugh, and WIll Ferrell) through troubled times in their lives. To ease the suffering of middle-age the trio starts a fraternity of sorts. The film is at its best when dealing with all the crazy stereo-typical college hijinks. It is at its lowest when it deals with the personal lives of the three. This does, however, help the film resonate at a more personal level, but weighs down the lighter, funnier moments. On the big plus side there are plenty of cameos and a ROCKIN' 80's soundtrack. Overall a good time for you and your friends. So go, have fun, see Wilson, Vaughn, and Ferrell (at the top of his game) have a blast, and put your brain on cruise. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Laughs almost continually. Even an older guy and his wife I was sitting near enjoyed it.If falls into the gross-out type of comedy, cartoon like in many ways. Even so, it taps into reality very well. Unless you're a college administrator, in which case you may feel the need to hide any indication that you are before the lights come back on.So how does it compare to classic college frat movies? The best I can remember (yes, including Animal House), possibly the best. As comic and cartoonish as it is, it simply is closer to the truth than most. Except for the Snoop Dogg house concert.Will and Vince carry the movie with their acting, and Juliette Lewis does a great job with her roll as well. Then there is Andy Dick, but I'm not sure how much acting was really required. The casting person deserves a lot of credit for picking the right people.Finally, the soundtrack is extremely fitting. Though you don't expect any FX, they are there and fit seamlessly.</fullReview>

Movies that aren't great "films" or beautiful "works of art" but overwhelmingly succeed at making you laugh.The laughs begin almost immediately - out loud laughs - and grow until during the tranquilizer dart scene, I was convulsing, wiping tears away, and hoping I wasn't missing anything because I couldn't see or hear what was going on because of my own laughter.I will pay to see this see this movie again, and I will buy the DVD when it comes out.Fans of comedy... you MUST see this movie!</fullReview>

Stand-out performances by Vince Vaughn and Will Farrell...it was obvious these two were going to steal the spotlight. Luke Wilson, as always, played the quirky straight man - and yes, there is a love story thrown in there for him. But the love story and the plot all play second fiddle to the charismatic, bust-your-gut, eye stinging laughter that will keep you far too busy to notice any technical short-comings. I gave it a 10 - I really hope these guys get together to do more stuff... the casting director should get the most praise. The smile never left my face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your New Animal House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems fitting that 25 years ago we were introduced to the Delts and it took that long for a movie to equal the pure riotous laughter of the original Animal House. Will Old School win any Oscar's or be nominated for that matter H**L No, will this film make you laugh so hard that you can't breath and make your side feel splitting pain ABSOLUTELY! As you can probably tell from the trailers and commercials, Old School doesn't have a lot of story or character development, in fact, the story is there just to keep the gags, lines, and jokes flowing. Oh but do the laughs come, like a busted 36 inch water main you are inundated with laughs and they don't stop. My fiancée and I were laughing so hard we couldn't catch all the dialogue so were going back to see it again.Ferrell or Vaughn steal every scene there are in, Ferrell with his brand of physical and `crazy' dude humor and Vaughn with his quick wit and one-liners. Vaughn brings his unique fast talking, dialogue style humor to the part of Beanie, the owner of six SpeakerCitys and the father of two. Mark my words: the word `Muffs' will enter the pop culture lexicon very quickly based solely on this film and what Vaughn did with it. Ferrell is in top form as well and fortunately for us, doesn't have the handcuffs on his performance that he has had while doing other films and SNL. Therefore you get the full Ferrell.both figuratively and literally. Afterwards I found myself thinking that when this story was written, the roles of Frank and Beanie were written specifically for Ferrell and Vaughn because I don't believe anyone could have played them better.I chose not to include any of the jokes in this review because I cannot do them justice; you must see them for yourself. Do I recommend this movie.ABSOLUTELY! Will you see a funnier film this year.only if Bubbahotep from Bruce Campbell gets released, otherwise, this is the funniest thing you have ever seen. However, do budget for a second showing because we were in a 1000 seat theater with maybe 100 people in it and you couldn't hear half the lines because everyone was laughing so hard including myself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An "Animal House" for a new generation. Fantastic! **** (out of five)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OLD SCHOOL / 2003 / ****DreamWorks Pictures presents a film directed by Todd Phillips. Written by Scott Armstrong and Todd Phillips. Staring: Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughn. Rated R (for some strong sexual content, nudity and language).By Kevin Kaufman:I'm not sure how much critical success "Old School" will receive, seeing as the film is intended for teenage moviegoers. By that, I mean high school students through college students. Being in that particular age group, I can say, without hesitation, that I loved this film. I found it to be a great "kick back" comedy, filled with plenty of laughs, a great story, and an all-star cast.The setup: Mitch Martin (Wilson) arrives home early from a business trip, only to find his wife in bed, all alone, watching a porno. Thinking it's only self-gratification, Mitch is turned on. At that point, two blindfolded strangers come out of the closet. Now distraught, Mitch is convinced by his friend Beanie (Vaughn) and Frank (Ferrell) to start a fraternity on a college campus.First of all, let me say that this film is very similar to "Road Trip," another Todd Phillips film. If you didn't like "Road Trip," I suggest that you stay away from this film. Though this film is better than Phillips' 2000 release, both films share similar themes and qualities. However, If you did like "Road Trip," see this film by all means.The cast in this film really shines. Much like "Animal House," (or, regrettably, "American Pie 2") this film highlights the college life. But instead of the cast being strictly teens, "Old School" hands us some of the most respected adult comedic actors working today. Will Ferrell is hilarious as Frank. And Luke Wilison and Vince Vaughn are also great as Mitch and Beanie, respectively. The story also is surprisingly good and well crafted. It's nice to see an original teen comedy with an original story, rather than all those recycled plots. Good job Scott Armstrong and Todd Phillips!All in all, "Old School" is a fulfilling comedy jam packed with a wicked cast, some groovy tunes, and all the college hotties one can ask for. I'll take this flick over the "American Pie" series any day (I've always hated both of those films). If you in the mood for a kick back, "guy" comedy filled with sexual jokes, and typical college life, see "Old School." It might just take some of the older dudes to those good ol' days of college. Funny, funny stuff. --- 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now I know that most of you out there are thinking that "I've seen all the funny parts after watching the preview twice". Well, that is far from the truth. First of all, In following up after such great movies like American Pie and other not so great movies such as Road Trip, this movie could not include much of the funny laughs it has in these previews. Secondly, Will Farrell, and Vince Vaughn are perfectly cast in their roles, and Luke Wilson has proven to me in his last couple movies that he has what it takes to be a lead. Also, in commenting on this movie, I have an obligation (if only to myself) to say that I was disappointed about Elisha Cuthbert (from '24') and her 5 minutes. Not actually her 5 minutes, but her only having 5 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well as everyone knows this is a freaking hilarious movie. It's pretty much considered a classic so how I missed seeing it until now is beyond me. I finally 'get' what my brother is doing when he says "earmuffs" to his 2 year old son now.Cheap laughs and raunchy over the top humour from a fantastic cast who work incredibly well together. Lots of cameos and clever secondary roles or bit parts as well. Well Ferrell actually made me cry I was laughing so hard.The plot is pretty good for a comedy and follows 3 mid twenty-ish guys trying to postpone adulthood (responsibility, wives, families) in favour of recapturing the irresponsible fun of their college years by starting their own off-campus frat house. In order to avoid being evicted by the Dean, still holding a personal grudge they bring together a misfit of student pledges; losers, the middle-aged and elderly retirees. 6/1/11</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong, mildly funny comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Old School" is a somewhat funny comedy, in the vein of "Animal House", in which a group of middle aged men start a college fraternity in order to escape the drudgery of their middle class, white collar world.The film stars Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson and Will Ferrell, but possesses few jokes and little insight. What humour there is comes mostly from Vaughn and Ferrell. Ferrell plays his usual slow-witted, goofy, overly sincere gentle giant, and Vaughn's a deadpan quip-trader. Most of the film is slow, dull and plot-heavy, but these two make it bearable.Unlike most "teen sex comedies", this one is aimed squarely at older men. It's a "turn back the clock" fantasy, but one carefully designed to negate any of the unseemly aspects such a fantasy may entail. And so our heroes sleep with the bosses daughter and teenage girls, but it's okay because our heroes were unconscious and "she" wanted it. Likewise, our heroes dump their wives, but it's okay, because it is "she" who wanted to end things and their relationship wouldn't have worked anyway. And so on and so on.7/10 ? See "Frat House", a documentary by Todd Phillips, or Frederick Wiseman's "High School" and "High School 2".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Couple of my dudes watched this the other night while crushing Natty's into the AM. I wasn't expecting much you know maybe a funny stiller line here and some Farrel shenanigans. Plus i kinda like new school stuff better so i was unsure about going old school. But i took the leap and the old school is pretty funny and strikingly similar to the new school i noticed. anyway old blue is over tonight we're getting trashed and talking about the big things in life like god and heaven and meaning and reality, so i gotta go old blue is calling my name... Blue has a new theory on Kant and he can't wait to tell me while doing a beer stand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love this movie! It's great if you have had a bad day and need a good laugh. Also great to put on if you have the right guests at home.Anyone can laugh at this movie and if you can't you need to get over yourself! Hello earmuffs! No cussing around Vaughn's kid without them and Ferrell takes full advantage. That scene alone makes me laugh out loud! The seat-belt scene in the cab got me off to hysterically laughing! If you haven't seen this movie you really need to. Don't ask me why just watch it! Trust me! Will Ferrell is great and Vaughn is even better.

I never actually got around to seeing this movie before, it was only recently that I saw it and completely fell for it!I could watch it for days and not get bored with it!Frank the Tank surely delivers some of the best comic scenes(and lines!) in movie history!Lots of fun and roaring with laughter is what you will get by seeing Old School.This is definitely a must see!

		<shortDescription>Probably the Quintessential Will Ferrell Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, you could watch "Anchorman" or "Elf" or "Wedding Crashers"... but if you want real Luke Wilson and Will Ferrell action, you want to see "Old School".A group of 30-year old men turn a house into a fraternity to recapture their days of beer-drinking and women-catching. But once the dean finds out, it becomes an all out war between these men and the establishment.The cast is perfect: besides Wilson and Ferrell, you have Vince Vaughn, Elisha Cuthbert, that girl from "Rushmore", Jeremy Piven, and a variety of other cameos. Even James Carville, who is just about the last person you expect to appear in a sophomoric comedy of this type. Well, second to last: Robert Novak would have been stranger.I have no complaints to make about this film. If you're familiar with the work of these gentlemen, you know what you're getting already. And this is the cream of the crop. If you like their other movies and not this one, I think you're probably out of your mind or on some mind-altering drug like Ketamine. Because how can you not appreciate this? Oh, and it has Terry O'Quinn and Snoop Dogg. Seriously, watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(This comment is dedicated to Patrick "Blue" Cranshaw, 6/17/19-12/28/2005) American Pie was too toilet oriented and Van Wilder was simply disgusting. But aside from showing parts of Will Ferrell that the world really could do without, Old School hit the mark. Funny jokes, 80s parody, hot girls like Elisha Cuthbert (and Ellen Pompeo, before she totally ruined her sexy image with Pink's Gynecology or whatever prime-time wannabee intellectual soap she felt was necessary to rescue her "bimbo" image. Courtney Thorne-Smith and Daphne Zuniga suffered a similar self-imposed metamorphosis with Melrose Place). I would've preferred more female nudity, but the initiation rites, keg parties, and cameo appearance by Sara Tanaka (of Rushmore fame) was ample compensation. Maybe the special effects for Weensie's vaulting scene could've been better too, but hey, who's being picky."We're going streaking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</fullReview>

My two favorite scenes are when they are in the church and when Mitch first shows them the house. I think once you see these scenes you will find out what I am talking about when I say the dialog is amazing. The acting is astounding and the appearances by Sean William Scott and Craig Kilborn didn't hurt either. Jeremy Piven plays an excellent villain and really does a good job of getting the audience to hate him.

		<fullReview>This is really nothing out of the ordinary or anything special, but its an amusing and often funny film that's definitely worth a watch!. All the characters are cool, and the story is good, plus it has three very funny performances in Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell!. I do wish Elishia Cuthbert, Juliette Lewis and Seann William Scott were used more, and some scenes were just not that funny, however I got what I expected and that was a pretty funny way to pass the time, and I don't regret watching it a bit!, plus Will Ferrell's streaking scene was hilarious!. The Opening is really cool and Luke Wilson always plays a great straight man in Comedies!, plus the scene where Ferrell shoots himself in the neck with a tranquilizer was very funny!. Jeremy Piven plays his role extremely well as the asshole, and I thought the ending was pretty cool as well!, plus the wrestling scenes are great. Its got plenty of nudity to enjoy and it's quite well made as well!, plus Luke, Will and Vince all had great chemistry with each other. This is really nothing out of the ordinary or anything special but its an amusing and often funny film, that's definitely worth a watch!, and I say check it out. The Direction is good. Todd Phillips does a good job here with very good camera work and keeping the film at a fast pace!. The Acting is excellent. Luke Wilson is great here, he always plays an excellent straight man in Comedies and here is no different, he is funny, had great chemistry with Ferrell and Vaughn, was very likable, and focused and was just perfect for this role, I dug him as usual. Will Ferrell is hilarious for the most part, his streaking scene really cracked me up, as he did his usual goofy stuff, and it really worked here, he really blended in with the film well, and had a cool character, I liked him a lot, and i'm not a big fan of his but he's great sometimes, and here he proved that to me!. Vince Vaughn is funny as always and did just great here, I loved his sense of humor, as he really cracked me up!. Jeremy Piven is excellent as the asshole, I hated him but he really excels at these roles here is no different. Ellen Pompeo is decent here as the love interest and did what she had to do adequately, not too hard to look at either. Juliette Lewis is usually amazing in anything, however not here because she only has one scene!, she did good in it though, and it was great to see her again! (Juliette Rules!!!!!!). Elisha Cuthbert is incredibly gorgeous!, and did very well with what she had to do, which unfortunately was not much, as i would have loved to seen more of her! (Elisha Rules!!!!!!!!!). Craig Kilborn is convincing as the cheating asshole, he did his job well. Seann William Scott is very funny in his scene but that's all he had, I wished he had more! (Scott Rules!!!!!). Leah Remini and Perrey Reeves both do what they have to do well. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5</fullReview>

I don't know how any of the other actors could keep a straight face while he his delivering lines on set, during the course of filming this movie. I still can't get past Will Ferrel's facial expressions. His subtle expresssions say so much. The only thing that this film could have improved upon with was a cameo by Dave Chappelle. Two thumbs up.

		<fullReview>Will Ferrell typifies most middle aged men in this movie. He tries to conform with what he thinks society expects from him by getting married and buying a house and generally acting in a responsible way. Unfortunately his will persists and like a child he finds it impossible to resist temptations that we have to assume plagued his youth, hence the nickname.At times the situation comedy reaches Laurel &amp; Hardy proportion with excellent use of sound/music and imagery. Have to say, it happens occasionally, when you see a scene in a film that causes you to double up in pain of laughter, so much so that you wonder if the scene will hold its power on repeated viewings. This film contains a scene that I continue to watch, it acts as an instant pick me up from the nonsense that can be life. Highly recommend this film for adults, its addictive like all Will Ferrells films - He has the X factor when it comes to Comedy - Good stuff Team</fullReview>

The only way to show this is to show the misery and unhappiness (in a pretty light hearted way) that their adult lives have dealt them.And if you don't think the FRANK RICARD is probably the funniest character in comedy over the last decade, go get your GREEN HAT.And shove it....Want to laugh?

		<shortDescription>Update of Animal House with hilarious results *** out of ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the huge success of Animal House in 1978, Hollywood has "blessed" us with all of the tired sex joke comedies year after year. First came the occasionally funny Porkys then the surprisingly good Police Academy and a string of duds that I don't care to remember. Since the sometimes talented Will Farrell has starred in some of the worst movies ever made, it was no surprise that Old School should have been as equally unfunny.Will, I TAKE IT BACK! I came into the theater expecting a disappointment, and found myself laughing all the way through it and Farrell gives a performance that would almost equal that of the late John Belushi (of whom there was nobody better).Mitch (Luke Wilson) returns home to discover his girlfriend in the middle of a threesome. Realizing that her excuses are like a butt (everybody's got one) he almost buys into her lies until a knock at the door from a gentleman (no, not a Jehovah's Witness or Mormom) announces that he is hear for the gang bang.Meanwhile Will Farrell (Frank Richard) is getting married despite warnings at the alter from Vince Vaughn who whispers "this is the last vagina for the rest of your life." This leads some very funny moments in particular the wedding singer who at the reception has his own version of a famous love song. Mitch eventually moves into a house on a college dorm and funny guy Vaughn (Bernard Campbell) shows his friendship by throwing a party to "ease the pain" of his failed relationship. Frank assures his wife that he will behave and that lasts about 1 minute after he arrives.The next morning, the dean (four eyed geek Jeremy Piven) cocks up an idea to have them kicked off campus unless they are able to form an actual fraternity. While the idea seems impossible, the Three Stooges find a way to pull it off.One of the nice things in a movie is to see the co-star provide most of the laughs like Steve Martin did in Little Shop Of Horrors and Kevin Kline In A Fish Called Wanda. While Farrell is billed third on the credits, he is the star. This is not an exaggeration especially when Farell shoots himself in the neck with a tranquilizer and the rest, you just have to see. Even critic Roger Ebert (who awarded the film one star) admitted that Will Farrell had some nice scenes.Like all comedies, the laughs aren't always there but there are a lot of them in Old School that makes you just want to stand up and yell, "lets party"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instead of horny teenagers like in Phillips' last film Road Trip, we're introduced here to a bunch of horny men in their early 30's. Married, trapped in routine jobs and longing for their collage days. The three of them carefully select a larger group of losers and they start their own fraternity. Old School perfectly fits in the popular category of 'sex and booze'-comedies. Will Ferell is cast best as the former party animal who suffers from an early midlife crisis. His career contains multiple low-brained comedies already but Old School is easily one of the best. Vince Vaughn doesn't really belong in a cast like this but he makes the best out of it. So does Luke Wilson...that guy is a lot better than his overrated brother Owen, in my opinion. There are many gorgeous looking girls walking through the screen, nice cameo's ( by Sean William Scott for example ), there's a terrible forced happy ending and we even get to see a little bit of ravishing female flesh...what more do you want? Oh yeah, the film has a really good soundtrack! The best aspect about the entire film is the terrific use of catchy songs at the right moment! The best sequences are supported by songs like 'Master of Puppets' by Metallica, 'The Sound of Silence' by Simon &amp; Garfunkel and 'Here I go again' by Whitesnake. Paying attention to the soundtrack is definitely recommended when you're watching this average comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoilers! once again I am expected to suspend my belief expotentially. I mean come on! In order to enjoy a movie like this, I have to be able to somewhat relate it to real life experiences in general and say, "yeah that could happen". a situational comedy movie to me is only funny if we can sit back and realize that these things could happen in real life and thereby we find humor by vicariously seeing someone else experience it.But like every other movie nowadays, everyone has to go over the top, just like American Pie. I simply cannot enjoy OLd School because too many of the things would never ever happen. So unless I am watching a classic movie like "Airplane" which is supposed to be unrealistic and not situational, i cannot sit through movies like this. Here are some examples:1.Frank apparently has no job. No need to earn an income.2.who in the hell would pay some freaking man to come over and show three women how to give blowjobs? What women would possibly waste her time to sit in someone's living room with a cucumber, with other women and perform oral exercises with a faggot instructor on giving blowjobs. Utterly ludicrous and simply a vehicle for cheap laughs.My god!3. When Mitch is in the coffee shop with Juliette Lewis, the high school girl happens to be there too. (how coincidental!!) she then precedes to say everything to mitch about their escapade in front of Juliette, as if she wasn't there. "Don't worry about my dad, he doesn't know anything's going on". Yeah right. Why would she do that? Why? She could not be that stupid. Who would just walk up to someone at a coffee shop and blurt out something so private in front of someone else. Wouldn't the high school chick have to expect that the other women could be a girlfriend. Or even if the stranger was simply a friend or family member, would it make sense to walk right up to the table and just blurt out everything. IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN. But for the lazy uncreative writers, the scene is necessary to make a point.4. C'mon! a 92 year old man dies and Will Farrell sings at his funeral? Where's this guys family. No way man.5. There's no way a Dean to any college would behave in such a manner. Running through campus, visible to everyone, just jeopardizing his career to exact this vendetta he has with the fraternity.this is like some cartoon!6.Yeah right. Snoop Dogg's gonna show up at this frat party. Goodbye you morons. this movie is trash!</fullReview>

My personal favorite was when 'Frank the Tank' shoots himself in the neck with a tranquilizer gun!

		<fullReview>This was not a great movie. Comedies today seem to be created one scene at a time. A lame plot line is concocted to string them all together at the end. The Porky's and American Pie movies are examples. With that said, this movie contains some great bits. There are some very funny scenes and it is worth watching as long as you temper your expectations and drink a few beers first. It's no Animal House, but it's better than any of the police academy movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually rent comedies like this one, but I gave it a shot because of the excellent cast. It's hilarious! Similar premise to Animal House but perhaps funnier. Will Ferrell is great as the newlywed beer-guzzler "Frank the Tank," Vince Vaughn's appalling asides at the wedding are worth the price of the rental alone, and Luke Wilson is a perfect heartbroken leading man. Luckily, Juliette Lewis isn't in much of the film because it's definitely not her best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>KISS-Keep it simple stupid. If you like to watch comedy to laugh your arse off, and your ok with over the line humor, watch this and laugh. Then do it again. If you want Citizen Cane, don't see movies like this! Here's the perspective: Dudes 10 years out of college like myself (though I never grew up) and now apprehensive about never having that kind of fun anymore go far enough in their various ways to go back and do it again. This isn't 600 level astrophysics, it's roll one up, grab a beer and laugh time. I laugh out loud through half this movie, it holds up under repeated viewing very, very well if this is in your range for humor. I've read comments both here and elsewhere, pro and con, and this one is like Caddyshack or Animal House, you get it or you don't. The juxtaposition of situations is hysterical and outrageous, scene after scene of bellylaughs, and generally over top funny start to finish. I haven't laughed with a movie this much in ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest and well-written movies ever made. The casting, from Luke Wilson (who was incredible as Mitch)to Jeremy Piven (his best comedic effort, very underrated) could not have been more perfect. Vince Vaughn was amazing with his cutting dry wit. And, of course the drunken teddy-bear performance by Will Ferrell was unforgettable. But along with a great cast with tremendous chemistry you have to have great writing, directing, and performances by everyone in every role to achieve classic status. This movie has done that. Critics of this comedy heavyweight see it again and look a bit deeper, it is wonderful. Surely it will be quoted at parties as often as Animal House was or even as much as Caddyshack is quoted on golf courses. It should only gain momentum as time goes by and people get to see it again and again (the more you see it, the funnier it is). It will become one of those movies where if it's on you can't turn it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like raunchy sex comedies as much as the next guy, but Old School was pretty mediocre. Granted, there were a few funny parts, but you should only watch it if your expectations aren't too high. Some of these other user comments might lead you to believe the film is extremely funny, but you aren't missing much in my opinion. Skipping it wouldn't do much damage.Old School's best moments consist of an "oral sex class" part, and a bit of nudity. If that's worth $5 to you, then be my guest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok i registered on this site just because of the comments posted for this movie. Old School could be the FUNNIEST movie of all time. I guess all the other people writing comments for this are old and not funny people. You're lives must be terrible, i guess you think you are intelligent or something. Lets start, #1 Will Ferrell is rediculous in this movie, so is Vince Vaughn. I read a post that Vince Vaughn is not funny?????? are you retarded? The movie just doesn't stop with the laughs, at some points i didn't have enough breath to laugh anymore, so i just made noises instead. My stomach hurt i was laughing so hard. The movie was not suppose to make a whole lot of sense, it was just suppose to be hysterical for the sake of being hysterical. Will Ferrell is incredible. Enough with your posts, where you are trying to sound sophisticated. Your life must be terrible if you did not find this movie funny. Rent it one more time and just skip to the dart scene, trust me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny...but could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment I saw the first trailer, I had to see this movie. As a 32 year old male, whose best party days are behind him, this film spoke to me.Maybe this heightened by expectations of the film. Positive word of mouth solidified my desire to see the movie. It came out on DVD and ran to the local video store to rent it, love it, then buy the DVD.It just did not work out that way.Don't get me wrong. This IS a funny film. Will Farrell is spectacular and Vince Vaughn plays his "Swingers" character as an older married parent, and is very good as well. I laughed out loud on numerous occassions - and there are many quality "quotes" (the measurement of a comedy for guys).My beef with the film is that it could have been much better. The premise is fantastic, and they do not capitalize enough on the squareness that becomes your life as you grow older. There is less party and goofy scenarios as the older guys try to relate to the younger guys (Will Farrell's explanation of his 'big' Saturday not withstanding), and too much of Luke Wilson's love story and dopey "gross out scenes". The Andy Dick scene is just a waste.Overall "Old School" is a pretty good movie with some GREAT scenes. But that does not add up to be a "classic".Review: 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old School shines with three talented actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Luke Wilson plays Mitch in the funniest film I've seen in quite a while, Old School. I've never thought of Luke as the funny actor in his family. I leave the laughs up to Owen. With films like 'Legally Blonde' and 'Alex and Emma' under his belt you'd think this dude was a serious wuss. But then you get into his films like 'Old School' or 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and you change your mind. He's a great actor in both the comedic genre and the dramatic genre. So we've covered Luke Wilson. But he doesn't really make this movie. Want to know who does? Oh a little comedian by the name of Will Ferrell. I don't know if you've heard of him or not, but he's the funny dude who played on Saturday Night Live and was also seen in 'Zoolander' with Luke's brother Owen. Yes, this man sure knows how to make me laugh so hard my side hurts. Oh Will you're crazy man, you're crazy. Rounding out the cast you've got Vince Vaughn, the man who made me cringe in 'Psycho'. He was also in a small role in 'Zoolander'. Wow, all these actors are connected, and I just know stumbled across that. Luke's bro is Owen. Owen was in 'Zoolander' with Will and Vince. Oh geeze, sometimes I scare myself. We're not playing the 7 degrees of Kevin Bacon here. So I'll stop. Anyway, besides having the funniest cast to hit the block in a while, it's also got some really funny jokes. Oh even if Will wasn't saying the lines, and let's say that Pauly Shore was, well it would still be funny. Plus besides having the most hilarious storyline to come in a long while, it's also got a soft side to it. A love story is tangled up in the jokes --- somewhere. You'll see it somewhere. And I like how it wasn't really a main focus in the movie anyway. Love is so overrated. Okay, so go rent this movie now or you will be sorry cause you want to laugh --- right?Ratings (out of 4 stars): Script - ** 1/2 Cast - *** Overall - ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Comedy...Your my boy Blue!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the funniest movie I saw in the theaters since There's Something About Mary. I loved it. First off Will Ferrell steals every scene he is in and pushed this movie from very good to great. The comedy ranges from outrageous to (rarely) subtle. The wedding singer is an example of the simple, subtle, but genius comedic moments. Why is it so funny and why hasn't somebody thought of it before? As for the big laughs there are too many to mention from the bosses daughter, to the streaking scene, the tranquilizer scene etc etc etc. The three main cast members (Vaughn, Ferrell, and L.Wilson) make a great team each bringing their own different comedic style to their respective roles. Lets be honest every 30 something male wishes he could live in this "fraternity" and relive wild days gone by if only for a brief time. If this movie doesn't make you laugh at least a few times you may be dead, and if you're not dead there's a good chance your cheeks could hurt from laughing and smiling for an hour and a half. My only complaint is that Jeremy Piven is a great comedic actor and misused as the dean who wants the frat shut down. He did a fine job, it's just that I know how funny the guy can be and he was just your standard villain you see in any campus comedy. In closing let me just say Long live the Godfather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, but why did they take out all the extras?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old School is about 90 minutes, which is the standard for dumb comedies (which i love). However, despite all of the great parts in this movie, the last 20 minutes felt rushed and choppy, and really hurt the overall product. I left the theatre slightly disapointed, thinking about what could have been. I bought the unrated DVD the first day it came out, and when i watched the deleted scenes, i was shocked. THey were fantastic, funny, and ke to the movie. I cannot figure out why they were cut. My only hope is that the producers produce an extended version, that has all these scenes in the movie, plus anything else they cut. Usually deleted scenes are left out for a good reason, they either suck, or mess with the flow too much. Had the movie included the extra 20-30 minutes i saw on the DVD, i would have walked out comparing it to the other masterpieces like Caddyshack, trading places, and dumb and dumber. I can't believe they had something so good and screwed it up so badly. This is a movie about a fraternity, and that part is sorely neglected. Also the ending is really weird, unexplained, and hard to believe. Had they beefed it up and left in the many funny lines, the weirdness and plausibility would have been overlooked, like in most other classic stupid movies.Bottom line, great movie, kept out of the pantheon because of poor editing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst film of the year...the worst film ever!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If AFI ever does a list of the 100 worst films, I nominate "Old School" as being the worst film of all time!! I wanted to laugh. I was ready to laugh. God knows, I tried to laugh, but there was nothing to laugh at. However, in the unrated version on DVD, the airline ticket seller had ONE funny line at the end of the scene. Finally, I had ONE laugh...but then, those who paid to see the film in the theatre never got to see the deleted scenes. The movie took on the role of an "idea" session among script writers. "Wouldn't it be funny if Will Farrell streaked across town?" "Wouldn't it be funny if Andy Dick taught a class of a half dozen housewives how to perfect oral sex with raw vegetables" "BOY! THAT WOULD BE A HOOT!", "Wouldn't it funny if the token black student weighed 400 pounds and fell off a roof with a concrete block tied to his penis?" "Man, that would have 'em rolling in the aisles!" "What if Vince Vaughn were not just manipulative...but MEAN and LOUD and let him overact?" "Gee, that's funny just thinking about it!" These inane ideas were mulled over by a one shot director/producer/writer/bit part player who has no concept of what's funny and what's ridiculous. DIDN'T Spielberg or anyone at Dreamworks see this piece of excrement before they decided to release it? Everyone had a good time making the film. Too bad they didn't keep the audience in mind. In my lifetime I've seen over 10,000 films and NONE of them come close to "Old School" as being the worst film ever made. It made me want to rush out and rent "Ishtar" for comic relief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you've always wanted to see Will Farrell naked, now's your chance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tagline of the movie, `All the fun of college, none of the education,' is surprisingly more descriptive than the usual movie tagline. The movie does manage to eek by at a higher level than it's idiotic colleagues, the American Pies and Road Trip and The New Guy, Not Another Teen Movie, etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. These are kinds of movies that we are flogged with more in the last five years or so than we ever have in the history of the movies, and they seem to be going downhill, as though filmmakers are conducting morbid experiments on the moral and intellectual depths of their viewing audience. While Old School certainly contains all of the ingredients of one of these experimental films, it manages to escape being yet another vicious insult to the general intelligence of moviegoers as a whole, although just barely.Vince Vaughn single-handedly saves this movie from a fate that it was almost sure to suffer. This is a tremendously talented actor who is distantly above doing movies like this (although other actors in the movie, like Farrell (and probably no one else) are hugely talented as well but are famous for this type of comedy), but who takes on the role with a smile and with the right frame of mind and who, mostly with a straight face, delivers all of the funniest lines in the movie.If you go to the home page for Old School on the IMDb, there is a message at the bottom where someone asks people what their favorite line from Old School is, and if you click on that there is a huge page of people's quotes, which just shows how packed this movie is with hilarious scenes and bits of dialogue. I'll be the first to admit that there is plenty of cheesy crap in the movie (since I tend to look for stuff like that when I watch a movie like this), but there is also a huge amount of great comedy that more than makes up for it. There are tons and tons of scenes and pieces of dialogue that are unexpected and hilarious but not unexpected in that they were just thrown in for a laugh or for shock value.And besides that, Master of Puppets was on the soundtrack! How can you POSSIBLY go wrong?? When was the last time you saw a movie that was brave enough to use a Metallica song on the soundtrack? BRAVO!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really funny movie! I laughed so hard I thought I was going to cry! The story line is very unbelievable but simply hysterical. The story is about a man named Mitch (Luke Wilson) who catches the early flight home and catches his slut girlfriend (Juliette Lewis) inviting the neighbors home for a gang bang. He flips out and they break up. Since his girlfriend keeps the house, he has to move out to a very crummy apartment, which his newly married friend Frank (Will Ferrell) and his other married friend Beanie (Vince Vaugn) help him move into. When they are getting kicked out of the house by the Dean of the university down the street (Jeremy Piven) because the area is being made for university students, they decide to start a fraternity. The members of their fraternity are the strangest people ranging from an midget from India, a really obese black man and a 89 year old elderly man named Blue. The movie is for people who loved comedys like Road Trip and National Lampoon's Van Wilder! It is also for others too. I really recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie to go see.

		<fullReview>What's with you whiners who don't like this movie. I read some of the posts of people who thought this movie sucked. You guys just don't get it. IT IS A COMEDY. Easy to follow plot, exaggerated antagonist, etc...the simple recipe for a comedy. Stop comparing it to Animal House, Caddyshack, etc... Those were funny then. But we have evolved. We laughed at American Pie, we laughed at Scary Movie. These movies are designed as elongated skits from SNL. When you don't click with a comedy like this one, guess what you are too old. You've turned into your parents.What's funny is that Roger Ebert hated this movie. He gave it one star and explained in detail how poorly used the actress Ellen Pompeo was in her role as the romantic interest of Luke Wilson. Hey Roger, get a clue. She is working in Hollywood. It's a job. She doesn't take her craft as serious as you do you blow-hard. Word to the wise for other people who appreciate low-brow humour...when Ebert hates it your will love it. (References: Ace Ventura Pet Detective, any Adam Sandler comedy, Booty Call)Enough already. If you read this far, convince yourself, your brothers and your friends to go see this movie. Spread the word. It would be great too see this movie make alot of money and make the critics look out of touch with their readers.</fullReview>

Will Ferrel is great though and the funniest scene is actually during the end credits, so be sure to stick around for that.Some people here say this is the funniest movie ever made, and I'm sure they think so.

The second time I saw it, I could remember a bit more in the end (not that much more, mind you), even though I didn't find it quite as amusing this time. Finally, I just watched it for the third time last night, and I think that was also my last time. I think I can remember most of it now (some parts still didn't ring any bells the third time, even though I had seen them twice before!), but overall, I didn't find it too amusing this time, so what good is that?Mitch Martin, Frank Ricard, and Bernard "Beanie" Campbell are three friends, all currently in their thirties, who are not currently having the best of luck. One night, when Mitch comes home from work, he finds out his girlfriend, Heidi, is playing a sex game with another couple, and that's the end of their relationship. Shortly after this incident, Frank gets married, but giving up his partying lifestyle will not be easy. Beanie has been married for a while now, and has kids of his own, but longs for his old partying lifestyle. Mitch has moved into a house on a local university campus, and the three friends start a fraternity there to relive their past! Many people join them, including students, as well as others of different ages, the oldest one 89. However, Gordon Pritchard, whom Mitch, Frank, and Beanie knew in their childhood and liked to pull pranks on, is now the dean of this university! Still holding a grudge against them, he plans to shut down this fraternity of theirs! Two scenes I COULD remember from my first viewing of "Old School" are Frank (played by polarizing comedian Will Ferrell) enthusiastically running naked down the street, and one of the fraternity members (a student) being accidentally pulled off a bridge when the brick attached to his genitals with a rope falls down a sewer hole. From what I remember, I found both of these gags highly amusing the first time I saw them. However, the last time I watched the film, I found the former only mildly amusing, and thought the latter was pretty lame. I don't know exactly why I found that one so funny in the first place! Some parts definitely did make me laugh during my latest viewing, some probably slightly more so than the public nudity scene. However, I didn't find most of the film too amusing, found a lot of it boring, and definitely found more than one lame joke. In fact, I think the scene where Frank walks around with a bullet in his neck before falling into the pool was just a tad disturbing to me! The first time I watched this movie, I knew it was pretty silly, but that's not always a bad thing. (I like "Dumb &amp; Dumber".) However, the last time I saw it, it DID seem like a bad thing. Maybe it's because I now have higher standards than I did back when I first watched it, or it's a film that wears thin with later viewings. Maybe it's a combination of the two. Well, whatever it is, it's clear that I don't care much for "Old School" anymore. Like I said, I could barely remember the film after seeing it once, and I assure you, I was sober at the time. I don't take any illegal drugs and don't usually drink. I think this proves that it's certainly not the most memorable comedy ever made. This 2003 comedy could be amusing if you like extremely silly, crude humour, the kind that appeals MOSTLY to guys (like me), this might be worth checking out, but I highly doubt it will be widely remembered as a classic decades from now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferrel &amp; Vaughan shine in this bland unfunny turkey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Will Ferrel and Vince Vaughan is an excellent actor (watch him in swingers he is awesome). Unfortunately they are wasted in this movie, a very bland attempt at re hashing tired clichés for other movies (fightclub, animal house, porkys, van wilder, American pie, billy Madison). Todd Philips directs very amateurishly. The camera work is very sloppy with no sense of rhythm which is incredibly important in a comedy to underpin the flow of the jokes. It is badly edited spoiling what jokes there are (And there are some good ones). Some of them however are incredibly pathetic and predictable - for instance the re-occurrence of the toaster gift. When Vince Vaughans son receives a gift you just know what it s going to be based on its size. Its sits there for about 20 seconds before its revealed - thats bad camera work, a good director would hide its size until the last moment thus adding an affectation of surprise to the albeit obvious punch line. Not to mention the fact that this is the third time someone receives it as a gift - Just to make sure we really really had no chance of seeing that one coming. A joke is good once, three times it just starts to get old.Todd Philips isn't that great a writer of comedy either. What writer with any ability has to bilk jokes and scenes from other films ?For instance there's the painfully bad homage to fight club with the waiter and colleague wanting to be part of the fraternity and then toward the end of the film it descends into an exact copy of the last 30 minutes of billy Madison - IE. hero has to prove oneself before the academic community in adebate/sporting/qu iz type scenario before villain self-destructs. If that wasn't bad enough just before the final credits roll we see the old man 'blue' dressed as an angel singing at a piano just like we saw carl weathers do it at the end of 'happy gilmore'. Then you have Juliette Lewis who's performance at the start was so badly acted you realize why she was so good at playing trailer trash whores - because thats what comes naturally, but even here she fails.A Message to Todd Philips. 2 things.1) Next time let Vince Vaughan and Will Ferrel write and direct. 2) Sit back, pay attention and LEARN how real talented people operate.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Does anyone read these reviews? I didn't like the main idea at all, i.e. some fraternity for older people, and their fight to keep on going. However, there are some ingenious bits, such as Will Farrell running along naked thinking he had others following him, and many more. One brilliant sequence deserves special mention: when Will Farrell has fallen into a swimming pool, messed up on tranquilizer, and has a fantasy on a beach dreaming up an ex. Which of course turns out to be a drug-created dream, but the sequence is amazing. And then there is Elisha Cuthbert. Her role is relatively small, but memorable. She is as delectable as any female on the big or small screen, and I predict big things for her. Special mention for Artie Lange from the Howard Stern show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've absolutely no idea what 'fraternity' is. I've never heard of pledges, sorority, freshmans, jackasses, prom nights or any of the other thousands of terms used (at least not in the context of education &amp; this film). Yet bizarrely Hollywood, year after year seems to think the rest of the world has an interest in either the American Police force, or in this case the Amercian College system. We don't.Luke Wilson's character made little, if any sense at all, his potential romance added nothing, Vince Vaughan is a great actor but to put it bluntly - isn't funny and hampered by starring in some of the most painfully lame films imaginable and Ferrell appears to also have some talent but no scripts that come close to reflecting it - one or two mildly amusing scenes here, when drunk but his character seemed completely lost &amp; still in the first draft. The rest of the cast had such minimal air-time they were doing nothing more than making up the numbers.This is marginally funnier than the likes of Dodgeball &amp; Anchorman (which really isn't saying that much) as there are one or two scenes that ... I wouldn't go as far as make you laugh or even smile, but at least make your lip twitch slightly.The plot (if you can call it that) moves fairly quickly at the beginning and what with the ridiculous &amp; amateurish tangents it goes off at, it's pointless thinking to yourself "why is this happening" or "how did we end up here." Just hope that you can go back to kip again.3/10</fullReview>

It seems to me that an actor or producer would have realized, at some point, that "Hey, this movie's terrible!", but apparently that didn't happen. The movie could not decide if it wanted to be funny or semi-romantic, and it ends up being neither. As for being unrated, I have no idea why it was so.

What was left was a dull, formulaic, meandering plot that seemed like it was patched together with the hope that its resemblance to Animal House would carry it off. I kept waiting for it to get better - it just kept getting worse. I give it 2 stars (7 stars for the trailer, though, for duping me into seeing this thing).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that people that are older than the age of 18 actually liked this movie. It is moronic, childish, and immature. Will Ferrell does his usual SNL acting, which wasn't to good in the first place. Everyone else seemed to be in this movie because they wanted the paycheck. Therefore, didn't take this job seriously and did not do the best job they could have. I think that everyone in this movie was trying to pretend that they were actually younger and more immature than they actually where. Adding to the actual negativitity of this movie. I don't know how to explain how terrible this movie is without actually using bad language and added swear words. The best way to describe it is that this movie is for the very immature and self centered losers who peaked in high school and couldn't climb out of being a kid and actually become a REAL Adult who is successful personally as parents and REAL Adults. I am very disappointed. Unless you are a 15 year old male kid then I suggest that you keep away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A funny, understated Saturday Night Live-type vehicle. It's also a bit confused. The concept is good - thirty-somethings sucked into opening a college 'frat house' - but once the jokes concerning the simple incongruity of older men behaving like younger ones have run out, we're not left with much more.The parallel stories concerning the men's partners don't really have much to do with the frat house joke. We have to rely on the riffing of the main three protagonists. Will Ferrell is the most engaging, managing to suppress both the self-importance which has afflicted his subsequent films and his Tourettish over-acting. Vince Vaughan doesn't and is at his aggressive, self-important worst. Luke Wilson is nominally the principal of the trio and is most successful by virtue of being most sympathetic. 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here lies the college party movie of the season, from the director of the successful and uproarious Road Trip, but for some reason Old School never seems to have the energy or humor that could be expected. The premise has promise of course- Wilson plays Mitch, a guy who comes home to find his girlfriend hosting an orgy. When his big-time, speaker store friend Beanie (Vaughn) hears of this development, he dutifully encourages him, along with their friend Frank (Ferrell) to start up a fraternity in Wilson's new house which is right next to campus and has everything to with partying and nothing to do with studying. Soon their pledges come from all walks of life; even a ninety-year old joins in on the fun. The laughs come in spurts, but a problem is that the film rests most of its laughs on the shoulders of Ferrell. And while he's dependable throughout with his style (two highlights include when he's drunk running through the streets and another is when he burns out at a party following an end to his marriage), Wilson acts like he usually does in the B comedies he stars in that only appear to be on the shelves at blockbuster, and Vaughn's character comes off as the rather obnoxious thirty-something businessman turned party dude not many want to associate with after five minutes. Jeremy Piven also comes up short-changes as he tries to pull a 180 from his role in PCU. It wasn't a waste of a comedy, but less than I expected; Snoop Dogg makes such a brief cameo he doesn't have time to mouth a shizzel before exiting. C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Howdy people, I loved old school, one of my favorite comedy's of ALL time. Just recently though i saw a copy of National Lampoons "Animal House" with John Belushi. Another funny movie. Watching this made me think that Old School is almost a remake, (albeit a bit better even) of this old 1978 movie. Both are good, and both worth watching.Lots of breasts out in Animal House - you blokes will love it. Too funny seeing the "underwear" of the girls back in the late 70's!In fact i think that Animal House has spawned a lot of copies over the years... road trips, frat houses, - this is almost the blue print for teen and early adult comedies!!!Dan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where 'the child within' remains buoyant into middle age and beyond</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look I don't know if anyone else does this? When I rent movies, what I like to do is choose two or three films to watch back to back, in a sort of film-binge. I take quite a bit of care to choose films that will 'work' together in a symbiotic resonance with each and my particular mood. It might be mono-genre fest, a world cinema whammy, old film/new remake combo or a mix and match melange. Whatever! When I'm watching with anyone else I prefer to do a quirky pairing that will promote a full on post-pleasure chin-wag. This explains why I watched OLD SCHOOL and SIDEWAYS at the same sitting. What an interesting pairing! They are both Men Behaving Badly/ Buddy Rites de Passage vehicles. They are both variants of very funny, they are both cast with known and admired funny-men, they both have comparatively young new directors, they both feature weddings and boys downtime antics.etc.etc. I love sniffing out blossoming social trend in movies (used to be in fashion forecasting). For me watching from a female perspective, the most notable thing was how both scripts constructed a scenario that allows the juvenile phase of manhood to be extended way into middle age and far beyond. the thirties are new forties and I don't think it is entirely because the bestest funny guys are that age and need continuity of work! I maybe wrong here but the film industry doesn't seem to be providing the same comedic opportunities to female actors. There have been offerings in the grey spinster/old girls genre, but they are usually serious emotional dramas. It seems so unfair that the chaps are allowed to keep their child within buoyant for ever and us women are doomed to a bitter croneship getting continually cosmetically upgraded to deny our age.I do realise films are not real life but I think you will agree there is an audience/ film interaction going on that informs society?. Old bags have a sense of lightweight fun as well, so where are all the youthful girly directors prepared to have a laugh at their own expense??? Well while we are waiting for this to happen OLD SCHOOL is superb entertainment that fills the void.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another generic teen comedy, with something a tad bit different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe the genius behind Anchorman, i.e Will Ferell partook in this dump. What exactly is this? Another watered down comedy we've all probably seen already in different shapes and sizes.Let me summarize this for you. In main characters, you've got the typical 'nice' guy who actually thinks and cares. We have the party guy, who likes to have a lot of fun but now has a family which has sobered him up a bit. We have the somewhat retarded guy who's responsible for most of the 'funny'. The only thing different about the movie compared to other teen movies are the main characters as they're not teens, but fully grown adults. For the bad guy, we have the nerd who, for lack of a better word, is a complete a**hole. Sound familiar? As for the content of the movie, here's what we have. Partying, pointless nudity, swearing, sexual references, pseudo-drama, more partying, dumb antics and 'intense' moments (e.g a really fat kid trying to pass a gym test). I don't particularly have a problem with any of these but the cold, hard truth is that they're NOT funny at all. There isn't any kind of brains applied to the humour and the way it's presented is very typical and watered down. Random nude chicks, ha ha, hilarious. Guy hit with tranquilizer and falls into a pool, ha ha, very funny. Guy gets drunk and runs on street naked, ha ha, I can't stop laughing. Oh wait, that's because I'm not laughing.The story structure is again rehashed and very weak. You know how you have a typical 'verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus' structure in most songs? Same thing with teen comedies. It can be summarized as 'happy parts, more happy parts, sad parts, everything comes together part, happy parts'. The ending is your typical 'everything's fine and dandy' and is insanely annoying.Just avoid this movie unless you're a fan of the traits I mentioned. That is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although EuroTrip is more the same territory, this is a good natured and almost as funny follow-up to Road Trip from same director Todd Phillips. Basically Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson, Owen's brother) has his nymphomaniac girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) cheat on him, Frank Ricard (Will Ferrell) gets married but can't let go of his party animal life, and Bernard 'Beanie' Campbell (Vince Vaughn) is a bored family man, so all three are disillusioned by their normal lives. Beanie suggests they from their own fraternity (male organisation) in Mitch's new house on college campus to relive their glory days bringing together a variety of misfit college students, and all ages and sizes are welcome. After a while though the new student Dean, Gordon 'Cheese' Pritchard (Scary Movie 3's Jeremy Piven) threatens to evict Mitch and his friends, who has a grudge against, from his house, unless they can prove themselves worthy college student material (or whatever), by taking some tests, physical and mental. Also starring Ellen Pompeo as Nicole, Leah Remini as Lara Campbell, Perrey Reeves as Marissa Jones, Craig Kilborn as Mark, The Girl Next Door's Elisha Cuthbert as Darcie, American Pie and Road Trip's Seann William Scott as Peppers, Snoop Dogg, Warren G. and Lost's Terry O'Quinn as Goldberg. Wilson isn't as laid back or fun-loving apart from at the parties, so Ferrell and Vaughn are the two that steal the show and create most laughs in this pretty good comedy. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, but not funny or deep enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Renowned comedy actors Will Ferrell (Blades of Glory) Luke Wilson (Blue Streak) and Vince Vaughn (Wedding Crashers) star in this comedy drama about a couple of middle aged men trying to recapture their college days.When reading the back of the DVD I thought I knew what would happen and knew the kind of genre but I was wrong.Though the film follows many conventions such as love, embarrassing situations, stereotypes and a basic plot, there were still many surprises in stall to make it an interesting watch.As in most comedies, the central character has to overcome various obstacles to find himself. Wilson's character Mitch is struggling with relationships after coming home to find his girlfriend caught up in a bizarre sex situation. On moving out he starts to realize how hard life is being single. With an ounce of predictability, this storyline is slow moving, focusing on the character, which was good enough but the situations could have been stronger and longer to give the character more depth.Vince Vaughn's character is very annoying and selfish and is frustrating to watch at points. Ferrell's character is good to watch as he is the funniest out of the free, especially the streak scene.With a strong focus upon sex, there are a few humorous moments involving carrots, streaking, dolls and naked wrestling this film is focused towards an older more mature audience.The plot is average. Situations needed more explanation and depth but had a reasonably good focus upon divorce, love and life.Jokes are often predictable but are often still funny. Acting and direction is good enough to justify the genre. The ending was slightly bizarre but otherwise its an OK film, slightly different from conventional love stories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>simply put - the frat pack strikes again, and this time doesn't missall of the actors have their usual characters, but all of them do it perfectly, mostly thanks to the script - the dialog, the jokes and funny scenes make this movie happen Will Ferrell again is great in putting his character in the most embarrassing situations, Vince Vaughn is the solid married man yet still the mischievous kid, while Luke Wilson's character tries to put his life on the 'right' rails, but with the help of his friends decides to go a different way in the end Any feminist lady will surely hate this show, but i'm sure all the boys/men watching it will have a good time Some plot resemblances to Fight Club only make things funnier; many other 'hidden' jokes add a lot to the laugh as well overall - watch it with some friends and some beer and...just have funpeace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animal House for adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old School is cut from the same cloth as film like Animal House and Porky's. It's unapologetic, raunchy, hilarious and made for guys. My wife just doesn't get it. She doesn't see the humour in the film. but every guy I have spoken to about the film can relate to it, and they love it. The movie speaks to men who perhaps are married and sometimes yearn for the younger days when they had little responsibility and could go through life in a daze of a hangover. Will Ferrel, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson are those guys.Will Ferrel again plays the funniest of the three characters and although he is played for laughs, he might also be the most relatable character. There is one exchange between him and some frat boys at a college campus party that many of us married men can relate to. Just before some of the rowdy boys are going to chug their beer, they ask Frank The Tank to participate. He replies that he can't because he has a big day the next day. He is going to Home Depot to pick out some paint and some blinds for the living room. The guys just look at him and laugh. In a movie like American Beauty, this could have been played for a serious look at men yearning for their younger days and missing out on life as it gets too serious. But in Old School, it is played for yuks. Frank the Tank begins funneling the beer and soon he is streaking on the streets of his hometown. This is very reminiscent of the scene in Porky's where PeeWee is running down the county road and pulled over by the local police.Another funny and poignant scene in the film is where Frank and his wife are in marriage counseling and the shrink tells Frank he is in a happy place and nothing can hurt him here and he can say anything. Anything? Frank replies? Anything, the counselor replies. What ensues is something Ron Burgundy would say:Anything? Well, uh I guess I, deep down, am feeling a little confused. I mean, suddenly, you get married, and you're supposed to be this entirely different guy. I don't feel different. I mean, take yesterday for example. We were out at the Olive Garden for dinner, which was lovely. And uh, I happen to look over at a certain point during the meal and see a waitress taking an order, and I found myself wondering what color her underpants might be. Her panties. Uh, odds are they are probably basic white, cotton, underpants. But I sort of think well maybe they're silk panties, maybe it's a thong. Maybe it's something really cool that I don't even know about. You know, and uh, and I started feeling... what? what I thought we were in the trust tree in the nest, were we not?This scene is painfully honest, and honestly painful, because it rings so true.I read on IMDb that this was actually an homage to Fight Club. The first rule of the fraternity is that you don't talk about the fraternity. The second rule of the fraternity is that you don't talk about the fraternity. There is even a scene where Blue is about to wrestle the two naked women, where Mitch is dressed like Brad Pitt from Fight Club. It's kind of funny to look for some of the similarities.Old School is one of the funniest films of our generation. The situations the three men go through are painful in some ways, but they are played for pure comedy. Vince Vaughn scores another winning and classic performance here as Beanie, the rich playboy of the bunch who likes to spend his money on extravagant things like hiring Snoop Dog to play at his party, and buying hundreds of packages of KJ jelly so that one of his fraternity members can wrestle in it with some hot college girls. He might as well be Joe Francis of Girls Gone Wild fame. Also making a cameo appearance is Elisha Cuthbert who plays a highschool girl that "befriends" Mitch. And she very nice to look at in the film.Old School is raunchy and unapologetic. It has a keen ear for detail and this may have been the film that proved to the studios that Ferrel could carry a movie on his own. He really is hilarious in Old School.This is a 9/10 and one of the funniest films of the decade. It will go on to be a classic.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Error</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An error in the movie that is not listed in the "GOOFS" section. In the kitchen scene at the party when the guys try to get Frank to drink out of the beer bong he says he can't because he has to get up early, "Got a nice little Saturday planned. Goint to Home Depot.....". However, the Mitch-A-Palozza poster says the party was on Thursday night. The party would have had to be on a Friday for him to need to worry about getting up early for his "Nice little Saturday".Overally, I thought the movie was comic genius and certainly the best of the Will Farrell movies although Talladega Nights was a close second and Farrell's cameo appearance in "Wedding Crashers" was brilliant.Jeremy Pivin continues to play the role of a sniveling low life that he has perfected as Ari Gold in "Entourage".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the party scene, when Frank is moving through the house and comes upon Spanish and Weensie at the beer bong, he says he can't drink because tomorrow is a "big day". The hippie on the side says: "Big day? Doing what??" Frank says "Well, actually a pretty nice little Saturday..." and then proceeds to describe his Saturday. However, the next morning, we see Mitch waking up angry because he is going to be late for work, and then comes down the stairs in a suit, which suggests that he is going to work. Then we see him in his boss's office. This suggests that he would have to be working on a Saturday...is this a goof or an example of my obsessive-compulsive attention to movie details?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a sign that I'm getting old (48 and counting) when I sit down to watch a movie with a tremendous amount of buzz and I shut it off in thorough and complete disgust. Old School is proof that humor is generally communal in nature, but good film making demands some sort of discipline.I laughed at selected moments of Old School, but the occasional LOL, intermingled with slack-jawed amazement that any studio would sign off on a plot-less, writing and acting-free project like this just leaves me shocked and in awe. There's nothing here, no story, no sense. When Luke Wilson rents a house on a university campus, there's almost no lead-in, no explanation of why he picked THIS house and not THAT one. He's broken up with Juliette Lewis and-KaBam!-Vince Vaughn, easily the most talentless entity in movies today, has a party going with-oh, boy!-Snoop Dogg, and before long, I've given up on any coherence and I'm praying that there will be enough funny stuff to keep me from cursing at the screen and putting a piece of tape over the tab hole in the VHS cartridge for re-taping.God, what crap! And the funniest thing about Old School is the dunderheads who think (that, in itself, is a stretch) this is God's gift to humor.Bonehead Appetit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very weak narrative and never hilarious but amusing enough to be distracting and quite fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leaving a dull conference earlier than planned, mild-mannered Mitch Martin arrives home to find his wife watching pornography alone. No problem to him but he does object to the blind folded couple that stumble out of his bathroom to engage in group sex with her. His depression isn't helped by him being one of the groomsmen at the wedding of friend Frank Ricard along with embittered married friend Beanie Campbell. When Mitch gets a new house near a local college, Beanie throws him a massive party, sowing the seeds of an idea. They decide to give their midlife crises a name ? "fraternity" and set up an informal frat house. However Dean Pritchard is determined to shut it down.The cast list was enough to convince that this would be an amusing comedy even if it would be unlikely to be featuring too highly in any top 50 list of cinema classics. The plot is a suitably silly affair that only serves to set up as many jokes as possible in this sort of adult college movie. It takes the clichés of the genre and uses them pretty well with a reasonably good script and sufficient laughs to keep it moving along. It isn't hilarious by any means but it is amusing and easily distracting fare that will appeal to those who generally like the humour of Ferrell, Vaughan et al. It is all a bit basic and crude at times but generally I was amusing without the poor plot ever dragging things down too much.The cast do their best to help the material by virtue of their performances and presence. Wilson is probably the least of the leads as he has to deliver a story and carry most of the narrative himself. Laughs then are equally shared between Ferrell and Vaughn, both of whom do their usual routines to good effect. Ferrell is manic and funny, even if his material is not as imaginative as I would have liked. Vaughn is very good but given too little to do ? although his comedy is usually best in small "supporting" doses. Piven is welcome but doesn't have much to work with, while Pompeo just makes up the numbers with a thankless role in the plot. Cameos from Scott and Cuthbert add interest but not a great deal else.Overall then a distracting comedy that will please those that like their comedy rowdy and like the other comedies that Ferrell and Vaughn have made. It isn't much cop and the actual narrative is easily the weakest part but it is funny enough to keep things moving forward if you are in an undemanding mood.</fullReview>

Why is it that nowadays good humor movies are ruined by filling half the movie with nude people and dirty jokes? It's not necessary to do that in order to make a successful funny movie.If all that stuff is cut out, you only have half the movie left. Really it's bad taste. The idea was good, and the dialog was good enough without all that bad taste being added to it. Apart from that, the lead actors are natural comedy talents.

Old School starts out funny, but ends kind of dull. Where is Vince Vaughn in the last 20 something minutes of the film? The plot is easy to the eye, but funny to the brain. The most funniest scenes are the ones that have dirty humor. But, I love Old School. Frank the Tank, played by Will Ferral is the funniest guy in the movie. It has a funny base, but like I said the last part of it doesn't really match up to the beginning. Sure, it's an all around film, but the plot could be a little bit more in depth. If you laughing, rent it. If you like frats and colleges, borrow it. If you like Animal House, buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Mitch (Luke Wilson Legally Blonde) catches the early flight home to surprise his girlfriend, he is the one that is surprised to find her in bed with a room full of naked strangers. Together with his two best friends Frank 'the Tank' (Will Ferrell, Saturday night live) and beanie (Vince Vaughn, Dodge Ball) they turn Mitch's new house into their very own none discriminate fraternity full of misfits and middle age dropouts. After some raging out of control antics they find themselves fighting the student dean, Pritchard, for their right to stay a fraternity.Although frank is not the main character the film you through the heart ache of frank's life and his looser style of tackling everyday life. I think that will Ferrell plays the part of frank exceptionally and so comfortably just like that is how he used to be before his big break in film. The film includes the wedding party of Frank's wedding where there is an amazingly funny rendition of 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' by an unconventional wedding singer which truly makes the song his own by adding in a few extra words for example "when I see the f*****g look in your eye." Also a few non-choreographed dance moves, which consist of pelvic trusts and the brandishing of the middle finger at the bride! This film takes its interest from 'Animal House' but gives the twist of the main characters being middle age. Teen is a typical teen style 'gross-out movie' that focuses on wild parties and nudity, which is also how the trouble starts for the unofficial fraternity.The way the director (Todd Philips road trip) shows that the endangered fraternity means business is by; having a shot of the stairs to the university looking up them with just the heads of the members poking over the top and walking forwards with the music gradually getting faster the camera cuts to a closer shot where most of the fraternity now in view and looking bigger. Again the camera cuts in to a close mid shot (CMS) where some of the fraternity are cut away, and again it cuts now with a close up (CU) of Mitch's head in the middle of the screen and Beanie to the left of him. Throughout this sequence the whole group are wearing the same clothes and Mitch, frank and beanie are in the centre. This achieves the desired effect because they are looking serious and not joking around.One of the most memorable scenes for me is the KY jelly-wrestling match. It gives the viewer a sense of familiarity because we have all watched wrestling at the same point or another. The oldest member of the fraternity (Blue) is faced with wrestling two very attractive top less women, in light of his age he doesn't move while the women close in on him saying 'what's up old man?' with that he collapses backwards with his feet in the air and suddenly the whole room is silent and taken by a huge gasp of disbelief. Todd Philips makes this scene funny yet shocking by having the mood lightened when the topless women stat to taunt Blue and just before he dies the camera zooms in on his face showing the fear he was feeling. The music 'dust in the wind' being sung by frank, fades in and then the picture fading while the camera slowly lowers to reveal frank in his suit singing in the graveyard with a united states Navy wreath saying Blue, and a black and white photo of a very handsome Youngman. The camera slowly zooms out and pans left showing the people that attended his funeral. The scene cuts to Mitch and beanie, beanie giving words of wisdom quietly to Mitch, the camera then cuts to the view we just left and the camera slow zooms back into frank as he finishes the song and shouts 'you're my boy Blue' which he says at the start of the fraternity.One of the 5 tasks they have to complete is an athletics competition, where the dean chooses 3 events and 3 random people to take part. In the vault event he chooses Todd. The way that director Todd Philips builds up the tension is by lining up the members of the fraternity along the run up mat, and also after inspiring words from Mitch and beanie the camera slows down just as soon as beanie slaps Todd's backside which prolongs him reach on the board the music gets stronger and faster when he hits the board it suddenly stops and all we hear is the screams of Todd as he flies through the air.Director Todd Philips thought of this movie as a comedy version of 'fight club' there (1999), and as such there are several references to fight club in the movie. References include (but are not limited to) the basement-wrestling match, the photocopying of club propaganda at work, the restaurant scene and Vince Vaughn's out fit during the initiation scene is to mimic Tyler Durden.To any one who loves to laugh this is a film that you have to see! Do what ever you can to get the chance. Get together with a group of friends and watch it, you wont regret it! 'Old School' provided me with more laughs than I've had in a long time and it never gets boring however many times I watch it. It is chock full of hilarious moments mainly at the expense of grown successful men living their wildest frat fantasies. This film is worth watching once if not more times, as it takes you through a roller-coaster of emotions each and every time, as well as making you chuckle and roll about in laughter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Old School" was a really good film: another takeoff on "college life", similar to Natinonal Lampoon's "Animal House" and "Van Wilder" films... yet this is something different. Luke Wilson arrives home and finds his girlfriend getting ready to have a massive orgy with a bunch of blindfolded, closet-hidden strangers and he realizes= "Why should I have to deal with this?" So he moves back into a college neighborhood and without even joining the school, starts a fraternity in a house with some friends. Will Ferrell has just gotten married and realizes that he will indeed only have "one vagina for the rest of his life". He decides to have some fun and join the frat, where kidnapping new students to bring to the frat is the norm. Vince Vaughn is also among the frat-house dwellers, bringing many laughs to this picture.This was an entertaining piece of movie= it had a good cast, lots of laughs (nude lubricant jelly wrestling, tie-a-brick-to-your-thing frat initiation, and tranquilizer gunshots to Ferrell's neck as he falls and sinks into a pool to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's "Sound of Silence") and also a motivation factor: I plan to join the Sigma Chi fraternity when I move into my college this fall. This was a good film overall and definitely worth the 90 minutes. Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old School (2003) has gotta be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! This got the world showing the best chemistry between actors such as Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson and Will Ferrel, and also formed their name as "The Frat Pack." Old School is The Frat Packs "Breakfast Club." This movie holds tons of hilarious scenes, such as the kidnapping of the pledges, the band at the wedding playing Total Eclipse of the Heart, the pledges always crack us up, Will Ferrel drunk and streaking in the streets, and the scene I laughed most in: The cinder block scene! That let the whole audience at the theater laughing for 10 minutes! I give this masterpiece a 10/10, and will forever go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Drinking beer, women wrestling, loud music, not remembering what happened the night before, and of course...Streaking. These are some of the elements of college life that are showcased in Todd Phillips' Old School.Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) is a little down after finding out his wife has been having sex parties when he is out of town. His life seems to be crumbling until he buys a house next to be a college. His friends Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell) decide to re-release Mitch back into the "wild" as they call it and throw him a huge party.This is just the beginning of what would become a new fraternity that brings people from college and the outside community together. Since it is Mitch's house that will be fraternity HQ, Mitch has been dubbed "The Godfather". With interesting induction ceremonies and "off the chain" parties. The three men get into trouble when their fraternity really gets their old friend Gordan "Cheese" Prichard, the dean of admissions, ticked off.What ensues is non stop comedy. Ferrell's character Frank "The Tank" is one that will live on for generations to come. His need to have a good time even though he just got married doesn't quit and we are thankful for that. Streaking, beer, and always ordering the frat "brothers" to do off the wall tasks.Old School, much like its predecessor Animal House, has become an essential movie for teens to watch and pick up lines from it to use in everyday communicating. I can't count how many times I've heard "earmuffs..." announced. To sum up Old Schoo, Frank "The Tank" does it the best..."Once it hits you lips, it's so good!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I'm going to touch a nerve or two with this one, but I find Will Ferrell to be funny, but not as funny as he thinks he is. He is the loudest talker in the movie Old School, an "Animal House for our generation" type movie that is mildly amusing, but not as funny as it maybe could have been. Maybe because Ferrell is so over the top, the lower key performers I found funnier, such as I found Luke Wilson's character to be the funniest and Vince Vaughn does another solid job. The movie revolves around Luke Wilson being evicted from his home because it is on the local college's campus' property. His friends (Vaughn and Ferrell) get the idea to turn his house into a fraternity, allowing Wilson's character to stay. The rest of the film is a look at how grown men relive their college days and how, I guess, you too can go back to your college days where you streak through the streets or watch jello wrestling. The film is what it is. Nothing profound, and at only 91 minutes, it knows when to end. It is funny at times, though I didn't find Ferrell to be as funny as I remembered him on Saturday Night Live. Maybe it was the writing, or maybe it was my expectations. Whatever it was, the movie is fun but not the best comedy I have ever seen, but short enough to enjoy, then probably forget about the next day.</fullReview>

At the time of this movie, it was the most advertised thing on TV.This movie offers a few laughs, thanks mostly to Ferrell. Of course, I know, not every character is supposed to be hilarious, but to entertain. Vaughn is o.k. but Wilson is terrible. What is Kilborn doing in this movie? Wasted cameo by Andy Dick.Decent comedy, offers some laughs, thanks to Ferrell and the Blue character. But this movie is one you watch once and forget. It is very overrated.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old School is the story of three men (all over 30) who try to recpature the fun and wildness from their college days. The trio of comedians Ferrell, Wilson and Vaughn give a strong performance and work well together.The jokes were original and laugh out loud funny, but not knock out, out on the floor laughing funny. As some others criticize Old School for its lack of story and exaggeration of sub plots, I didn't have a problem with it. Some of the funniest scenes were scenes that were not vital to simply the core of the story. In a movie like Old School, viewers are concerned with the story so much as the humor. Therefore I don't see a problem with the straying from the storyline. All in all Old School is very funny. Perhaps not the most original or artistic film, Old School accomplishes what it is meant to do, make the viewer laugh out loud.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does have some of the funniest scenes of any movie I have seen in awhile. Moreover, it has some major heavyweight talent, with Farrell, Vaughn and Wilson. Heck, the Dan Band alone is worth paying the rental fee. HOWEVER, there are some real duds sprinkled into this work. All parts dealing with Andy Dick should have been left on the cutting room floor. Craig Kilborn is also wasted in a ridiculous role. It just makes for an uneven film. You laugh your head off at one crazy segment and then you kind of roll your eyes at some of the other stuff that is so forced. This movie could have been great, had the story been tightened up a bit. However, some of the subplots are just tacked on for attempted laughs and do not enhance the story. In fact, they really detract from the film. I am sure that younger generations will claim this movie as their generation's "Animal House" and I guess that is OK, but it could have been better.</fullReview>

If you know this going in, you will not be disappointed. No it is not as funny as "Animal House". Nor are the characters as memorable or charming. But there are enough truly funny moments in this movie to carry it thru to the end.The three leads work well off each other. The supporting cast is fairly forgettable."Old School" won't have you forgetting Otter and Flounder or Bluto, but it will keep you smiling and laughing.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instant Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Practically within hours of its release, 'Old School' became an instant 'joe six-pack' classic to rival old-standby's like 'Animal House,' 'National Lampoon's Vacation,' 'Dazed and Confused,' and 'Porky's.' We're not talking about great cinema here, but few film choices are better for a hung-over-but-still-drinkin' Saturday matinée with the guys. Girls will find the film amusing the first time around, but the fellas will almost universally require repeat viewings to memorize all of Will Ferrell's dialogue, which they will then repeat endlessly until their girlfriends/wives threaten them with the John Wayne Bobbitt treatment.Mitch (Luke Wilson) is a real-estate lawyer down on his luck. He comes home early from a business convention to catch his girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) hosting a swinging party. After answering the door to find a miniature version of John Holmes standing at the door (director Todd Phillips in a self-effacing cameo) who announces, 'I'm here for the gangbang,' Mitch dumps Heidi and moves out, leaving behind a great house and his beloved dog, along with most of his pride and self-respect. Mitch's best buddies, slick stereo-salesman Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and newlywed Frank (Will Ferrell) decide it's up to them to get Mitch back on track. Mitch's new rental home is in a neighborhood near the local college, so Beanie masterminds a plan to help Mitch get over his problems while simultaneously buttering his own bread. He hosts 'Mitchapalooza' and invites basically the entire student body of the college, using the opportunity both to promote his string of circuit city-style stores and to give himself and his buddies a little taste of the decadent partying ways they've had to leave behind due to distractions like their wives, children, and careers. 'Mitchapalooza' is so successful that Beanie determines to make Mitch's house 'Party Central' for the college crowd and a de facto frat house for men looking to get away from their boring lives. When Mitch is threatened with eviction by the killjoy Dean Pritchard (Jeremey Piven), Beanie concocts a scheme to form a chartered fraternity with no age limits, and recruits misfits of all ages to fill out its ranks.Meanwhile, Frank (Ferrell) has fallen off the reform wagon and slipped back into his beer-guzzling party-animal alter-ego, 'Frank the Tank,' prompting his new wife Marissa to kick him out of the house. He moves in with Mitch and quickly becomes the movie's chief comic attraction. But the fun is always threatened by Dean Pritchard, who is determined to screw up a good time.Mitch is helpless to stop his friends, and before he knows what hit him, he is living in a frat house and being spoken about in hushed tones around campus as 'the Godfather,' the figurehead of the fraternity for grown men, a fact which compromises his courting of a former high school crush, Nicole (the very lovely and charming Ellen Pompeo), who is intrigued by Mitch but always seems to run into him at inconvenient moments.The plot is pretty much just an excuse for the hi-jinks and gags and to highlight the comic genius of Will Ferrell, who can't seem to do anything that isn't hilariously funny. Ferrell steals 'Old School,' as anyone who's ever overheard some jackass at a party saying 'it's so good when it touches your lips!' or 'you're my boy, Blue! You're my boy!' can attest. Vince Vaughn breaks out the wiseguy-hipster character he's been perfecting ever since 'Swingers' and plays a perfect Abbott to Ferrell's Costello, and Luke Wilson is one of the most likable male leads in the business. He's no thespian, but Wilson has that rare look and presence that makes him equally appealing to the girls (who think he's hot) and the guys (who think he's cool).Director Todd Phillips seems to be specializing in juvenile gross-out comedy (his previous best-known work was the patently offensive but irresistibly funny 'Road Trip'), but there are poignant moments in this film as well, particularly related to Frank's dissolving marriage and Mitch's growing sense of responsibility for the welfare of the young college students who have hitched their fates to the faux-fraternity.Still, this movie exists for the purpose of watching a naked Will Ferrell snatch a microphone from Snoop Dogg to yell 'we're streaking!'--It ain't 'Casablanca,' but 'Old School' is a male bonding classic to rival Monday Night Football. If you've ever had your lips on the business end of a beer bong, this is the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every single moment of Old School is wrong. The director should have asked for a re-take on every single line delivery. Not a single thing is done right. If i can see this - why could no-one on the set at the time? A real waste of time, Old School is yet another movie which only works as the movie you bring to it, the movie you imagine it to be.Example, Will Ferrell (plumper than in Elf) gives someone a toaster, without realising that that exact toaster was a present that friend gave to him a while back. The scene was a funny idea - and its only funny if you imagine it really happening. To you. The way its executed in the film betrays incompetence. Even from Will Ferrell - whose comedy timing is usually superb.Clearly the words "let's do another take" were not in this director's vocabulary.1/10. This held absolutely no value for me. I hated every minute of it. Will appeal only to brainless college frat-boys. Not men the age of the characters in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To this day... I only see this movie as mildly funny. The first time I saw it in theaters, I barely laughed at all ( and neither did the packed theater, actually). It was the kind of movie that I filled in the gaps for while I was watching it. Most of the jokes, especially the oral sex one with Andy Dick, struck me as tired and watered down. And the stuff with "Old Blue" - aren't jokes involving old people already buried into the ground?After seeing it a few times on DVD, I laughed a little more each time. The biggest laughs were commanded by Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. However, this is still no "modern comedy classic" if you ask me. I don't think it holds a candle to Dumb and Dumber, Billy Madison, There's Something About Mary, The Jerk, or the recent Anchorman.Don't try to tell me "check your brain at the door" because I certainly did and came in just expecting to laugh. I did at times, but I still don't see what all the fuss is about. Plus, if I hear one more teenage girl say "we're going streaking!" or "Snoop the Loop...you can bring your green hat", I'm going to explode. Thats up there with the morons who keep saying "hu-what" from Chappelles show.</fullReview>

This film stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell as 3 mid 30's companions whom decide to start a fraternity even though they do not attend college.Student #1: Does Vince Vaughn's character `Beanie' bare resemblance to Trent in `Swingers'? Mr. Meeza: `Swingers' is so old school for Vince. however, I do have to reiterate that Beanie does have similar behavior or misbehavior eccentricities as the vivacious Trent. Student #2: What is the funniest scene in `Old School'?Mr. Meeza: Ok! Good lead-in question because now we are going to study `Asstronomy'. That assteemed I mean esteemed recognition would go to Frank the Tank's classic nudistic march at a frat party. Ferrell did not tank with his comedic performance. It was just a classic raw scene!Student #3: Is Luke Wilson Darth Vader's son?Mr. Meeza: Next question!Student #1: Mr. Meeza, Is `Old School' the funniest film you have ever seen?Mr. Meeza: No, not by a long-shot. The funniest film I have seen is `Office Space'. However, my progress report of Old School does make it a satisfactory viewing. Pass it on! **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Animal House this isn't!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm entertained by juvenile gross-out comedies as much as the next guy but the story here is so familiar that I actually started to roll my eyes. Story is about Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) who is in his early 30's and one night he catches his girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) having orgies. He moves out and lives in a house near the University and when his best friend Bernard (Vince Vaughn) finds out he convinces him to start a fraternity so that they can party every night and meet girls. They throw a wild party one night and Mitch's buddy Frank (Will Ferrell) gets wasted and goes streaking but is caught by his wife who throws him out of the house. Frank ends up living with Mitch and the three of them quickly become legends on campus.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Mitch is infatuated with Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) but she has an obnoxious boyfriend Mark (Craig Kilborn) who constantly flirts with other women. The head of the university Dean Pritchard (Jeremy Piven) will stop at nothing to get them out of the house and finally challenges their fraternity to a bevy of tests. This film is directed by Todd Phillips who is slowly becoming one of the better comedic directors around and one has to figure that he was influenced by films such as "Animal House" and "Bachelor Party" but that's where the similarity ends. The story for this film is so familiar that it comes across as very tired and there was never any real flow or rhythm to the way it was presented. Scenes just seem to bump into each other and this film is really not edited well at all. Also, the abundance of cliche's hurts the story as well and how can you have a college comedy without the obligatory nasty Dean trying to spoil their fun? And of course Pompeo's boyfriend is a jerk, how else is the star of the film suppose to get her? When the film finally ends their really isn't any wrap-up to what you have just watched and I'm not sure Wilson even gets the girl. The film just kind of ends and everyone seemingly just moves on. Did I miss something? The only reason I didn't rate this lower is because of the talent of Ferrell who is genuinely funny in certain scenes and Andy Dick pops up in an amusing cameo but these scenes seem few and far between. Phillips is a talented director and I believe he's still learning but he has a way to go before he becomes the next John Landis or Neal Israel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, if you want to laugh until you have peed your pants. That's great! Go and rent or buy this movie. You'll enjoy watching this flick. If you want to laugh, and at the same time let your mind wander through the landscape of stupidity, sexistic jokes, lame dialogues, and below-the-waist humor, Old School is the right movie for you. Old School is a movie for people who don't want to think while their watching a film. This movie has disappointed me in every way. I was recommended to watch this movie, so I thought, sure why not...we all like to laugh, right? So I rented this movie and watched it. I hardly could sit through the whole film. It was dreadful, but I somehow managed to endure the 90 Minutes of neverending nonsense and sensless humor. I mean who in the world wants to form a fraternity for men of all ages? Young men, old men, fat men, and underachievers? Hello??? The only positive thing about this movie is when you rent or buy the DVD you'll get featurettes like Will Farell "Inside the Actor's Studio" skit, a Snoop Dogg video, and "Fantasy Wrestling" (for those who are into that kind of stuff). Otherwise, don't waste your money, nor your precious time on this flick. Pardon me, but I reserve the right to refrain from rating this movie since I've already mentioned that it's dreadful. If you want to see a movie that is funny and witty, you're better off with "Meet the Parents" or even "Elf".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe my expectations were a little too high coming in, but you would think a movie with Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Jeremy Piven and Craig Kilborn would provide a few more laughs. Will Ferrell was about the only funny thing about this movie--and even those laughs were few and far between. When will filmmakers finally realize that when we go to see movies like this, we're not looking for a compelling story? I don't really care whether or not a group of slackers are able to make good and create a counter 'Greek' movement of their own, thereby redeeming all geeks, freaks and outcasts for generations to come. I chose to see this movie because I needed a few good laughs. And that's exactly what I got--a FEW laughs. You would think they'd learn by now that you build a good comedy film around a comedian's talent. Let them shine. The story is secondary. You don't start with a bland script, and hope they'll infuse a little life into it. These funnymen obviously did the best they could with decidedly lackluster material. Big disappointment.</fullReview>

She is having gang bang parties when he is out of town. He breaks up with her and moves in a bachelor pad near a campus. His friends throw him a party. There is even a cameo with Snoop Dog. Mitch's friend, Frank 'The Tank', played by Will Ferrel, gets kicked out of his house for getting busted by his wife running the streets naked. Frank ends up moving in with Mitch.It starts getting formulaic when the evil Dean gets the house for campus use. Mitch is told he has to vacate the house. His friends find a loophole and decide to start a fraternity to keep the house. The rest of the movie is spent trying to keep the house from getting taken, and YAWN it's too bad. It would have been better if the movie was just about a bunch of 30 year olds getting a house and partying. But it turned into an Animal House rip-off. Will Ferrel did a good job with his character. He was the funniest in the movie. Even Luke Wilson was good, but the script bluntly "sucked", and it was unoriginal. 6/10, but then again I am the drunken critic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Old School' is a raucous, raunchy comedy in the `Animal House/Bachelor Party' tradition. Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn ? all of whom are very good in their roles ? play a trio of thirtysomething losers who have never really grown up, despite the fact that one of them is married with children, another has just gotten married and the third wants desperately to have a meaningful relationship. The three come up with a scheme to create an `unofficial' fraternity at the local college, giving men of all ages a chance to get away from the rules and restrictions of everyday adult life.Although there are a few undeniably funny moments in the film, `Old School' is basically a numbskull comedy filled with junior high-level jokes and pratfalls, some of which work but most of which don't. Like far too many comedies that advertise themselves as freewheeling, daring and iconoclastic, `Old School' ends up literally `old school' in the end, coming out foursquare in favor of responsibility, seriousness and conformity. In other words, it wants us to identify with these juvenile grownups, then turns right around and makes them just like the people they've been going after all along. Unfortunately for the viewer, `Old School' loses the courage of its convictions early on.There's not much point in over thinking this. Suffice it to say that `Old School' sprinkles a few good laughs over a parched desert of a comedy.</fullReview>

While the movie focuses heavily on base humor, there is comedy for every intellectual in this movie. Luke Wilson may play the main character in this film, but it is Will Ferrell who walks away with most of the laughs and the movie in this laugh a minute riot. Every joke was well thought out (even if it was improved) and hilarious. While i must admit i found the climax of the competition sequence to be a little bit of a let down the end of the movie was quite hilarious. And i never thought that anyone could make a Whitesnake song cool after 1990, but this movie did it.

He played such a sleaze, yet such a (begrudgingly) devoted family man at the same time. His character was the driving force behind the movie. I think Leah Remini is just wonderful and wish she had more opportunity to break out of the hard-nosed 'wifey' character that she has been typecast into.Not exactly a deep plot, but great slapstick, irreverent, and very funny.I'll give it 7 out of 10 stars any time. The bad reviews that I've seen on this site must be from 'stick in the mud' types, (or the stick is somewhere else) who don't know how to accept this movie on face value. Grow up, or maybe I should say, 'don't grow up', and have a little fun.Believe me, if you have half a brain, see this movie. Have enough beers to halve that brain again, and have a good time.

All the visual sight gags, wet-behind-the-ears cast, and lighthearted content must add up to an upbeat gig to work at for a few months of your life. And yet that seems to be exactly what is missing from this outing. The atmosphere feels dead. I never once felt any kind of lunatic, slapstick momentum building up. The stunts are fractured and uncoherent from the rest of the movie. Remember when Will Farrell derobes and jogs down the main drag? Why the hell was everybody at the party so quiet and devastated? To make him feel bad? I'm a university student, rest assured naked antics are always a huge hit at parties.At least Elisha Cuthbert turns in a brief role as Will Farrell's hook-up. I was a slightly unhinged follower of her documentaries for Popular Mechanics for Kids. It was mostly disturbing to see her transformed from wholesome ScienceKid to pink panties plaything.

The plot is inconsistant with horrible characters (which is upsetting, because there is some good comic talent in this flick). Will Ferrell, as funny as this man is, can't make up his mind who he is. Is he the laid back, whipped conservative newlywed, the goofball clumsy guy with a hockey stick, the drunkard, or the free spirit. Every part that could've been remotely funny were spoiled in the previews (such as what happened with There's Something About Mary) with little left to redeem itself. It's a waste of some great talent, money, and time. I didn't even remotely chuckle once the entire time watching it. For the love of all that is holy, pass on this one and go see a comedy that actually is funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another "Animal-House-type" guy comedy filled with guy humor. Does it work? For the most part. There were moments where I felt like I was forcing myself to laugh to prevent myself from feeling cheated, but there are some genuinely funny moments. Will Ferrell is almost always funny, being one of the greatest recent SNL alums. For some reason, there's something about Vince Vaughn that always cracks me up--when he does comedy, of course. In "Swingers" he steals every scene with his hilarious portrayal of Trent, and does the same in this movie. It's funny to see Jeremy Piven playing a dorky dean, playing against type, since he'd usually be cast as one of the party animals. Todd Phillips also directed "Road Trip," and though this isn't as funny as that previous effort, it works. And he was able to fit in the obligatory boob shot, during the KY wrestling scene. I actually felt like this film was too short. It should've at least ended with a final party scene, instead of fading to black leaving you with a "That's it" feeling.

Will Ferrell as Frank a mild mannered married man that hides a secret, when he drinks he becomes a wild party guy named Frank the Tank. Ferrell steals the movie just as Bluto did in Animal house 23 years ago. Luke Wilson is the boring ad guy that has his world turned over when he finds out his wife is having special adult parties. Vince Vaughn plays Bernard 'Beanie', Campbell a guy that is married with kids and longs for his college days. Beanie is a guy that comes up with crazy ideas and drags his friends with him. I think the problem with Old School is they had werent gross enough, if they had gone for the 100% over the top gross it would have been an even better movie.You're my boy, Blue</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But only because of Will Ferrell, who is an absolute riot in this comingling of ANIMAL HOUSE, PORKY'S and VAN WILDER. The plot is inconsequential, but basically it involves three guys who can't seem to, or simply won't, grow up. Vince Vaughan is OK as usual, but I never once bought his character's desire to remain an 18-year-old in a 40-year-old's body. Luke Wilson is his usual charming, offbeat self.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to wonder whom a film like Old School was meant to appeal to. I have a vision of 1978. A group of teenage males are sitting in front of the television; riddled with hysterical laughter as John Belushi yells `Food fight!' Somehow, I felt that, deep down inside, this film had the intellectual capacity to please those same reckless youths now, over thirty years after the release of Animal House. I was wrong. The smartest thing about Old School is its title (a sort of tongue-in-cheek metaphor). I think this film missed its mark entirely. It is not rebellious or ruthless, it is disorganized and pressured, a key element that has been over looked by all but a select few of Animal House clones. But I will give credit; Old School developed two traits that I did not expect to find. Its composure was wickedly brave, never once shamed to push the lines of good taste, not necessarily a positivist trait, but a respectable attempt. The other element was the handling of the material. Animal House defined a generation in comedy; Old School realized this and decided to take a different approach. Instead of trying to recreate a phase, it tired to assemble a framework in hopes of remembering such a time in the history of comedy. And even though recommendation comes with baited nerves, something appealed. Maybe I am going soft, or maybe I was just having a ruckus day, either way this film prevailed out of pure harmonious abandonment. The story to Old School is simple, but that of which binds it together is not up for discussion, due to a high level of explicit nature and distraught enthusiasm. If you wish to know what happens in this film you will have to discover it through your own perseverance. I think what Old School was trying to get at was that over grown men will never outgrow themselves. It shows that you can take a man out of his natural environment and try to shape and mould him, but deep down that suppressed child that he always was will surface with time. This is shown through three men, probably in their mid-thirties, who are all stuck in communicative potholes. Mitch is a high-class banker who walked in on his girlfriend, about to indulgence in an act of unmentionable priority. He is best friends with Bernard, a businessman who runs an outlet store named Speaker City and is so big on plans that he could talk his way in and out of almost anything. And then there is Frank, also known as Frank the Tank (ho ho) who is a grown idiot with an extremely loud means of expression and a fetish for being publicly nude. In a brief moment of despair, the trio purchase a house on a local campus and start up their own fraternity. As you can predict, all sorts of zany and predictable mayhem ensues. There is much to like about this film, especially its character alignment, never short of a motivational reasoning behind immoral actions, and also never forcing us to question the circumstances behind such a friendship, just accepting it. I liked this bond and the doubtlessness that surrounded the friendship; simple circumstances make for simple viewing. In choosing such diverse comedic actors to play said friends we get a wide array of outrageousness that delivers according to each actors approach. Will Ferrell as Frank is what you would expect, dumb, loud and funny out of his own unrealized stupidity. A scene in which Frank accidentally shoots himself with a tranquillizer gun is a prime example of this. There is also a hilarious bit about a bread maker that I will not give away. Vince Vaughn also plays Bernard as you would suspect, a fast talking, persuasive, charmer who takes matters into his own hands only to make others do his dirty work. Yet Vaughn adds a impression of sensitivity into his character, even through all his wild antics he refuses to cheat on his wife and won't allow his children to hear profanities. But the surprise comes from Luke Wilson, a great comedic actor who uses his sense of wit to describe his character instead of his actions, the trait of a natural character actor. At the same time the direction from Todd Phillips, who also directed the forgotten comedy Road Trip, is hectic and unfocused. He seems to have placed his camera in a forward position and told everyone to `go wild' after action had been yelled. Surprisingly I liked this technique. It gave the material a certain natural tinge, making it hard to imagine how any of it could have been scripted, a regard that I felt gratitude for, making it seem as if Phillips had matured since past endeavours. But never assume goodness until goodness has been received. The script, a joint venture by Phillips and Court Crandall, barely sees lift off before the ending credits veer their tragic head. Old School is in possession of little in the plot department, and a lack of plot means a lack of point. It plays like one dead pan sketch after another, and not as a flowing constituent. The story is dead in the water, never taking off or making any point of approval, something I was hoping for because the material surely suggested of it. But the story is ridiculous. I didn't buy one second of it and would not pay for its esteem. But in all fairness, my lack of interest only reflects a lack of offerings. After viewing this film I had to think, is it tangible to believe the actions of grown men are as probable as presented herein? No. Will this effect the way teenagers who find obvious sex related material funny view this film? Probably not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Old School" is a marginal attempt a campus comedy which tells of some thirty-something guys who try to start a Frat house near their alma mater...etc. The film begins with some promising fresh material but peaks early and fizzles after morphing into just more of the same old stuff as it grinds to its conclusion. The human story of alumni camaraderie and love/like relationships don't work on any level, the casting is questionable save the principal players, and the screen play lacks continuity and doesn't build. Taken as a whole, the film is passable stuff which will play best with couch potatoes in need of some mindless humor which doesn't get too gross. (C+)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old school, like most modern American college movies, is nothing new. The idea of 3 older men moving onto campus is original but the jokes are pretty similar to what we have all seen before. However that does not mean its not funny, because it is a major laugh out loud film that will have you sniggering away like a 6 year old that just heard the word "sex". The humour is daft, characters like 'Frank the Tank' are silly but hilarious. What makes the film just that little bit different is the perspective of the older man re-living his youth in such a blunt and brash way. Its definitely worth a look for a bit of mindless comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of setup...but no punchlines!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself to have an off-beat, wacky sense of humour - being a big fan of such films as "Kingpin", "Happy Gilmore" - and my pick for funniest film ever...Adam Sandler's "Billy Madison"."Old School" just wasn't funny. I fidgeted a lot in this film. I looked at my watch a lot. I felt embarrassed to have recommended we see this to my friends who accompanied me. I felt confused when the audience laughed at an old man dropping dead in a pool of jelly. I felt confused when the audience laughed at a man shooting himself in the neck with a dart gun and falling into a swimming pool.Every scene in this film had a reasonable "comic" build-up. But every scene failed to deliver any sort of punchline. Vince Vaughn still had that "Swingers" spark, but the script just gave him nowhere to go. He would have been funnier if he'd been left to ad-lib! Being from the UK, I wasn't familiar with Will Farrell, but I found him annoying and rude, rather than wacky or funny.Avoid this at all costs...I guarantee whatever you do instead will be a better use of your 90 minutes than this unfunny lame rubbish. If you're after a good wacky comedy, go rent "Billy Madison" (which features a similar but far funnier climax) or "Kingpin" with Woody Harrelson.p.s. only thing that was good was Snoop Dog's cameo performing a cover version of Eric B and Rakim's classic 80s rap "Paid in Full" - unfortunately the cameo was far too short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film by accident; I went to the cinema to see 'Johnny English,' and due to some muck-up, it turned out that I got to see this film instead. I wasn't overly enthusiastic at first; it looked to be the typical american slap-stick/bottom-humour comedy which is so typical of hollywood - completely moronic and unappealling. However, as the film progressed, there were some genuinely clever situations and gags, though admittedly the plot was awful. Not bad at all, worth a watch at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top Notch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old School is the typical comedy film that has become popular in contemporary films today. The film describes the basic college frat life of getting drunk and performing radical things that older individuals would completely look down upon doing. The difference in this film though is that the individuals that are performing these stunts are the older individuals who are labeled as the working class. The film starts off with an individual who just found his girlfriend cheating on him after a long-term relationship together. He goes into this little mental break down of sorrow. After moving into a college neighborhood, his friends decide that the way to cheer him up is by turning his house into a fraternity. Most of the fraternity pledges are actual college students, but there are a number of them that aren't and even one of them, Blue is about 80 years old. Being a comedy film, there is the typical snob in the film who is out to destroy the fun others are having and in this case it is the dean of housing who just happened to know the individuals starting the frat and who they picked on back when they were in school. Basically the audience can tell from the beginning of the film that the dean will create problems for these partiers and stop at nothing to get their frat shut down. We see this when the dean actually blackmails the housing president so that she vote against allowing the fraternity. This also becomes apparent when the fraternity has to go through a performance evaluation before being allowed to sustain their fraternity and the dean is administering this. They all believed that they passed, but the dean failed them because one of failed all the tests, Blue. Blue was dead though so his score wasn't suppose to count, but it goes to show how the dean was being manipulative again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. What an utter mess that seems to only fit in with the dumbest genre the cinema has ever produced, the dreaded teen flick. Even though this is a terrible film that has no business existing, it is still a little better than most others of the type and does present itself as a ridiculous time-passer for anyone who is really (and I mean really) bored with work or life in general. Three men (Luke Wilson, Will Farrell and Vince Vaughn) take it upon themselves to start a fraternity near a university that does nothing except offer men (ages and races varying) the chance to have fun with wild parties, loose women and no rules. Vaughn is the catalyst after Wilson dumps ditsy live-in girlfriend Juliette Lewis and Farrell marries the woman he thinks he wants, something he should have never done. Soon the typical insanity takes place with crusty school officials (Jeremy Piven and Harve Presnell, the latter of "Fargo" fame) trying to close the frat boys down at any cost. There is the would-be romantic side-story (with the boring Ellen Pompeo as Wilson's love interest), the crazed sexual innuendos and situations and the cameos abound in every direction (Snoop Dogg and Craig Kilborn being the most recognizable). In the end, "Old School" is another one of those films that is funny because it is so bad and not because of its waning attempts at comedy. Anyone who ever attended college (and I mean really worked to receive their education) will wonder why couldn't their education have been like this. Here's an idea: show how people in a stupid teen film are doing 10 years later. I am sure their lives are not near as funny or humorous the second time around. In short, do yourself a favor and read a book rather than watch a waste like "Old School". 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much like the tradition of the raunchy flicks of the 80s, Old School encompasses the age old tradition of tactless and tasteless film creation. Buy the oddity of the situation, this is one of those films I can tolerate. Mid-life malaise couldn't have been drawn better in the lives of Mitch, Frank and Beanie. Men who serve no purpose in society, especially to their significant others. But that's the significance of the frat house. No, it isn't about being drunk and hitting on 19-year-old girls, its about reaffirming your role in society and making the inner soul feel good and relaxed. So, say what you want about the random nudity and cussing, this film is a life affirming film for all men hitting their 30s.</fullReview>

I just didn't think Vince Vaughn had enough material to work with. What REALLY ticked me off was the FLUFFY love story between Mitch and Nicole. Sometimes, as much as I hate to admit it, I become annoyed at LUKE WILSON'S VOICE!! However, there were good scenes in this. The streaking scene was funny with Farrel. Also, the scene where Will Farrel tries to get Snoop Dogg to streak was funny. It's a good flick, just not worth the 8 dollars I spent on it.</fullReview>

It was a elam (you can unscramble the letters - and no, it isn't male or meal) attempt at a carbon copy of the classic Animal House.The amazing thing to me is just how subjective comedy is. I like situation comedy like Married With Children, but I don't like slapstick - too simplistic - and a lot of this movie was just that. The pie in the face idea is so old and worn out. I guess I just want to be surprised by intelligent wit and humor rather than just bombarded with physical gags.Not surprisingly, IMBD shows the older you are, the less likely you are to rate this movie highly. What is surprising to me is that the group that I watched this movie with was largely 30-50 years old and they seemed to laugh their asses off. I just don't get it. All I can say is that I didn't think it was funny. Caveat Emptor</fullReview>

Very funny stuff.Wilson does a good job as basically a character like himself. Though the whole subplot with the boss' daughter is iffy, it's still amusing.Nudity...always good in a college flick such as this.

		<shortDescription>Silly &amp; Mindless Yet Tasteful and Entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was bored after work and decided to see whether anything in this movie was funny. It's not a great movie, but it does have its moments and in some respects it surprised me.My expectations were low. I had expected this to be another comedy with too many bathroom jokes. At this point, I can't recall a single mindless bathroom joke. Mind you there is a "streaking" scene, which I thought was very funny. I believe it's in the trailer for this movie.I still can't figure out why this was rated "R".. There was one very quick, gratuitous breast scene which probably got this movie the "R" rating. However, it's as if that scene were thrown into the movie just to ensure it did get a "R" rating. There are no "sex" scenes, no violence and little bad language. I wouldn't be bothered if my 12 year old daughter saw this movie.Now the premise of the movie is very unrealistic.. older friends ban together to create a new fraternity on campus.. a fraternity with students and non-students, with younger and older men.Maybe the best part of this movie is that it's only 1.5 hours. After seeing "God and Generals".. (almost 4 hours) it was nice to go to a movie edited into a 1.5 hour format, a movie that deals up mindless entertainment in a silly, but tasteful way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're expecting something original and ground breaking from this movie, save your money. I didn't care much for Luke Wilson or Jeremy Piven, but Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn saved this one, along with some smaller (and surprising) names that popped up (Andy Dick, Craig Kilborn). Not ALL of the small roles were as funny as they could have been (Sean William Scott, who only generates laughs due to his haircut) I don't want to seem too down on the movie, because I DID enjoy it. Maybe not a film for everyone, and a bit predictable, but it's a comedy! To me, the laughs are more important than the story, so don't be too picky about it, and try to have fun when you watch it. To me, this falls into the "rental" category. Worth seeing, but don't spend an arm and a leg to see it at the theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had to re review this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was in a bad mood. Before I once wrote "This film is the same old same old with some funny scenes. This film will not age well, and become forgotten like most of this party type films." Boy, was I wrong Old School ages well and is a time honoured classic. Well written, directed, with the perfect cast. All the actors became stars in the own films. Everyone was at the right age to make this film. I am happy they never made an Old School 2! This film is so great I repeat lines from it. "Going to the home depot" is one I use all the time. If I am asked what I am doing over the weekend. I give Old School a ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy @#$% this movie is so hilarious!!! I just saw it in the theater and the whole audience was cracking up the whole time. Everybody was clapping at the end the same way they did after Lord Of The Rings or any Star Wars movie... that doesn't happen often after comedies. I didn't expect it to be half as good as it was, many of the recent comedy flicks on the big screen have been let downs but this movie is just so damn funny all the way through. Will Farrel is shameless! I can't wait for it to come out on dvd!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OLD SCHOOL (2003) *** 1/2 Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Ellen Pompeo, Juliette Lewis, Leah Remini, Craig Kilborn, Elisha Cuthbert, Jeremy Piven, Andy Dick, Seann William Scott, Patrick Cranshaw, Artie Lange, (Cameo: Snoop Dogg). Raucously funny outrageous comedy about a trio of close buddies who decide to start a just-for-the-hell-of-it fraternity to shake up their post-collegiate life of trappings they didn't anticipate. Wilson's perpetually furrowed confusion makes a good straight man as well as Vaughn getting in touch with his inner Bill Murray/Bud Abbott semi-straight man but it's Ferrell's real showcase of his outlandish comedy as the party hardy recently married doofus just wanting to recapture his glory days (by any means necessary). Director Todd Phillips (who co-wrote the frequently hysterical screenplay by Court Crandall and Scot Armstrong) owes his debt to obvious guy comedies like precursors `National Lampoon's Animal House' and `Stripes' but maintains the cutting-edge gross-out appeal that thrives today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the chance to see the movie last night. I expected it to be full of "non-stop" laughs and to be quite hilarious. It turned out, however, that the movie has a few good moments, but otherwise it is not really funny. In fact, towards the end it gets pretty dull and cheesy. Go see it and decide for yourself. Will Farrow does a hell of a job, and he is the only one really funny actor in the whole movie. Overall, the whole thing is VERY overrated. Animal House is much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old School: 3/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Haven't we seen this all before? Old School, from the director of Road Trip, is basically Animal House for the new generation. Except for the fact that Old School is very rarely funny, and is basically just stupid, with idiotic sex jokes thrown in.The plot is nothing, there's no reason to throw it in. Mitch (Luke Wilson) just broke up with his girlfriend, so he starts an off-campus fraternity. It's a throwaway plot, just like the rest of the movie. There is not one redeeming quality of this picture. If it was a mindless comedy that was FUNNY, I might be able to give it some slack. But a mindless motion picture comedy that isn't funny, I just feel sorry for. The whole theater was cracking up. I was about the only one with a stone face.This type of broad comedy I can usually handle, but I couldn't when watching Old School. It has basically zero laughs and minor characters that we don't know about! It's a mean-spirited fest that is just horrible. The supporting characters, such as the people in the fraternity, have zero depth and nothing that makes us care about them. Plus, there were some fat jokes I didn't think were funny. If you think that people with a cinder block tied around their genetalia is funny, you should see Old School. Everyone else, if you are dragged, at least you can witness a humorous (not funny, humorous) parody of The Graduate.Wilson, who, along with his brother Owen, I like a lot, was OK, but it isn't his fault that he got stuck with such a stupid movie. I'm not really sure how many times I can reiterate that this movie was horrible. I think I've said enough, but I'll leave you with one last thought: IT'S HORRIBLE!My rating: 3/10Rated R for some strong sexual content, nudity and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old School promises viewers all the fun of college and none of the education. Thanks in large part to Will Ferrell, that's exactly what they get: nonstop laughter and many memorable moments. As mid-life crisis hits them, Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank (Will Ferrell), and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) try to put their troubles behind them and recapture their college days by starting an all-ages fraternity. Wilson's character is questionable, and yet funny in an awkward way. In the group he works very well, but alone he is uninteresting. However, Will Ferrell is a comic genius and propels the movie into greatness. Old School may not have an involving story or a lesson to teach, but it succeeds on almost every level as a free-for-all comedy. Although many people said this was really funny, I didn't quite feel that way. IMO, it could have been much funnier (maybe its because there were some deleted scenes when I watched it on TV), but altogether Old School is a great movie...Go cheCk it out! 7 out of 10</fullReview>

I laughed once but never again. Will Ferrell, who is usually pretty funny (check him out in Jay and Silent Bob), tries way too hard to be funny here. I admire the effort but it didnt end up to much. Luke Wilson is uninteresting here. Vince Vaughn isn't funny either. The movie has bad and unfunny jokes that plagued Anger Management. This movie could have been funny but in the end it wasn't. Old School is something that is truly forgettable, maybe not as bad as Anger Management but damn bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly, disapointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I want to say that even though I appreciate all forms of cinema, I have always had a soft spot for comedies. Some are good movies AND are hysterical, like Office Space for instance. Some are lame but genuinely funny because they are silly, and still are fun because if we can lighten up, we can laugh our butts off. And some are just completely lame, make no sense and have few if any redeeming qualities. Old School, to my greatest disapointment, falls smack dab into the LAME category.Now, I'm a college student, and to further my 'credibility', I love the silliest of movies like Deuce Bigalow, Van Wilder, Kingpin, Porky's...etc, b\c to me, though I can acknowledge that they aren't 'oscar caliber' that isn't what I watched them for...I watched them to laugh, and when I want to laugh at a good movie, I am usually laid back enough to enjoy them, and appreciate the comedy, no matter how sick/juvenile, and enjoy being in stitches. The comedies I find good all have redeeming qualities and are hilarious in their own right...but when I really think about it, most of them also had 'purposes' too. What I mean by that is, though they are not why we are watching them, the fact that they have plots, and have some type of moral or triumph in the end makes them not only worthwhile, but also satisfying. If they didn't have them, then all I'd need is to watch a movie that was nothing but scene after scene of sketch comedy for the same effect.Old School looked so funny from the trailers, plus it has Will Ferrell in it...streaking! That right there sold me, I think he is one of the funniest guys out there right now, and since I love movies with the Animal House spirit, I decided to give this one a shot. I can't believe how disapointed I was towards the end.I will say that there are about 3 or 4 good laughs, mainly around the beginning, 1 of which had me rolling on the floor, and maybe a couple more chuckles here and there...but I was shocked at how boring this film was in between. Not that plot really matters that much in a movie like this, but this film didn't have one, and it's attempt at one was not convincing nor did it make any sense. So these guys create a frat for any age with no school, but all of the parties...great idea. But, for a movie about partying and whatnot, after the 'Mitchapalooza' that went on during the first 20 min, there was a severe lack of 'partyage' going on. Sure, we see a scene here and there of partying, mischief or hazing of pledges, but unlike Animal House, Van Wilder, or even American Pie, there is absolutely no feeling of camaraderie shown between the cast, nor does the script allow us to really feel for the characters or their situation. We see all of these random supporting actors who play pledges to the fraternity, but not one of them is developed so we frankly don't care about anyone. I'm being completely honest here, I wanted to laugh when I saw this one...I ended up trying so hard to chuckle at the slightest things...but the last half of the movie seriously DRAGS. Me, and everyone I saw it with agreed, even the person who spent the money to rent it, who was more excited to see it than anyone else fell asleep during it. And this comes as a shock too, I usually love movies like these...I think this is the first time I have ever ripped on a college movie, but I just can't help it with this one...it is way too lame for its own good. The actors have no chemistry together, and utterly go nowhere with the script. It also has way too many sappy subplots that seriously get in the way of the comedy, and in the end, amount to nothing, because like I said, Vaughn, nor Ferrell, nor Wilson, though all great actors/comedians, really did not do anything on the screen to evoke any empathy for the audience. Now, I loved Will Ferrell's scenes where he is 'Frank the Tank', chasing down beer bongs and screaming his head off at pledges, but after a while, those scenes got old, especially after seeing that this was the best the movie could come up with.Anyways, this is waaayyyy too long of an analysis over a movie like this, so I will sum it all up like this. This movie had so much potential, and because of that, it makes everything negative about it suck even more. Sure, there are a few pretty funny parts here and there, and they will make you laugh out loud, but they are so few and far between that I cannot give this movie any type of good review. This is, to the record, the first college movie that I have seen, even with the aid of about 10 beers, that instead of finding as another comic gem, I found it to be...rather...boring. I'm not talking mandatory sappy plot segments that are needed to make a 'plot' for this type of movie, I'm talking joke after joke that doesn't work, promising setups with punchlines that fail to deliver, and of course, periods of total, complete boredom...in 10 minute intervals at least, where absolutely nothing funny happens. But then again, before I had seen it, I had heard of friends say that their friends loved this movie, so I guess to each their own. I give it 4/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Some movie ideas spring naturally, either from the tides of society, an already successful project elsewhere or the talents of one or more of the players. But some are clearly engineered, a result of some roomful of analysts who have identified a need. A product is devised to fit.In this case, we have marketing data that shows that a significant number of older men go to `teen' sex/grossout films apparently because of the fantasy of reliving those days in a better way: sexually carefree and without responsibilities. So here we have old guys literally moving into a teen movie. One guy gets to sleep with a classic, 16 year old pulchritude pie, but it is okay (we are told) because he really didn't know and his girlfriend is a slut anyway. One guy gets to dump his new wife, but that's okay because they weren't meant to be (he being carefree and all). But (here is the voice of the product engineers) the most cynical is the one that stays with his wife and kids in spite of clear, penalty-free opportunity.No mistaking: this is for the "Men's Health" crowd, 40-50 year olds who wish they were 20. Note the name; note the really old guy who brackets the viewer demographic.The situation is what sells (underscored by the REALLY old guy) not the specifics. In fact the specifics, by design, are supposed to be as calorie-free as your average teen movie. The only interesting adventure here is to note which of the three you find most funny and wonder why.Vince Vaughn plays the ironic cynic, not fully committed to his cynicism; Wilson plays the cleverly ironic actor sometimes indicating a character; Ferrell plays it straight, Jerry Lewis goofy style. In my case, the anchor of the film is Vaughn, and his bits are what made me laugh, even when Ferrell was doing the moving.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this film expecting mindless entertainment and a fun evening out and ended up walking out after an hour...and I'm surprised I lasted that long. This bomb of a movie will haunt the actors for as long as the stink remains in the air. What were you thinking, Dreamworks, when you took responsibility for this piece of garbage?I was very open to this film as the reviews I read said it was sophomoric but had funny moments. But they must have been screening another film for these reviewers because there was absolutely nothing original or clever in this film. It was like every terrible movie about excess drinking and sex in college only featuring older actors who should know better. Same cliches about beer and partying, same female roles (stupid sex kittens in wet t-shirts, shrill wives, or virtuous girls out of reach), same moronic men who are afraid of growing up. My only question was where was David Spade, Rob Schneider, and Adam Sandler? They seem to specialize in this "boys will be boys", no laughs, Hooters, type of movie and they would have felt right at home in this stinkbomb.</fullReview>

The fraternity concept was good but it had to be the framework of the script, and it should have been a lot more developed. The movie turns out to be muddled and the script goes in every direction, lacking an axis (the fraternity).The gags are for the most part insignificant though a few ones manage to crack you a smile.As for the characters, they are also under developed and the alchemy doesn't emerge at all. When you hire an actor with a tremendous comical potential like Will Ferrel, you have to use him ! His role was too discreet when it seemed obvious he even could have been the main character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching a short TV-spot for this film, I though that this film looked really funny. A year later, I felt like I was in the right mood to watch this film, that's why I felt like renting it. Boy oh boy, after watching that film, I felt like I made a pretty bad mistake.What OLD SCHOOL is about is that it's about three guys named Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank (Will Ferell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) who are now living their normal adult lives decide to re-live college days by forming a fraternity filled with various people including friends, college students, lowlifes, middle-aged men and old retirees. However, Dean (Jeremy Piven) holds a strong personal grudge against Mitch, Frank and Beanie and their fraternity that they had created.OLD SCHOOL could've been a rather funny and enjoyable film with a fine casting about a group of adults forming a fraternity, especially if it's got Will Ferrel in it, but unfortunately, it failed. I could've given it no stars at all, but since it had at least two good jokes (the rest of the jokes were extremely juvenile and unfunny), I thought I'd be generous and give it two stars out of ten.To sum this review up, don't watch this garbage!</fullReview>

My friends ranted and raved about how amazing it was, so they rented it for me to see...I don't like to rip apart movies but I'm about to right now. This had to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. It may be because I'm not big on comedy movies or maybe its because it wasn't funny. I do not get to this day why people think will Farrell is funny. When I tell people I didn't like Old School they look at me in shock and ask "YOU Don't THINK A MAN RUNNING NAKED DOWN THE ROAD IS FUNNY??!?!" No.I didn't think it was funny either when Farrell got half naked in Talladega Nights or Blades of Glory either. This movie had a dull plot and lame warped comedy, plain and simple. Why does Farrell have to yell all the time? cant he be funny without screaming? I didn't give this movie a low ranking because everyone else loves it, i just thought it was awful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some things you just can't recreate, no matter how hard you try. Woodstock, for instance. In this case, it's "Animal House". They can rip off (or pay homage to) the original all they want, but they just can't recapture the spirit. Animal House worked because it was fresh and new, but this movie, made 25 years (and countless other college/party animal movies) later, just reeks of staleness and recycled ideas. In addition to swiping the central plot from "Animal House" (uptight Dean resorts to dirty tricks to drive wild fraternity off campus), it also borrows shamelessly from "Revenge of the Nerds", "Back to School", and a ton of other movies, such that there's barely a single scene that isn't borrowed in some form from an earlier movie. Take, for example, Will Ferrell shooting himself with a tranquilizer dart, which is similar to a scene where he is shot in the butt with a tranquilizer by a monkey in "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back". It was, to put it bluntly, a lot funnier the first time around. And that applies to pretty much the entire movie. Most of it isn't very funny, and even the parts that are were funnier before, elsewhere.3/10</fullReview>

Vince Vaughn (coolest actor of the new generation) carries this film with great help from will Ferrell and a so-so lead from Luke Wilson. Elisha Cuthbert's small role oozes the sexuality that she awesomely possesses (marry me please), a sexuality that made her pretty outstanding in The Girl Next Door.This film is heavily quotable (especially Vaughn's character) and appeals to both sexes, if your looking for a Saturday night riot of a movie, with awesome belly laughs, look no further than Old School. 9/10</fullReview>

Ill admit that I wanted to see this movie because it looked funny initially, and I really wanted to like it, but the jokes were just not funny. The writers tried so hard to make the audience laugh, but they failed miserably. Will Farrel showed an utter lack of talent by embarrassing himself in front of national audiences.

		<fullReview>"Old School" is as funny as it is an homage to "Animal House." It is about three guys who try to relive their college glory days by starting a college fraternity off-campus, where anyone who likes to party can join. But to understand why this happens, you must understand the stick-skinny plot.Luke Wilson plays Mitch, a lawyer who wanders home from a seminar one night to find his wife with two naked strangers. After his divorce, Mitch moves into a house near a college campus...only to find out that the house is to be repossessed by the college unless it is turned into a fraternity. So Mitch and his two friends, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank "The Tank" (Will Ferrell, the funniest guy in the film), start a fraternity, where their initiation is a method of trust. Those interested in joining the fraternity must drop a cement block (which is tied to a..."sensitive area") from a twenty foot drop, hoping the line doesn't pick up any slack. One of the most hilarious segments is this scene, which had me on the floor in laughter.But trouble ensues when Frank's favorite fraternity member, "Blue," an eighty-nine-year-old-man, dies in the house, causing everyone in school to be booted from college and causing Mitch to lose his house. Unless they can prove to the college board that they have a meaningful existence as a fraternity. "Old School" is at its best when it is cruel. "Old School" is the "Animal House" for today's generation. It comes as no surprise that its creators also made the rude, crude film "Road Trip," a film I have yet to see but hear isn't all that great. To tell you the truth, "Old School" isn't great, either, but it has a cruel streak running through it that is hilarious. It's like a person not afraid to speak their mind. It had me in tears, and at other times, glancing at my watch.For example, take the scene where a fat college-goer drops a cement block from his sensitive area to join the college, only to have it fall through a pot-hole and suck him through. Or when the same guy has to do gymnastics to demonstrate athleticism to the college board. Or when Frank gets shot by a tranquilizer dart at a birthday party, and falls into the pool and wrecks the little boy's party. Or the running gag about a kitchen device Mitch bought Frank for his wedding (Frank tries to give it away numerous times, including to Mitch and the boy at the birthday party). Or when Frank dresses up as a mascot and tries to jump through a hoop of fire. Or the second-best scene in the movie, when Frank is at a party and is asked to drink from a beer bong. "No, I promised my wife I wouldn't drink. I have a big day tomorrow." He goes on to explain that his big day consists of going to home supply stores. "Maybe Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. I don't know. We may not have enough time." After being pressured to drink, he finally gives in, and goes completely wild; he ends up stripping down and streaking across town, until his wife and her band of friends find him on the street at night, yelling and hollering, completely naked. Will Ferrell is the screen-stealer here. I've liked him since I saw him on "Saturday Night Live" years ago. He recently left the show to start a film career. "Old School" marks his first film away from "SNL." It is also his funniest. I like the way he talks. I remember a gag on "SNL" where Will played an NBC executive greenlighting a new television show called "...And a Pizza Place." He said, "I see tables. Some cheese. Some pizza. I don't know, I'm not a writer." He sounds exactly the same when he says, "Maybe Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. I don't know. We might not have enough time."This could be the sign of an actor with a promising career, or an actor who people will soon find repetitive in his roles and expressions. I sure hope not, because though he sounds exactly the same as other characters on occasion, it's just his personality, just like Bill Murray was such a smart-aleck and Chevy Chase smacked his face on the floor all the time. Although, those actors lost their careers pretty much recently, so I wish Ferrell the best of luck, because he is one uproarious guy.In conclusion, "Old School" is a funny movie with some funny scenes, some of which are extremely hilarious. But the problem is the long stretches in between. It's got the formula. It's got the actors. It's got the cameos (Craig Kilborn, Sean William Scott), but it just fails to be consistently hilarious. I still had a fun time watching it, though, and I like these kinds of comedies once and a while. The kind that don't promise anything in particular, but give a whole lot back, whether in terms of laughter, or just ninety minutes of a big fat smile on your face. The script doesn't have to be too witty for me as long as I'm having fun, and I had a fun time watching this movie. I just hope that the sequel(s) manages to make the audience laugh on a consistent basis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the crappiest comedies I´ve ever seen.. the characters are one dimensional and don´t make sense at all.. That can be a good thing if it´s done well.. but in this case it just makes you wanna kill your self :DIt starts out very good with kinda bizarre dialoges and embarrassing situations.. and it cracked me up a few times.. but than it takes a strange turn and starts to look more and more like some empty B-movie from the early 80´s.. Avoid this one people.. this is for those with an IQ of 50/ Martin</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the exception of perhaps two or three lines at the beginning, this was the worst movie I've ever seen. No contest. I was literally angry when I left the theatre, angry that I'd wasted my evening seeing it. I could've stayed home and clipped my toenails and felt more productive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a Will Ferrell fan I had to watch this movie, but sadly it turned out to be extremely weak on many fronts.Acting from the lead characters was the sole exception.On the whole the story and comedy routines were flat out boring, and for a movie hinging on comic appeal this was far too slow for any positive momentum buildup. Of the actors Vince Vaughn I think stole the show with some creative, smooth talking of his lines that blended quite well with his character. Luke Wilson was the one weakness this movie had in its actors and they should have looked elsewhere to another actor for this role. Overall a watchable film but nothing really to write home about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucked so bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think a couple of stoned guys got together and decided to film a movie with no plot and no humor. Will Ferrell, who is usually so funny, was completely wasted with stupid pet tricks. Luke Wilson was ok, but his character didn't make sense. Vince Vaughn was the only one who was remotely funny. The only thing that was truly great in the movie was the shot of Elisha Cuthbert's rear end when she was lying on the bed. Other than that I feel robbed of valuable time that I could have spent filling ice trays or organizing my sock drawer. Anything would have been more enjoyable than sitting through this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that funny and Will Ferrell was annoying .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie , and I 've heard many good things about it ,and many things like "this is one of the funniest movies ever made " .But I don't agree . Actually it was pretty annoying and dull .The story isn't very relevant ,it is just a bad clone of "Animal House " Of John Landis . Many of the scenes don't have any relationship with the plot ,and all are just to show the stupidity of the characters . For example , when Will Ferrell removes all his clothes in the party when he is drunk , and many other similar things .And like many other movies of the same genre ,it is very sexist ,and the way how it portrait the women it is just repulsive . Now you can say "it is just a movie " , but there are some jokes that probably would offend some women .This one is pretty over-rated .Seriouslly ,it wasn't that good .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was no good. Forgive me for saying it, but it really wasn't even funny. Here's why.The story is that of Mitch, a man with problems, his wife left him, he needs to get his life on track, and thus moves on with the help of two friends. The three start a social club in a college where Mitch lives nearby. With the group thus assembled, all sorts of men join hoping to have a good time. Needless to say, it leads to trouble.Simply put, this film is built upon a weak and feeble plot, used solely to employ naked women, inappropriate toilet humor, and a multitude of smoking and drinking jokes. If the truth be told, the film has occasional funny moments, but funny though they are, they do the film no justice. -1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unexplored like a first draft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although promising, 'Old School' completely fails as a decent comedy. The stars Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn have what it takes for such comedy and Todd Phillips has created the hysterical 'Road Trip', so the ingredients seem right.But the ideas are incoherent, the situations are badly set up and the jokes are simply not funny enough.I truly believe that the general idea of 'Old School' could become a hilarious movie if the right paths were explored. The script as it is now definitely feels like a first draft.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Will Ferrell on SNL and he was good at the beginning and in some sketches towards the end. But, his movie career sucks. I basically rent this crap movie just to see the hot women who were in it, but even that didn't save this film. Basically I am have nothing to add that others who panned this movie didn't except that your not missing much if you didn't see it. Same goes with anything with Will is in and he seems to be doing like 8 films a year. If Adam Sandler was the worst actor out of SNL in the 90s, well Will has taken over where he left off. At Least some Adam material has been watchable in recent years. But Will and the rest of the buffoons in this movie just get worse and worse see Wedding Crashers, Talledaga Nights, The Girl Next Door, and The Break Up. I basically just rent bad films like American Wedding and this one to see the hot women. Also this movie like oh about 50 that have come out since 1994 ripoff 70s and 80s films. This one stole things from Swingers, Stripes, Animal House, Gotcha, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually like bad movies because they're funny...and the worst they are the funnier they are. Exept in this case, the movie doesn't take off. It's one dull scene after the other. It took me twice to watch the whole thing. The second time around, I though I'm rested and I'll be able to give it a fair chance...no it didn't do it...got worst actually. Well there's one good scene, it's when the girls take off ... and shows ....unfortunatly it last only one minute. Overall.... save your money and rent something else... there are decent flics out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Potentially funny premise badly handled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of middle aged men trying to relive their youth by starting their own fraternity does have promise, even though it isn't really that far removed from the raunchy college campus comedy genre (which, face it, has been pretty much been beaten to death.)However, the movie very badly handles the idea. To begin with, you would think that the movie would put most of its focus on (1) the members of the fraternity, both the major and supporting players, and (2) the various antics the fraternity does. Unbelievably, the movie actually doesn't go that route. For one thing, we don't get to see much of what this fraternity does. Sure, we occasionally see parties etc., but that IT. If we had seen all this motley crew doing other things, such as actually stepping out of the frat house, this could have lead to some really funny things. Especially since they have a wide range of characters - an old guy, a fat guy, a foreigner, etc. These characters get little to NOTHING to do.Most of the movie actually just focuses on the three characters OUTSIDE the fraternity - in their boring jobs, their rotten love lives, etc., scenes that for the most part have little chance of making us laugh. Why focus on these things?While watching the movie, I wondered if maybe that the original cut of the movie had more of the material I was thinking of. It certainly FELT cut - not just for seemingly missing this material, but how certain subplots (threatening dean, potential love interest for the hero, etc.) were barely touched on and resolved extremely quickly for the most part. However, looking at the outtakes on the DVD, I found the cut sequences had none of what felt missing, proving that the movie was badly planned from the very start. Oh, there are some laughs, sometimes big ones. But generally "Old School" is a sloppy jumble that inspires more a feeling of impatience than anything else.</fullReview>
