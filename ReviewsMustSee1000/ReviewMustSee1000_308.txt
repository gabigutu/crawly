		<shortDescription>Analyze This, That, and the Other Thing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Analyze That" is proof the critics can be wrong. Which probably means you shouldn't be listening to me, either. But you are, oh well. I guess I'll have to review the movie, now.The Boss and The Shrink are back in therapy: Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) has been locked up in Sing-Sing for 850 days. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) has just lost his father. That's when he gets the call from Vitti. Vitti gives him the low-down: Someone is trying to kill Vitti in jail. Sobel hangs up, Vitti gets mad, so he fakes crazy, and Sobel gets called in (since he is Vitti's psychiatrist). Sobel believes Vitti is cuckoo in the slammer, as he sees him singing tunes from "West Side Story" (one of the funniest parts in the film). So Vitti is released into the custody of Ben Sobel. But on the ride to Sobel's house, Vitti snaps out of it, only to reveal that he is not crazy, but, in fact, quite well. Now Vitti must start a new life and get a real job - that involves working "from 9 to 5!" - and find out who is trying to kill him...and why.Perhaps I am mistaken, but "Analyze That" is funnier than "Analyze This." Maybe it's just me, but I found it quite funny. I didn't think it was a "rip-off" sequel, there for "no artistic reason." Sure, it's a sequel. Of course it's not going to be an Oscar-winner for originality; I don't ask for that in a comedy. Honestly, can you think of any sequel (other than the rare "Godfather Part II" film) that is as good as the original in terms of reasons for being there? All I know is that I think "Analyze That" had some very funny moments. Take, for instance, the scenes where Vitti is trying to get a new job. He becomes a car salesman for a day, and leads around a couple, showing them a nice car. "Look at that trunk - you could fit three bodies in there!" he says. When they say they're going to think about it: "What's there to think about? You've been busting my b@lls for the last hour over this thing, asking me all these stupid questions, taking it for a test drive...so why don't you buy it?"Scenes like these are hilarious. And while there are somewhat long sequences without any laughs, the laugh-out-loud scenes more than make up for those lacking.The only thing about this film that makes me drop the rating a notch is the execution of the last half hour. Just like the first movie, they set up a ridiculous "action" ending, that isn't action at all. Its ending is overlong and goes way too long without any laughs.But that is the only thing I didn't like about the movie. De Niro and Crystal have a real chemistry, even more so here than in the first film. De Niro steals the scenes he is in, and Crystal steals the scenes he is in, and when they are both on screen, you're not sure who to look at.I find Robert De Niro's latest journeys into comedy quite funny. He made a few comedies here and there in the past, but in the last three years he's coughed out some funny movies. "Analyze This," "Meet the Parents," "Analyze That," and to a certain degree (it was okay), "Showtime."Perhaps I am confused. Maybe I need to see the first again. But having seen the original about twice, and "Analyze That" once, I can honestly say that I laughed more in "Analyze That" than I did watching "Analyze This." And if that's not a good sequel, I don't know what is.Here's to "Analyze This, That, and the Other Thing"!3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the revues said this was just o.k. but I have to tell you different. This film had me in stitches from the start. I am amazed how Robert DeNiro can be so strong in serious roles and yet he does comedy as good as any one. People like Robin Williams are trying to cross over to serious roles as is Jim Carrey and this guy makes it look like anybody could do it. Unreal !! Two thumbs way up for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humor, action and a half-hearted attempt at depth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analyze This had an element of novelty and a generous dose of humor. Lacking the novelty due to its sequelhood, Analyze That tries to compensate by making forays into the psyche of Dr. Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal) as well as a little more (very little) analysis of mobster Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro). The psychology angle is not given much time or emphasis, but I suppose director Harold Ramis should get a couple of points for making a token effort.The film is pretty funny and worth seeing, but doesn't really offer us anything new. This is forgivable, though, because Crystal and De Niro are entertaining enough to carry the picture. Overall, I'd recommend it -- it's funny and watchable and the two leads are very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't laughing as much as I did in the first movie. But there are some pretty funny scenes in "Analyze That". I think I am in love with Robert DeNiro. It's official. :D Just kidding. He's just so funny in the movie. Once again he steals the show. Especially with him singing songs from "West Side Story". The plot isn't as interesting as the fist movie of course, but they keep up with the same goofs. Over all, it's a good film. But don't expect another "Analyze This". It's not as funny. But it's good for a couple laughs.And since I am so in love with Robert, I'm going to be nice.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another sequel on the market, another disappointment. It is not something totally new, but the fact that De Niro keeps playing in such movies is quite sad. I don't think he is really made for comedies, and if he is, then for no more than one. His type of character is quite clear and I wonder now how another sequel, to a good comedy, "Meet the Fockers" will be like. I sincerely doubt it will be good. SpoilersThe story is quite predictable...There is De Niro, a mobster (the one we know from the first film- Paul Vitti) who has to spend some time behind bars...but it so happens that he escapes with the help of his doctor, Ben Sobol( Billy Cristal), and exactly as in the first movie he gives him a very hard time. And so the story starts...The movie hasn't got an interesting plot, but it should've had many funny moments. Unfortunately these were quite missing, not totally, but I didn't laugh as much as I should've. The humor is dry, and not funny. The only question really was, how much they could squeeze out of all the mafia parodies. The answer: not much. The actors lost their charm too, and neither De Niro, nor' Crystal gave the movie an exciting tempo. It was slow, despite lasting around one hour and a half, and the rest of the characters where poorly modeled on the screen. There were much to few interesting moments in this film.If you want to see a good parody about the mafia, I would recommend "Mickey Blue Eyes", which I personally enjoyed very much! Or you could watch the first part to this sequel if you haven't seen it, because it is definitely better. Or if you want a comedy with De Niro just watch "Meet the Parents". All of these movies have more charm than this one. a cold 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sequel is mostly not a reputable thing in Hollywood. In one week I was reviewing sequels to memorable comedies like (Arthur 2: On the Rocks - 1988), (The Odd Couple II - 1998), and now (Analyze That - 2002) to have a bad result all the way. I think the commercial exploitation reached its explosion at the 2000s. Away from that, just look at this example : Director (Brad Bird) after the smash success of his Oscar-winner (The Incredibles - 2004) refuses to make any sequel, prequel, spin-off and dedicates himself to make totally another movie, another Oscar-winner (Ratatouille - 2007). This is wise creative person with bold decisions to make. Unlike Mr. Bird, here, after the genius simple (Analyze This) they produced (Analyze That) ! First off, the concept of this (That) was weak. I mean it could have been prettier idea to see some reversal as the mob man treats the doctor this time, or something like that. But unfortunately what we've seen was muddled, semi-pointless, and less funny compared to the first one. Basically the situations were on shaky ground. The sense of credibility, which was smartly coherent at the first (Analyze), is lost. And to hide that they made all the possible comic lines they can do, however none was well enough ! The best of this movie is its first half, where (De Niro) is a mad singing man or undesirable guest or failing at many jobs. As the second half was the best of perturbation; the wholly unfunny matter of the TV show (strange how they missed to produce any laughs out of it), some car chase, a sudden unbelievable heist, and one genuine fabricated happy end where (De Niro) must look as the criminal with the heart of gold, and everything finishes fine. (De Niro) seems rare as finally Mr. Hollywood; who's making the obligatory empty sequel, what a pity to hire a great comedian like him (who didn't have the chance much to express his talent at that area) just to be in a nice sketch or two. I'm sorry to say it, but (Billy Crystal) makes outrageously his Razzie-worthy role and movie, if you looked closer you'd find that the script gave him nothing to do, so he had to manage with what appeared as his most ridiculous performance yet. (Harold Ramis) turns to remakes (Bedazzled - 2000), and sequels (Analyze That - 2002) after years of his "original" masterpiece as a writer, producer, and director (Groundhog Day - 1993). It's nearly the perfect case for what Hollywood does with its people at the insolvent boring 2000s ! This movie is in disarray made it look poor. And after the success of the previous one, it's disappointing. What can I say? The hasty dealing and the absurd plot did it. The only good thing to be said about those couple of movies is that they're way better and more watchable than De Niro's other candy bars of the same time (Meet the Parents - 2000) and (Meet the Fockers - 2004) which were horrible.More often than not.. The shadows of good movies, which they call sequels, can shadow effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Concept swings low</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rise of the producing team of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, Flashdance and sundry other subtle works exploring the deepest secrets of the human heart) in the 1980s introduced the High Concept movie - one whose premise and entire raison d'?tre could be summed up in a single sentence, preferably referring to other hit movies ? for example Days of Thunder was `Top Gun with cars.' 1999's Analyse This may have been a High Concept movie ? Mafia Don Sees Shrink With Hilarious Results ? but it had a lightness of touch that made it seem less like a focus-group product and more like an offbeat little comedy. Unfortunately for Analyse That, the success of The Sopranos has made Mafioso-psychiatrist relations almost as much a cliché as two cops, one steady and by the book and the other an impulsive maverick, who initially hate each other but bond over the course of several gun battles. More fundamentally, the concept of Analyse This hasn't been taken any further. There could be some entertainment to be had when Robert de Niro's character takes a job as an advisor on `Little Caesar', a Mafia-themed TV drama, but the main joke is that the actor playing the Don is an Australian. It struck me that both actors who played Don Corleone in The Godfather series have now taken the mickey out of the mafia ? Brando in The Freshman and now de Niro in the Analyse This and That series (if there's a sequel, what will it be called? Analyse The Other?)Lisa Kudrow is grossly underused ? one gets the feeling that much of her part ended up on the cutting room floor. Both Crystal and de Niro are pretty good (this is called `damning with faint praise' in the trade, if you're wondering) There are some pleasing shots of New York, and David Holmes' soundtrack has its moments (although is nothing to his work for Ocean's Eleven or Out of Sight) Analyse That is not a bad film, just a rather forgettable one. Puts the `sleep' into `sleeps with the fishes.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write reviews, but I remember watching this stinker, and wanted to throw in my two cents.This film is about Paul Vitti pretending to be insane to get out of jail, thereby driving his psychiatrist insane. How idiotic a premise is that? "Analyze This" was a good film. But "Analyze That" is bad. The plot is empty and chaotic. Apart from the beginning few scenes, there is almost nothing related to madness. The film tries so hard to be funny, by doing the exact opposite of "Analyze This". This time round, the psychiatrist gets crazy and the mobster has to cheer him up. And it is Ben who bugs Paul all the time. I feel that they try too hard to be funny. The end result is that the film ends up not being funny, and sometimes becomes just plain silly. "Analyze That" is a disappointing sequel. Don't waste your time on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As sequels go, this was above average. Which translates into a so-so+ movie. I gave it a 7 out of 10, instead of a 5 or a 6, because there ARE some great laughs in it. Although it pains me to say it, overall, as a movie, "Analyze That" was a bit flaccid, a bit pale, and certainly not as good as the original. It seemed tired and faded, somehow--- kind of like the recent "Men in Black II" sequel to MIB. However, if you are a Billy Crystal-hitting-old-age fan, and if you are a Robert DiNiro fan (and who isn't???--- and if you are gracious enough to be willing to be entertained for a couple of hours, go see it. You'll probably have a pleasant evening!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyse This had a freshness and uniqueness of concept that carried right through the film and made it an enjoyable fluffy comedy. Analyse That falls very adeptly into the stereotype of the sequel that tries to emulate the original and fails miserably. The jokes are the same but somehow less funny, the new characters add nothing notable, Robert DeNiro seemed lost and unsure of his character, Billy Crystal was just plain annoying at times and the story was alternately ridiculous and pedantic. Are we really supposed to be curious about whether or not he's going straight? And in the end, did he? 6 is actually a bit generous, consider it a 5.5 rounded up.But that's just my two scents. ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They are back, and Ben Sobel (Crystal) got more issues to deal with his patient who happens to be a Mob leader: Paul Vitti (De Niro). So folks Robert De Niro again with Billy Crystal, it turned out more fun then i expected, and I am hard to impress when it comes to sequels. Sequels often ruins the whole part of movie loving, in fact i couldn't imagine a sequel of ...on the top of my head "The Shawshank redemption" that would really make me angry. Anyway i could in no way say that this one is better than the first one, in fact it would be better if they just stopped after the first one, but actually this one was really funny (for a sequel), so it still gets 6/10 which is probably the highest vote for a sequel given by me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boys Are Back, and They're Good-- Yes, Yeeeees They Are--</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when `sequel' was synonymous with `less' with regards to quality, as mainly the studios wanted to capitalize on whatever was good about the original and duplicate or enhance in the follow-up the parts they `thought' were responsible for bringing in the big bucks at the box office. Which meant that usually, except in rare instances, the sequel failed to lived up to the first one and, more often than not was a huge disappointment. Happily, in the past few years that tide has seemingly turned, and as this film so aptly demonstrates, a sequel can, in fact, even surpass the original. `Analyze That,' directed by Harold Ramis, is the further adventures of Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) and Dr. Ben Sobol (Billy Crystal), and in a word, it's a hoot. And, most importantly, this one stands on it's own; the characters are back, but the story is fresh-- it's decidedly NOT just more of the same or a rehash of `Analyze This.' As Paul Vitti himself would say about this film: `You... Yooou-- you're good, yes you are!'All is not well with Paul Vitti, currently doing a stretch at Sing Sing; someone, it appears, wants him whacked, and it's driven him into some kind of psychotic episode from which he may never emerge if he doesn't get out of prison, and soon-- like right away. And who better to treat the `boss' than his personal therapist, Dr. Ben Sobol; or so goes the reasoning of those in high places, who actually have some ulterior motives in mind.So Vitti is released into the custody of Dr. Sobol, who is not all that thrilled at the prospect of having a mob boss as a house guest. Even less thrilled is Sobol's wife, Laura (Lisa Kudrow). But they don't know the half of it, yet. There's a war brewing between two `families,' and Vitti, it seems, is right in the middle of it. And soon, some old faces begin showing up at the Sobol residence, like Jelly (Joe Viterelli); and if that isn't enough, the good Dr. Sobol has just been through the death of his own father, and he's grieving. And it's `a process.'And a `process' is what brought this film so successfully to the screen, and it's gratifying, not to mention enjoyable and entertaining, when the result of a creative collaboration like this works so well. Screenwriters Peter Steinfeld, Peter Tolan and Harold Ramis crafted and delivered a script that is imaginative and fresh, and Ramis, who also directed `Analyze This,' as well as a couple of modern day comedy classics, `Caddyshack' and `National Lampoon's Vacation,' hits his stride with arguably his best work yet. His sets a perfect pace and his sense of timing has never been better. Of course it helps when you've got one of the best comedic actors in the business in there `doing lines' with the best actor-- period-- in the business. Crystal and De Niro together? Well, forgetaboudit... They take what is already great dialogue and make it ring in a way Quasimodo never dreamed possible. It's witty, extremely clever (like the reference to Ben's son, Michael, as `Clemenza') and, most importantly, FUNNY. And Ramis goes with the flow, keeping it all right on track from beginning to end. And De Niro singing? Does it GET any better than that?As expected, De Niro slips back into his Vitti persona with facility, as does Crystal with his Sobol; the way they pick it up, as if they've been living in these guys' skins since `Analyze This,' lends credibility to the film and allows the viewer to settle in with them from the opening frames. So it's not only an entertaining film, but `user-friendly' to boot.The single disappointment comes from the fact that the lovely Kudrow isn't afforded more screen time. She's such a welcome presence when she's on, and to her credit she makes the most of what time she's given, holding her own with her dynamic co-stars right on down the line.A nice addition this time around is Cathy Moriarty-Gentile as new mob boss Patti LoPresti. This particular character suits her extremely well, and she runs with it; especially in her scenes with De Niro she has a captivating, commanding screen presence and it puts some real life in the exchanges between Vitti and LoPresti.Conspicuously absent in this one, however, is Elizabeth Bracco, who did a nice job as Marie Vitti in the original. Sister of Lorraine Bracco (of TV's `Sopranos,' the hit series to which this film successfully pays homage in some key sequences and plot developments), Elizabeth seems to gravitate more toward roles in `indie' films, however, where she's carved out something of a niche for herself (as in Steve Buscemi's `Trees Lounge' in ?96), a la Parker Posey and Catherine Keener. And though she's missed here, it's understandable; career wise, she's in good company.The supporting cast includes Anthony LaPaglia (Tony), Joe D'Onofrio (Gunman), Richard Maldone (Joey), William DeMeo (Al Pacino), Reg Rogers (Raoul), Brian Rogalski (Earl) and Thomas Rosales Jr. (Coyote). Given the nature of the story and the characters, this film necessarily has something of an `edge' to it, but Ramis navigates the R-rated waters in a way that makes `Analyze That' funny, friendly AND highly entertaining. There are those who will say that it should all end here, on a successful note; personally, however, I'm waiting to hear that `Analyze And the Other Thing' will soon be in pre-production. As far as I'm concerned, you can never get enough of a good thing.   </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze That (2002): Dir: Harold Ramis / Cast: Robert De Niro, Billy Crystal, Joe Viterelli, Lisa Kudrow, Cathy Moriarty: Inferior sequel to Analyze This, which searched of the trauma of the Robert De Niro character. This time out regards current issues that plague the psychiatrist including the recent death of his father and the release of De Niro into his custody. De Niro claims that attempts were made on his life in prison and he fakes insanity singing songs from Hollywood musicals. Same setup with a formula agenda but a pleasant dismiss. Director Harold Ramis creates the same witty humour. He usually creates comedies with some sort of social message such as Caddyshack and National Lampoon's Vacation. De Niro once again finds the right note for humour and his role is written in an upbringing as well as his sincerity is tested. Billy Crystal comes to terms with aspects of his own life as well as closure with De Niro. Joe Viterelli as De Niro's closest friend in crime is given little to do, which is unfortunate given that he stole his scene in the first film. Lisa Kudrow as Crystal's wife has little screen time and she seems only there as a prop for the Crystal role. Cathy Moriarty co-starred with De Niro in the boxing masterpiece Raging Bull. Now they co-star in this unworthy sequel. This is a pointless sequel but if viewers enjoyed the much better Analyze This, then perhaps they may dare to analyze this as well.

		<fullReview>Analyze That is a mafia comedy film, and a sequel to Analyze This that stars Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal, who respectively reprise their roles as mobster Paul Vitti and psychiatrist Ben Sobel.Lisa Kudrow,Joe Viterelli and Cathy Moriarty-Gentile co-star to play key supporting roles.It was co-written and directed by Harold Ramis. Ever since he ended up behind bars, mob leader Paul Vitti has been in sad shape, alternately weeping like a child and singing favorite tunes from West Side Story. Fearful of his emotional stability, prison officials release Vitti into the custody of his psychiatrist, Dr. Ben Sobel, but this is far more responsibility than Sobel wants -- he's having troubles with his family after the recent death of his father, also an analyst, and has been overworked since taking over his late father's practice. Sobel becomes even more exasperated when he learns Vitti will be moving into his home, which is especially upsetting for Sobel's wife, Laura. As Sobel tries to get to the root of Vitti's problems -- which are very much real, even if he was faking his symptoms behind bars -- he tries to help Vitti find a straight job, which is hardly easy for a man of his temperament. And adding to all this confusion, several members of Vitti's old crew are after him, determined to insure that he doesn't pass along any incriminating information.Audiences who loved Analyze This may have to see the new movie to believe just how empty it is. What they'll find is a profound difference between the two movies since this sequel is thin, flat and largely forgettable as De Niro and Crystal trudge through with all the enthusiasm of John Madden at a salad bar.Also,where the first movie - Analyze This - struck just the right tone, blending anxiety attacks with machine-gun attacks to come up with a comic La Cosa Neurosis, this picture consistently goes too far in all directions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze That is the sequel to Analyze This and again re-unites Robert DiNero and Billy Crystal. The story picks up right where Analyze This left off. Paul Vitti is in jail and when unknown people try and kill him, he realizes he must get out and get to those responsible for the attempts in murdering him, before they get to him. He fakes an illness and gets released into his former shrink, Ben Sobel's, care.I enjoyed the first one. I thought it had a a few funny moments, great acting, and I just overall enjoyed it. I didn't see the point in a sequel. However, I also enjoyed this one. It wasn't as good as the first, by no means. But it was still alright.Once again, it had funny moments and great acting, but I didn't buy into the premise, and some of the dialog was a bit hammy.

		<shortDescription>Not as good sequiel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel of the 1999 mob comedy "Analyze This" has plenty to keep the viewers laughing, bemused, and sometimes shocked. It's no longer a tale of a sweet psychiatrist keeping a mafia don sober. On the contrary, it's the gangster who's showing his shrink the reality of the tough side to every human soul. Guess who's expected to be lying on the psychiatric couch? Yep, this film offers a fun ride to the psychology of the shrink! And it makes no apologies for pumping up enough guffaws to keep one's throat sore. It may not be the comedy for the puritanical grandmas and grand-papas, but face it, it's gangland - foul-mouthed, and rude gestures, vulgarities, et. al. Yep, Director Harold Ramis can't be accused of not injecting new flavor and spice to this sequel's characters! Nope, there's no way one can complain that it has the same old jokes. De Niro and Billy Crystal, and a cast of amusing actors are offering a new outlook on mob life and it's influence. There are demons lurking in every mind; there is the identity crisis to consider - even with the good, old professional folks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analyze That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sequel to the 1999 comedy Analyze This. The mob boss Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is released from prison to the reluctant custody of Ben Sobel, his neurotic psychiatrist (Billy Crystal). Sobel has to try to convince Vitti to reform himself and get a lawful job ? easier said than done. Vitti does find work as a consultant for a mob-themed TV show, but at the same time rivaling gangsters are after him and Sobel is more stressed than ever.I like the original film a lot and there is fun to be found in the sequel as well. De Niro lampoons his many gangster roles and mob movie clichés in general, while Crystal's role continues the Woody Allen tradition of neurotic worrying. Both have mastered the mannerisms and dialog their roles demand, making the more down-to-earth scenes much funnier than the big action set-pieces, such as the armoured truck robbery in the end. Even though I laughed many times, I don't think the jokes come out as effortlessly as in the first movie, but Analyze That is a very watchable sequel in any case. In his last role, Joe Viterelli also deserves a nod for his performance as Jelly, Vitti's right-hand man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a big fan of Analyze this. That is why I was really disappointed with Analyze that, a film that could've been a lot better. Trust me, it's not as bad as Be Coll or anything. I was a big fan of Get shorty and I was disappointed with that movie's sequel also. Trust me, this ain't Be cool though. Years after he was put away, Paul Vitti comes out of Sing Sing prison, where he sang sang. He comes back to his therapist Ben Sobel(played by the great Billy Crystal), where he causes even more chaos than before. I loved the original film, but this film has a Whole ten yards thing going with it where it's just a little silly. I give both films(Analyze that and The Whole ten yards) the same rating though. Does this film come close to being as good as the original? No. But the film still works in some sort of way. I'll agree that it was a disappointment, but I still liked it.Analyze that:***/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anal-ize this!!! Although not as good as the original, ANALYZE THAT is still good enough. In some ways, it improves on the original. De Niro is more relaxed, nastier and funnier. There's less of Billy Crystal, which is always a good thing. But when the two of them are together on screen, the movie's laugh-out loud funny. Yes, the plot is dispensable and most of the jokes are mere variations of the original. It's a sequel, for Christ's sake. Accept it for what it is, a reunion with old friends who make you laugh even if they tell you the same jokes over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw "The Analyze That" (a trilogy to the famous comedy "Analyze This") trailer for the very first time I gave a promise to myself - To see the movie on the release date. After I've watched the first part, back in 1999, a bunch of the phrases from the movies became my favorite quotes. I also knew some of the dialogs by heart. Even in these days, I can say it for sure - the "Analyze This" remains one of my all-time favorite movies. May be because of that, I have been feeling some sense of hesitation on my way to the theater. I was afraid to be disappointed by the sequel.The first thing I want to say - I loved the movie. I'm not going to compare the first and the second parts, or decide which one is better. A great job has been done in the sequel to preserve the spirit and the style of the original movie. Many tricks from the first part have been used once again in a brand-new fashion. Paul repeatedly expresses his admiration of Ben - "You...You... You are good", Ben experiences the nervous breakdown as well as Paul and now they are crying together. And of course Jelly is still inimitable with his simple and effective solutions to the problems - throwing off a guy from the roof, despite the order from Paul. When Paul told Jelly that he is not doing what has been ordered, but what he (Jelly) wants or likes, Jelly gives him a nice smile and saying - Yes.The whole movie can be divided on three parts. The first one concentrates the major part of the funny moments of the whole movie. Paul makes an incredible performance of the "West Side story" theme - "I feel pretty", Ben is trying to analyze and understand the "really bad" mental condition of Paul, while Paul (or should I say Robert De Niro here) demonstrates himself as the best mimic. The Feds release Paul into the Ben's custody because of his "extensive mental disorder", which happened to be a one big setup - "I knew it...I knew it. You used me to get you out of jail" - "Took you too long".In the second part Paul is trying to "start a new life", find a legal job and to figure out what to do next. He lives in the Ben's house, brining a lot of fun to Ben, Laura and their relatives. After 45 minutes of loud deep moan, which can be heard in any part of the house, Ben goes to the room where Paul is entertaining himself with a prostitute. Ben - "I have 17-years-old boy in my house..." Paul - "Okay, I'll ask her". Eventually, in the last part, an unsuccessful car dealer, a jeweler, a waiter and even a movie production adviser finds himself in only one suitable position - "Paul Vitti - The BOSS".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is going to take a lot of guff because critics are poised to give an R rated comedy a lower rating since their virgin ears can't listen to such foul language.I saw the preview 3-4 months ago and i asked my self, "all the movies out there to make a sequel to and they made this...what the heck...?" Anyways I just got done watching it and i have to say i enjoyed this one much more than the first. The comedy is much more overdrawn and the Bobby does a great job reprising Paul Vitti and Bill is same old same old with a little added problem of his own, the death of his father. They both do a great job with their characters, but the story is so-so (it's a comedy folks, no need for an Oscar written story here).The movie does drag on towards the end, but in no way does it destroy the movie, check it out if your in the mood for nothing more than a good laugh.*** out of 4, bring the kids!!!j/k</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ranks up there with 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' as one of the funniest films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember over two years ago, when my father took me to see 'Analyze This' in an almost empty auditorium in Las Vegas. Although I had enjoyed it, it was a film that was not as funny as it should have been. Thanks to a special sneak preview in Camp Pendleton, California, I got to see an early screening of 'Analyze That', the sequel to 'Analyze This' and it is easily ranks right up there with the original. It is one very fun movie.As the movie opens, mobster Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) is having new problems. He has, for no reason, started to sing songs from "West Side Story" and nobody knows what's wrong with him. Not even his psychiatrist Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) knows what is wrong, and he could care less at the moment. His father has just died and he's not easily getting over it. ("I'm greiving. It's a process.") Anyway, Paul ends up under the custody of Dr. Sobel, and promises the doctor that he will try to go straight. However, when people like Lou the Wrench start stalking him, chaos ensues.It's hard to believe that 'Analyze That' works just as well as the original, but it does. Hey, there are even some stronger laughs in the sequel than in the original. There are also some very funny one-liners that I will not reveal her, and the direction by Harold Ramis is just as deft as it was in the original.Are there flaws? Probably, but there are enough laughs to make us forget them. The climax is the only area where flaws show. This part of the movie seems too much like a rip-off on 'Ocean's 11', but it's just my opinion.Anyway, if you're looking for a funny adult comedy to see this year that ranks right up there with 'Death to Smoochy', 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' and 'Austin Powers in Goldmember', than 'Analyze That' should be your cup of tea for the end of the year.My rating: ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This time around, everything is different. Paul's coming from somewhere he's never been, going into a new life, and in new directions, and dragging the f'ing Doctor along with him.The same dynamic from "Analyze This" is in play, but it is applied differently, with more skill. This chapter feels like it tries to be more serious, and loses some of the charm of the first installment, but it manages a certain gritty edge missing from that first movie.This is still a witty movie, don't get me wrong. But it gives the viewers more of the business end of Paul Vitti and family. The laughs are less the belly kind and more the thinker's tickle kind until about half way through it, and then it changes gears and the belly laughs start coming again.I really enjoy this movie, and watch it often.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>De Niro and Crystal reprise their respective roles as Paul Vitti and Ben Sobel in the sequel to 'Analize This' The story begins shortly after the first film, Paul Vitti's still in Sing Sing prison and Ben's father has recently passed away. After several attempts on Vitti's life he fakes madness and is released into the care of Ben Sobel (who is grieving - it's a process!) The opening 30 minutes or so show a great deal of promise, and you could be forgiven for thinking 'here comes more of the same' but like several other reviews on this site have pointed out, the movie falls a little flat and simply fails to recapture the magic of the original.I wouldn't call this film a disaster, but i wouldn't say it's a must see either.6/10 For That!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze That is not a good movie.Analyze This was not too hot either. It is only watchable due to Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal and eventually you grow tired of them and the predictability of it all.If you blink you may miss Lisa Kudrow though I suspect she was well paid for her efforts. The story of the heist was totally implausible.Also, I am wondering when Bobby De Niro will tackle a decent dramatic role again. He's not getting any younger and may regret doing all these comedies when all he is offered is Grandfather parts in Lassie movies. As for Billy Crystal, well he's always got The Oscars to fall back on. This barely got a cinema release in the UK. The DVD has special features including a documentary where the cast, director and producers tell you how funny it is though you are more likely to fall asleep than split your sides with laughter.A waste of time and talent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The analysis is dire for flat, uninspired sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Analyze That (2002): Incarcerated mobster Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro, who is first seen dancing around on a tabletop like a lunatic and singing songs from "West Side Story") is released into the custody of his hapless psychiatrist, Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal), and predictable, allegedly humorous hijinks ensue. Somehow it was considered a smart move to include a heist-caper subplot that honestly expects viewers to believe that Sobel, Vitti and his mob friends (all equipped with thousand-dollar suits and standard New Yawker accents) are going to form a cohesive unit and attempt to rip off an armored truck containing millions of dollars in gold bullion. It's unfortunate that neither Dr. Sobel nor director Harold Ramis can solve the identity crisis that outright cripples this movie, because it can't decide if it wants to be a hysterical knee-slapper or a straightfaced crime drama. It succeeds at neither. In fact, this same nonsense was pulled in "Showtime" (which also starred DeNiro), and look how that wreck turned out. Another strained subplot puts Vitti in the public eye as he serves as a consultant on a "Sopranos"-style TV show despite his complaining to Sobel that someone is out to kill him and that he was almost offed in prison. Do make sure to sit through the closing credits, where compensation for the squandering of Crystal's and DeNiro's talents comes in the form of the long-overdue laughs that should have been reserved for the actual movie instead. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze This was a marvellous comedy. Sharp, witty, and hilarious with just the right mix of smart lines and visual gags. Problem with the sequel is that they're trying to recreate the chemistry between De Niro and Crystal in the original, and it's just not as potent. Too many moments are forced, and too often the story plods into melodrama.The story is simple: Vitti, De Niro's character, is released from jail into Dr Sopel's care and the obligatory situations they would find themselves in follow. Nothing original there, and the problem is the Odd Couple just doesn't work here. Not like in Analyze This.Analyze This was witty, quick, refreshing and didn't take itself at all seriously. Analyze That is none of the above. Of course it has amusing moments, some laugh out loud moments too. But it's just not as good as the first one.I adored the original, and fully expected this to be as good. I was a bit disappointed.Ah well, can't win 'em all.</fullReview>

Analyze That is the usual sequel with an almost Identical plot that gets old the second time around. Its also kind of agonizing to watch Billy Crystal and Robert Deniro have their talents wasted away in this movie when they could be put to use in a better movie. I recommend The Sopranos over Analyze That any day. It is better written and the humor is much more enjoyable and the characters are much more memorable.</fullReview>

After much thought about this pitiful sequel, I can honestly say that Callie Thorne has nice legs. How can two of my favorite actors make such a disappointing movie? Well, they can change Crystal's shiny-suited mob boss impersonator of 'Analyze This' into a snivelling character with bad hair who over-grieves his father's death. Then, they can take a slick gangster with some funny emotional issues, and transform him into a tired, haggard-looking ex-con who over-acts and uses the "f" word indiscriminately. Add a whining, also haggard- looking, fingernails-on-a-chalkboard annoying Lisa Kudrow, with an overweight and overacted mob boss-ette played by Cathy Moriarty. Blend all this with a mediocre effort by the cast and a questionable plot line, and you've got another greedy $equel. There were a few scenes where I was able to force a laugh, but the chemistry and magic of the original was totally absent. I hope that any idea for another 'Analyze' is immediately whacked, hit, popped and clipped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Analyze That' is the abysmally unfunny sequel to `Analyze This,' the charming and amusing `crime comedy' from 1999. Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal reprise their roles as Paul Vitti, the ex-mob boss who breaks with Mafia protocol by poring out his problems to a sympathetic shrink, and Dr. Ben Sobol, the psychiatrist who helps Vitti cope with the stresses and crises that go along with his unconventional occupation. Unfortunately, this time around, these two fine actors have been saddled with a screenplay (by Kenneth Lonergan) that is little more than a collection of crude, vulgar one-liners that land with a resounding thud every time the characters open their mouths to deliver them. In this installment Paul has faked insanity in order to be released early from prison and Ben is the poor schmuck who has to watch over him to make sure he doesn't get into any trouble. Director Harold Ramis fails completely in bringing any of this to comic life, with poor De Niro and Crystal reduced to performing shtick comedy routines in a vain attempt to carry it all off. The marvelous Joe Viterelli as `Jelly,' the poker-faced mobster with the heart-of-gold, provides what few moments of pleasure the film is able to muster.At various points in the movie, Paul performs a medley of songs from `West Side Story,' which would be fine in itself except that it merely serves to remind us of how much we would rather be watching THAT movie than this one. Makers of stinkers like `Analyze That' simply have to learn that reminding us of all the great movies we've seen in our lifetimes is no way to enhance our impression of the turkey at hand.</fullReview>

What a hectic time this is, and although the language is rather filthy, the story holds up well, and the laughs are really funny. The two actors work well together; there is a scene where Crystal mimics a real hardboiled criminal and he is terrific! Some of the language is a little hard to take, but overlook it anyway; you'll laugh and laugh; plus the outtakes when the picture ends, are especially funny! The whole audience laughs with them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading all those reviews on the net and in the papers would lead you to believe that this one is a shadow of the first part. I am not a great De Niro fan and don't have the best things to say about Billy Crystal, but their chemistry works. Yes, some of the jokes are pretty jaded and surprisingly un-funny but over all I would rate it "Can Watch".De Niro might be one of the best actors ever but he sure doesn't know how to cry without making us want to do the same. And they expect us to find it funny. Billy Crystal should stop trying to be a "comedian" and just become an "out of work comedian".Having said that, the movie has its moments. Some extremely funny and some endearing in a way. De Niro is effortless in most scenes except in those he has to cry in a way that makes us laugh.If you haven't watched "Analyze This" you are sure to love it. If you have, you might be disappointed a bit but you wouldn't have wasted your $7.50</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who would've thought the movie could actually be that bad? Going into the movie I knew it wouldn't be good, but I was expecting some cheap laughs. There weren't many laughs and the movie just... sucked. I mean it was bad. I don't like to bash a movie, but this was just awful. I can see that Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal didn't do the movie because the script was good... I'm sure the $20 million actually made 'em feel better about making this piece of s***. It's sad how bad this is really since the first one was pretty good. This is one of the worse sequels to a decent movie I've ever seen. However, if you liked the first one, rent it on video.OVERALL: 4 out of 10 (bad)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw it as a freebie promotional. And it still wasn't worth it.Analyze This was very funny, with clever scripting and surprises for the brain. OTOH, Analyze That was a bore. The dialogue was awful, the humor just gags, and even the plot setup it worked out wasn't exploited at payoff time. Kenneth Lonergan wrote the screenplay for This but not for That. He was also the writer of the wonderful You Can Count On Me. Without him, this is just a churned-out sequel. You gotta wonder if De Niro and Crystal need money that badly -- why do they even bother with scripts like this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this sequel to be as good if not better than the original (here's one thing it might have with the godfather series, aside from 'stealing' one of the scores for 10 seconds, teehee). It seemed as if the satirical elements in the film were handled more poignantly but at the same time, more light-heartedly than 'Analyze This'. The clashes of cultures, of personalities, inter-mob conflict &amp; the FBI (FBI Agent's best line: "Just call the FBI's limousine service at 1-800-F**-Off", teeheehee) all work themselves-in pretty well here, the scenes are quite balanced with few excesses (i.e. overdoing some jokes to death). Some jokes/exploits are repeated a bunch of times, but they tend to be employed tactfully (i.e. I didn't feel embarrassed for the actors) and humorously (i.e. I laughed, I giggled). I confess I thought that this movie was not going to end up being up to par. I am pleased to be proven incorrect on that front. A good comedy and perhaps the best mob comedy (clearly one of the best).In closing, amusing and well-worth the time if one is seeking some good laughs. Of course, that depends one one's sense of humor (people do die violently in this comedy) : but I suspect that most people going to see this one would already know more-or-less what to expect, and in this sense, I think they will be pleasantly surprised.

		<fullReview>This film is about Paul Vitti pretending to be insane to get out of jail, thereby driving his psychiatrist insane."Analyze This" was a good film. But "Analyze That" is bad. The plot is empty and chaotic. Apart from the beginning few scenes, there is almost nothing related to madness. The film tries so hard to be funny, by doing the exact opposite of "Analyze This". This time round, the psychiatrist gets crazy and the mobster has to cheer him up. And it is Ben who bugs Paul all the time. I feel that they try too hard to be funny. The end result is that the film ends up not being funny, and sometimes becomes just plain silly. "Analyze That" is a disappointing sequel. Don't waste your time on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "Analyze This" when it came on video some years ago and I liked it, it wasn´t exactly a laugh-out-loud comedy, but funny enough. One of its strong points was its cast: Robert DeNiro was perfect and Billy Crystal knows how to do comedy. Since then I have seen the film a few times on TV and I wouldn´t mind watching it once more. I can´t say the same about "Analyze That", though. The film is a real let-down and worth not missing."Analyze That" has everything expect for jokes that really work. The cast is without doubt full of rock-solid talents and everybody gives a good performance. I´ve always considered Lisa Kudrow my favorite of the Friends and in this film she has been given a few amusing lines. But where can you go with a script that simply isn´t funny? I was very disappointed in this film, you should get more from such a movie as "Analyze That".I guess "Analyze That" is just another sequel made because of the success of the first part. Too bad most of the sequels are made just because of money and no one cares about the script (another example: "MIIB"). Hopefully the poor box-office performance shows that "Analyze This &amp; That Too" isn´t on the list of most-wanted movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I had nothing to do this Saturday evening, I switched on Pay-per-View movie to watch the movie I had missed when it was released. Good to know, I did not wasted my money in theatre.This is a sequel to a movie which did not need any sequel. Psycho-therapy takes a back seat in this sequel. While the dialogues and chemistry between two lead actors were highlight of "Analyze This", the sequels relies heavily on gags and vulgar dialogues to evoke laughter, but fails miserably. There is no emphasis on the psycho-therapy, which was the basis of prequel. Instead, the character of Paul Vitti is transformed into some sort of "Saviour" who helps Billy Crystal.Though Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal tries hard to put life in the movie, the script and dialogues are too below-par to make this movie noteworthy. It looks like we are watching some episode from "The Sopranos" and the movie "The Score" combined together.Hope we do not get any sequel for "Analyze That"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly disappointing comedy sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>5.5/10Analyze This was a very funny comedy about a psychiatrist (Billy Crystal) and his mobster client (Robert de Niro). The sequel to this movie was similar in that the relationship continues after de Niro cannot cope with the pressures of jail life. Analyze That therefore had the difficult job of following up the bright and breazy comedy and in some regards it worked with some well timed gags, and the growing disillusion felt by Crystal as he begins to analyze both their lives. However, I sensed that the film was virtually just cashing in, in the timeless way that sequels have done before offering nothing new. Crystal and de Niro I felt did their best to inject some enthusiasm into the movie, but there just wasn't enough room for anything other than a few laughs and a little enjoyment. For these reasons the movie is worth watching as a little light entertainment, but don't be surprised if you end up ultimately disappointed.</fullReview>

Then there is JELLY, yes you heard me right...the gangster named Jelly. He was great! What was missing was Chaz P who was in the first one.

		<fullReview>Analyze That was a big disappointment. A potentially very funny film with a good, well-tried storyline and a good cast was spoilt by some very overdone, very silly, and very juvenile vulgarity. Crudity is only funny if it is cleverly ironic or satiric and parodying, Analyze That is none of these. The whole film seemed to revolve around how many times those actors playing assorted criminal slags could spit out the f-word in the dialogue of a scene, which is plainly pathetic as a device for comedy. The director, Harold Ramis, who has been a good comedic actor and a clever writer for other films, should go back and rethink his whole recent approach to comedy if this movie is any indication. And what is the point of having a resource such as De Niro if you can't use him better than this, or did he decide not to try too hard for this one. This film was just painful to watch. Analyze That is not worth the price of admission for this viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze me this: "Analyze That" (AT) makes as much of a comedy as "Jaws" makes a popular science film on Discovery channel. Got the point? OK let me try this: AT is not funny, it's humiliating. It was humiliating to watch De Niro tearing down the memories of a once great actor.How long has been since we saw him act, I mean act la De Niro. Let's see. The last memorable performance was in "Cape Fear" in 1991 and since then the only worth mentioning are "Frankenstein", "Casino" and sure "Analyze This". The rest complete crap - "The Fan", "Sleepers", "Jackie Brown", "Ronin", "Meet the Parents", "The Score" to mention a few. Don't forget, we are talking about Robert De Niro. Is he blind? Doesn't he read the scripts? Or is just about money again. 20 million for this sequel-now that's laughable.Don't waste your time with this movie. It's not that you gonna hate it, De Niro and Billy Crystal are in it, but it's a waste of time. AT is so contrived with an idiotic plot and the jokes are so stupid with most of them actually repeated from "Analyze This". For me this movie ranks below 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

I wish that I could erase the memory so I could go on loving Robert Di Niro and respecting him at the same time. I was also forced to look at Paulina in this awful light.

		<fullReview>It could be "Analyze That" is even funnier than the original picture, and it certainly is more liberal in it's use of the F-bomb than "Analyze This". I guess that's because there were a lot more mobster characters in this one, as Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) is released into the custody of his psychiatrist Dr. Sobel (Billy Crystal). The picture takes on the guise of a caper movie during the latter third, and it wasn't quite clear to me at what point Vitti turned the tables on the the Rigazzi Gang and Patti LoPresti (Cathy Moriarty). With all the bullets flying, it's tough to keep straight who the 'good' bad guys and 'bad' bad guys are, but it's not important enough for me to watch it all over again. The one thing I noticed for the very first time in any film made after the events of 9/11, was the absence of the Twin Towers as part of the New York City skyline. Prominent by it's absence, it had me thinking about the picture in an entirely different light.</fullReview>

It's funny how casting becomes so important in Mafia films (there's even a sort of parody of this in the film, when Paul gets a job as a consultant on a film set). Pretty good script. Considering DeNiro and Crystal could have dialled it in, they seem to have made an effort to show that their on-screen relationship has evolved from the first movie. Lisa Kudrow's considerable comedic talents are wasted here, however, and Cathy Moriarty could have had a much larger role, she's that good. I don't want to give anything away, but the ending is relatively weak. Also, DeNiro's hair colour seems to change with each scene. Despite this, watch. Enjoy.</fullReview>

He stays in his house and makes a practical attempt to get legitimate work. After repeated failures to secure a job and causing disturbances to Crystal's relatives and friends, De Niro eventually gets involved in a movie production. This leads to hilarious consequences. Meanwhile his rival gang begins to have doubts to he may well be planning a attack very soon.No kidding this is a enjoyable movie. However the post interval portions does not sustain the the same level of interest in contrast to the first half. Involving De Niro in movie production just didn't cut it for me. It was also that that segment involving Crystal was sidetracked. Tha pace is moderate and Ramis gives his best effort to make a follow up. The scenes between De Niro and Crystal form part of the main highlight of the movie. Overall if one enjoys watching De Niro doing comedy, it is worth a watch.</fullReview>

DeNiro does a fabulous job of satirizing his many gangster roles and Billy Crystal is at his best. The same cast and crew returns with a few new additions including Cathy Moriarty as a female crime boss. The plot involves DeNiro again as Crime Boss Paul Vitti trying to extricate himself out of prison as rivals are trying to "knock him off" inside the prison. Crystal as Dr. Ben Sobel will not return his calls so he feigns psychotic acts and the feds call upon Dr. Sobel for help. He ends up right back where he started from with Crime Boss DeNiro. Some of the funniest scenes involve DeNiro job hunting. Both films, "Analyze This" and "Analyze That" are available on DVD and Blu-Ray as a dual-pack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In case you are wondering about my one line summary... it's based on a gag in the film. And it's so much of a running gag that they must've had that thing training for a *marathon* before they made the movie. I'm not kiddin', it's said the better part of a dozen times, in a 90-minute movie. Now, I grant that the first was hardly a work of art. By all means, it was perhaps good for a few laughs on a slow night with nothing else or better to do, but this, my gosh, this "film" takes everything the first was and takes away what charm there was to it. The characters are reduced to stereotypes. Tons of jokes and scenes are recycled, and any merit they may have is all from having appeared(and possibly worked) in the first film. Someone compared this to Men In Black 2... and I would have to agree that this is a sequel in that same vein. More or less everybody comes back, some simply to reference their character in the first, and everything is, supposedly, taken up a notch. Scenes are pushed further into the extreme. Any humor that could have existed in this film is lost due to everything being so forced. The plot is written around how to shove Crystal and De Niro together again, and it only goes downhill from there. Was there any point to making this sequel other than the anticipated profit(which apparently did not come to be)? Analyze This did not need a follow-up. La Paglia isn't terrible. I suppose the film is watchable, and not as bad as others out there, but you ought to ask yourself: "Is this something I need to spend my time and/or money on?" I recommend it only to those who simply must see more after watching the first... and even those should take care, because opinion seems evenly divided between those who enjoy it and those who regretted watching it. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great funny film, great mickey take</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Analyze This because DeNiro and Crystal had a good and funny script and worked so well together. Well, they are on top form yet again in this film too. DeNiro is released from prison into Crystal's care which inevitably proves pretty well impossible for both of them. Clearly the two actors are having a ball and this spirit is infectious, endowing the film with that feel good factor that is so essential in order to make a comedy work.I know that some will say that parts of it are clichéd but again in a good comedy it is comforting to revisit good jokes. It's a bit like hearing a favourite song on the radio. Everyone in the film is good and I loved Cathy Moriarty's line to her daughters about hurrying up in order not to be late for their ballet lesson (I'm far too polite to repeat it verbatim here!!)The film has the added bonus of the running joke/mickey take of a TV show called "Little Caesar" in which an actor frequently associated in the viewers minds with playing gangsters is shown playing the role of a gangster. This actor with the director and film crew of "Little Caesar" employ DeNiro as the true gangster Vitti to give them some insights and tips on gangster mentality and behaviour. The actor in question here is Anthony LaPaglia who is uncredited. He basically plays himself complete with broad Australian accent. The whole notion of DeNiro and LaPaglia both playing or pretending to play gangsters is very funny. Facing each other, LaPaglia as Anthony Bella attempts to imitate the accent and actions of DeNiro as Paul Vitti, this is even more amusing when you bear in mind that Australian Mr LaPaglia honed his Brooklyn accent by watching that other perennial gangster actor Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon! This is a super little nonsense film, well made and plain good fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do your voters want! To give this hilarious brave depiction of organized crime with a dream cast and script such a low rating makes me think they've designated "dumpers" for films on this site. Not "Godfather" viewers. A prerequisite, I'd say.God! Robert De Niro as a funny gangster. I love it. How very cool, a spoof of the Godfather. I hesitate to go into the story line but want to tell the writer and director this is my idea of great entertainment. Unfortunately, we film production outsiders can't always relate to the humor of recent gangster films because we are not steeped in those that have impacted formidably before. Perhaps a proviso. An admonition prior to the humorous take, that is, if the viewers haven't seen Robert De Niro's or Francis Ford Copolla's films prior they should go rent them first THEN see this spin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sequel of "Analyse This" with again Billy Crystal as the shrink and Robert De Niro as boss of the "gang". The first one was really funny and I did very much enjoy it. The sequel is entertaining as well, maybe not as good as the first but still very funny and worth watching if you love the genre. Don't expect of course a very intriguing and well written story, because you will be disappointed. Just expect an entertaining De Niro and amusing Crystal and you will have a good time.De Niro is of course born to play Paul Vitti. He is perfectly suitable for this kind of movies. The scenes in the beginning where De Niro is faking that he's crazy are very funny. When the movie is finished there are also shown some bloopers who are certainly worth watching! Not top class, but still very funny and entertaining! 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abysmal attempt at a sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSDespite a criticised attempt at comedy, Robert De Niro has always proved critics wrong by producing decent comedies. "Meet The Parents" and "Analyze This" were both original ideas which benefited from De Niro's style and intelligence. Sadly the sequel to the later film is absolutely abysmal and totally unfunny.Set a year or so after the original film, Paul Vitti (De Niro) is positioned in prison as a well respected leader when an attempt on his life is made. Lying his way through a few tests, Vitti is eventually placed in the care of Doctor Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal). Faced with two potentials therefore, Vitti must choose between going straight and the life which he has grown up in. Whatever he chooses, threats on his life remain.This film is just not funny. Using the same cast and a plot following on from a decent original, it's not hard to see why Harold Ramis and company felt that this was worth making. Sadly however, all "Analyze That" does is make us want to watch the original again.Looking at the characters involved, Billy Crystal is his usual self playing the eccentric psychiatrist who is forced to look after Vitti. As Vitti however, De Niro is far from his usual self. Whilst in the original, De Niro is absolutely stunning as an almost comic character of himself, in this film he is pathetic and rather pointless.There is little else to say really. Lisa Kudrow, in contrast with the original film, is hideously underused in this film, and the same is true of Joe Viterelli as Jelli. With a superb support cast, this film deserved so much more than what we received. Sadly the film turned into the simple Crystal vs De Niro show. This is a shame, but there's little which can be done now.All in all, "Analyze That" should have been a decent sequel. Sadly it is a pathetic follow up which makes the audience grind their teeth and causes more problems than positives.</fullReview>

Those who saw the first film said they liked this one much better. The acting is superb and the jokes great.I guess it depends what sort of a mood you are in when you start watching a movie like this. If you are critical and grumpy, then you probably won't like it, but if you are smilingly open and want a good time you'll probably find this film a treat. Maybe those from NYC or feel close to the Mafia are prone to trash this film?In any case, this film is worth a try. If you are showing it to a group of friends, just rent a few others to use as backup if your friends don't warm to 'Analyze'. I had a selection of 7 DVDs for my friends to choose from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Embarrassing rehash of the mafia-comedy idea. Okay, the first film was great - a nice, funny mafia comedy. But what Ramis has done here is try and follow that same formula as closely as possible, and as such the results are underwhelming. It gets tired for the same reason sitcoms often gets tired - when the comedy derives too much from the characters, the same jokes can get repetitive). The first movie exhausted the "nerdy psychiatrist," "neurotic mafia man" and "domineering Lisa Kudrow" situation. This time, we've just got the same characters doing the same jokes.1/10. This is really insulting. A really weak film. Has transferred only the characters, not the magic, from the original. A sequel should at least try to do something a bit different, instead of trying to sell tickets based on the name of the previous hit film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze That (aka Analyze This 2)Starring: Billy Crystal, Robert DeNiro and Lisa KudrowGenre: Comedy/CrimeRated R for Language and Some Sexual ContentI liked Analyze That better than the first which was Analyze This. In the sequel, Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) is settling down with his family, while his patient Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) is in prison. Later when Ben Sobel goes to find out what is the problem with Paul is that he was singing West Side Story songs the past few days which I thought was funny. Paul gets released from prison in Ben's care which is where more chaos is going to happen as Ben helps Paul while inheriting his family practice as well as an excess stock of stress. Another one of my favorite parts was when Paul was acting like something was wrong with him and what Ben was doing wasn't working even poking a needle in him but Robert DeNiro missed up on some of the stuff in this part in the bloopers! Will there be a Analyze This 3? I don't know! Fun as well as the first movie!</fullReview>

The stuffed shirts with the heads stuffed with straw for IQ that try to "analyze" every bit of film instead of enjoying it as presented, deserve the fact that they received no enjoyment from it. I have always believed if you think you can or if you think you can't, you are probably right. The same about enjoyment of most films. If you think you won't, you probably won't. Go into it with an open mind and just go with it. I said open mind, not an empty head as many seem to have from what I have been reading. Crystal and DeNiro in both films have been a great mix. Crystals' constant frustration and DeNiros' WTF attitude blend so well. Joe Viterelli? I will miss you very much. You added so much to both films. Hanging the mobster off the roof, the car salesman, opening the robe in the kitchen and so much more made this movie exactly what it was - entertaining. PLEEEEASE make another! Rich Day</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's some concern that an unnecessary sequel to a good film could ruin its integrity, because in the future it won't be remembered as a good movie, but part of a bad film series. However, I think for the makers of Analyze This, making Analyze That was a no brainer because these films never had any integrity worth preserving in the first place. Analyze That was simply a guilty pleasure because I'm guessing that except for the people who were in charge of getting Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal in the same room together, very little effort was put into this film, especially Crystal and De Niro themselves, and yet the results are hilarious. The reason why is that Crystal and De Niro just have such clashing on-screen personas that if you just have them play type, you don't need to do much more than that to get laughs. So when talking about a sequel, it doesn't really matter whether the film is fresh and does something new with the original idea, because we don't remember anything about the original except De Niro and Crystal's chemistry (or lack thereof), and Analyze That has plenty of good fun between the two. 3 Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Squanders more great ideas than most comedies ever have</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was only a middling fan of the original Analyze This, so my expectations for this second installment were practically nil. However, the first fifteen minutes or so of this movie just blew me away ? I was rolling on the floor laughing, and contemplating with glee all the various subplots that had been set in motion. This was, I felt, going to be a great comedy ? surpassing its predecessor by far.And oh, how it could have! The original pretty much got by on the one-joke premise of a gangster seeing a shrink (already passé at the time, incidentally ? not only because [as so many have pointed out] HBO's The Sopranos had just recently introduced that same theme, but also because another *DE NIRO* movie had even mined this territory before; anyone remember the Bill Murray character from Mad Dog and Glory?). Crystal and DeNiro worked well together, there were no major gaffes, and the whole thing had a certain low-key charm ? but it was no big whoop.By comparison, the opening of Analyze That promises a movie of so many different clever plot strands that the only seeming danger is that none of them will be developed completely. There's the fact that the DeNiro character has to pretend to be crazy in order to get out of prison (the ways DeNiro finds to do this are all admittedly over the top, but hilarious nonetheless); there's the fact that he's released into Crystal's custody and is forced to stay at the latter's house as a LIVE-IN (promising culture clashes abound); there's the corresponding fact that the cops, the Feds and even other gangsters have Crystal's house staked out and under scrutiny for just this very reason; then there's DeNiro's various ill-fated attempts to get jobs in the respectable 9-to-5 world that, as a gangster, he's been insulated from his entire life (seeing him as a pushy used-car salesman is a hoot: `Look at this trunk space, it's big enough to fit *two* bodies in there!'); then, when DeNiro's Paul Vitti character gets brought on as a `technical advisor' to a very Sopranos-like mob TV show, one begins to feel that this thing has inspiration enough for three or four different movies.However, none of those movies made it to screen. For, as fast as any of the above-listed concepts are introduced, they are either dropped or relegated to the back-burner. What the film becomes instead, inexplicably and intolerably, is a third-rate hack job mob revenge film, with Vitti working to put the pieces together of who was trying to kill him in prison, and to hunt down and bring to justice the bad guys. This is all done without a trace of wit or intensity ? and, even if it was, what's it doing hogging center stage in a supposed *comedy*? For, one thing this movie clearly is not (after those hysterical first 15 minutes) is a comedy. It's not just that things are not funny, it's that the filmmakers literally don't seem to be trying for jokes; they seem to want to involve us completely with the action and intrigue elements of the story. Since these are not in any way interesting, novel or inventive (and would not be even if the movie had been done as a drama), there's simply nothing to hold your interest. Nothing.Once the film reveals its hand, not even DeNiro and Crystal can save it (as they did the first one). Their relationship in this one is tangential at best: DeNiro is mostly on his own, pursuing his own agenda, while Crystal hangs back out of the way, alternately fuming or obsessing (a sub-strand about his father's recent death and his backlog of grief and resentment toward the old man, which could have provided yet another rich vein of material, is handled so shallowly and incompetently as to make Crystal's character particularly annoying and ineffectual). It's a shame. This movie could truly have been a comic masterpiece. And, if not that (realizing that masterpieces are tough to pull off even with the best ideas in the world), then at least solidly decent. The fact that it falls so far off the charts ? after such a promising beginning ? is a big disappointment indeed. My recommendation: if this is ever on television, watch up until the first commercial break, then turn sharply away. And if you're in a rental mood and have got a DeNiro-Crystal jones going on, rent the first one. Even if you've already seen it, and can recite all the lines by heart ? it will still be a fresher and more invigorating experience than watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Analyze That' pleasantly surprised me. Based on the reviews I have seen, I expected it to be predictable and silly. While it was silly, it certainly wasn't predictable. The talented ensemble cast of Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, Lisa Kudrow, and Cathy Moriarity could not have been more appealing ? or funnier. I found myself laughing out loud on several occasions. Reg Rogers as the supercilious TV director, Raoul Berman, was a comic delight. I did not see `Analyze This,' so I accept the conventional wisdom that it is a better picture than "Analyze That." Nevertheless, there is enough wonderfully funny stuff in this cleverly written and well-acted piece of fluff to cause me to recommend it unhesitatingly. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you found "Analyze This" a little too slow-going for your tastes, you'll probably enjoy the sequel more. Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro) has been released from prison, apparently due to a nervous breakdown and several attempts on his life, and is now living temporarily in the home of his psychiatrist Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal). It turns out the nervous breakdown was all a sham, and soon Vitti is on the run from the hitmen of a rival mob boss. After trying unsuccessfully to keep several different jobs, Vitti is hired to be the acting coach to an Australian actor (Anthony LaPaglia), who plays an Italian-American gangster on a TV show. Soon all of Vitti's friends are stars on the show and Vitti himself is planning one last big heist before his retirement. Sobel gets caught up in the middle of it all, making for some hilarious misadventures. There are several amusing fantasy sequences in which Vitti flashes back to his childhood, before it all went apart when his father was murdered.It's a comedy you can't refuse.</fullReview>

He once again has proven that he is a great actor who can play perfectly in any kind of movie no matter what the genre is.

		<shortDescription>The funniest movie of 2002!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anybody were to be prejudice about this movie, it should be me. I loved "Analyze This"! And knowing how sequels tend to have bad track records, I should expect much less from "Analyze That." That slowly happened after hearing all the bad word-of-mouth and reading all the terrible and sub-par reviews, but when I finally saw it (about 7 or 8 weeks after it was released) I was pleasantly surprised! This is not a funny movie; THIS IS HILARIOUS!! The first 45 minutes or so got me laughing so hard my throat was almost sore. The rest of the movie is also a riot, but I think I was trying too hard to catch my breath from laughing. There are some classic gags, only some of which I will give away. One of my favorites is the scene in which DeNiro is having sex with his hooker girlfriend and Billy Crystal and wife Lisa Kudrow are annoyed by the noise they're making. Crystal confronts DeNiro about the noise and says, "What's wrong with you? I take you in, I give you a homecooked meal." DeNiro sarcastically responds, "A homecooked meal. Yeah, that's what I've been j**king off to the last 3 years in prison." (making a masturbation gesture) "Ohhhhh, tuna casserole!" And you must stay for the outtakes of that scene at the end of the movie. The scene where DeNiro takes a stab at being a used car salesman is also classic. The husband and wife customers ask to speak to the manager. He grabs his crotch and says, "You wanna speak to the manager? Here's the f**king manager." Another one of my favorite gags is when Crystal is at a strip club, and a scantily clad stripper is in his face. All he has is a 20-dollar bill, so he tells the stripper, "All I got is a 20? Do you have change?" Afterwards, he stuffs a handful of coins down her g-string and says, "That's my change for the meter." Now based on these three gags, does it sound unappealing? To be fair, I didn't see a hell of a lot of comedies this year, so when I regard this as the funniest of the year, you could take it with a grain of salt, but I don't often get this many belly laughs from a film. Usually I get either a lot of chuckles, a lot of chuckles and a few belly laughs, or simply a lot of regular laughs. But not often do I receive this many "belly laughs." I love Joe Viterelli as Jelly, and it's true that he could've been used more (even Billy Crystal didn't have as big a role as I expected), but DeNiro alone was a comic tour-de-force. And like in the original, he plays the scenes straight and not for the laughs. He really does seem like an angry, cranky mobster. I'm sure I'm part of a minority in saying that I liked "Analyze That" even the better than the original and found it to be totally hilarious, but that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopefully No More Analyzing After This.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another ho-hum sequel which followed a ho-hum predecessor. "Analyze That" picks up with mob boss Robert DeNiro in jail, but an attempt on his life means that he must get out with help of nervous psychiatrist Billy Crystal. The plan succeeds of course and now DeNiro is free and trying to figure out which crime family may be after him. DeNiro also tries to go straight, but the itch to be a criminal may be much too great for him. "Analyze That" is basically the same thing as "Analyze This", but with slight variations. The film is full of unsavory dialogue and situations that just do not feel right in a production that is trying to go for laughs. DeNiro and Crystal working together is still interesting, but far from riveting. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an avid DeNiro fan, I was anxious to see this film on the big screen. Needless to say, that conglomerate's hand is ever-present in this sequal, and unfortunately the excellent performances from Robert DeNiro, Billy Crystal, and even a surprising representation from Lisa Kudrow...are all but underplayed due to seriously bad editing. The off screen personas of such big stars should not be ignored, in fact. the star power should not only be acknowledged, but also played up against each other. With simply modifying the final cut, with longer takes...perhaps even holding longer on classic expressions that only DeNiro can portray....perhaps this film would have survived being a victim of it's under-scored parody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A poor sequel (to a pretty lightweight predecessor). It's a narrative collection of sketch-style moments.Robert de Niro is the most watchable. Even in this comic-caper fare he manages to be genuinely menacing. However, one man recycling old tropes whilst having a ball as the grandstanding 'villain' does not a movie make.Billy Crystal plays himself. Lisa Kudrow plays a parody of his put upon wife from the first film. This is as nothing to the complete lack of a story. All we have to go on is a rough ultimatum drawn up by the FBI about how long de Niro's mafia boss must stay under Crystal's shrink-roof. It doesn't deal - like the first - with whether a leopard can change its spots. It's Hollywood big guns on a slow morning. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was very disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Rating: ** out of ****. Analyze This was an enjoyable, funny comedy. I was not really sure what to expect from this sequel because I actually thought it took a little too long to get into theaters. I must say I was very disappointed.Analyze That was an incredibly dull film. Its not to say the film is not funny but its script is more than a step down from the first one. Instead there are only a few laughs that are not even that memorable. I did not even find the film that entertaining, it was mostly boring.In Analyze This, Robert De Niro proved he could poke fun at his past gangster roles and did a great job. He completely upstaged everyone, even Crystal who is a comedic actor. Not much has changed, De Niro upstages everyone. However, this performance is not De Niro in top form. De Niro is good here but he lacks the energy he had in the first movie.There are also two very disappointing performances. Billy Crystal has been on a decline for a while and his performance here does not help him. He is unfunny and boring. The real depressing performance is Cathy Moriarity. She is really underused and doesnt make much of her scenes but its more than that. She and De Niro have been together before (Raging Bull, anyone) and its really said to see them appearing together in this mediocre film.Analyze That is not be a complete waste of time. However, thats the best I can say here. Its underwhelming and boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whew, this is a bad film - one of those sequels that never should have been conceived, let alone actually put on celluloid. The plot (if you can call it that) is ridiculous at best, and the chemistry between Crystal and DeNiro (which was even strained a big in the original) is hanging on by a dreary thread here. It's like they both realize they're in a over-cooked turkey and they're gonna do the best they can with it since it is Thanksgiving, after all. The out-takes, which run over the ending credits, are very funny, so I was thinking maybe a film called Analyze These might be a good idea - where they show 75-90 minutes' worth of Analyze This and That out-takes as an actual movie. (I just think if I'm gonna say the plot sucked I should at least offer something in the way of constructive criticism.)</fullReview>

It's not as bad as all the critics say, and it's very disappointing. 2002 was obviously not a good year for De Niro, who did Showtime, City By the Sea and this (all three bombed).

		<fullReview>What's wrong with film studios these days? They come out with something as witty and funny as Analyze This, and sabotage our memory of that original movie with something as obvious and obnoxious as this Analize That.In reading the credits, I almost fainted after seeing that the characters were written by Kenneth Lonergan, one of our best playwrights and by Peter Tolan, a good screen writer. Well, they both missed the target big time. It must be a cause for embarrassment for all the talent involved.With the exception of the opening scenes and up to the point that Paul Vitti comes to the home of Dr. Ben Sobel, it showed great promise. But from there on the whole thing falls so flat that you hardly hear any laughter in the theatre. The subplot of the TV serial, not unlike The Sopranos, is very badly presented and executed. Anthony LaPaglia who is one of the best screen actors around comes out as such an idiot that we kept wondering who advised him in taking this role. For that matter, who sold the idea to the great Robert Deniro, or someone of the stature of Billy Chrystal to repeat their original roles in this loser?Thank goodness that Lisa Kudrow doesn't have much to do, she can't do much damage here. Cathy Moriarty comes out better as the Mafia Mamma, but she's an actress that can do no wrong. The rest of the cast is forgettable.Sorry Mr. Ramis, better luck next time.</fullReview>

A pretty tame film that tries to draw laughs from getting the straight laced Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) mixed up in the "Mobs" business as he seems to be trying to help someone, that he also knows doesn't need the help. The situations were ridiculous, and unrealistic, which would be ok if it were a hilarious "screw-ball" comedy, but it falls way short on the comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yep, it streaks with bumpy and rough romps for raunchy laughs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel of the 1999 mob comedy "Analyze This" has plenty to keep the viewers laughing, bemused, and sometimes shocked. It's no longer a tale of a sweet psychiatrist keeping a mafia don sober. On the contrary, it's the gangster who's showing his shrink the reality of the tough side to every human soul. Guess who's expected to be lying on the psychiatric couch? Yep, this film offers a fun ride to the psychology of the shrink! And it makes no apologies for pumping up enough guffaws to keep one's throat sore. It may not be the comedy for the puritanical grandmas and grand-papas, but face it, it's gangland - foul-mouthed, and rude gestures, vulgarities, et. al. Yep, Director Harold Ramis can't be accused of not injecting new flavor and spice to this sequel's characters! Nope, there's no way one can complain that it has the same old jokes. De Niro and Billy Crystal, and a cast of amusing actors are offering a new outlook on mob life and it's influence. There are demons lurking in every mind; there is the identity crisis to consider - even with the good, old professional folks.Just observe Paul Vitti's 'manic-catatonic' stupor. I don't mind paying the regular price of a tix just to watch De Niro's facial expressions. I'm not sure whether you'd ever listen to 'West Side Story' without a smile, after watching this flick. Concentrate on how Dr. Ben Sobel entices him to respond to the psychiatric tests. The are great moments in this film. This comedy does work with the characters' new images. This is one hoity-toity hokum - out to spin laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analyze That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first gangster comedy film was a surprising success, and they tried to create the same thing again with this sequel, from director Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Bedazzled). Basically Paul Vitti (Robert De Niro) is in prison following the events of the last film, and he seems do be cracking under the pressure, and he is fearing death. So naturally the one to called in to help him out is the psychiatrist and analyst he last saw, Dr. Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) who has just lost his father. Paul appears to be catatonic when Ben visits him, but once they are are out of prison and the former gangster is Ben's responsibility, he shows he was faking. Paul is eager to both open up about his feelings once again, and try to find something to do to open up, make something of himself and feel good. He may in fact though be planning some big scheme, even when he finds a good job assisting the scriptwriter of a successful gangster drama show. Ben's wife Laura (Lisa Kudrow) is obviously not happy about the former gangster being Ben's responsibility, she would be even more unhappy if she knew their son Michael (Kyle Sabihy) was his driver. Of course it comes to the time when there is a big job, Paul has planned a robbery of a truck filled with gold bullion, and it seems to go reasonably well, up to the point when the police show up, and it is all part of the gangster show! In the end, the big crime family that the police wanted get caught, and Ben and Paul part ways as friends and singing a show tune from West Side Story. Also starring Joe Viterelli as Jelly, Reg Rogers as Raoul Berman, Cathy Moriarty as Patti LoPresti, John Finn as Richard Chapin and Callie Thorne as Agent Cerrone. Crystal is still great as the pressured, humiliated and embarrassed doctor, and De Niro is still good as the fast talking, rude and emotionally damaged crime lord. The film has its great comedic moments, but that is all it has, moments, it does not have the same dynamic the original had, but it is an alright crime comedy sequel. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>De Niro plays great again in Analyze That. At the beginning of this movie, you'll see that he pretend as a crazy people in a jail. We know that he always doing good in acting. Like Awakenings, he doing good again on this movie.But, I guess it would be better if you watch the prequel, Analyze This, before you watch Analyze That. I don't know surely how it works. Maybe these movies can watch separately.I've ever watch Analyze That before, and I'm not enjoying as much as I'm doing that: watch the prequel before. I think the most important thing to understand is the relationship between Ben Sobel (Billy Crystal) and Paul Vitti (De Niro). It must be explained -- how it can be so close in this movie. The explanation you can find in the prequel.The "connections" with Godfather is not as much as in the prequel. But, the story was the same. It was about mafia. And it's about psychology, too. I think the movie was funny.And, surprise... you'll find Al Pacino on this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can this get even better the second time. The answer is no, but close to the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Niro and Crystal are at it again. When I first heard they were making a sequel to Analyze This, I thought it would be impossible. The end of This didn't exactly spell sequel in my ears. Vitti was in good mental health he was finally rid of his gangland cronies. But the director made a decision to totally change Vitti's personality in the sequel or at least he made it as it was in the beginning of This. Yes, I know this is a comedy and you shouldn't get hung up on logic in these films but it seems strange that Vitti likes being a criminal in That all of a sudden, although I don't remember him actually participating in the robbery of That.One of the pleasures of This was also Billy Crystal's performance, but here he has been reduced to playing a anxiety plagued crybaby. De Niro could pull it off in This, but Crystal seems to think that popping pills and hyperventilating makes great comedy. It is more like watching a person who needs to go to the bathroom for eternity than funny. They also made a mistake of reducing Jelly's part to make room for Cathy Moriarty. Yes, we know De Niro and she was co-stars in Raging Bull but what purpose has her character here. She is basically just there to show that this time she is the boss of De Niro where as in RB she was abused by him. The other character I hate is the "Yeah, what" man. He is so utterly stupid, that he thinks that looking like a deceased ape makes you a tough guy. The one new positive thing about this movie is the setup at the TV studio where De Niro acts as a consultant on a Sopranos style show. It's great to see Anthony LaPaglia playing an Italian Aussie playing an Italian-American. It's a great in-joke. He is also one of the few supporting players who doesn't seem intimidated by De Niro.There are lots more points to make why this film doesn't live up to the original but to put it simply - this isn't really a sequel but more of a revision of the first movie and on that note it almost succeeds. It does have laughs, especially in the first half hour and De Niro is in good form. Here's to hoping that Meet the Fockers will be better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mafia blues 2: the relapse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harold Ramis seems to have found his bearings in American comedy through the repetition. In Groundhog Day (1993), he condemned Bill Murray to live the same day over and over again. In "Multiplicity" (1996), he gave Michael Keaton the opportunity to clone himself in four different characters. Here, for the third time in his career, the repetition strikes again. "Analyze This" was a big success in 1999 and a sequel was likely to be awaited. But this follow-up mainly obeys to a commercial logic. Quite obviously, Ramis wanted to use the recipes again that made the success of the first movie. As we say: it's always the same old people... for a rather unexciting film! I watched "Analyze This" during a flight for Canada in 1999 and I thought it wasn't too bad but not memorable. What did I think of "Analyze That"? I quite hated it. The duo Robert De Niro/Billy Crystal is rather exhilarating and their scathing confrontations are running well. Besides, the director offers De Niro the opportunity to make fun of the type of character he acted in "The Godfather" (1972) or "Goodfellas" (1990). On another hand, it is true that the movie takes off in the moments when the two protagonists are in identity crisis. For the rest, sorry Mr Ramis but I can't accept so much vulgarity in the dialogs, so much ponderousness in the style and so much inconsistence in the screenplay (it is difficult to imagine De Niro looking for a job on Crystal's advice because he acts a character with a limited IQ). Moreover, the plot (if there is one!) tends to fray and as soon as De Niro is hired as an adviser in dialogs for a television series, the rest of the film is just padding, notably when we arrive at the stickup sequence. Be that as it may, if you liked the first movie very much, "Analyze That" will please you. As for the others, to approach with caution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro stoop to some pretty raunchy physical comedy and non-stop vulgar language in "Analyze That," this Busman's Holiday cash cow film. Not as clever as the original, it still has funny moments when the two engage in exchanges that must have required many takes as the actors struggled not to laugh (the out-takes during the credits confirm this).It's basically the same story: Crystal, a psychiatrist, aids De Niro, an aging but still-in-the-game mob don, to elude assassins and the law. Crystal's hapless routine is familiar but he pulls it off because he is very funny. De Niro takes time off from films where he really hurts people to be a lovable capo.Lisa Kudrow is also pretty good in her limited role as Crystal's spouse.So we have: mob gags, Jewish jokes, enough sexual references for any movie and some familiar action shots.The most amusing part of the film, at the beginning and end, is the hijacking of Leonard Bernstein's "West Side Story" score - you ain't never heard "Tonight" and "Somewhere" performed like this. Lenny would have split a gut string laughing.Joe Viterelli appears again as "Jelly." When will they stop casting him solely as a "made man" and recognize that he may well be, potentially, one of America's greatest serious actors?My thirteen-year-old said it was "the worst movie I've seen in months." And he's often a sharper critic than I am so all are forewarned.5/10.</fullReview>

If he wanted to stick with a franchise or follow up film, why didn't he just wait and do meet 'The Fochers'? Anyway, I did not find it worth my money's worth and I wouldn't revisit it and do it again if I had the chance to go back in time. My advice, don't waste your time.

		<fullReview>The last time I saw Robert De Niro and Katherine Moriarty (now Moriarty-Gentile) in the same film was Raging Bull. What a come down for both of them. What a come down in film for all of us. It used to be that bad movies were bad usually because they weren't professional enough. Today movies are bad because they are too professional. Analyze That is just TV-sitcom hyperconcentrate, a non-nutritious slurpy extruded by that great big Media Machine In The Sky, AOL-Time-Warner (a triple conglomerate [ignoring the numerous smaller companies absorbed by the three]). It takes less than 10% of one's brain to follow this totally improbable piece of sh-te. But, hey, the movie is politically correct; it's empowering: It made me feel that I too, like Billy Crystal, could rise up out of my drab, cowardly, neurotic existence to participate in the sexy, violent glamour of the NY Families and punch a Wise Guy in the mouth.</fullReview>

DeNiro, one of my all-time favorite actors, has made several cheesy films in the last few years. Any of the charm of the last film is gone. Watching him "fake" being insane, singing "I feel pretty" is just plain painful.The first film was light, simple and fun. The second has not one redeeming quality.Please, save yourself, do NOT watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only managed to see about a third of the movie I'm told. All right I was sleepy and tired to begin with so I fell asleep, but I deliberately wanted to after about thirty minutes or so of this movie. It was totally awful. I can't quite figure out why, but the characters were irritating, the script seemed stale and bland. The acting seemed force and not really heart-felt. This was one of the worst movies I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Analyze This was a perfect comedy vehicle for both Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. And it is understandable why the pair wanted to go for another shot. A funny, sharp comedy with interesting characters, and, from all accounts, a fun set too.But this just proved that the story of a mobster and a shrink was a one-movie joke. And even when the out-takes can only raise a smile, you know you are in trouble.If you want the laughs, get the original, but don't expect to find many here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rank bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film in this series -- Analyze This -- was quite witty and well done, and was a reasonably funny parody of many mob films and cliches.This sequel, however, is rank bad and unfunny throughout. Billy Crystal can really get on your nerves with his brand of "funny man-ness" and he was certainly doing that.When the funniest part of a comedy is the out takes at the end you have a problem as a film maker. And those were only funny because DeNiro is still a genius. If he makes anyy more of these films, he's going to lose that status.It sucks. Don't see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a terrible waste of time and money! I really wish I had checked this movie out on this site before I bothered to see it. I would have walked out except with the actors they had I was sure if I gave it enough time it would get better - Wrong!!! The two main actors should be ashamed of themselves for being involved in such trash. There was an excellent story-line but it was destroyed by vulgarity, crudity and swearing. Come on fellas - you could have had a great success here but you blew it! I want my money back!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harold Ramis: Analyze Yourself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the first movie (Analyze This), but after seeing this movie only one thing comes into my mind: This movie should have never be done in the first place.I saw this movie with more people, but no one gave a good comment on the movie, no one laugh more than 1 or 2 times.The plot is hardly sustainable, acting was below average. The jokes were never funny (Even the one about Robert De Niro, told by himself).Instead of laughs through the movie I almost started to cry when the credits started to roll and that was only due to the waste of money and time this movie was for me.Recommendation: AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

		<shortDescription>This is why sequels have such a bad reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So...No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proved right.Analyze That illustrates perfectly why 'sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time.So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the original again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just bought a disc player and went to the bargain bin for a cheap video to test the installation with (oh, yeah I'm that retro).Well it served its purpose, and learning how to watch it in French with English subtitles was amusing for 2 minutes. In retrospect, I strongly regretted not choosing the cheesy cartoon version of Ben Hur instead.I suppose it is someone's idea of entertainment, but not mine. I'll be heading for the internet to order a copy of the Jack Benny Nazi farce "To Be or Not to Be" directed by Lubitsch.I think that's inane nonsense too. But entertaining at least.For those who think Mafia humor is intrinsically funny stuff, well OK, that's your bag. Frankly, I believe about any movie you could pick at random in the whole list available on this site would be at least as good.Wait until you see it on free TV at least (and if you can stand to get through it), before you spend more than $0.25 on it.</fullReview>
