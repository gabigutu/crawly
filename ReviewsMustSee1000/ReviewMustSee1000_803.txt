		<fullReview>Recipient of the prestigious Palme d'Or award at Cannes, David Lynch's "Wild at Heart" is an amazingly brilliant spectacle for the senses. Bold splashes of deep red, curiously staged musical numbers (Nicolas Cage does his own singing ? and he's great!), and the continuous references to "The Wizard of Oz" help create a surreal and dreamlike texture to the narrative. The story in brief: Sailor and Lula (excellent performances from both Nicolas Cage &amp; Laura Dern); two broken souls passionately in love, flee the vengeful wrath of Lula's mother Marietta, who for reasons of her own will stop at nothing to ensure the lovers are kept apart. Diane Ladd practically steals the show in her brave portrayal of Lula's psychopathic mother Marietta. Gut wrenchingly violent in places, hopelessly romantic in others; Lynch has crafted an adult fairy tale worthy of multiple viewings. Recommended to those who enjoy and appreciate abstract methods of film-making ? a definite 10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In A Word: Outrageous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outrageous! This is another sick-but-fascinating David Lynch film, maybe his sickest, although I've never seen Eraserhead. The most interesting feature of this strange movie, I think, was the weird characters, one after the other. Make that ultra-weird.....and the strangest of them all is "Bobby Peru," played by Willem Dafoe. In all my years of movie watching, I think "Bobby Peru" still has to rank in the top five of the creepiest characters. He is so outrageously disgusting and perverted you just have to laugh out loud at him.In fact, "outrageous" might be the best word to describe this film, characters and all.This wild and entertaining film sometimes makes me shake my head in disgust that I own it, and at other times makes me just laugh out loud at the absurdity of it. You really have to have a dark sense of humor to appreciate much of it. I do, to some degree....enough to keep viewing this.Nicholas Cage is particularly fun to watch and provides most of the laughs. Laura Dern is also convincing as a trailer-trash-type. If you want a clue on why Dern would play such a sleazy role, check out her real-life mom in this film, Diane Ladd, who plays her mother in the movie. It looks like Mom passed on her wholesome values.As with some other Lynch films, the music is outstanding: just a great soundtrack. I bought the CD to this a year after first seeing the movie, and I've always enjoyed it. And, another Lynch trait that certainly is here is the excellent visual style, which is enhanced by the widescreen DVD.So, if you are looking for an outrageous two hours and you aren't easily shocked or offended, this would be a film to consider.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This whole world is Wild at Heart and crazy on top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at Heart begins with an arresting scene of bloody violence by one of the two lead characters, Sailor Ripley, and this immediately grabs our attention. After this he hooks up with his lover, Lula, who he fiercely protects, and goes on a bizarre road trip into the deep south of the states, while avoiding Lula's mother, played with passion by a deservedly Oscar-nominated Diane Ladd, who has an obsessive hatred for Sailor. They meet an assortment of weird people, especially Bobby Peru, and also Perdita Durango, who has appeared recently in a film with her name as the title, also written by Barry Gifford. It is classic David Lynch, with a homage type theme to the Wizard of Oz. It has the sensuality and eroticism later seen in Lost Highway, the violence and gore, the head sequence after the bank robbery being graphic, and a general uneasiness throughout. But it is a darkly humorous and transfixing piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch on the road to hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most creative and controversial director in cinema is back with a road-movie! Wild at Heart is one rough roller coaster ride and a typical Lynch-cocktail of violence, sex and of course?bizarre characters. I challenge you to find one personality in this film that could be referred to as a ?normal human being'. As usually, Lynch introduces a bunch of wicked individuals in his film who're all messed up in the head pretty bad. Yet, I feel like Wild at Heart might be Lynch's most accessible film (outside The Elephant Man and The Straight Story). The structure remains chronological and quite easy to follow. Unlike the previous Blue Velvet, I feel like the plot and development of Wild at Heart is a bit inferior to the wonderful photography. The greatest aspects in the screenplay are in fact the delicious side-chapters that are told without absolute necessity. Like the story about Lula's cousin Dell (Crispin Glover), the torture of Harry Dean Stanton's character and the nasty and disturbing images of a car accident the protagonists come across. These are the little sequences that truly prove Lynch's talent as a storyteller. Overall and simply put: this movie is COOL! It's a joy to watch and you really hate to love some of the offensive characters. Willem Dafoe takes the cake as Bobby Peru. His portrayal is a neat follow-up to Blue Velvet's Frank Booth. Peru is a filthy and despicable pervert with itchy-trigger-fingers! It's a damn shame he hasn't got any more screen time. Wild at Heart surely isn't the greatest masterpiece out there, but you should love it for what it is: an absurd and entertaining adventure with a couple of thought-provoking values and an extraordinary love-lesson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, violent, funny and surreal--a masterpiece from David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite David Lynch films. It is also one of the more transparent, easy to understand Lynch films, although that's not the reason why it's one of my favorites. But that fact also makes Wild at Heart a good candidate for introducing someone to Lynch.On the other hand, although it's more transparent and linear on a surface level, I'm still not sure I've figured out the multilayered, bizarre subtexts and symbolism that lie deep beneath the surface--even though I've seen it a few times now. Assuming that there is indeed something to figure out. To an extent, it seems like maybe the hint of something "deeper" is in this case more of a red herring. This is one of Lynch's funnier films, albeit very macabre humor. It contains references to all of Lynch's most common "content quirks"?including sequined ingénues singing jazz, manipulative housewife types, shots of asphalt speeding by, minor characters with freaky speech "impediments", severed body parts, and on and on--but it's almost as if he's making fun of himself. Combine that with excellent performances (including a hilarious bit part for Crispin Glover, one of my favorite actors/personalities), a sublimely incongruous score, and a retro, gripping, violent road trip saga cum romance that presages both Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994) and just about all of Quentin Tarantino's career, and you've got quite a film.Wild at Heart, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, is the tale of Sailor (Nicolas Cage) and Lula (Laura Dern), a doe-eyed, "classy white trash" couple. As the film starts--and what a start it is--someone tries to stab Sailor to death as he's exiting a theater. Sailor will have none of it, and Lynch begins the film on an exhilarating, brutally violent note--this is not a film for the faint of heart. To complicate matters and set up the primary conflict, we learn even before the attempted stabbing that the hit man was sent by Lula's mother, Marietta Fortune (Diane Ladd), who claimed that Sailor tried to seduce her in the bathroom (this isn't quite true, as we learn in detail later).There isn't a character in the film who isn't involved with some shady business, either presently or in the past. Sailor and Marietta's tensions stem from many years ago, when Lula was just a girl (she's supposedly quite a bit younger than Sailor). The events of the film's opening result in Sailor being imprisoned. Lula dutifully waits for his release, much to the consternation of her mom. The basic gist of the film is disarmingly simple--Sailor and Lula are headed across the country, with an eventual goal of California, as Marietta tries to arrange for Sailor to be put away for good. There are many finely realized subplots and detailed tangents, but that's the crux of the plot on the surface.In addition to his typical hyperreal/surreal weirdness, Lynch concocts a very improbable stew of influences that work together beautifully. Lula has something of an obsession with The Wizard of Oz (1939). She's haunted by visions of the wicked witch (including the "evil cackle"), and she sees the road trip as a veritable journey to the Emerald City. Lynch works in a lot of subtle references to The Wizard of Oz with other characters, too. Sailor is something like lounge version of Elvis reincarnated as a gangster flunky, with even better karate moves to match. Yet the two are huge heavy metal fans, especially of a band named "Powermad", whose music exquisitely punctuates many sequences, including some sublime dance scenes. In the first half, important scenes are set in New Orleans, with the familiar unsettling undertone that that locale often has in films--you can just smell the voodoo, sex, drugs and death bubbling beneath the skin of the city. Later scenes are set in the desolate, desert prairie country of Texas, which turns out to be even more unsettling (even though I really find such places refreshing and relaxing). There are other kinds of symbolic, stylistic and literal references worked into the film, such as the constant fire motif, which Lynch shoots beautifully, but the above is to just give you an idea of the stew.It all seems like it should add up to some subtextual grand narrative, and maybe it does, but I haven't quite figured out what it all means yet. But it doesn't matter. The stylistic flourishes are ingenious superficially, too, and maybe Lynch _is_ just poking fun at being Lynch. Here, perhaps more than in any other work, he has found the perfect balance between the soap-operatic and the utterly bizarre--the filmic equivalent to author Harry Crews' best work.Tarantino doesn't tend to have pithy subtexts in his films, either, but they're no worse the wear for that, and when Wild at Heart takes a turn into typical Tarantino territory, Lynch is just as captivating, gritty and groovy, plus he's doing it before Tarantino himself. At the same time, Lynch manages to maintain a parallel lush, erotic romance between Sailor and Lula--Dern is incredibly sexy/sensuous here. This material works as well, and supplies what just may be the message of the film after all--that love can (eventually) conquer all, even the stuff that's "wild at heart and weird on top".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Languorous violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Lynch wants to say something he takes his time, no doubt about it. Sometimes he takes his time even when he doesn't have much to say. Example?Isabella Rosselini in torn stocking, shabby wig, and red shoes is swaying gently to some music when Willem DaFoe crashes in and gives her a vigorous smooch. That's the beginning and the end of the scene. Another example? Cage and Laura Dern are having an argument just after he's let out of the slams. She's nervous and upset because she hasn't seen him in six years. He looks at her intently and tells her it's a mistake for them to get back together again. There is about a twenty-second closeup of Dern's magnificent blue eyes. They don't drip with tears. They don't even blink. They stare directly into the camera. Why? Like you, I'd have to guess. (I'd guess that her unblinking, unteary stare is meant to tell us that she sees things pretty clearly despite being shaken. That's pretty banal, I know, but my mind is open to other interpretations.)I don't mean to sound as if I'm bashing the movie because that's not what I mean to do. Let's linger a little over a much later scene. It takes place in the middle of a city street, El Paso I would guess, but it's one of those industrial-area streets that are deserted on weekends. It's a wide sun-baked silent street cluttered with drunken-looking telephone poles and lined with one-story factories and warehouses, and there is a city skyline way in the distant, cerulean with urban haze. And Cage is walking alone through this bleak and ominous landscape. But it's not only the visuals that makes this scene outstanding. A handful of viperous dudes wearing black fall in behind Cage's figure and another group of Thugees finally blocks his way in mid-street. The music comes to an abrupt halt. Nobody says anything. The atmosphere throbs with threat. Cage sets down his suitcase, takes the time to deliberately light a cigarette, looks around him, and asks, "Okay -- what do you faggots want?" What they want is to beat the hell out of him, and they get their wish. The unconscious Cage has a vision of The Nice Witch of the West (don't ask) and when he recovers he finds he's still surrounded by these sadistic brutes who ask him if he's had enough. He struggles to his feet, gingerly feeling his "broken" rubber nose, and says, "Yes, I've had enough. Furthermore, I'd like to apologize for referring to you dudes earlier as homosexuals. You've taught me a lesson." Then he runs away ecstatically. How many other movies can boast ten minutes worth of film like that?Now, I can see where a lot of ten-year-olds (or ten-year-old minds) might be bored with this film. It's long. There isn't an abundance of violence, although DaFoe does get his head blown off by twin blasts from a shotgun. I mean, quite literally, his head is blown completely off. It bounces off the wall like a football and lands with a loud splat on the pavement. So maybe there's a little hope for the horror afficionados after all, but not much, when you get right down to it.The movie is punctuated with violence and, even more, with oddities, but mostly it moves languorously. Cage and Dern thrum through the Texas night in a shiny old convertible whose radio plays nothing but news like, "A man won his appeal today for dismissal of charges that he ate his own child." Well -- not that, but equally weird. One relative of Dern gets his kicks by putting a cockroach directly on his nether orifice. Willem DaFoe should definitely sue his dental surgeon. He thrusts his mouth close to Dern's at one point, urging her to say something filthy to him and he'll let her go, and his mouth is like a limpet's, his lips a disgusting circle of membrane filled with hideous teeth.I wouldn't argue that "Wild at Heart" should be put into a time capsule, but it's not a movie that's easy to forget. David Lynch may or may not be a hot commercial property but he's one of the most original directors working today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A symbol of Lynch's individuality and personal freedom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at Heart is probably the most conventional David Lynch film I've seen. That being said, it still remains very far from mainstream. Wild at Heart revolved around a young couple, played to perfection by Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. Fast paced, mostly ridiculous, and pretty unrealistic, Wild at Heart is far from perfect, but a very fun film to watch.The premise is strange, but intriguing. A young couple is separated when the guy, an Elvis fanatic named Sailor (Nicolas Cage), goes to prison for manslaughter after defending himself against a man who threatened him. When he gets out, he is desperate to get Lula (Laura Dern), the girl he loves, back again. Lula is more than willing to pick up the relationship, but if her mother has anything to do with it, she won't have a chance. Being young and in love, the girl rebels. However, her mother's desperation leads her to contact a hit-man she is in knows and the young couple is forced to run away. The two lovebirds head to California and encounter all sorts of crazy situations along the way.Arguably the best thing about Wild at Heart is its great cast. Nicolas Cage is in his prime here and the role is, somewhat, reminiscent of the "repeat offender" he played in Raising Arizona. Nicolas Cage was great in his pre-action-hero movies. Laura Dern is equally excellent. I'd never understood the reason for her popularity in sexy roles. It's effective here, though, and she embodies sweet yet trashy Lula wonderfully. Supporting performances by Willem Defoe, Harry Dean Stanton, and Diane Ladd also provide liveliness that enhances the film.Although it deals with such serious subjects as murder, incest, and general family dysfunction, Wild at Heart is anything but serious. The film is chocked full of amusing moments and over the top clichés. The best example of this is the presence of a rich, older crime boss with a penchant for having young ? preferably naked ? young girls surrounding him at all times he's present. There are a few moments when the style gets repetitive and the characters do something worthy of much eye-rolling. Despite that, this movie is never boring and fairly unpredictable.Wild at Heart is a fun adventure to hitch a ride on. It is full of energy and snappy dialogue. Unlike most Lynch films, it is very linear and straight forward. The acting is excellent and the characters are strangely likable. Wild at Heart feels a little long and drags in a few places toward the end, but this barely hinders the film in its entirety. This is an amusing film, one that would make a good introduction to Lynch for those unfamiliar. For the rest of us, it's simply an enjoyable piece of film-making.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surreal, Nightmarish Road trip that's Wild at Heart and Weird on Top!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild at Heart" is one deranged and twisted road trip as only David Lynch could bring you. It's so dark but at times funny too. Lula (Laura Dern) and Sailor (Nicholas Cage)are in love, but Lula's mother played by Laura Dern's real life mother Diane Ladd is evil. She doesn't want to see them together. Because of a murder, Sailor is finally released from prison. Lula's mom hires people to kill sailor. So Lula and Sailor go on a crazy road trip with dark and fellini like characters. William Defoe is unforgettable as the creepy and perverted Bobby Peru. The film almost received an X/NC-17 rating. It's easy to see why, it has lots of disturbing sex and violence. But than again that's a David Lynch trademark. This film is probably on my list of favorite road trip movies, next to Godard's "Weekend" (1967), "Thelma &amp; Louise" and "Natural Born Killers". Both Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern give amazing performances. Dern's character Lula is the complete opposite of Sandy in "Blue Velvet", cause she's so wild and sexual. But Lula still has a naive child like charm. It seems that actor Nicholas Cage was born to play Sailor, a charming Elvis like ex convict who wants to change his ways. Also check out Berry Gifford's sequel to Wild at Heart, "Perdita Durango" (aka. dance with the devil) These films are both Wild at Heart and weird on Top!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inventive, bleak romance drama has power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A real stimulatingly offbeat exhibition from Lynch is the dark and wild backdrop of a romantically engaged traveling pair: "Sailor" who is on parole after committing a brutal murder, and "Lula" whose mother demands her to return from a spoiled trip to Texas with help from a detective. It's a twisted, artsy journey that is often repulsive and long to boot (and certainly not for the squeamish!), but fares inventive at a certain degree and boasts some of the strongest performances ever worked on a Lynch film, perhaps even in 1990. Cage's concert act and the magically rendered semi-ending are two classic acclaims put together in this moving cinematic collage. RATING: * * *</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stark trip into the heart of the weird and not so wonderful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's true to say that Wild At Heart is perhaps one of David Lynch's more-flawed cinematic endeavours, with many of the scenes and indeed, the film as a whole, seeming incomplete or lacking any real purpose. One criticism of the film that tends to crop up most often is that the whole thing smacks of "weirdness for weirdness sake", with Lynch failing to tie his strange characters and their surreal situations to any kind of real narrative, which, I suppose, is true. However, despite these flaws, the film is still a great deal of fun, and although the whole thing is ultimately very silly, it still has enough bizarre high-points, set-pieces, sight-gags and cameos to make the whole thing ultimately worthwhile.I suppose the film is best described as a vicious black-comedy, though the emphasis there is on 'vicious'. Lynch also makes allusions to the 'lovers on the run' genre of crime film-making popular in the 60's and 70's, taking it all further into the realms of the bizarre through his own cinematic obsessions (like deformities, arson, small-town Americana, detective fiction, good versus evil, car-accidents, etc), as well as more arcane references to Elvis, voodoo, incest, and the Wizard of Oz. It's a surreal trip, best summed up by the film's repeated mantra "wild at heart, weird on top" with Lynch seemingly revelling in this carnival of grotesques, whores, thugs and criminals, all gathered together in small-town New Mexico under a haze of blood and sex. American film critic Roger Ebert mockingly referred to the film as a "lurid melodrama, soap opera, exploitation put-on, and self-satire", which to me, sums up the film's most successful attributes. The plot takes off from films like Thieves Like Us, Bonnie &amp; Clyde and Badlands, pre-dating Oliver Stone's similarly over-the-top dark-satire, Natural Born Killers, with two star-struck lovers hitting the road in an attempt to escape from the pressures of the modern-world (parole, poverty and an over-bearing mother). Lynch lays on the melodramatic clichés in broad stroke, to the point where all narrative references are to be taken with a pinch of salt... for example, it's not enough for our hero Sailor to be a murdering jail-bird from the wrong-side of the tracks, but he has to have a loving, sex-kitten girlfriend from a well-to-do neighbourhood with over-protective loved-ones. Admittedly, Lynch does subvert this almost saccharine depiction of moral family values by offering a flashback, in which our heroine, Lula, is assaulted by a predatory uncle, while her mother is later revealed to be a drunk, manic-depressive with mafia ties, which again, is all part of the joke.There's also the spirit of the 50's, with Fredrick Elmes' colourful wide-screen cinematography bringing to mind the Technicolor melodrama of Hollywood's golden age, and the films of people like Nicholas Ray, Elia Kazan and Douglas Sirk. There's also the obligatory references to the feckless youth of Brando in The Wild One, or the self-aware pastiche of Coppola's great film Rumble Fish, with the characters here looking and sounding like they've walked out of the pages of a lurid slice of pure pulp fiction. Of course, this is another problem that some viewers have had with the film, with Lynch offering no real characters - as he had done with masterpieces like The Elephant Man and Blue Velvet - and instead relying on arcane ciphers and bizarre caricatured grotesques. Again, this is all part of the fun and not really intended to be taken entirely seriously, with Lynch and his actors keeping the film moving from one out-burst of random surrealism to the next; with a number of humours and/or terrifying iconic performances from this esteemed, though certainly eclectic, cast of characters. The centre of the film, and indeed, the real focus of our attention, is established and sustained well through the relationship between the characters Sailor and Lula, which is developed surprisingly well through the strong and fearless performances of Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. Dern has never looked more stunning in a film as the sensual and unhinged Lula, whilst Cage reminds us of what a strong and intense character actor he used to be in the days before he switched to shallow Hollywood blockbusters. Both actors have a great chemistry with each other, and create a believable relationship in spite of the over-the-top abstractions and dramatic flourishes called for by Lynch's script. Amongst the supporting players, Harry Dean Stanton is a joy as the hound-dog private-investigator Johnny Farragut, who is sent looking for Sailor and Lula by his lover, Lula's mother Marietta Fortune, who is brought vividly to life with a grand-standing over-the-top relish by Dern's real-life mother, Diane Ladd.Add some bizarre cameos from Lynch regulars, like Sherilyn Fenn, Jack Nance, Freddie Jones, Grace Zabriskie, Isabella Rossalini, Sheryl Lee (here continuing the Oz references with her climactic appearance as the good witch), J.E. Freeman, Crispin Glover (in one of the film's most bizarre scenes, as Lula's troubled cousin Dell), and an extended appearance by an unrecognisable Willem Dafoe, who's character Bobby Peru meets one of the most outlandish and overly violent sequences ever witnessed on screen. Certainly this film doesn't quite floor-me with it's madness as it used to when I was 14 or 15 (and would watch this and Blue Velvet pretty much religiously), with Lynch subsequently out-doing himself with the modern masterpiece Mulholland Drive. However, this film is probably more fun, and doesn't take as much concentration to really follow or get into it.Ultimately, the film works depending on how much of Lynch's bizarre creations you can stand; with the film falling somewhere between the darkly-comic satire of Twin Peaks at it's most wittiest and the dark, industrial nightmare of Lost Highway, only with a more linear plot. I still think it's a great deal of fun, and will undoubtedly appeal to die-hard Lynch fans or those with an interest in cult American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So violent, bizarre and mysterious that it actually works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene to Wild At Heart features Nick Cage ferociously beating an assassin to death. Heads are rammed against walls, fists are lunged into guts and what results is a brutally bashed corpse with brains pouring out of it's head. This kind of high-octane violence which is fueled by maniacal characters and deranged intervals creates a fantastic effect. One which has so much impact and so much individuality to it's merit that it turns out to be one hell of a movie.This is simultaneously a thrilling road movie and a revelation of small town, American country folk. The two protagonists, Sailor and Lula (Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern) are so in love with each other that they'd go to extreme lengths not to be separated. Their separation is exactly what Lula's crazed mother wants, as she believes that Sailor is a cold-blooded murderer who is putting her daughter in danger. Her anger is so fierce that the viewer becomes slightly scared by her: her manic fits of rage where she plasters herself in red lipstick; her bizarre paroxysms fueled by numerous cocktails. All of her slight idiosyncrasies and mannerisms well up to create a very intimidating mother. She sends out a hitman to dispose of Sailor and bring back her daughter, but the lovely couple are on the run from her and the law.Sailor and Lula meet up with some very strange characters whilst travelling far away from Lula's mother. The eccentricities of 'Tuna Town' in Texas, the insane car accident victim and Lula's nutcase cousin who believes that "the man with the black glove is coming to get him". It's all rudimentary David Lynch fare. He has mastered the art of contemporary film making: a clever blend of black-comedy, violence and fantasy.The viewer builds an empathy for the two main characters, as it would be a terrible thing to see their undying love for each other shattered. The other characters in the movie all seem to want to destroy that love. Sailor's character, although violent and hardbitten, seems the most normal of the lot. It takes a sane man to make sense of all the insane folk in America's underbelly. He puts up with a lot from everyone, but all he really wants to do is escape from it all with Lula.After all, who can love in a world that's wild at heart?Nine out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I much prefer Blue Velvet, maybe because it was new and shocking and original, whereas here Lynch seems to be copying himself, Nic Cage seems to be doing his faux-Elvis 'look at me all the time" schtick and Laura Dern just seems lost. The camera work is lovely, but to what end? It's kind of an empty story when all is said and done. As Emanuel Levy says in his book Cinema of Outsiders, "the shocks have little resonance, and the weirdness is trivial- the pictures hyperkinetic wildness is mostly on the surface, the images are elaborately conceived but meaningless." </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch attempts to out-Lynch himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at Heart is not without superb elements, but overall, it's a disappointment. Lynch did what has been deadly to so many talented filmmakers - he bought into his own reputation. Wild at Heart is highly self-aware, furiously cranking up the Lynchian stylistic quirks with little awareness of the delicate balance that made former Lynch films great. Blue Velvet did descend into surreal, dark chaos, but it contrasted the depraved weirdness with common decency and compassion. Wild at Heart, on the other hand, is just a heady stew of violence, sex and bizarre happenings - very little here is recognizable as human behavior, and just about nothing as human goodness. If Blue Velvet was guilty of being a little too turned on by its own darkness, Wild at Heart is downright proud of presenting evil in a lurid, gleeful manner.Nevertheless, if all you want from Lynch movies is memorable surrealism, wacky characters and delirious energy, Wild at Heart still offers plenty to savor. Parts of Wild at Heart do possess a mad energy and offbeat humor that is infectious. The performances are also highly entertaining - Nicolas Cage has rarely been better, and Dianne Ladd is hysterically funny in an utterly unhinged performance. But the madness of Wild at Heart all starts to seem too calculated, too soulless, and too ugly. The weirdness of Blue Velvet and Eraserhead almost always seemed organic, like a natural outgrowth of the film - Wild at Heart seems awkwardly scrambled together. Wild at Heart contains flashes of true Lynchian brilliance and a game cast, but they are lost in a nauseating, patchy, sub-par work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch gave us a story of a totally shattered society.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch who was making the famous TV-series Twin Peaks, decided to make a film at the same year, called Wild At Heart. He used his usual crew, for instance Angelo Badalamenti who also composed the music for Twin Peaks. Laura Dern is also well known from Lynch's Blue Velvet (1987) and no one but Laura worked with David Lynch again from this crew. In a documentary "Il était une fois... Sailor et Lula" (2009) most of the people who worked with Wild at Heart told that the project was just so exhausting. Even Lauran Dern said that she was shattered after the film was finished.The movie is very hard to put in a genre (like most Lynch's movies), but I would consider it as a romance/drama/road-movie, since it deals with love and family issues on the road. People who mostly watch mainstream films, would probably find this movie sick and twisted. But for people who watch a lot of movies from Lynch or not, will probably find this very interesting, affecting and entertaining.It's about a criminal, called Sailor (Nicolas Cage) who runs away with her girlfriend Lula (Laura Dern) across the southern states. Lula's mother (Diane Ladd) sends few killers after Sailor to save her daughter. David Lynch has put the world of 1990 into Sailor and Lula's life. What we see in their life is a totally shattered family structure, a shattered society. Among this it deals with death, despair and how crazy all the people have gone.This obviously is a postmodern film and it's surrealism as most of Lynch's movies are. The music is also outstanding, modern and different. As I mentioned Lynch used the same composer (Angelo Badalamenti), that he used with Twin Peaks. But in addition to that, Lynch mixed some old Rock 'N Roll like Elvis with new Heavy Metal, which expressed the rage and frustration of the characters brilliantly.So David Lynch is dealing with reality through surrealism. His world view in this film is dark: the world full of misery, death, violence, hatred and horror. While watching you might think that David Lynch is sick, the whole movie is sick and that's the world view Lynch is showing. We're supposed to feel sick, the world around us is sick."This whole world's wild at heart and weird on top." This is what Lula Fortune said to Sailor Ripley and it's pretty much what this movie is about.I don't know why Wild at Heart has a low rating over here, maybe because of its originality (Not that low, but compared to other Lynch-films). In the documentary I mentioned before, they said that this movie was a flop in the United States but a big success in France. I can clearly see why, the narrative partly reminded me of the French style. And people in Europe are more used to artistic films, I'm not talking about all the people, but generally speaking.8/10 A great postmodern film, which also was Nicolas Cage's best performance. A violent story about the world we live in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wild At Heart" is an entertaining fantasy about a rebellious couple in love who go on the run to escape the troubles and violence which have blighted their lives in the past. On their journey they share passion, danger and conversations about their backgrounds as they get to know each other better. Theirs is a story which is heavily steeped in pop culture as illustrated by the movie's soundtrack, the numerous allusions to "The Wizard Of Oz" and their Elvis and Marilyn personas but it's also a story of hope as they try to escape to a better and more peaceful life together.Sailor Ripley (Nicolas Cage) and Lula Pace Fortune (Laura Dern) are very much in love but Lula's mother Marietta (Diane Ladd) will go to any lengths to keep them apart and so hires a thug to kill Sailor. Sailor kills his assailant in self defence but ends up in prison after being found guilty of manslaughter. On his release, Lula meets him at the gates and in an act which violates the terms of his parole; they decide to run away to California.The extremely determined and completely unhinged Marietta responds to this situation by hiring one of her boyfriends, a private detective called Johnnie Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton) to find the couple and bring Lula home and then later hires another boyfriend Marcellus Santos (J.E.Freeman) to kill Sailor.When the couple reach Big Tuna, Texas, Lula is pregnant and they start to run short of money. Sailor gets to know a criminal called Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe) and then later agrees to carry out a robbery with him. Peru is a reckless psychopath who threatens to rape Lula, unnecessarily shoots two people during the robbery and also sets Sailor up to be killed because he'd been hired to do so by one of Santos' gangster associates called Mr Reindeer (William Morgan Sheppard).Sailor is subsequently given a five year sentence for his part in the robbery and on his release, Lula meets him with their son. An important decision then has to be made about what's best for the family's future and the course of action that Sailor takes is determined by an extraordinary and fantastic intervention from a very unexpected source.Nicolas Cage is sensational as he portrays his character's ability to be brutal and violent as well as charming and caring. His Elvis-style drawl and his renditions of two of the King's ballads are terrific and the way he delivers some of his great lines is brilliant and hilarious at the same time. Examples of this are his speech about the significance of his snakeskin jacket, the occasion when he exclaims "rockin' good news" and also when he says to Lula "the way your head works is God's own private mystery".Lula is strangely naive but also profoundly damaged by being raised in a family where both her mother and her cousin Dell (Crispin Glover) were insane and where her mother arranged to have her father killed in a fire. Add to this her childhood experience of being raped and having an abortion and the extent of her psychological baggage becomes clearer. Laura Dern captures Lula's contradictions and spontaneity perfectly in a performance which is absolutely flawless throughout.Diane Ladd's performance as the mad and murderous Marietta is wild and powerful and she dominates the screen every time she appears in the action."Wild At Heart" was directed with great flair and adapted for the screen (from Barry Gifford's novel) by David Lynch whose style is both colourful and surreal. Lynch's preoccupation with all things eccentric, bizarre and off-beat can often be unsettling or extremely funny but in the case of this movie is especially effective as it complements the fantastic and fairytale quality of the material so perfectly.</fullReview>

Wild At Heart is definitely one of those films where you can't stop watching until it's over and the credits are rolling. While I'm not a real big fan of either Laura Dern's acting in this film, and Nick Cage's acting doesn't really strike me well either...all around it's a good movie that is fast and furious...and in the end it's a great love story as well.

This film does not poke fun at white trash, but rather concerns two free spirited individuals who are pursued by the darker elements of life, i.e. unbalanced family members, crime syndicates, and just plain weirdness! This movie is a collage of great scenes pieced together by references to the Wizard of Oz. Fun, fun, fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild at Heart (1990)An inventive, crazy, abusive, drugged up, violent, sexed up, romantic, anti-romantic, road trip pseudo noir campy intense up and down silly disturbing movie.But is it any good? Is it fun to watch, or moving, or beautiful? Maybe, if you are pre-disposed. At times I was amused or bemused or fascinating or surreal in a raw and theatrical way. It doesn't always add up, and even though it isn't meant to, the movie feels so self-indulgent you feel like the style is used to hide sloppy movie-making. It's a campy mess, really, with a whole slew of episodic turns and twists. You couldn't really care less about anyone or anything. It's too comic booky for that. Nick Cage is a bit too much to take, too...you might find him funny, or just overacting. There are some terrific performances--a hyped up, silly sexy Laura Dern, a hardened Isabella Rosselini, a characteristic Harry Dean Stanton, an unpredictable Willem Defoe, and so on, quite a quirky cast! A lot happens in two hours, and it has that wide open American landscape behind it. It's no doubt sexist, but I doubt any of its fans care a bit. And luckily, this kind of highly stylized film has its fans. Surely the glossy saturated nightmare and all the sex and violence is has all the earmarks of counterculture hedonism. That's good if you're into that. But I constantly think how much more powerful it could have been. There are moments, and scenes, that are fabulous, really brilliant. But in the long run it's a lazy movie, depending on its weirdness far too often. For me that's not enough. Curious, but not enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of David Lynch's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Wild at Heart' is one of the best films of David Lynch, maybe second only to 'Blue Velvet'. The story is more simple and the style more direct than in some of his latest films, but this leaves place here for his full talent and expressiveness to get to the screen. The approach in describing the a violent world of crime with characters being more victims than villains despite their violent behavior reminds very much the films of Tarantino. In a few world Lynch at his best looking as Tarantino at his best.The film is a combination of crime story, love story and road film, all in a style of childish and naive innocence. The two principal characters are splendidly played by Nicholas Cage (in the first in a series of bad-but-redeemable-guy roles) and Laura Dern engaging in a deadly run trying to escape the revenge and will to set them apart of her mother, making love and seeding blood and death around them. They are not so much a Bonnie and Clyde couple, but rather two grown up kids trying to run under the sign of the wizard of Oz, but actually looking from refuge from unspeakable traumas of their childhood. The strong soundtrack, the acting style, the efficient story telling make this likable and expressive film survive well the two decades since it was made.</fullReview>

I saw it once when it came out and the only things I remembered was the car accident with Sherilyn Fenn and the angel at the end. That's it. I saw it again for the first time in 19 years and I understand why. It's not very memorable because it isn't a very good movie. Sure, there are some cool crazy characters (all right, they're all crazy!) and the photography of the bleak landscape is beautiful. David Lynch has also a cool way of using sounds and music which makes the film very eerie. Apart from that, the film is dangerously close to being a B-movie, almost laughable.

		<fullReview>In a cruel, creepy, crumbling world, the romance of Sailor and Lula at the core of Wild At Heart is the bright sun that a galaxy of eccentric characters revolve around in David Lynch's signature film. Bizarre, absurd, surreal and extremely violent, the film weaves a canvas of classic love story, Wizard of Oz and Natural Born Killers (another great messed-up romance) that will stick in your mind forever - with its extreme characters, brain scrambling soundtrack and memorable images.From its shocking opening to its beautiful Elvis-fuelled climax, Wild at Heart never puts a foot wrong. Outside of Twin Peaks and Frank from Blue Velvet, Lynch has yet to create a more wonderful, rounded, set of characters that will get under your skin and stay with you like a nightmare tattoo. It's impossible to imagine anyone other than Nicolas Cage as Sailor Ripley, the coolest - if not smartest - man on Earth or Willem Dafoe as his nemesis, the dark angel of death Bobby Peru.For an archetypal Lynch film, the plot of Wild at Heart, inspired by Barry Gifford's great book, is quite straight forward and very romantic, which makes it more accessible to the general public - well, those with strong stomachs - who want to cruise along this particular highway and taste life on the 'wild' side!</fullReview>

I did not like this film at all.It dragged and dragged and dragged Mr. Lynch could of ended the film long before his "Wizard of Oz" ending, I know this is because of continuity (Wicked Witch, The tapping of the Shoes) but shame on Lynch for such a unsatisfactory ending. I'm probably the only one I know who didn't like this film, one friend of mine described it well by saying it was "Dripping With Ick"!!!!! There are also links with the life of Sailor (Cage) with a certain Elvis Presley's early years (Wardrobe, his job as a truck driver and his voice) and I believe Lula (Dern) with Marilyn Monroe (Wardrobe, accent again). I thought the film would kick-ass after the first scene but it just drifted away into the Hollywood Archives or late night T.V listings!!!! Sorry but a poor 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one goes into a David Lynch movie expecting a normal viewing experience.But what do you come out with when you've seen a movie that cross-breeds a road movie with "Bonnie and Clyde", "The Wizard of Oz" and "Blue Velvet" (Lynch's previous film)? Headache, nausea, dizziness and slurred speech, that's what.This is not a movie, it's a litmus test for how far a movie can go and how much it can get away with. And obviously, the MPAA didn't let it get away with TOO much. But enough, to be sure.As Sailor (Cage) and Lula (Dern) make their way through a bizarre world replete with oddball characters, twisted situations and nihilistic scenes of violence, it's kind of hard to juxtapose these with scenes of Glinda the Good Witch and Dern clicking her heels to get back home. Lynch tries to make a joke of the whole thing: blood, guts, severed hands and heads and all, but this is the kind of humor you're more apt to get if you're into jokes about death, dismemberment and a lack of overall morals. The only scene I did like in this whole mess is set in a dance club, where Cage roughs up a guy trying to put the moves on Dern, makes him apologize, has the guy get himself a beer and then jumps up with the band and breaks into an Elvis song while the girls in the club squeal and scream for joy. Seeing Cage sing like Elvis is worth the price of admission itself.Almost.One star. For sheer guts, this movie has no equals, thank goodness. But though it's "Wild at Heart", its "Heart" is not in the right place. Just like its brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Call me a sucker. I've seen this movie twice but it is one of my favorites, however I would not consider myself biased due to my appreciation of David Lynch, my own life with a situation of being separated from a girl I love due to her mother, or anything else.I think the goal of movies should not be solely to entertain, to pass the time, or anything like that- movies like this exist, and some like to watch them only for that value. But I consider those a waste of the short time we have to live.Movies which impart you with something that is relevant to your real life, and leave you with something, a feeling, some meaning of some sort, some sort of belief in a good thing, these movies are worth the time. That should be the goal of every artist, to make something that enriches the lives of those who absorb it, not degrade.David Lynch's use of very subtle yet heavy (to those who notice) symbolism, combined with the right moments of comic relief, and the general spirit behind it all really make you appreciate the right spirit for any form of art to be made with. Every artist has something different to impart but I think in the end they all have the same employer. David Lynch definitely creates his movies with some semblance of the things I'm talking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the other lynch films first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of David Lynch, but if this had been the first film of his I had seen I would have never given any of his other films a chance. This film is a mess filled with incoherent dialogue, pointless weirdness, and out of nowhere Wizard of Oz references. Most of Lynch's films have some point in their surreal atmosphere, but this one does not. This film is basically a criminal lovers on the run film like Badlands, True Romance, or Natural Born Killers, but while those films had coherent stories and plots this film does not. Our two protagonists, Lula and Sailor, are both completely insufferable and lack any redeeming qualities. David Lynch seems to not understand the appeal of Nicholas Cage because he populates the film with crazy people. If everyone is insane then Nicholas Cage seems normal. This film is supposed to be a comedy, but it blurs the lines between being intentionally and unintentionally funny. I would only recommend this film to David Lynch completists, and implore anyone how is unfamiliar with Lynch to watch Blue Velvet or The Elephant Man. I do not know why this film won the Palm D'Or, but i assume it is similar to the Oscars in that the right people win just not for the right film. I really do think Lynch is one of the best directors of all time, but this film is just incoherent garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch on steroids</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Um - Wow! Nicholas Cage doing Elvis! Almost too hard to watch. Just the beginning.Lynch himself bouncing between Fellini and Hitchcock, hitting everyone in between. Playing Cage, Dern, Ladd, Dafoe, Rossellini, Stanton et al like mad marionettes. Using every weird European-inspired device, from extreme close-ups to putting the camera in front of lenses, like cocaine nightmares.This must have been a hell of a fun movie to make, giving in to every impulse from the actors mugging in every scene to Lynches' signature direction to the screenplay totally unbridled and special effects that include Dafoes' teeth and his glorious death-scene, blowing his head off with a good-ole-boy monster shotgun in a good-ole-boy Texas shoot-out.Great cars, too.Easy to see where all the raves come from, a Midnight movie from conceptional glint. I'm giving it one star in Homage to its intent, to be so bad as a movie that it transcends its media. In fact, from Blue Velvet to Twin Peaks to the disaster of Dune, Wild at Heart has got to be Lynches' masterpiece. Uncharacteristically, it even has a happy ending: Cage singing Love Me Tender in Elvis' voice to Dern after getting beaten up by a Chicano gang, being set straight by the Good Witch we all remember from Oz, and realizing she (Dern/Lulu) is the love of his life. Everything just totally off the wall.Even better, Lynch is being so much Lynch that Lynch disappears and the movie splats on the screen as itself, transcending Lynch, the over-acting, the screenplay, the truly awful, European devices as well as its media. Textbook really bad movie with absolutely nothing going for it proving that that's what movies are all about.One caveat - you got to be able to stomach Cage not only trying to act but trying to be Elvis while he's trying to act. It's a very painful experience, like watching French-people trying to act and speak French at the same time or Gerald Ford trying to think and chew gum simultaneously. But if you can get through it, you'll be rewarded.Down to it, Wild at Heart's just a good-ole, traditional love story filled with good-ole, traditional love story angst and pathos and a good-ole, traditional love-story ending.</fullReview>

I'm not a HUGE fan of his early work, but as a general rule anything by Lynch is worth seeing at least once.It stars the brilliant Nicolas Cage as ex-convict Sailor, who is obsessively in love with Lula (Laura Dern). The two of them set out on a road trip to escape from Lula's evil mother and her croneys, and plenty of Lynch-style weirdness ensues. To top it all off there are numerous references to 'Wizard of Oz' in the story.It's not an easy film to watch -- lots of violence, gore and unsettling scenes as you'd expect from this director, and most of them don't really add anything to the film. Nevertheless, there's some great stuff here and I'd definitely recommend it to Lynch fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, really messed up, one of the strangest films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let me explain that this is the first (and still only) Lynch film I have ever seen, and I've heard that most of his movies are like this. It can be viewed in two ways. One is that it is a masterpiece, I can see how people can view it this way, and the other is as a weird, strange tale that just doesn't click. This is the way I viewed it. It gets so wrapped up in being odd and different that ultimately it forgets how to be a movie, and turns into a disjointed bore. This is likely the movie that launched (or at least furthered) Nicolas Cage's illustrious career, and Laura Dern's semi-illustrious career (the lead in Jurassic Park, and a supporting role in last year's October Sky). They deserved it, as they are actually very good, and probably the film's brightest spot. It's not solely the direction that can be blamed, the writing should be carrying most of the criticism. It often doesn't make much sense, and appears to be deliberately taking the movie down with it. 'Wild at Heart' appears to fail, but as I have already said, it can be taken two ways. I chose to tear it apart, but that is probably because it demands a large amount of attention I just wasn't willing to give. Take a chance on it, if you like it then good for you, if you don't then you're in the minority.4/10</fullReview>

A funny sort of mystery surrounds a young pair of lovers, Sailor and Lulu (Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern). They've gotten in with a bad sort of crowd. They both come from wild lineage, and strange beginnings. Despite a lifetime of dangerous relationships and happenings, their love, and the good energy that gives to them. . . .drives them to overcome all the bad things in their midst. Because they remain true to their love, and are wild at heart, they come out OK, though the world should crumble around them. Some of the dark and crazy characters around them reflect our own potential for buffoonery and disgrace, very darkly, yet humorously so. The satirical theme of the film is highlighted by a brilliant musical score throughout, that seems to supply a perfect tempo for the film. Special kudos to the whole brilliant cast for carrying out the directors theme throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to be the lone voice of protest here, but. . .I saw this film the other day, and aside from a few touches of visual flair and a terrific performance from Willem Dafoe (nice little 'Sailor vs. Marine' motif), it was an undercooked mess. The "over-the-top" qualities which would serve Oliver Stone so well four years later in "Natural Born Killers" come off as clumsy and forced. Visual cues--such as the plethora of Oz references--are thrown in with about as much subtlety as a beer commercial (but without the sophisticated wit). I got the idea that Lynch was tired, the cinematographer didn't feel like framing his compositions in a creative manner, and the editor hit the bottle a few too many times before coming into work.And another thing: I was embarrassed for Diane Ladd and Laura Dern. This film is a black spot on their respective careers (though, from what I've read, they have a near-cultist reverence for Lynch and his 'artistic integrity'). I found it most difficult to watch the scene where Ladd has to crouch up against a toilet after having vomited, with lipstick coating her face, and chunks of spew in her hair. I didn't find it hard to watch because it was merely disgusting--folks, there is such a thing as the degradation of women on film, and it's here.At long last, if you want to see these kinds of stories done right, here are a few alternative film suggestions:1. Joseph L. Lewis's 1949 film of "Guncrazy", a B-movie classic of star-crossed lovers on the lam.2. "Bonnie and Clyde" of 1967, which skyrocketed its principal players to stardom, and rightfully so. A cornerstone of '60s American cinema.3. From across the Atlantic, another 1967 film, Jean-Luc Godard's "Weekend". Even if you don't like the picture, you can't deny Godard's mastery of the medium. Where Godard rebelled and bucked convention in countless ways, Lynch is trapped in his own urge to include another in-joke, pop-culture reference, or blood splatter, and calling those his 'trademarks'.4. Terrence Malick's first film, 1973's "Badlands", with a remarkably youthful Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek, accompanied by Carl Orff's "Musica Poetica" (fans of "True Romance" will recognize it instantly), and elegaic heartland cinematography.5. The imperfect but extremely likable "True Romance", from '93, with an excellent Tarantino screenplay, the aforementioned Carl Orff score, and the first 'straight' performance from Dennis Hopper since God-knows-when.6. Finally, the one that puts any David Lynch effort to shame, Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers". Fans of Lynch and "Wild At Heart" will be angry with me, calling WAH the main source of inspiration for NBK, but I see it as a rehearsal instead. Oliver Stone, for all his faults, at least takes filmmaking seriously.I was careful to have seen nearly all of Lynch's films before making a comment. I have seen all but "Twin Peaks/Fire Walk With Me" and the "Twin Peaks" TV show. I also have studied film seriously, on my own, for the past seven years, so I like to believe I speak with a little authority.I realize Lynch must feel that his works are impervious to the audience's resentment of him, but he's wrong. Without an audience, the celluloid itself is nothing, because it exists in no one's mind except its makers and collaborators. Think about that.I also acknowledge the small but steadfast group of Lynch devotees. That's fine. I'm happy for those guys. And like them, I have nothing but hope for Lynch's next film .</fullReview>

Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern, Diane Ladd, Willem Dafoe and Sherilyn Fenn give solid, electrifying performances. The supporting members of the cast supply a gritty backdrop allowing this fantastic adventure to come to life.Rarely do you see a film when the moods, sounds, colors and scenery alone play such a vivid and vital part of the completed work. This film is true magic. It allows the viewer to experience a world full of decadence, beauty, anger, love and betrayal without actually having to take stock in it. I say this knowing that if the events in "Wild At Heart" were a part of your reality, you would definitely want to hide your red lip stick and keep a safe distance."Wild At Heart" A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, so not a "pure" comedy, since there are some pretty intense dramatic scenes, but 20 minutes into the film and throughout most of the rest of it, I can only assume Lynch is being funny. The whole Elvis imitation thing and the overblown drama of the relationship are camp humour. The Wizard of Oz links are also pretty funny. However, there are some heavy-handed attempts to create intensity, some of which fall flat and some of which work, and subplots that never get developed or seem to go anywhere. A pared-down version of this movie could have been brilliant as a dark comedy/drama. I can't help thinking that Lynch was throwing too many ideas around and didn't pull it together. It's also obvious he was working on Twin Peaks at the same time as they have a similar feel at points and some of the same devices are used in both.I'd give it 6.5 (if I could), but gave it 6 since it's a little painful at points.</fullReview>

Aside from stellar performances, and a really moving, creative and intelligent script, this is a movie that defines cool. Nicholas Cage's character, Sailor Ripley is as cool as his namesake, and if you don't like the name, you probably won't like the character or the film either.Critics have agreed that the film has it's moments. For me, the film itself is a large moment, with smaller, powerful moments inside it. Overall, it's a clear example of genius. I would recommend this to anyone who has a stomach for extreme sexuality, violence and fantasy.There is nothing in the same league as Wild at Heart.</fullReview>

So just how bad is it? Well....Thinking perhaps I was hasty in hating it, I rented it again, years later.What a huh-YOODGE waste of time! You know how sometimes you keep watching an awful movie, hoping in the end it will somehow get a skosche better, or that at least something will be explained/justified, so that your time has not been wasted? Only then it never does, and as the credits roll you wonder out loud why you watched the thing? Well "Wild At Heart" is that kind of movie.Again thinking I must be wrong; no Nick Cage movie could be that ridiculously bad, I rented it again, and this time instructed my teenage kids to watch it, and tell me what they thought of it. I did this WITHOUT FIRST TELLING THEM&lt; OR INDICATING IN ANY WAY, WHAT I ALREADY THOUGHT OF THE MOVIE. Well guess what. My daughter came back with eyes wide and lips wrinkled in disgusted amazement, proclaiming, "That's the worst movie I've ever seen!" Her older brother demanded of me why I made him watch such a terrible movie.There, see? no spoilers.

Oh, but it's an artsy movie! It's got a vomit-staring scene in it! It has references to the Wizard of Oz! It has a lady with an untweezed mono-brow in it! Yep, sure is artsy. How avant-garde.

		<shortDescription>Down the Postmodern Yellow Brick Road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild at Heart" is not one of the most famous films by David Lynch, but I think it is as worthy as his best ones. Perhaps its unique genre has been preventing a wider appreciation of the movie. The plot is deliberately simple. There are two sweethearts, Lula Fortune and Sailor Ripley. Sailor goes to prison for killing a gangster who tried to kill him. Lula's mother hates Sailor and wants her daughter to break up with him, but Lula waits for him. As soon as Sailor gets out of prison, he breaks parole and takes his love on a road-trip adventure. Wild at Heart has multiple allusions to the Wizard of Oz, with the wicked witch (Lula's mother) and the adventure and troubles of a little girl (Lula). Some of these references are even direct, like in the scene where Lula is clicking her ruby slippers. Of course, in modern times you don't walk down the yellow brick road ? you drive. The lovers encounter numerous dangers on their way.PULP FICTION: Wild at Heart looks to me like a precursor to Pulp Fiction which was made by Quentin Tarantino four years later. Both movies are loaded with pop-culture references, which are a favorite fodder of postmodern directors (Wizard of Oz, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, gangster novels). Both have a simple comic book-like plot. Even the names Sailor Ripley and Lula Fortune sound like they came from a comic book or a paperback novel. However, this simplicity is intentional - in the postmodern art the plot is usually no more than a loose guidance, a necessity used by the director to express his art. It's the same idea as when a jazz band takes a simple tune and transforms it into a completely new and fascinating art piece. There are many other similarities between the two movies. For example, the mobster's name Marcelo Santos resonates with Pulp Fiction's gangster Marcellus Wallace. Uma Thurman identifies Travolta as an Elvis man as opposed to a Beatles man ? well, Lynch clearly casts Sailor as an Elvis man in his movie. But the main similarity between Wild at Heart and Pulp Fiction is the fact that in both cases we are watching an absolutely low-brow material ? which normally we would skip - but are enjoying it as true art. We genuinely yearn to be around the characters, in the midst of an action, forgetting the fact that this marvelous artwork is actually built out of pulp. Tarantino will develop the same method even further with Kill Bill, but for David Lynch this is the only movie of such kind. One difference of the way Pulp Fiction is made is that the episodes in it are not sequential, even though you can mentally restore the time-line. Lynch will use the same approach later in Mulholland Drive, which is even harder to reconstruct than Pulp Fiction (although possible). The point is to take the viewer's attention away from the linear plot, from the comfort of knowing what's next, and instead focus on each episode or character alone. LYNCH'S AESTHETICS: There is a plethora of weird episodic characters in the movie, which is typical for Lynch. He always handpicks collections of bizarre and freaky creatures in his films, which are often unnecessary for the plot but create an intense mood. The pigeon- squawking man, the maniacal woman with orthopedic leg, the three fat "porn models", Mr. Reindeer (another typical comic book-like character) ? the list can go on and on. This alluring ensemble of freaks and weirdos circles around our lovers on the yellow brick road. Some of them are just confusing, while others are menacing. Very few are amicable, like the old black gas station attendant who is tapping joyfully to Lula's dancing, his legs sticking out of short work overalls trousers as thin as the legs of the chair he is sitting on.ROAD HAZARDS: It feels like Lula and Sailor are the only sane people, devoid of evil tendencies, surrounded by hostile and mad reality - or perhaps they have accidentally landed in a scary fairy tale. Their journey to happiness hits snag after snag along the yellow brick road. The radio in the car keeps talking about horrible crimes and accidents on every frequency, and the atmosphere of distress is trying to put them down. They stop the car, jump out and start kissing. This may be their only way to escape, even if futile. Our heroes are alone in their adventure, and all they can hold onto is their love and the foolish snakeskin jacket, proclaimed to be a "symbol of individuality and personal freedom". But the clouds are darkening over them.ACTING: Willem Dafoe puts up an excellent performance as a remarkably despicable mobster Bobby Peru. He is repellent and attractive at the same time, and even Lula almost surrenders to him (remember her bent outward fingers ? her "tell"?).Lula's mother displays a harmonious combination of murderous and humane sides, lying and trusting at the same time. Painting the face red before betraying and dooming her former lover is a fascinating scene reminiscent of the ancient theater. She is evil and vengeful, yet so feminine and vulnerable.GENRE: So is Wild at Heart a road-trip movie? A love story? A fairy tale? A gangster movie? Neither, even though it freely plays with the elements of all these genres. In order to understand it, one should drop the perception constraints of any specific genre and start enjoying the movie as a unique creation. Then the movie will open up, scene by scene, like a good wine which reveals the depth of taste as you sip it. Overall, Wild at Heart is a remarkable postmodern feature, unique in its kind for Lynch yet in the same league as Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, Cage and Dern did a great job keeping this sleazy pile going on. But their performances, however good, couldn't rectify what was essentially an evil exploitative movie. First off, I don't care about symbolism for its own sake, especially when symbolism is used to elevate trash intellectually. Pop culture references are a total bore and cop out, yeah yeah, Elvis &amp; the Wizard of Oz, too heavy! But to the movie's credit, it CREATED the themes and styles that permeated the 90s and the early 2000s that I hated. Weird characters for weirdness sake Lots of fire &amp; red Patronizing Southern and Western themes used to mock said cultures Stylized violence and villainy Elvis, omg, can you get any more tacky? Tacky retro styles like old T-Birds, snake skin jackets, ballroom settings for what? Road movies through the same South and West derided earlier Road movies of young lovers who aren't as wicked as the scum who are chasing them. The young lovers are actually almost noble. Lots of steaming hot sex with beautiful people. Also too much cigarette smoking, like some high school rebellion thing from the 1950s. Is that supposed to be risqué? I hate cigs! Relentlessly exploiting disabled, disfigured, mentally ill characters just to keep it all so weird. Don't get me wrong, handicapped people don't have to be glorified or honored all the time, but in here they were just there for atmosphere The relentless mockery and denigration of the family. The movies that use some of these elements are legion but two movies use this as a template, "True Romance" and "Natural Born Killers". But 1000s of cheaper indies like "Way of the Gun", or "Arizona Dream" borrow the style elements almost verbatim. Tarantino's cynically used these elements in his movies too, but of course, he added his own distinctive touches.So in that respect, we can give this movie plaudits, like the original Road Warrior, in creating a whole genre, a dubious one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild at Heart is less a movie and more a psychological journey. It's hard for me to judge it the way I judge other movies; it simply can't be put under the same standards. Most movies are about entertainment and telling a story; this movie (like Blue Velvet before it) is about intense emotions, the darker side of the soul, and the warped mind of director David Lynch. David Lynch is one of the few directors left who still expresses himself through his work; he is one of the last true film artists. He indulges himself here, perhaps to an extreme. I'm not even sure I can say that this movie "entertained" me in the usual sense; but I relished the experience.Personally, I think they do a great job-it is meant to be humorous, and it works as a perfectly good counterpoint to the increasingly sinister obstacles they must overcome. Here is where the movie really shines: Lynch lets his imagination run wild in his depiction of a bizarre and dangerous underworld of criminal activity. Willem Dafoe is pitch-perfect as the sleazy hit-man, and the scene where he tries to seduce Laura Dern in the hotel room is one of the most disturbing moments of sexual tension ever caught on film. As with most David Lynch films, there are so many small details, so much humor and intelligence (as opposed to your average Hollywood hit) that it can be enjoyed over and over again. All in all, I think "Wild at Heart" is an underrated movie that, while far from Lynch's best, is very enjoyable. It is well-filmed and -directed, and there is a feeling of strength and energy that makes the film even more appealing.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A certain amount of fear, as well as things to dream about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is how Lynch described his attraction to Gifford's book. It speaks just as well about every other film he made of course where a certain amount of fear makes the things to dream about stand out from the night as all the more urgent.It has enough going for it either way; a road movie given to us with a gonzo eye, crime and anguish as kitchen- sink ritual, archetypally American male and female avatars of sexual youth, a sense of wanting to just love but the world is a wicked place, and if that's not enough something else will come along in the next scene.It was awarded the top prize that year at Cannes. I would have to guess that the French saw some of this as archetypally tweaked America, quintessential in the fracture. It's the same audience that was going to receive Pulp Fiction with plaudits in a few years.And this is the whole thing. At this point Lynch could still be thought of as one among the quirky bunch that included the Coens, Stone and soon Tarantino. But can he be thought of as one of them now? No indeed and that's how much he has evolved.What sets Lynch apart is that others create movies as self-enclosed worlds; for Lynch it's rather one larger, open-ended world that he carries with him everywhere and now and then summons some part of it in movie form.The Coens for example, who are closest to him in several ways, both work with metaphysics and indulge loves for song, noir and dreams. Blue Velvet and Raizing Arizona, I can't think of one without the other, both with a dreamlike noir engine that skewers idyllic middle America. But the Coens think up a story and cleanly work out its mechanism, Lynch's work seems to come from prolonged stays in meditative habitation of that world. They are intellectuals, he's spiritual (not the same as pious).Except this one came from a book Lynch was given while finishing the Twin Peaks pilot and decided to do; not so much summoned from his world as he visited someone else's and came back with impressions. Now in my third viewing, it continues to be my least favorite of his post- Velvet long works that constitute the Lynch world but still one of the most endearing messes I know. It's Lynch letting out steam more than anything.But I'll keep with me the powerful noir engine that creates the fearful dreaming; two women, mother and daughter, who are traumatized by something they (she) allowed to happen (rape, husband's murder) and this is now spilling and surging through the film as helplessness to resist evil (most notably seen in the helplessness to avert the PI's death and the Bobby Peru scene). It does show Lynch as a humanist filmmaker, not a cynic, and that alone elevates it above mere carnage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand why Lynch likes the story because it's indeed how he feels the world : unlike Burton, Spielberg who sticks to « beauty », Lynch really likes the decay, the filth, the under belly, the vomit, the perversions, the paranoids, the violence? For him, there's something artistic in those leftover and as this love story is built on them, he was surely very happy ! So, in a way, this is a rather unique and powerful romance because we are not used to see lovers like this ! Beyond the content, the visual is also masterful : for one time, we have a director who cuts flashbacks with intelligence, who uses zooms and large frame with talent and who really understands colors ! Soundtrack is cool with very different sources mixed well together : from classical, to Badalamenti, to Presley, to metal?At last, the casting is really well-built : Dafoe is really scary, Cage finds one of his best character, Rosselini achieves in 5 minutes what she lacked in one hour in « blue velvet » and the family duo of Ladd is unusual in film history : to have a mother and daughter playing the same parts in such a deranged movie is a real experience? So, it's true that along 2 hours, we have our eyes, our ears, ours brains exploded with talent so Palme d'Or was deserved. We can only regret that the movie is a proof that our civilization lacks also values, good manners?</fullReview>

The photography is excellent, it was like having a heavy metal guitar player on the camera, superb.

		<shortDescription>A cross-country chase fueled by cigarettes, alcohol, rock music, lunatics, and...LOVE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch has created and/or intensified some of movie's most extreme and psychopathic characters ever.Nicholas Cage's character, Sailor Ripley, is violent and always seems to find himself among the wrong crowd, except when it comes to the love of his life, Lula, whom he'd protect with his life. However, he's also someone who can be very nice and helpful so long as no one rubs him the wrong way.Sailor's girlfriend, Lula Fortune, played by Laura Dern, is a sweet, innocent, and, impressionable young lady; but, naive and sometimes as dumb as a box of rocks! Her love of Sailor is unquestionable!Together, these two run off on what becomes a road-trip/chase that leads to many encounters with David Lynch's other-than-wholesome cast of characters. Some weird; some strange; some funny; but, all are off-the-wall damaged!Bobby Peru, played by Willem Dafoe, is probably the best psychopathic and sociopathic maniac in any of David Lynch's movies (and/or, of all time)...to me. He's as crazed and violent as Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) in "Blue Velvet;" but, unlike Booth, Bobby Peru can be friendly and persuasive with people (in order to use them), as well as funny...which, to me, makes him much more dangerous than Booth.Marietta Fortune, Lula's mother (Diane Ladd), is seemingly protective of her daughter; but, in actuality, is a demanding control-freak who cares of little beyond her own needs and wants.Marcelles Santos (J.E. Freeman) is a cold-blooded killer and complete lunatic - 100% worse than Frank Booth from "Blue Velvet;" and, without humor, like Bobby Peru.If you want to see a movie completely filled with unreasonable, shady, and, mentally-deranged, and, sometimes funny, characters...you have to see this. If you liked "Blue Velvet," you'll love this case-study of some of the most pathologically messed-up characters all brought together in one movie. Even the 'cameo' characters seem as though they were temporarily released from an insane asylum just to shoot their scenes...it's brilliant! GREAT ACTING!*In Psychology 101 in college, we had to choose two books along with the movies, to write a psychiatric thesis on. Although neither were on the professor's list, with some persuasion, I was allowed to write about this book (and, movie...the movie is much more in-depth - thank you, David Lynch - I got an "A")!The other book/play (and, movie) was "Equus" (1977).This is a Bozo-Bin-Bonkers-Bonanza of a Bunch-a-Bananas...you'll love it! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fiery, beautifully brutal addition to Lynch's career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my cinematic pantheon, there are three great 1990's homages to the violence, romance and lovers on the run shtick of Bonnie And Clyde: Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, Tony Scott's True Romance... and David Lynch's Wild At Heart. It's definitely the weird one of the bunch, let me tell you that. But it's also a kaleidoscope of fiery passion, deranged characters, bloody violence and a running theme of Wizard Of Oz references that allow the crazy color scheme to pop off the screen like fireworks. It's one of the most beautiful looking films of the 90's. Subject matter wise, it's also one of the ugliest. There's a whole lot of lurid, surreal, extremely taboo sexual and violent content here, so only go for it if you're in a full moon kinda mood. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern are dynamite as Sailor Ripley and Lula Pace Fortune, two Louisiana kids deeply in love, who high tail it on the run from Lula's demented, unstable monster of a mother (Diane Ladd, Dern's real life mother, got an Oscar nod). She hires all sorts of creeps to follow them, from ruthless mobster Marcellos Santos (J.E. Freeman positively oozes sleaze), to the sadistic Juana Durango (Grace Zabriskie will give you nightmares). Also on their tail is PI Johnny Farugute, played with kooky stray dog aplomb by Harry Dean Stanton. Our lovers take a blood splattered yellow brick road past New Orleans out to Texas where they meet the weirdest character in the film, Bobby Peru. Willem Dafoe is a deranged wonder in the role, a volatile, sexually abusive demon of a man, and chews every scene as only Dafoe can. There's a whole sideshow of ridiculous characters, from Laura Palmer herself, Sheryl Lee, Jack Nance, Crispin Glover, John Lurie, Isabella Rossellini, David Patrick Kelly, and a gut wrenching cameo from Sherilyn Fenn that will leave you shaken to your core. My one problem with this flick is at times the grotesque nature is overbearing, and it seems Lynch just tosses stuff in for the love of fricken whatever. But it's a small quibble in an amazing film. He directs with a rainbow costumed aesthetic, almost poetry like dialogue, and a larger than life realm of monsters, jazz tunes, heavy metal, fire, murder, sex, love, Elvis, dancing, good and bad witches, and a constant thrumming vibe of feverishly surreal weirdness that will leave you panting, hot under the collar and stirred in that special way only cinema can induce. In Lynch's world, everything is Wild At Heart and weird on top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild At Heart is one of those films that scoops you up and plants you directly in its own magical, twisted little world as soon as it starts and drops you back on boring old planet earth at the end feeling like you've just woken from a dream. At least that's the effect it had on me the first few times I saw it, and seeing it again last night for the first time in years the same is true, in fact it's possibly even better than I remembered. I can't be bothered to go into plot and character details, suffice to say that everyone involved gives top notch performances, and the story is deep enough to be engaging without being confusing. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, occasionally terrifying, but always deliciously deranged, Wild At Heart is quite possibly one of the ten greatest pieces of cinema ever created in my opinion. I'm not even a massive David Lynch fan - in fact this is the only Lynch movie I've felt the need to watch more than once - however this one is a sublime, darkside masterpiece that blows away the competition. Give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern escape their pasts and her mother</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was just OK. The story didn't turn me on. Rather a lot of this and that without much impact.David Lynch does his thing in this movie, which means he introduces weird stuff every so often, leaves loose ends, is unconcerned with conventional story-telling, and wants to be unconventional. The rest of us tag along. Even the actors may be wondering what it is they are being asked to do in some scenes. This movie is not open to rational questions because it's not intended to simulate reality. It's anti-Hollywood in that sense despite being Hollywood. It functions sometimes as put-on and parody. It cannot really be taken as a serious story. It's more like, "What the heck, I'm telling the story, and if I suddenly want to show some weird thing, I will." So, how good is Lynch's art in this one? It's passable but that's about all. It doesn't really excite me or grab me. He hasn't really either shown the way to the new thing here or shown us a great work. I liked "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway" a lot better. "Twin Peaks" was on the queer side too. Simply breaking with the old ways isn't enough. It still has to be good. This isn't bad. It's on an up slope but it hasn't reached the heights. Thematic depth is missing. In the end there isn't much to the story. One can only take so much of Laura Dern and Diane Ladd is unwatchable altogether. Watching this again will be tedious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fiendishly Wild Road Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The camera gazes upward at what appears to be the ceiling of a ritzy mansion, swing music frolicking in the background. Capital letters suddenly appear on the screen, announcing that the location of this swing music adoring home is in Cape Fear, somewhere near the border between North and South Carolina. One can almost feel the rush of an air- conditioned breeze after a romp in the sun. Guests only come inside for a glass of bubbly and a leather chair to reflect on. A party is going on. We meet it at its exit, Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern trotting down the chandelier lit staircase in an effort to find some fun elsewhere. But a man stops them. You see, he has caught wind of a certain incident (allegedly, Nick attempted to have a tryst with Laura's mother in the bathroom), and has been hired to off him for the preservation of reputation. The man pulls out a switchblade with a wicked grin, ready to slash ? sensing danger on the premises, Laura belts out a screechy "NOOOOOOOOO!"; Nick, in the meantime, overpowers the villain, slamming him against the handrail, the steps, the floor, until blood and brains cover the area. When his opponent is dead and gone, he can do nothing besides light a cigarette and viciously wag a finger at a Southern belle of a woman at the top of the stairs. You, his eyes say.No, we don't know what the hell is going on, and no, we aren't given enough time to react. Is this supposed to be a scene of camp, or a scene of heinous savagery? Perhaps both, as the carnage is soundtracked by thrash metal and Dern's screams while still managing to disturb the living bejesus out of us. As we will soon learn, Wild At Heart is a fearless road movie, unafraid to be abstract, unafraid to shock. Wild At Heart never gives us the chance to question our curiosity. It begins so ferociously that we're immediately determined to figure out why our supposed hero feels so inclined to crack a man's skull in full view, even if the answer is somewhat ambiguous. What follows is a sprawling tale of distinctive criminals and sordid romances, all set to the tune of the road, Elvis Presley, and The Wizard of Oz.Cage and Dern are Sailor and Lula, young lovers on the run from Sailor's parole and Lula's crazed mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd). The two merely want some time alone to bathe in each other's company through sex, rock 'n' roll, and the freedom of the highway; but Sailor, a cursed individual no doubt, has provoked the psychotic Marietta. He witnessed a scandalous event from her past that could ruin her high society livelihood, so, desperate, she hires a hit-man to rid herself, and her daughter, of any future harm. But this doesn't do as much good as she would like ?in fact, it does the complete opposite. Unleashed is a nightmare of crooks that sets out to destroy Sailor and Lula's seemingly unbreakable love, while Marietta, in the meantime, suffers a breakdown in the face of wrenching guilt.Reading the synopsis I've just written, I'm worried that I've made Wild At Heart sound too much like '93's True Romance. That was a conventional movie with a vivid way with words, whereas Wild At Heart is a satire of the archetypes given to the lovers-on-the-run subgenre. To be even more specific, it is a satire of Sirkian melodramas, Elvis movies, road pictures, middle-of-nowhere noirs. It's one big satire, but it isn't. Lynch doesn't so much make fun of clichés as he does boil them in acid, turning them inside out and making things once viewed as beautiful oddly freakish. This is what I've always admired about his work; even at his worst moments, he creates his own world out of all things familiar.In some cases, his films have had too many ideas to fit into the space of a normal movie, playing out as monotonous rather than provocative. The framework of a road picture, however, suits Lynch's style perfectly. Road movies are places in which characters can ramble, where possibilities are endless; the unpredictability of his style is fitting, as tonal shifts manage to feel natural. The main characters are loose cannons, as are the individuals that haunt the small towns they face, so a jump from broad comedy to gory suspense doesn't feel very questionable. Sure, a genre shift can be jarring, but this is Lynch (or a Lynch road trip) we're talking about; a sense of aesthetic coherence is a gift from the gods. More sensational are the actors; the movie calls for insanity, and they provide nearly all of it. Cage and Dern are as over-the-top as any romantic leads could ever be, Cage taking breaks from metal concerts to lip-synch Elvis Presley's "Love Me", Dern going back and forth between vulnerable and thrill-seeking. Ladd, in a fantastic performance, is a hoot, taking the nastiest components of the bitchy women from Dynasty, Dallas, and Peyton Place and undergoing an excessive on screen breakdown. In one scene, she covers her face in red lipstick in the wake of an increasingly guilty conscience; it could have been laughable, but Ladd makes the ridiculousness masterful in its delivery.Wild At Heart has a wild heart no doubt, but it works much better than some of Lynch's more indulgent offerings. It's a reminder that filmmaking can be, in any form, an exciting craft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(74%) In a world with so many movies barley amounting to very much in terms of tone and mood we have this early 90s Lynch classic that overflows with it. The film has a real ability to be darkly funny then instantly plain dark in such a way that you question exactly what is was you just chuckled at only a few seconds ago. The bleak dark grime is intermixed with a beacon of bright light and beauty so it never becomes overly oppressive despite some real nastiness and although clearly not for everyone (too many on- screen mental break downs and revolting characters for some), it still remains unquestionably well made and superbly acted proving Lynch to be a real genuine talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This whole world is wild at heart and weird on top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is another fine voyage into David Lynch's fantastic world. Although it's not one of my favorites, I can enjoy some of the same unmistakable aspects present in other of his films; a rupture from reality, constantly giving place to oneiric experiences, where the strangeness and the humor that comes with it hit us full force. Scenes like Sailor and Lula dancing at the nightclub, where Sailor suddenly stops the party to "prove his love to his girl" and then finishes off with a powerful song by "E", are simply hilarious. Also, quotes like "this is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom" set the tone to the movie. Besides the comedic side, there's also an interesting take at the love story between Sail' and Lula, involving Lula's growing up and having to overcome her childish anxieties, such as the maternal power, which to me, is what the story is really about. The constant parallel made between their story and Wizard of Oz's proves that point, in which Lula's mother would take the place of the Wicked Witch of the West. We follow Laura's character as she slowly escapes from her mother's control to experience her womanhood and become rather independent, but there always seems to be something evil on the verge of happening, to prevent Lula from experiencing a full grown-up life beside Sail', like there was always something preventing Dorothy from getting back to Kansas. I think both Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern's performances were great, and also bold, for that matter. One little thing I noticed after repeated viewings is the way Laura smokes her cigarettes. I'm not sure if it was intentional or something personal (I suppose the latter), but if you pay enough attention (and they are ALWAYS smoking), you can see she never takes a full drag or inhales the smoke, only sort of pretends to do so. Details like this are fun to notice after you've watched a movie quite a few times, and when it's a Lynch film, there are always hidden treasures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 'Twin peaks: fire...' I was up for another Lynch film and I had only 'Wild at heart' to pick. Compared to 'Twin...' this one comes off slightly silly at times (as do Lula and Sailor - again, at times), but for the greater part it is still a wonderful film. The (love &amp; hate) story is basically straightforward (with a few too many flashbacks when things are pretty obvious anyway), but the hardships which Sailor and Lula have to endure, add the extra layer. The best example - and also one of the best scenes of the film - is when Lula encounters Bobby Peru in the motel room; though Willem Dafoe also shows us that he is a better actor than Nicolas Cage (even if Cage is better for the part of Sailor).'Wild...' has many bonus characters that do not add much to the story, but they do add to (the atmosphere of) the film, as do some haphazard scenes, like the one when they encounter a survivor at a car accident. Need I add that Lula by Laura Dern is one the hottest roles in the history of film? Done.A big 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charmous, weird and fascinating. This is Wild at Heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early screenings of 'Wild at Heart', it was extremely bad received, with about 80 persons walking out of it in the first two days, whose a good majority of them were complaining mostly about the graphic and gruesome depiction of violence, or the intense sex scenes,and even about the crude profanities spelled in the film. What a poor reasons. Seriously, it's a great film regardless if it is too strong or not. It's a very good film. And i'll say why it's so good.Lynch's use of references of the pop culture such as the popular fantasy film Wizard of Oz and the Elvis Presley's films fits well in the environment of Wild at Heart. It even softly calms down a few tense situations, due to an spoof feeling on it. The abundant use of the 'hot' colors in this film, to portray a 'wild' atmosphere, are masterfully used as well. The plot it's everything but clever though. This is somewhat obvious,because we're talking about David Lynch, whose content of his films are always expected to be very obscure. But if it helps, Lynch himself said that the film's main intention is to show 'how to love in the hell'. I really think he did the mission very well then. So, in a short resume, Wild at Heart is a film full of pointless dialogs, pop references, sex and violence, all mixed with a stunning cinematography. If you are planing to watch it, i highly recommend you to do so. 8.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filled with some crazy characters, this one certainly catches your attention and refuses to let go. Nicolas Cage is at his best playing the larger than life Sailor Ripley and Laura Dern does a great job as Lula. I thought Diane Ladd as Marietta was truly excellent and Willem Defoe was also great as the sleazy Bobby Peru. You cannot fail to notice the many references to 'The Wizard of Oz'; a theme that runs throughout. Unfortunately I found the film ran too long, there's only so long you can put up with all the craziness. It reaches a point where we lose one of the main threads that have been running through the first two thirds of the film and I found that quite distracting. Still, it's worth a look for a decent Cage performance and the, almost comic-book, like characterisations from Lynch (well at least for the first two thirds).SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 6.9/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked "Blue Velvet," a very memorable and strong film. I think most of the brilliance was due to unique directing and a dynamic cast, in particular, Dennis Hopper. I thought that "Blue Velvet" heralded the arrival of a great new director. The problem is, I have not liked anything else Lynch has done since. Movies to him have become an opportunity to string together a few cosmic and stylistic scenes. The negative is, you generally have to tread through many more pointless scenes that do not illuminate the "story" at all. A car's headlights on a road, eccentric and bizarre characters, stylish music, filler. The same blueprint for every movie. His movies are stylistic filler, no message, no point, but many scenes that are cool to look at. We then automatically think there is some great and surreal purpose to these imaginative scenes, but there isn't. There is surreal and then there is a stylish waste of time. Lynch creates a stylish waste of time, unless the eye candy is enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road movie that is quintessential Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at Heart was probably the film that David Lynch directed at the height of his fame. It was released off the back of the major television event that was Twin Peaks. As it happened it was screened to great acclaim in Cannes resulting in it winning the Palme d'Or. It is essentially a surreal road movie, a sub-genre of film that is well suited to Lynch's eccentricities seeing as it is a format that is geared towards a plot-line that is a succession of strange events. In it a young couple ? an Elvis fixated ex-con called Sailor and his lover Lula - hit the road to escape the latter's psychotic mother who sends some shady underworld figures after them. The plot synopsis doesn't really tell you much though because the joy of the movie is in the details. The story is really only a means for Lynch to string a series of strange events together. Nevertheless, Wild at Heart does make definite sense as a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. But apart from that, it's a bizarre ride.Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern are the young lovers in which this strange tale revolves around. They meet many strange characters along the way. This includes quite a number of bizarre cameos from the likes of Crispin Glover as a Christmas obsessive, Freddie Jones as a helium voiced bar-fly and Jack Nance as a trailer-park weirdo who talks about a dog. It's the characters with a little more depth to them that make a real mark though, like Willem Dafoe as the unforgettably creepy Bobby Peru and Diane Ladd who plays Lula's deranged mother who at one point disturbingly covers her face with lipstick and is depicted as a wicked witch throughout. Moreover, Wild at Heart is partially a homage to The Wizard of Oz in many other ways ? we even have Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer from Twin Peaks) appearing at the end as the Good Witch.The approach of the film is consistently very stylised. It's fabulous visually with striking imagery and great use of colour. In this way Lynch ensures that the dream-like ambiance is beautifully maintained. Or maybe that should be nightmare ambiance, seeing as this is probably the most violent film in the director's filmography. Its mixture of dark themes with highly charged eroticism is pretty typical though and is a combination he has used frequently. Another common trait here is in his use of music. Characters once again break the action to croon pop songs from the 50's/60's; this was also the first time where he incorporated intense heavy metal tunes as well. It's a strange combination in a strange film.I guess you could place Wild at Heart as a film somewhere between Lynch's full on surrealist movies like Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me and his more straightforward narratives like Blue Velvet. Its tone is wildly uneven as a consequence. The parts seem greater than the whole in fairness but what parts!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit of a weird one, this, but then what was I expecting from a David Lynch film? It's a surreal road movie starring Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern as a pair of star-crossed lovers on the run from Dern's demented mother and the string of assorted weirdos on their tail.I can't say I enjoyed this film all that much. I don't mind slightly crazed or surreal movies, like an earlier Nicolas Cage flick (and out-and-out comedy), RAISING ARIZONA. But WILD AT THE HEART feels like it's trying to be deliberately bad. Cage isn't in touch with reality at all in this one and Laura Dern just comes across as a bad actress.The direction is over the top throughout, with no measure of restraint on view. Lots of scenes are cheesy or just plain bad. It's not all bad, though, because we do get Willem Dafoe in an scene-stealing supporting role, and some decent set-pieces (like the bank job) along the way. But a lot of it, especially during the first hour, feels repetitive and slow, and the WIZARD OF OZ allusions are annoying more than anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wild At Heart" is my first real taste of a David Lynch film. The only other film of Dave's I've seen is "The Elelephant Man" and although it is an extraordinary and moving film, it restricts David's trademark weirdness and motifs as it's based on a tragic true story. I've been wanting to get a taste of David Lynch for a while because I'm into weird, over-the-top films and so when "Wild At Heart" popped up on ITV (not the crap wildlife drama) I had to give it a record. I have to say that I was pretty impressed and I'm looking forward to other films her has to offer.I would describe Lynch's style as Quentin Tarantino on acid. It's even more over the top in its editing, directing and music than most Quentin films. I absolutely loved Wild At Heart's energy, it has a fantastic pace and doesn't remain dull for a moment until it reaches its final half hour or so. The beginning keeps you immediately hooked with its fantastic over-the-top pantomime characters, especially the mother who is played with psychotic and sometimes frightening spirit by Diane Ladd. Nicholas Cage gives a typically wooden performance, whereas his partner (Laura Dern) in crime has a much more likable spirit.It's just a shame that the film seems to lose its focus about more than halfway through. The mother suddenly becomes absent and her presence is lost. The twisty and revealing flashbacks also go a miss, making the viewing less gripping. Things also start to feel repetitious when the duo encounter the car accident, the formula of dance, have sex, drive begins to where thin and the introductions of more hit men become incredibly confusing and surreal! However, there is a great use of colour throughout with the red and yellow conveying the idea of flames to create a clever fiery atmosphere.When the duo meet the super creepy Willem Dafoe (looking unbelievably frightening- prepare to have nightmares) the pace starts to slow and it's only the scenes with Willem that gain attention as things begin to lose focus. Although, there is a a fantastically creepy robbery sequence that will stay with you for an eternity. After this things begin to rebuild its focus, building up to a brilliant and clever finale.I also liked the "Wizard of Oz" references dotted throughout and its use of music. Overall, it's certainly a film that is worth seeing and if the film didn't lose its focus and had a good ten minutes cut down, then I'm certain that I would be branding this a masterpiece. However, unfortunately it doesn't quite reach that status despite it still being tremendously likable. I shall look forward to "Mulholland Drive" and "Blue Velvet" especially from Lynch.EDIT: Having now watched and loved Inland Empire, Twin Peaks (1/4 through series 2) and Mulholland Drive (which is now one of my favourite films of all time) I am, professionally speaking, in love with David Lynch. When I revisited Wild At Heart again last night I enjoyed it much more than the last time. I liked how the pace slowed down in the second half with Willem Dafoe as it gave the film a more dream-like quality which is something David is incredibly good at doing. Although, I still wouldn't brand Wild At Heart as a masterpiece, it still isn't far off and I'd urge people who've only seen it once to see it again in a different light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholas Cage at his Nicholas Cagiest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably Lynch's most openly comedic film, drawing on the uniquely kitschy aspects to American mythology to great effect. Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern ham it up as a pair of dimwitted lovers on the run, obsessed with such classic bits of Americana as Elvis and the Wizard of Oz. Lynch draws from the rich wells of melodrama to create a sublimely ridiculous story and a parody of the American road movie and its accompanying ideas of masculinity.With that said, this does feel like minor Lynch. The over-the-top aspects of Wild at Heart are hilarious at first, but over the course of two hours they wear out their welcome. Moreover, there's a line at which ironically being a bad movie stops justifying being a bad movie. I'm not sure that Wild at Heart crosses that line, but it still comes close to it.Wild at Heart may not be the masterpiece the Palme d'Or would make you think it is, but it's an enjoyable treat nonetheless, provided you don't mind a big helping of cheese.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atypically ambitious but flawed film from David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface this may seem typical Lynch fare, the mixing of film genre, strange often unexplained characters, and a strong visual style. Unlike most Lynch films however the story is actually a simple one, the two main characters that of Nick Cage and Laura Dern play two lovers being hunted down by hired killers. They have been hired by Laura Dern's vengeful and deranged mother. The film therefore appears to be a readily recognizable form that of the chase movie, however Lynch likes to complicate, perhaps over complicate, and this makes in this case for a messy and uneven film. Some might argue this is the effect he is going for, but to me it is Lynch not handling the material effectively. He prefers to go for weirdness as a stylistic effect, rather than to explain or further the plot. I also think that Laura Dern doesn't quite have that compelling glamour that the film needs to really justify the more over the top aspects. It tries to involve wizard of Oz references, which only distract from rather than help the story. There are attempts to bring musical elements to the story, but this film is a tough one and the attempts at lyricism seem out of place. Cages performance is actually very good and most of the time he underplays rather than hams it up, which works in a wildly ambitious film like this. I wish I liked this film more, and I can see that for the early 90's this might have been seen as a landmark film, it's strong sexual references intermixed with violence, and directorial flourishes would have seemed exciting. Today the film it seems a little dated, and a little self indulgent. There are fine scenes in this film however to make this film worth watching. The scene of the girl dying after the car accident, is astonishingly powerful, and genuinely moving. There is also a very nicely done gory touch at the end of the film. I just wish there were more scenes like that to make the film something better than the sum of its rather disjointed parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it for the first time,good characterisation, fast pace, and both Nicholas cage and Laura Dern plus William Defoe are very good in this although all play no-good characters.The storyline was understandable as well. Particularly like the Snakeskin Jacket on Cage it suited him for the part! A movie for people who do not mind watching flawed characters, as none are what you might call on the good law-abiding side!Nicholas cage has done some good movies and some bad, another one of his good ones was "Red Rock West" which I recommend watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch Does Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I am a Lynch fan. I love the way he is able to tap into the most disturbing recesses of the subconscious, dredge up the most visceral, unnerving and insane thoughts, ideas and images, which reside there, and transfer them onto the screen. This was done superbly in Eraserhead and the pilot of Twin Peaks. It pains me to say, then, that this does not come up to par. It's almost like he is running a 'how to be a Lychian director' class, and has made this as an educational tool. It's like 'Lynch does Lynch'; he has become conscious of what we expect, and has tried too hard. Consequently, it comes off like a parody, and performances from certain people - most notably, Nicolas Cage - do not help. I get the feeling he is going for a James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause kind of vibe, but unfortunately, does a kind of disaffected Elvis. There are some flashes of the old master, but mostly this is a disappointing offering from someone so original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little uneven tonally, and not as profound as 'Velvet', but pure Lynch through and through.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am quite the fan of David Lynch. He has a knack of combining the massively gratuitous and the oddly sweet, a pastiche he has been using in his films for years (Blue Velvet made me cry, and horrified; few films have the capacity to do either). So, I walked into this as a David Lynch fan, expecting the tropes I'd come to love, with a campy, hammy Nic Cage performance on top and the ever reliable Lynch regular Laura Dern as a bonus. I wasn't disappointed, as it was a fantastic film with virtuoso moments, some fantastic performances (Diane Ladd, whom I had no prior knowledge of, impressed me greatly), and a fantastic tone that marries campy satire with gut-wrenching violence. Yet there was no denying that this was a slighter affair than his best work, and it falls short of being the epic that Blue Velvet or Mulholland were.It tells the tale of Sailor Ripley (a hypnotic Cage), a man just released from prison (he was put there for killing a man hired to kill him and his girlfriend). He goes on the run with his girlfriend, Talulah (Dern), much to the histrionics of her mother, who hires a hit-man to kill him and her. On the young couple's bizarre road trip they meet a variety of oddballs, none of which are more memorable than Willem Defoe, in a strange performance that is grotesquely unforgettable.It has an ending, which I won't ruin, and several plot turns which I will also leave unspoilt if you aren't already aware of them. This is a long film, in which a lot happens, and you feel a little bit like you have gone on the road trip with them. It is never too busy, though, and some shots pan out, showing the expanse of the deserts that the couple have got themselves into. This could be symbolic of something, but this is a film in which a lot of things are symbolic of a lot of things. I won't mar your experience by saying what I thought of it all.It is a queasy film, too, and it doesn't skimp out on the violence (although there is no denying that it has dated somewhat) or the gratuitous sex (which hasn't really dated at all, to be honest), but if you're a Lynch-ite like me, then you won't be offended or off-put by it, but you will admire Lynch's verve, and his bravery to put such un P-C things in his films. Very anti-establishment.It's flaws. It suffers from repetition. Quite a lot of it. It also drags on ten minutes too long, a little bit of speed could have given the deterioration of the couple's journey a bit more impact, instead of just being a touch inevitable and predictable. The ending feels a little bit unnecessary.That said, these are niggles in the grand scheme of things, and this is a rare film that manages to provoke a reaction from every person who watches it. Even now it is quite lurid, and it's content would be faintly shocking to most, and offensive to others. It isn't completely accessible, but any film fan worth their salt should really fit this one in at some point in their lives. A brilliant, unforgettable film on the whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird and yet engrossing love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I had no idea what this movie was about, but decided to check it out since I heard this movie has Nicholas Cage when he was actually pretty good. He was good in this, but the set up and everything is sort of weird in some aspects. In fact just about every character in this movie is a bit awkward, but the style of this movie makes it really stand out. The plot is sort of random and it's a bit of a random road movie in some aspects. And has snakeskin jacket wearing Nicholas Cage who isn't a necessarily a villain in this movie, but still a bit of a crazy character. And is facing the obstacle of loving someone and going through some tough times while on the road. And he manages to pull it off pretty well, he makes the character entertaining to watch. Sailor(Nicholas Cage) also has a contract out on him for a reason and it all goes in a road movie with a bit of adult fairy tale in it. Overall this is a engrossing movie, weird but engrossing and kept my interest most of the way through. I am giving this a 7.2 because it was bleak and dull sometimes.7.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when i was well under the 18 rating. But thanks to early facial hair, parents who knew nothing of David Lynch except the elephant man and Dune and very lax staff at the local video shop I got to see it. I loved it as soon as I saw the back of Bobby Ray Lemon's head with the brains trailing out. And of course Bobby Peru.I've watched it many many times partially due to writing a long essay on it in media studies A level and in part due to really liking it. With hindsight it is not one of Lynch's best although it's not his worst either. Stubbornly weird but blessed with a hypnotic visual charm it really is very watchable.Supporting turns by Harry Dean Stanton and Willem Dafoe are both great and the leads have us rooting for them. In fact the majority of the cast master the disassociated Lynch house style.A hotchpotch of film references and atmosphere enhancing vignettes keep it ticking over between bouts of physical and/or psychological violence.We learn cars are not our friends and that you should never question gang members' sexuality no matter how much leather they wear.While a touch style over content it is very watchable if you like wilful oddity and menacing situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As always with Lynch, intriguing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at Heart is the 8th Lynch film I have seen. As always with Lynch, the film is able to become intriguing without becoming predictable.The performances are pretty great. Laura Dern, Diane Ladd, and William Dafoe are all great in their parts. Nicholas Cage is too to an extent, although I'm sure that he didn't feel like he had to do anything different from his other roles. It is interesting to see Lynch making a road film. It is definitely weirder than other road films, but as far as Lynch goes, not even one of his most surreal films. A lot of times it is really intriguing, and always entertaining, but I still never got the feeling that Lynch was creating something really powerful or effective. For that reason I did like the film, and it was very entertaining, but it would have to be in his lower half of his best films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, Mesmerizing, Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Violent, vivid and strangely humorous, David Lynch's "Wild at Heart" has many memorable moments, and it might be a source of inspiration for Tarantino's early works, and it's a great film with very few things to say.Before Mickey and Mallory appear there was Sailor and Lula (played by Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern), a young couple in love challenging everybody who's on their way trying to stop them for being together, most notably Lula's possessed and scary mom (Diane Ladd) who thinks that Sailor is a criminal (she provoked this instinct on him when some killer tried to kill him, but instead was murdered). This crazy woman contracted a detective (Harry Dean Stanton) to follow the couple, and also another man (J.E.Freeman) that works almost like a hit-man who is trying to get the detective out of the way of his business. These and other characters are bound together not only in the story but in a quirky rereading of "The Wizard of Oz" film mentioned all the way by countless references, jokes, and visions of the Bad Witch (Lula's mom) and the Good Witch (played by Sheryl Lee). Instead of Dorothy's wish to find the Magician, return to her home and help her new friends, here in "Wild at Heart" we have the main couple who seeks for peace, love and understanding but there's no magician who can do that.One thing people need to understand about this film is that performances here are meant to be bad and that's why the film succeeds. All that exaggerated acting coming from B-films of the 1940's and 1950's are meant to be presented this way here to make a funnier film that has a unusual violence that might cause shock or might cause some laughs (but it's impossible to laugh at the murder of Sailor's first victim with the head skull appearing in a pool of blood). Lynch's idea worked better with Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" and "Natural Born Killers" (yes, he wrote the film but didn't directed but the similarities between films are enormous, but "NBK" is more controversial, shocking and funnier after a couple of views). If Cage with Elvis impersonations and Dern with her dreamy voice sounds like cheap performances think again and watch the movie with a different perspective, you'll find all that very interesting, quite funny. But the most impressive performances here are delivered by Diane Ladd (Oscar nominated for her role) and Willem Dafoe playing a psychotic bank robber; his two best scenes are the one where she talks to Laura Dern in the motel room, and his departure from the story, one of the strangest things you're gonna see in films.The only thing that bothers me about this film is that it looks like Lynch haven't got nothing to say with this story. It is a impressive and stunning film, visually mesmerizing but it doesn't says nothing more than his complex and twisted works such as "Blue Velvet", "Mulholland Dr." and "Inland Empire". You watch these characters wandering around here and there, some accidents happening and lots of music in the background so....? and your point is...? For someone known as an adept of Meditation who constantly keeps us thinking on his works after it finishes and we never know what just happened ("Eraserhead" does that perfectly) this film seemed to simple for him and for its audience, except for the dark humor, and some innovations in story telling which makes of this film something memorable and outstanding, very different than some low quality, errant and devious things that sometimes we watch and call of "films".Don't give up while watching, you're gonna be surprised by the vast original elements displayed here, lots of fun. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>abnormal behavior</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch once admitted to making movies about things that frighten him, and after seeing this comedy-noir freak show it's obvious he must be terrified of criticism from the political Far Right. The film is a catalogue of nightmares guaranteed to offend any card-carrying conservative: heavy metal music, raw language, kinky sex and violence, a casual abortion, so on and so forth.The token storyline, adapted (rather freely) from a novel by Barry Gifford, follows two rebellious young lovers on the lam from an assortment of warped sideshow villains and the usual pathological refugees from Lynch's overwrought imagination. With its almost epic displays of bloodshed and sex the film certainly lives up to its title, but there's a disturbing sense of familiarity about it. By now the peculiar habits and dark obsessions of its director are too well known, and this postmodern nightmare only redefines the same evil undercurrents of his earlier 'Blue Velvet' on a bigger budget and even more outrageous scale.At its best (in some of the more offbeat digressions) the details are morbidly amusing in a way that recalls Fellini or Bu?uel, and the director's hallmark visionary style and outer-limit dream logic are still compelling. But a colorful rut is still a rut, and controversy for its own sake is always an artistic dead-end. In the end the film is just another excuse for Lynch to test how far he can push the censors, with results ranging from brilliantly perverse to just plain embarrassing, and not even the occasional arcane reference to The Wizard of Oz will endear the film to anyone but the most die-hard of the director's fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very experimental, but not Lynch's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throw all preconceptions of what you think a movie should or can be before watching David Lynch's disturbingly bizarre and highly experimental Wild at Heart. Everything comes loose for this odd tale of romance, horror, and disgust. It's about an oddball couple named Sailor and Lula, played excessively by Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern respectively. Sailor has just gotten out of jail and so he and Lula decide to break his parole and drive cross country to places like New Orleans and the little town of Big Tuna, Texas. Lula's mother hires a strange assortment of assassins to track down her daughter and her boyfriend and kill him. From here we are unexpectedly delivered a grotesque amount of shocking twists and turns that make you cringe with every strikingly disgusting moment of the film. It can be enjoyed, but it can also tip the film off the deep end into insanity, turning it into an in-cohesive and disturbing mess of a film. It's very raw and very experimental on Lynch's part, and I can respect him for that, but the final outcome left me feeling disturbed and deranged, rather than impressed.I can't bring myself to say that Wild at Heart is a bad film. It's not. It has lots of issues, but they are all issues brought about by Lynch developing a lot of his surreal and twisted style that he has perfected since then. Wild at Heart is very unpolished and unperfected, and that is something that definitely keeps it interesting. It is a very surreal experience, but so much so that you get lost in what it is trying to accomplish. The film is excessively weird and relies a lot on shock value from the audience. There are a lot of incredibly bizarre moments that break any and all cohesion this film has and it just drives it deeper into its deranged self. Lynch uses this film to experiment and toy with the art of cinema and storytelling through the abstract and surreal. The final outcome may have not been all there, but his motives are clear and the goal of the film is in sight, just slightly out of reach because of all the ridiculous oddities strewn about in the film.The characters in this film are just as bizarre as the style in which Lynch portrays them. The two leads are very disgusting and obscene characters that are hard to like, and they are also just plain weird. They aren't good people and they aren't respectable people. Plus the actors portraying them make them into caricatures more than multi-dimensional characters. Laura Dern acts her heart out, but plays it up in the most insane and wacky manner. Nicholas Cage takes it a step further and plays Sailor as the most overzealous and obnoxiously excitable character. I couldn't stand him. I'm not a Cage fan anyways, but his performance in this film was just ridiculous. The rest of the cast feel like adrenaline fueled nut jobs as well. I didn't feel any sympathy or remorse for any of the characters, but they are definitely strange enough to give the film its consistently off beat feel.The bottom line is that this film is insane. It gets pretty lost in itself, and definitely takes a dive into the dark pit of insanity. You have to be prepared going into this film because it is unlike anything you've seen before, as is the case with David Lynch films. Wild at Heart is a difficult film to get immersed in and you will certainly spend a lot of your time doing double takes and questioning why some of the bizarre and chilling depictions of sex and violence are being displayed on your screen and what ultimate purpose they are serving. This film has a right to be part of David Lynch's lineup of films though because it has a lot of bearing on where Lynch's style would go from there. The film is so surreal and so experimental that it loses a lot of its impact, but if you look at it through an experimental and artistic lens, it plays an important role in the David Lynch legacy. I didn't love this film but I can't hate it either. And as with most David Lynch films, I definitely feel like Wild at Heart deserves a few more viewings before I write it off as just another film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>genius or bulls**t?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watch it and decide for yourself! I remember when this film was first released and a french exchange student at the college I attended (big film fan like me) had seen it before I got the chance. We were having a cocktail at a club and I asked him what he thought of it. In his broken, but somehow beautiful English he responded, "Maybe genius or maybe bulls**t." I've seen it over a half dozen times and I'm still not sure.It's probably my least favorite movie by Mr. Lynch (excluding Dune which I don't count). I think that's because it's too straight forward and is a very faithful adaptation of Gifford's novel. It isn't pure Lynch. I don't really care about Sailor and Lula like Mr. Lynch's other films' leads: they're just too stupid. Lula is particularly annoying.So why the high ranking? Because Mr. Lynch still makes one hell of a movie filled with unforgettable scenes and characters. Wild at Heart has an intense visceral charge from beginning to end. There are moments that I will never forget:Bobby Peru making Lula beg for it; and every other second he's on screen. Dafoe absolutely explodes in this role. Marietta Fortune's face painted with lipstick, doing the wicked witch. Girl in Accident worried about her purse. Uncle Dell: "Making his LUNCH!" Johnnie Faraggut's gosh darn school boy infatuation with the wicked witch. 00 Spool: "My dog barks some. Mentally you picture my dog, but I have not told you the type of dog which I have. Perhaps you even picture Toto, from The Wizard of Oz."All great, which makes the movie great, just not quite as good as Mr. Lynch's true masterpieces. The film is a tour de force: technically, perhaps his most brilliant. No one can shoot and edit like Mr. Lynch. Terrific sound and music. It's still great fun after repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild at Oz but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch's 'Wild at Heart' revolves centrally around Sailor and Lula. Does it? We see Nicolas Cage as the wild and dashing young Sailor. An odd choice but that must have been Lynch's intention. Oddness is not new to Lynch's creations. Lynch repeats casting 'Blue Velvet' actress, the ever talented Laura Dern, as Lula. And, then of course, what would a Lynch movie be without numerous weird characters appearing from nowhere in order to disappear into nowhere? However, Lynch's 'Wild at Heart' seems to follow a mixture of an Oliver Stone - Terry Gilliam style. It is completely different from the colourful style he used in the excellent 'Mullholland Drive' and the the mind blowing 'Fire Walk With Me'. Yet, he uses emotions, eroticism, colour, violence and surprise to create a 'beautiful mess' and he makes fine use of the climate, camera angle and the sound. The common viewer will find 'Wild at Heart' easier to follow because of its seemingly 'coherent plot'. One may watch this is an adventurous black-comedy flick or a 'Pulp Fiction' type flick.Though in my opinion, 'Fire Walk With Me' and 'Mullholland Drive' remain superior because of Lynch's unique style. These two are pure Lynch movies and for me they were an experience in itself. Maybe they are not for the common viewer (who would more likely prefer a 'Wild at Heart') but I wouldn't classify myself as a common viewer.To sum it up, 'Wild at Heart' is worth a watch to both Lynch fans and non-Lynch fans (though the latter may be a little disappointed with regard to their expectations).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie but with a disappointing ending?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild at Heart" is a road-movie from David Lynch which tell us the love story between Lula (Laura Dern) and Saylor (Nicolas Cage). It's a thriller about a twisted story of love, death, murder and betrayal, but it ends in a very smooth and romantic way? It's the first time I saw "Wild at Heart" from the beginning to the end. I had already seen some parts of the movie before, but I hadn't seen the whole movie. On one hand it surprised me a bit since it's closer to the "usual" kind of cinema by David Lynch than I initially thought: It has mysterious and bizarre characters, close camera shots, weird dreams, uncontrolled burning flames, excellent soundtrack (and perfectly combined with the scenes), and many other features that we can see in other Lynch's films. But on the other hand I was disappointed by its ending? This movie, unlike his recent films, has a straight plot, one "easy" to understand, but OK, I was expecting it, so there's no problem about that?but that ending! It really disappointed me! So smooth, so romantic, so sweet? I can't recognize David Lynch there! With a different and more "Lynchian" ending I would score this film with a 9/10, but because of that I can't score it more than 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Wild at heart" is certainly (along with "Dune") the craziest movie of Lynch's crazy filmography. It's a sick and monstrous piece of art where a carnival of atrocity is shown in a romantic way, and where the wizard of Oz meets the strangest Rock'n'Roll attitude. Because there is no "Rock'n'Roll movie" if not this one.Let's begin with the beginning, when a trancing Nicholas Cage blows the head off of another sick guy. Then, he puts his finger toward Lula's mother, the "wicked witch". The rest fallows the same old and fast road : bank robbery, running away, road, movie, fire, perversions, dreams, fear, until Willem Defoe arrives, masked with a ghost's face, shooting everything that moves, before he blows himself away. That's the way it works with Booby Perou.Everything goes as fast as a Punk-Rock song, but at the end of the "yellow brick road", it's finally "Love me tender" that Sailor choose to sing to Lula.Nothing else to say, for this movie is a movie of few words, just sounds and images : so I'll just shut up and watch again this beautiful losers disappear in their own beautiful madness.</fullReview>

I really don't see the need for sex scenes in this movie, although in my favorite lynch movie 'Lost Highway' i thought the sex scenes were quite appropriate. Warning! This movie goes from sick, to sicker, to downright disturbing and is not for the faint hearted with graphic violence aplenty. It's interesting film, but it's just so typically lynch. I am becoming a tad bit sick of the randomness of his narratives. Not being one of lynch's best movies, it still is riotously entertaining romp. The performances of Cage and Dern are fantastic, and the film has a brilliant and Moving finale. What the film has to do with the Wizard of OZ, well don't ask me, Just sit back, watch, and soak in some of that pure lynch madness.Recommendation: Bring weed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Lynch's most enjoyable films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at Heart, like most of David Lynch's other films, takes us into a kind of exotic and surreal parallel universe. The ride this time is more enjoyable and somewhat less confusing (and possibly less profound) than usual, thanks largely to great chemistry between Nick Cage (Sailor) and Laura Dern (Lula) and an exceptional supporting cast of bizarre characters.The film is very cinematic in the classic sense of the word -- it combines all the elements of sound and sight to create the illusion of interior reality. The music is a combination of Badalamente's usual mellow jazz tones with significant classical works and some Elvis and other rockabilly thrown in, even with some heavy metal.I'd love to say some really illuminating things about the movie, but it really has to speak for itself. Like I said, I think the supporting cast is great. Casting Diane Ladd in the mother role was inspired, and she gives a truly horrific performance. I really enjoy Harry Dean Stanton in this one and Willem Dafoe does some of his very best work in the unforgettable role of "Bobby Peru", a small time hit man with bad teeth and a nasty sense of humor. Crispen Glover and Isabella Rossellini also appear in brief bits, and we even get a good cameo from long-time Lynch regular Jack Nance.One minor criticism -- I think Lynch's interest in dopplegangers (which was effectively used in "Lost Highway") kind of backfired here. Rossellini and Zabriskie's characters are so similar in appearance that the first few times I saw the movie I didn't realize they were different characters.I think at some points you could easily criticize the film for showing things that are un-necessary in terms of story and might feel like overkill -- for example the car crash Lula and Sailor come across or the Glover character who is obsessed with Christmas and cockroaches. But it's all intentional and I think works well in the film in terms of feeling and mood. The sense is that these are two good-hearted kids who as one says "got lost along the yellow brick road". It's Sailor and Lula's relative innocence and the intensity of their love that gives this film a lot of heart. The escalating series of events often seems unrealistic, sometimes totally absurd or surreal (as when he sings Elvis songs or when they are visited by Glinda), but it goes to emphasize that they are getting deeper and deeper into this bizarre world that lies outside their own cocoon. The parallels to Elvis and to the Wizard of Oz are interesting because, while not totally intellectualized, I think they represent the dream world of the characters.</fullReview>

William Dafoe's part is really haunting too, especially how he is introduced to us, the way he comes out of the dark. If you liked Blue Velvet you are bound to like this one.

		<fullReview>Wild at Heart is one of David Lynch's most conventional stories, which says something about Lynch as this film is very bizarre and full of surreal elements. Inspired by the Wizard of Oz, Wild at Heart is certainly a road movie with a difference. The strongest weapon in Wild at Heart's impressive arsenal is contrast. The stark contrast of the romance between the two main characters and the graphic violence and disturbing images puts this film at both ends of the film spectrum. Disturbing and twisted imagery is, of course, Lynch's forte so it is no big surprise that Wild at Heart is as dark as they come.No David Lynch film is complete without a collection of weird and wacky characters. There aren't many people better than Nicolas Cage at fronting a group of weirdoes and to this day, Wild at Heart remains one of Cage's best performances. Cage as Sailor is unhinged in this film. Armed with a snakeskin coat and wild eyes, Cage is very memorable. Laura Dern is brilliant at playing the hopeless romantic Lula and developed wonderfully from her performance in Blue Velvet. Dern is very sexy in her part and her and Cage are a terrific pairing. Dianne Ladd and Willem Dafoe provide excellent support. Ladd probably gives the best performance (was Oscar nominated) as the psychotic, over protective mother. Her facial movements are almost terrifying, she is that good. Dafoe is utterly revolting in this film, his sleazy demeanour is great to see. Twin Peaks and John Carpenter's Vampires star, Sheryl Lee also makes a nice cameo as The Good Witch.Like me, Lynch loves his heavy rock music so I really enjoyed the soundtrack to this film. The crunching guitar riffs during the animalistic sex scenes are very effective as they emphasise the nature of what is occurring visually. Contrast is also a feature in the music because whilst there is all this heavy music in the background, out will pop Cage performing an Elvis number. Very bizarre but very good.Wild at Heart is like watching Blue Velvet mixed with Wizard of Oz and it's fascinating. Lynch once again, gives the world a film to remember. A film that encourages us to use our imagination and expands our outlook on films. Wild at Heart casts a spell on anyone who dares to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In addition to the above mentioned cast, the band performing in the movie is called Powermad and the song they are performing is titled "Slaughterhouse" from their 1989 release Absolute Power. The album itself was a cross between Metallica and Overkill but was very well written and performed. Powermad was one of the bands that signed on to Combat Records for their so-called Bootcamp Series, releasing a self-titled EP that managed to win them a major label contract with Warner Bros. Records, rare for thrash metal bands at that time. A second Ep titled "The Madness Begins..." was released shortly thereafter that included a cover of the Ramones track "Gimme, Gimme, Shock Treatment". Unfortunately, the band went their separate ways shortly after their debut was released and has not resurfaced since. Here's the line up: Joel DuBay - Vocals and Guitars, Todd Haug - Guitars, Jeff Litke - Bass, Adrian Liberty - Drums</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World of David Lynch: Wild at Heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at Heart (1990) was David Lynch's revision of the Wizard of Oz. A tale about to lovers (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) who were never meant to fall for each other. Their road to happiness lies past a gauntlet of odd fellows and psychopaths who want to ruin their happy future. Not even the threat of death or incarceration will split these two love birds. Another surrealistic drama from the master of the oddity and madness David Lynch. Brilliant cinematography and solid acting from the entire cast makes this one a watchable winner.This movie has to be seen to be believed. A cast filled with a wide selection of actors (Wilhem Dafoe, Diane Ladd, Isabella Rossellini, and Crispin Glover) who all mesh in nicely under the effective direction of David Lynch. WILD AT HEART was made during his Twin Peaks phase of his career. He was juggling the t.v. series and a couple of films during this period. Like his other films, WILD AT HEART was ignored at the box office. Pretty soon his T.V. show suffered the same fate.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wildness -- One Ring To Rule Them All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Wild At Heart" remains true to its name. All the characters are driven by wildness. Wildness is the fine thread that runs through the course of the movie, binds the characters together, lurks behind the scenes, and tightens round events. Wildness is the one ring that rules them all.While sometimes free to reveal this wildness and at other times conceal it, characters appear frequently on the edge. Although most performances are good or at least satisfactory, they still run the risk of being over-the-top.There happen to be quiet a few villains in this film. But none of them reaches any way near Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth in Lynch's masterpiece "Blue Velvet". Booth's dominance, his nasty presence could be felt anywhere and everywhere in the picture. He alone can be compared with legendary modern villains like Anothany Hopkins' Dr. Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs".There are just so many references to "The Wizard Of Oz", one may even consider this film to be a bizarre post-modern "remake" of the original musical classic. Very much in David Lynch's line. In his own creative fashion, he successfully employs the well-known allegory about Emerlad City to make his point. Brilliant.Whether silhouetted against the void of the day or luminous opposite the dark of the night, the Wicked Witch evokes not only terror, but also understanding of the characters' situation.Lynch has the good sense not to use Oz as a subplot however. It sort of hovers above the main feature like a "superplot". In the sense that it not only helps unfold the story so far, but also provides room for some wild guess at the direction it may take on the yellow brick road.The only unconvincing import from the merry old land of Oz was the good witch. But then, I was never much impressed by the original one in the first place. She was, I used to tell myself, a necessary evil, like so many things in our real world. So unlike Oz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Granted, Wild at Heart does not represent the apex of Lynch's career (that'd go to either Blue Velvet or Mulholland Dr.), but it is still a far better film than much of his other work (actually, I think, all of his other work outside of the first few Twin Peaks episodes).The movie is a garish, melodramatic love story. There's some violence, some sex, and Nicholas Cage going absolutely insane.It's not a perfect movie, nor does it really have anything interesting to say; there is no point to this movie. As an exercise in stylish fun, though, it cannot be beat. Like the best of Brian DePalma's work, Wild at Heart is all window-dressing. Yet it looks so good, moves so fast, and is stocked with such interesting and grotesque characters that you cannot help but enjoy yourself (once you get past the couple, exceedingly violent moments).Certain people have a problem with movies that place style over substance. When they're as stylish as this movie, though, I have no problem at all (I have a much bigger problem with Lost Highway, for example). Wild at Heart is simply an exhilarating movie that, to be sure, appeals to an acquired taste. Not everyone will like it. If you like cartoonish melodrama, though, watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-The-Top Love Story by Lynch's Excellent Directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a simple road movie format rather than a complicated plot that he normally writes, David Lynch makes this over-the-top love story, almost exclusively relying on his excellent directing. Laura Dern, a second-timer for Lynch's films, is genuinely fitted into Lula, an impulsive and traumatized young woman, while Nicolas Cage convincingly performs Sailor, a young working-class man trapped in a twisted destiny. The two leads are undoubtedly the key factors for the film's achievement, but Lynch must be the one who elicits their superb performances. Side-characters, who commit perversive murders and sexual activities, are filled with Lynch's signature bizarreness in both appearances and personalities. Various kinds of music, from classical to Presley to heavy metal, collectively produce a timeless sense, another trademark of the director. A sort of happy ending is little compelling; this is one of the film's very few drawbacks but a big one, leaving the audience with a weakened final impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May contain Spoilers: In a strange sense in an even more strange artificial world, this movie really identified to me how intriguing dark characters can be portrayed and how intriguing dark movies are played out like this one! I loved this movie, it had a decent plot, but it wasnt the plot that took the cake, it was the characters, Nicolas Cage(even though I don't like much of his work and consider this one of his best) and Laura Dern shine in this movie and what makes them shine or their aurora's shine in David Lynch's dark atmospheric world is their creepy existence's. I would figure maybe there would not be one person like this in the world or a world so vigorously abnormal but I would think maybe there is or maybe there could be. Lynch is a unique director, he is different and alternative and thats what seperates him from most directors such as Scorsese and Spielberg is that his vision is more open minded really to a more kaleidiscope world where he use's his filmmaking as an art(which he does also in his spare time and uses it for inspiration). I like Lynch's world because its not only groundbreaking on film but it's a pleasure to watch something not like anything normal sometimes we watch on screen. People in their reviews had made references to this as being a wizard of oz tale and it had all the intangible characters portraying the fairy tale ode, you had Diane Ladd as the wicked witch, Laura Dern as Dorothy and well Nicolas Cage as.....Elvis! Throw Elvis in a land of David Lynch's appraised film or homage to the wizard of oz and it's one radical looking film or update to the masterpiece. Cage is beautiful in this movie and so is Dern as reckless young lovers on a journey to be rebellious against Dern's mother to be together , as she is trying to hire someone to end Sailors life. But another thing about this movie both on a good note and a sad note simultaneously is Diane Ladd's perfect portrait of a mother on the edge as you see her in every scene break down and erupt, she is in the middle of becoming a volcano or a snowball headed to hell, and in every scene she is magnificent and beautiful to watch. Watching Diane Ladd it was almost the same feeling of watching Ellyn Burstyn in Requiem for a dream , both characters in a sense give you this deep burden to carry with them as they struggle through the film with their depression and it becomes your depression to as you watch their characters fatigue slowly. What's sad is in both cases of actress's they do not get the credit they so righteously deserve , but then again your dealing with Hollywood and the only way to be a good actor or actress is to be a underappreciated, overlooked and underestimated one in my book!!!I would definately recommend this movie only to the strong minded , and to people who like a movie that culminate to their highest expectations of something of a different pace in a movie, something your not expecting or a old cliche that has been run into the same ground over and over and over with no different root or growth that will appear. David Lynch is a fantastic director with a heart of gold , instead of black or a detiorating red heart as some like to sum him up as. Just because he has a different, unique imagination than most directors in Hollywood is no reason to degrade, ridicule or bash the poor guy, he is just someone that has his own artistic style and taste with a flourishing appeal that I find suitable and necessary in his oddyseys of film....and for the most part without David Lynch and other unique's like him, film wouldn't reach and break the multitude of milestones that has been broken. 9/10BTW: I forgot to add how much I enjoyed the part towards the end with the good witch , Sheryl Lee who is another gifted actress was pleasing also!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Hilarious Lynch Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one just might take the cake in the "absurd comedy" genre. Nicholas Cage is Elvis and Laura Dern is Dorothy (her real life mother plays the Wicked Witch) in this post-modern allegory on fairy-tales and violence. Being a Lynch movie, this is never out-right said, only implied through image and action. Having been made in 1990, and subsequently winning the top prize at Cannes, the film was latter ravaged by critics yet paved the way for a string of films in the mid-1990's that defined a generation of film-makers lead by the likes of Tarantino. There never would have been a reception for "True Romance," "Pulp Fiction," or "Natural Born Killers" if it weren't for Lynch's folly that actually plays pretty well (and with much hilarity) all these years later now that this genre seems to have run itself into the ground. Kudos to Dafoe for out-Dafoeing himself and making himself truly the ugliest character to ever grace the screen (those teeth! that death scene! WOW). Also, an oddity for Lynch, in that it seems to have an overtly happy (and rocking good time!) ending. A must for Lynch fans, or anyone who love the movies they love more than they love Movies.</fullReview>

The characters "Reggie", "Santos" and "Perdita" also appear in another movie, for which Gifford wrote the script, named "Perdita Durango". Typical for Gifford: Tex-mex people and countryside, small but strange stories like that one with Griffin Jones, ehhr... explicit violence and guys starring which could have jumped off an Slayer video clip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent movie, but Lynch is not up to par</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie, and while I liked much of it, it didn't seem to me as profound as Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, or Lost Highway (the three other films I saw by Lynch). Acting in this movie is usually decent, but I have seen Laura Dern do much better acting. I wasn't expecting much from Nicholas Cage, but he was decent. The scenes with Diane Ladd were quite good- I especially liked the "lipstick" scene. It almost seemed like a reference to Lady Macbeth (out, damned spot!). Some of the Wizard of Oz references seemed a little too hokey, even for a Lynch movie, though they work with the modern "fairy-tale deconstructed" theme. Otherwise, it was fairly easy to follow (compared to Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive), and I think it was ultimately done well. If you want to see an excellent Lynch film, see Blue Velvet (easy to follow) or Mulholland Drive (difficult to follow but fun to figure out). If you want to see a fun and refreshingly different love story, see Wild at Heart. 7/10P.S I can't wait to see Eraserhead and the Elephant Man!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something tells me the Cannes jury was bribed that year....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I must say I'm one of David Lynch's biggest admirers, so many people won't agree with what I have to say about him. I have defended "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me," and this in the past so one can see that I am not the type who just looks at, say, "Mulholland Drive" and say "What the F***?" David Lynch is definitely one of the best and brightest film directors alive working today. I hope he makes more and more films that dazzle and baffle at the same time. One thing I love about his films is how they inspire such debate that makes the love/hate debate over films like "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Dancer in the Dark" seem tame in comparison. He seems to be capable of either being a saint or sinner of cinema with little wiggle room in between. In "Wild At Heart," he seems to display both traits quite irresponsibly. So many people have said this film is his most amateurish and I think I'm one of them, but it has enough good to balance the bad as well. There is enough talent, titilation and compassion to make the thing rewatchable and wonderful. However, there are also enough testosterone-induced inconsistencies and Elvis, Marilyn and "Wizard of Oz" fetishes that bubble to the surface that make Lynch's psyche seem like a swamp as opposed to the clear pool that it can so lovingly be.The cinematography by Frederick Elmes is among the worst I have ever seen, certainly inferior to Peter Deming's gorgeous work in "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Drive." It's a shame that Lynch didn't discover him earlier. Having read the book by Barry Gifford (who also co-wrote "Lost Highway") I know that Lynch made MANY changes to the film so that it would follow his structure of a Fairy Tale gone bad in the "real world." But, besides that, it seems to be also be a winning tribute to the pleasures of non-conformity and irresponsibility (ie. love). I really didn't think the cameos from the "Twin Peaks" gang was really that necessary, as was Nicolas Cage's deconstruction of his "Raising Arizona" role. But I thought that the Elvis impersonations and the threatening sexuality of Willem Dafoe and Isabella Rossellni (along with the girl who played the freak with leg braces) make it have the prescence of a real dream. I didn't care for the vignettes about Salior's past and Lula's family (possible alien abduction? whatever!), but the music made the medicine go down quickly! Every note that's played in this film is classic! I really don't see why this was a Palm d'ore winner (but, then again, why was "Dancer in the Dark?") Maybe the jury just liked "Blue Velvet" a little TOO well. As with always with Lynch, the acting is top-notch (with the exception of Laura Dern, who just keeps pouring it on and seems so much smarter than that). The darkness does fall a little flat (Mr. Raindeer just didn't amuse me) at times, but there are some good ideas as well ("buffalo hunting..." sounds like a precursor to "silencio..."). I loved the locations (so refreshing from Lynch's usual backwoods/Hollywood settings), the drab cinematography even makes places like New Orleans and a desert hideaway seem SCARY as opposed to beautiful. Lynch's porno references are a bit much, but not nearly as rediculous as what he made Marilyn Manson do in "Lost Highway." Scenes like the Lula's desert radio freak-out, Henry Dean Stanton's death, and Sailor's stopping a bar-band's performance to sing to Lula are worthy of the Best-of Lynch, but the whole thing reeks of Freudian mother worship and beastily confusion. However, if you like Troma or John Waters' films, you really can't go wrong with this southern-fried Lynch tidbit. Besides, it made a star of Chris Issak, so it can't be THAT bad...."Have you been noticin' the build-up in traffic?" -Lula (Laura Dern)</fullReview>

Those were some really great opening visuals, you know, the credits? But, weren't they kind of fruity? Gee, I never really thought about them that way. Nolan, they were. Oh, no matter. Lynch is working on a T.V show, so he'll be with us in a minute or two, but for now he's a little busy. I read in Video Watchdog about the torrid affair between David Lynch and Mary Sweeney. Why would their affair be in Video Watchdog? Have you seen Mary? Lynch looks constantly confused, but has some wonderfully grinchey ideas.

Lynch begins the film as he means to go on, with a disturbing scene where Cage practically tears a man apart with his bare hands. Then we get over two hours of self-conscious weirdness and gross-out moments, including the aftermath of an incestuous rape, a couple of gruesome car wrecks, Wizard of Oz references, oddball reminisences (none of which are particularly interesting), Monty Python-style gory set-pieces, dribbling inbred outcasts...it's all so much garbage, lavishly served up in Lynch's expensive trashcans. Like one of those annoying college tutors spinning his pretentious theories and daring you to pick fault or point out the flaws (because you just know he'll crush you with condescending sarcasm), Wild At Heart is best avoided.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was actually the second Lynch film I saw...Lost Highway being the first and after seeing Wild At Heart, I found myself wondering why Lynch made such a piece of crap like Lost Highway (which I didn't mind till I saw this) This is simply put, a strange, strange movie and I wouldn't watch it any other way. The plots a little hard to put into words but in a nutshell, it's a love story with Nicholas Cage who put a new spin on a character he'd been playing many times by now and Laura Dern who is a welcome additon to any indy movie she lends her name too. The two go on the run and are pursued by numerous people most notably the mother from hell. Rounding out the cast is the usual band of Lynch weirdos featuring Crispin Glover and William Dafoe.First off, what gets you right into this movie is the dialogue. Every last line is worth paying attention to and even when it seems incredibly out of place and this tends to happen a lot it's still entertaining.Next up on the great aspects of this flick once again brings me to the cast. Nicholas Cage a few years before oscars gives a performance that's oscar worthy in itself. Laura Dern is terrific as always, William Dafoe gives the only performance of his that I liked and everyone else falls into place perfectly and keep things moving. Music is also another perfect for this movie as I didn't like all the songs they used but all of them where still bang on.The only downside to it as due to it's sheer strangeness...causal viwers may be turned off by this or pass it over completly. Still, this movie which pays homage to numerous things most notably Wizard of Oz is worth at least one shot as it's another classic example of a good independent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The last good David Lynch film (Fire Walk With Me doesn't count because it was basically a double episode, and Lost highway had some moments, but as a whole really tanked!) This has everything I've come to expect from a David Lynch film....odd scenes, eerie background characters, fantastic Badelamenti soundtrack, great twisted atmosphere and amazing cinematography...The story is an amusing, a bare-bones parallel to the Wizard of Oz (and most of the references were amusing except for that horrid 'good witch' scene at the end...). And the story has good pacing, and great tone. Hell, even the plotless scenes were mostly excellent (some were the best of the film!) I especially liked the nightclub scene and the Big Tuna trailer park scene (Jack Nance was *awesome*!!)The cast were pretty much perfect...Nick Cage, who's so up and down that every second movie of his sucks, was perfect in this one. I just don't understand Cage, who's made so many good films and so many *awful* ones... He's done this role before (see Raising Arizona) and he always plays the redneck Elvis well...Laura Dern was alright...she shrieks *way* too much though, and it takes away from her otherwise solid performance. Diane Ladd was the *really* annoying one. I cringed every time she was on screen, which I suppose is the point (as the evil witch) but still, she was the one great flaw in this gem.Willem Dafoe was brilliant (those teeth frighten me...and they look so real too!) I've yet to see Willem Dafoe in a role I didn't appreciate, but he rocks here! (his death is classic as well.The gore was a bit over the top here, though. Lynch had obviously been watching too much Troma, as it was mostly cartoon and just silly. As were the excessive sex scenes (cartoon and silly, that is) but they didn't detract too much from the film, though he should stick to being odd and give up on the cheeze.The car crash scene was too much. I suppose it signaled the breakdown on the Yellow Brick Road, but it was frivolous and cheezy (and Sherilynn Fenn, who outside of Twin Peaks has always looked better than she acted, didn't help much). It could easily have been dropped without a blink, along with the later accident (oh look: more trivial gore...)The ending also needs work; cheezy and simpering, it fell flat from where it could have gone. As soon as he went to jail the second time the film just broke down and died. Of course it had to have a romantic happy ending, but Lynch seemed to run flat out of ideas...Overall: a good, solid Lynch film, fans will probably appreciate it even more. Odd and bizarre...typically Lynch (and actually quite tame compared to most of his films). Could have been better, but not too much better (but somebody drop a safe on Diane Ladd and put me out of my misery!!!) 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler alert!When this film was released theatrically in the states much was made of the scene where Willem DeFoe's character blows his head off with a shotgun. Because of the threat of an NC-17 rating David Lynch added a smoky haze to the sequence to mute the blood and flying head. Watching the widescreen edition of the film last night on IFC I noticed that this effect was absent and the shot was seen in all its Technicolor glory!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the film I showed an old girlfriend to PROVE that I could sit through a 'romantic' film. Now that I've actually seen it alone, I can safely say that Lynch works wonderfully well with the Barry Gifford story, conjuring each page onto the screen with near-perfect vividness. It's a film better watched alone, without the tedium of temporary love gnawing at the air beside you.Having read the book, and the sequel anthology, "Sailor's Holiday," I have a certain affinity to this film. Others may not, possibly due to their view of what a 'David Lynch' film should be, or perhaps, like my girlfriend, they set themselves up for something entirely different before the opening credits began to roll. I for one hold no reservations about his artistry. I disliked Lost Highway and wasn't too impressed with his short films, but all of them add something interesting and unique to the world. And Wild at Heart is VERY interesting, if not a little unique.Definitely not for everyone, but highly recommended for those who can cast aside a few inhibitions and expectations. Wild at Heart is not in my top 10, but it's beyond and above the vast majority of Hollywood productions.A word of warning: if you are a smoker, be glad that you didn't see it at the theater and do not watch it in a non-smoking environment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's nadir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From feverishly obsessive near-masterpieces ("Eraserhead,""Blue Velvet") to provocative near-miss ("Lost Highway") to beautifully wrought mainstream exercises ("The Elephant Man,""The Straight Story") David Lynch has proven himself an intriguing, original filmmaker, but "Wild at Heart" is one of the most hateful experiences I've had in 35 years of film going (the only other film I can readily think of that rivals "Wild At Heart" for sheer repugnance is Roger Avery's execrable "Killing Zoe.") This film comes from a period when Lynch was obviously believing his own press. Like "Twin Peaks" (which for me went from mildly amusing to enervating and tedious in very short order), "Wild At Heart" presents Lynch being weird for weird's sake; shocking for shock's sake, with none of the dark, unsettling absurdity that marked "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet." Instead of taking the exploration of the themes of his earlier films to new depths (as in "Lost Highway') or heading into fresh territory (as in "The Straight Story"), Lynch gives his worshipful cult exactly what he thinks they want. There is nothing daring or original about "Wild At Heart." The allusions to "The Wizard of Oz" are just a tired, simplistic tool to glue the film together between outrages, the acting is goonish and self-important, and the film's view of the characters themselves is extremely vicious and condescending. This is not a humane exploration of people on the fringes. These characters are "hillbillies" and "niggers," and "aren't we lucky we're better than them." Even Sailor and Lulu, the two love struck protagonists, are shallow, contemptible "white trash" mannequins, propped up to hang Lynch's cultural cache on. A dispiriting, repellent, altogether worthless film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An appalling indulgence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a number of people who will trawl through David Lynch's films, lauding and praising each one for their apparently daring originality, their unusual and often incoherent narratives and the general level of weirdness on display, frequently concluding that the man is a genius who remains at the forefront of greatest American film-makers. I count myself in that group. No other modern writer/director has proved as consistently surprising and challenging as Lynch and managed to disturb and provoke in such intelligent fashion. But there are certain parameters necessary for the Lynch cocktail to work its magic. In his most successful films, there are in place certain constraints which are being pushed against, sometimes the quiet etiquette of suburban blandness, behind which all manner of desires and perversions seethe (Blue Velvet, Twin peaks, Lost Highway). Lynch has used this contrast to strong effect in other settings as well, such as the mannered hypocrisy of Victorian England (The Elephant Man) where men try to find solace and dignity or the dislocated and simple lives of Mid-West Americans 9The Straight Story) where one man's strength and determination slowly teaches them a little more about themselves. In Wild at Heart however, his most Lynchian and least effective film to date, there are no such constraints on either characters or director, so they all indulge their every whim. From the violent opening Lynch signals a ride of freewheeling excess is on the cards, but that excess is not grounded in any kind of stable centre and the overall effect is one of numb indifference. The basic plot is anther spin on the lovers-on-the-run theme, with just-out-of-prison Ripley (Cage) and naughty-rich-girl Lula (Dern) fleeing her horrific mother, Marietta (Dern's real-life mother, the insanely Oscar nominated Diane Ladd) and the loser (Stanton) she has assigned to wipe out Ripley because of some raging sexual jealousy left over from Ripley's rejection of her years before. From here on the story becomes largely irrelevant, since this is Lynch's arena and he uses it to dredge up all manner of over-wrought set-pieces, dream sequences and "symbolism", which are largely pretentious and uninviting, such as the sex scene where we repeatedly fade to each colour of the rainbow. Of course this is in keeping with the film's endless Wizard of Oz motifs, which are purely superficial and add nothing, since Lynch provides neither a worthy homage to that film or an interesting critique of its place in American culture (although he seems to think he has done both). There are less obvious "Oz" reference points which this film deconstructs, such as the death of the all- American family and the surreal nature of the open road, but it is hard to avoid the feeling that Lynch is simply keeping up his everything-goes ethic which permeates the film (or maybe just throwing a bone to those who enjoy spotting that kind of thing). This is not to say W.a.H. is a complete failure. Lynch is still an inventive and controlled visual director and at least some of his black humour comes off well, but these qualities lose their impact when there is a void of genuine suspense or intrigue. This is the one film which sees Lynch the film-maker pandering to "Lynch" the brand name, offering his fans all their favourite ingredients from his previous films, exploiting them to the full and removing the limitations which made those facets of his personality interesting in the first place. Ultimately, how you view Wild at Heart depends on whether you find this tedious or enthralling. Few, I imagine, will fall in-between.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sex, violence and David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this film has always been my favorite David Lynch film. the combination of ultra-violence, explicit sex, quirky characters and dialogue, and a unique directorial approach to the material is quite potent and satisfying.it's essentially a road movie with Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern being the lovers on the run. but, after being filtered through the warped sensibilities of writer/director David Lynch this movie takes on a life and style of it's own making.the film is extremely violent at times and comes close to being unwatchable during certain scenes, but they make their brutal point and actually have a point and are well integrated into the plot.the numerous graphic sex scenes act more as punctuation marks and while explicit, are not drawn out and are usually shown as fast cuts.while it's not perfect by any means, this film is the closest i think David Lynch has come to finetuning his unique and warped vision into his most coherent film to date.definitely check it out if you're in the mood for something dark and different, and don't forget your snake skin jacket when you do.rating:8</fullReview>

If you haven't seen it some scenes in "Wild" just become very strange.Ok, the movie is strange and weird like most of David Lynch's work, but personally this is my Lynch-favorite. It's raw but beautiful. Cage and Dern make sense together, and in the end the whole movie actually makes sense to. Finally there is the excellent acting by Dafoe and Stanton which add up to two hours of postmodern excellence.</fullReview>

Well interntioned movie, but just too unpleasant. The one's Lynch has made since aren't too great either. I consider Blue Velvet and Eraserhead his masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WILD AT HEART is a twisted but enjoyable road movie about 2 lovers who are on the run from a mother who is destined to stop that love. Some say it inspired Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS but I didn't catch that at all. Although the movie is chock full of Tarantino-esque scenes, it seems to be closer to TRUE ROMANCE than anything else. David Lynch seems to have an uncanny ability to get under your skin with movies like this one, but he does it in a very subtle way. The characters and the events in this movie at one angle seem totally outrageous but then again seem very real and even ordinary. Be sure and pay close attention to Willem DaFoe's mishap with the shotgun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weird and bizarre movie, but one of Lynch's easiest to understand.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What we have here beneath it's bizarre exterior is a fairly normal love story/on the run type of movie. The plot itself isn't too strange, and despite some unexplained incidents, anybody could understand the vast majority of this movie. Despite how easy to understand this generally is, this is still a Lynch movie, and it feels like 100% Lynch straight through. The characters are original and eclectic, and some are absolutely horrible, while some are quite likable, and several are just raging lunatics. That's what this movie is. It's a love story and a road movie, with a raging lunacy that no other movie, not even Lynch's own "Blue Velvet" has.Sailor (Nicholas Cage) brutally murders a man in self defense and is put in prison for almost two years. When he gets out, his old girlfriend Lula (Laura Dern) is there to pick him up. Lula can't return home because her mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd), a mentally unstable woman, will try to kill Sailor. Marietta sends a lover and private detective, Johnny Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton) to find Lula's whereabouts, and as a just in case, she sends a hardcore murderer, Stantos (J.E. Freeman) on Sailor's case. To add to the mix, Sailor ends up meeting Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe), and from there, in summation, chaos ensues.The characters bring out the emotions they are supposed to. Nicholas Cage is a confused young man, but he is likable, and the audience cares what happens to him. Laura Dern is an edge of reason to the movie, and she is also very likable. Diane Ladd...well, her role needs to be seen, not described...she's a pathetic woman. Even Harry Dean Stanton, who is supposed to be a murderer is very likable. The only actor who eventually chewed up the scenery too much, was Willem Dafoe, who is almost interchangeable with Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) from Lynch's Blue Velvet. Dafoe made the film hard to tolerate, and his character made the second act of the film less enjoyable than the first.Like most of Lynch's work, this one really needs a close analysis to get everything. Little scenes stick out, and there are probably hidden meanings behind them, but on the surface all they are, are Lynch being zany. And many of these zany scenes are thrown in the movie, and these scenes are what makes this movie so loony. A random story featuring Crispin Glover is thrown in, and a scene featuring Grace Zabriskie are extremely strange. And Diane Ladd, who is just brilliant in her own crazy way.This movie has a straightforward plot, and seems like it could be enjoyed by a wider audience than most of Lynch's works. Still, this is a strange movie, in a similar vein to Blue Velvet, but different in it's own way. If you like David Lynch, you'll be sure to love this.My rating: *** out of ****. 122 mins. R for strong sexuality, violence, language.</fullReview>

He truly is my favorite director and amazes me with just about every film he does. This movie disturbed me quite a bit but also blew me away and it is a great addition to my David Lynch collection.I thought the story of Wild at Heart was the greatest part, which should be true with any great film. It is disturbing and intense with awesome references to Elvis and The Wizard of Oz. It is bizarre but much more accessible than most of his films. And though I prefer his ambiguous films, this is definitely top notch as well.Acting doesn't get much better than this. Laura Dern is awesome as well as Diane Ladd, Willem Dafoe, Harry Dean Stanton and even Nicolas Cage, who I usually hate. They were all wonderful and really brought a lot of life to their characters. Lynch really understands how to direct actors.Lynch fans will be pleased with this romance/thriller. See it soon if you fall into that category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Wizard of Weird</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any of David Lynch's films could be called "sweet" or "heart-warming" 'Wild at Heart' might be the one. It's bizarre and deeply disturbing which is part and parcel of watching a Lynch work, but it has an underlying fancifulness that kept me from turning away, except sometimes, from the Lynch's through-a-glass-darkly view of the world around us. There is only one character that gave me the absolute heebie-jeebies and that is Willem Dafoe's Bobby. Dafoe usually gives me the creeps anyway but here he plays an utterly dangerous and insane maniac at loose in the depths of the Texas desert. Isabella Rossellini's Dorothy Vallens from 'Blue Velvet' has relocated from South Carolina to Big Tuna, Texas and has not improved her lot in life. Her mother is played by the great actress Grace Zabriskie, they too offer a few moments of cringing repulsion, but all in all the story centers around the deep and abiding love of Sailor and Lula, Cage and Dern. Nicolas Cage gives a highly engaging performance of basically good soul trapped on a nasty path, he's also very sexy. I didn't think Laura Dern had such 'reach' in her acting abilities but she is tremendous in this role.I found myself sympathetic to their plight resulting from poor Sailor not having proper parental guidance as a child and Lula having one of those horrible vampire-mothers. Diane Ladd gives Marietta (mom) a jaw-dropping performance and rips the big screen away from everyone else when she appears. This is still a film that will make you squirm and probably shouldn't be watched too soon before going to bed, a rule of thumb for all Lynch movies, except Dune, which doesn't count. 'Wild at Heart' is not at all difficult to follow, unlike 'Lost Highway' and Mulholland Drive'. It has a clear-cut story with a sweet under-tone based on 'The Wizard of Oz'. It's a modern, sleazy version of 'Romeo and Juliet' the Lynch film that I have watched the most of them all, aside from 'Twin Peaks' to which I have become addicted.Recommended for those who have shied away from Lynch-World, but not for the kiddies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't turn away from love Sailor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what I personally consider to be a great masterpiece of shock-like dream-work film-making, Wild At Heart explodes onto the screen in a surreal swirl of intense absurdity. Yet the plot and characters follow a true love story through a wonderfully shocking realism that literally digs into the viewers soul and draws him/her in. I truly loved this picture above all others. When Nicholas Cage (Sailor) sings "Love Me Tender" to Laura Dern (Lulu) at the end of the picture I find myself bubbling, burbling and sheathed in a great and glowing light of rapturous wonder. David Lynch has come to an epiphany of self creativity with this picture, and yet one has to be a little "wild at heart, and weird on top" perhaps to truly appreciate this film's luster. Strange and absurd characters abound throughout, and every scene is significantly twisted into it's own fabric of intensity and sexual energy. With a grand diversity of musical rifts, this movie rocks. The Wizard of Oz, and Elvis Presley are metaphors that keep cropping up in this film. Diane Ladd, who plays Lulu's mother, Marietta, carries much of the emotional and surrealistic tone with her maniacal portrayal of motherly jealousy and hatred toward her daughter's chance at the one true love she could never find. Harry Dean Stanton, Willem Dafoe, Isabella Rossallini, Grace Zabriske, Sheryl Lee (as the good witch), and the entire rest of the cast all shine in this tale, a lattice work of consistent intensity and aesthetic unveilings where two lovers try to find whatever happiness they can "down that old yellow brick road". As Sailor and Lulu desperately try to escape their twisted pasts, a string of relevant adventures follows them as they try to run from the evil characters who have corrupted their lives back home. Driving their way toward California via New Orleans and Texas they run out of money in the town of Big Tuna, Texas. Throughout this ordeal, they are chased by forces wickedly employed by Lulu's mother and her evil associates. Sailor is finally forced into the choice of committing a crime against his better judgement, and it turns out badly. But after this violently troubling episode there is a happy and wonderful ending. It is still weird and wild (of course) when Sailor finally gets to meet his son Pace after a 6 year stint in prison (which takes about 3 minutes in movie time). In one of my favorite scenes near the end of the picture, Sailor suddenly decides he can never fit in and care for his family like he should after he is just released from prison, so decides to leave temporarily, but not before giving his little son Pace (whom he has just met) this advise. "If ever things don't seem right to you. . .remember what Poncho said to the Cisco kid. 'Let's win before we're dancin at the end of a rope' ". Then he walks off; intent on leaving before more wonderfully absurd circumstances bring him out of his delerium and back to his true love, Lulu and Pace. It is somehow weirdly and consistently funny and wonderfully fun to watch. Anyway, I truly loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother and father versus daughter or son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple film by David Lynch. Of course you have suspense. Of course you have a good thriller. Of course too you have a good love story and gangster story intertwined. But there is something more than that in this simple film. David Lynch, for an unreasonable, i.e. unexplainable, reason decides to have a good sentimental positive ending. That enables us to draw a lesson from the rest of the film and transform a simple gangster story into a philosophical story about family and parents. A possessive mother can destroy everything around her but there is no reason for the daughter to yield and the daughter will always win against her possessive mother. Even evil witchcraft, or mafia gangsters, will not save the mother's stake. On the other side the father is an indispensable presence in the life of a child, be he a boy or she a girl. The possessive mother will get rid of the father if necessary just like she will get rid of her own lover if he stands in the way of her possessive schizophrenia (to commit suicide with lipstick, ah ah ah). But the father will survive for the daughter as a target to attain and recreate in the man she will choose to love, be impregnated by and "marry" in a way or another. But what's more the child born from this union will need a father and will recognize him at first sight even six years after his birth or so. Is this line, this thread going along all David Lynch's films? Maybe not so clearly but yes there is a family problem in all films, a link with some kind of a family, a father, a mother, an aunt, or someone else. The happy ending of this film and the way it is constructed at the very last minute in a very spectacular flight and return scene and then exploited through all the credits seem to show this family link is the essential link in the back of David Lunch's (at least ) subconscious mind. Well done and rather entertaining. And I loved the Deep Creek, Gulch, Stream, Bay or whatever, but Deep anyway, in the middle of a desertic nowhere somewhere in Texas, if it is Texas. As for the setting of some deep tragedy in the deepest layers of the minds of the characters or the dregs of society it is perfect with a heroin called Fortune and a hero called Sailor, that is wet with humor and damp with wit.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barmy. Bizarre. Beautiful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For such a downright bizarre film, Wild at Heart has got a surprisingly large cult following. Even though its wacky, surreal and completely out there, people love debating this film. They love to ponder it. And I must confess...so do I.If you're familiar with David Lynch's work, then you know what a kooky filmmaker he is. He's right up there with Tim Burton. Maybe even more so. A lot of Lynch's films come with an absurdist atmosphere that is at times infuriatingly difficult to crack. But it is worth the effort. Beneath the surrealism and oddball characters packed into his films is a rich and fascinating subtext. And Wild at Heart is one of Lynch's most absorbing efforts.Wild at Heart takes the basics of a road trip formula, and transforms it into a stunning journey of self-expression as well as discovery. Lynch would explore this territory again to equally breathtaking effect in the beautifully resonant The Straight Story, by far his best film.The film focuses on a modern day pair of star-crossed lovers, Sailor Ripley and Lula Fortune (Nicolas Cage &amp; Laura Dern). Lula is dominated by her obsessive control freak of a mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd, Dern's real life mother). But Sailor opens Lula's eyes to a world beyond her mother's front door. Alas, Sailor ends up in prison for two years after he kills a man sent by Marietta to kill him.While on parole, he hooks up with Lula, and the two set off on the journey of their lives. All the while, Marietta sends numerous PI's and hit men after them to kill Sailor once and for all.It may take some time for Wild at Heart to work its magic over you. Because its quite a difficult film to enjoy at times. But it is a near-masterpiece. You just have to look hard enough.All the most rewarding moments are between Cage and Dern. Their scenes together crackle with a real voracious, sexual kick. And Lynch knows that too. He shoots many of their lovemaking scenes in a dangerous red. To the point that it becomes unbearable. These are lovers with energy to burn. Which might explain the frequent closeups of smoked cigarettes to symbolise that point.And Lynch utilises Angelo Badalamenti's musical score to exhilarating effect. Alternately moody. Wistful. Tragic. The music is so accessible and perfectly attuned to the material it almost tells a story in of itself.Of all the films Nicolas Cage has starred in, Wild at Heart must count as his finest. The character of Sailor is a part that fits him like a glove. A travelling dreamer who defiantly defends his individuality in a world out to crush his free-thinking spirit. And although Sailor has no desire for violence, he is prepared to use it when he sees which way the wind is blowing. Cage also gets to show off his surprisingly fine singing voice. Doing some pretty nifty Elvis impersonations.Laura Dern is also at the top of her game here. At first glance, Lula appears to be a brainless piece of trailer-trash. But Lynch uses an interesting technique of multilayered flashback sequences to penetrate the levels of Lula's past. And over the course of the film, through a combination of Dern's acting and Lynch's direction, Lula engages your sympathies without you even realising.Diane Ladd turns in an astonishingly broad performance that threatens to teeter into parody at any moment. But the surprising thing is, her OTT theatrics are quite in character. That may go over your head the first time. But she does know when to dial it down. Her relationship with her daughter is quite an astute blend of domineering control and genuine concern. Although it may take several viewings before you pick up on that.Wild at Heart is punctuated with frequent layers of bizarreness. Some hover at the edges. Others spill over into the narrative. Such as Willem Dafoe's Bobby Peru, a detestable louse who ropes Sailor into crime. The scene where he corners Lula in a motel room, threatening her into sexual submission is not only alarming, but physically draining. You are quite relieved when that scene is over.The film is also mind-bogglingly obsessed with the Wizard of Oz. References crop up everywhere. Sailor and Lula's road-trip is compared to the Yellow Brick road. In Lula's mind, her mother resembles the Wicked Witch of the West. And at the height of inspired lunacy, Sailor receives a divine vision from Glinda, the Good Witch of the North (played by none other than Twin Peaks' Laura Palmer!), who inspires him to renew his relationship with Lula.As things draw to a close, it seems for a time our hopes for Sailor and Lula's love will be dashed. And Lynch does a superb job making it seem that way. But the final scene, when Sailor sings Love Me Tender to Lula, the song he promised to sing to his wife is a scene that's quite lovely. And you realise its a moment the whole film has been building up to. I love the way it plays out over the end credits. It ends the film on the perfect note.Touching. Disturbing. Never less than inspiring, Wild at Heart is a searing love story beautifully played by all. And one of David Lynch's most intriguing films to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wild at Heart is shocking, moving, strange, sexy, terrifying, and super cool. I recently saw this for the second time and had forgotten how intense the violence is, and how awesome the love story is between Sailor and Lula. The chemistry between Laura Dern and Nicholas Cage is absolutely brilliant. Theirs is a love with all the craziness of teenagers and all the energy of rock stars. And all the weirdness of David Lynch. The other characters on display are equally intriguing. Isabella Rossellini, Willem DaFoe, Crispin Glover, and Harry Dean Stanton all add up to more than the sum of their parts.If you're into a surreal experience this evening and don't have any LSD, check this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some might say a movie such as this one is one of those films "you either get..... or you don't". I would have to disagree, because I "sort of" get it. I just won't fret over this fact. David Lynch films will do this to a person. His genius is a type that not all will understand.I so enjoy his cinematic visuals with the simple everyday acts. For example, in the way he films the lighting of a cigarette. A simple everyday act , but so tied into the plot of the storyline. He seems to have fine tuned this aspect since Eraserhead. His earlier visuals were quite drawn out and only for the truly patient. But that's another comment board.** spoiler alert **______---------__________---------__________-----------_______Final thought: And just when I thought Dennis Hopper could not be "outcreeped" in one of David Lynch's films, along comes William DeFoe. What a fantastic performance. The movie was worth it on this count alone. Peace out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was a very young teenager.I thought it was so out of this world mesmerizing that I wanted to see it a second time and share it with a guy I had a crush on it.He was several years older and the movie scared the hell out of him.I realize now, years later, after seeing Wild At Heart many more times that he was just a fantastically unhip square pansy.Maybe I'm a little biased because I'm a Lynch myself and David Lynch is the spitting image of my great grandfather, but this movie is a total work of art IMHO.The movie is very dark and lurid in many respects, but it adds to the overall tone of the movie. And at its core, Wild At Heart is the perfect romantic comedy for anyone who is a rebel at heart !Oh and do watch it on Widescreen DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wizard of Oz, Elvis Singing, "weird on top" why???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a mess. It had some good aspects, but for the most part it was just kind of stupid. I didn't like the wizard of oz parts in the movie, they seemed totally out of place. The worst wizard of oz tie in was when Nick Cage gets beat up at the end (totally random) and the good witch starts talking to him up in the sky. The girls mother was totally psycho, made me uncomfortable when she was in scenes because she screams a lot and makes you cringe. This movie is almost comedic in how dumb parts are. Like when Nick Cage is in that club jumping around kicking the air and going crazy, it made me laugh and reminded me of the scene in Ace Ventura. Probably my least favorite aspect of this movie is when Nick Cage starts singing for no reason. At the end I think he sings an Elvis song or something, it's so dumb it makes me irritated to watch it. Oh yeah this movie has one of the worst lines ever, "This whole world's wild at heart and weird on top." I really wish they would have left that line out of the movie like David Lynch originally did (I watched the extras and found out the author asked him to put it in). Probably my favorite aspect of the movie was Willem Dafoe and the Duck sounding guy. Willem Dafoe plays a creep so well in this movie. I love the bank robbery part of the movie it was great. I might have given this movie a 7 if not for the Elvis singing and good witch at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Lynch movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two breakout performances (Cage and Dern), fantastic imagery and the most wonderfully twisted characters are what makes this movie a true standout. I just saw it again yesterday after not having seen it since it was out on video some 15 years ago, and all i really remembered was a truly creepy Willem Dafoe and Cage singing Love me Tender to Dern on top of their car at the end. Needless to say, it is so much more than that. It is a love story on acid, and a great one at that. You might say that it's David Lynch's attempt at writing the greatest love story ever, and it certainly has it all. Plus, it was fun to see some of the later Twin Peaks cast members in their various cameos (also it's evident that at least part of the "Twin Peaks style", with almost hypnotizing music to fit these extremely weird characters is something that Lynch started with in this one.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far my favorite David Lynch film and perhaps my favorite movie that I've ever seen. To put it in a genre, I guess it would be a road movie; since the two main characters (Nick Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula) are on the road the entire movie. The premise is that Sailor killed a man out of self-defense and Lula's mother goes crazy trying to kill him. So Sailor and Lula run off, breaking Sailor's parole, in an epic journey of love and adventure.The direction of this film reminds me of a mix of Quentin Tarantino's creative in-your-face violence and pop culture savvy, with the far out craziness of a Stanley Kubrick film. However, the two elements combined are pure Lynch. This is the most conventional narrative I've seen from David Lynch. Both Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway went freely in and out of reality and fantasy, leaving the viewer with lots of brain food to snack on for days after viewing the film. Blue Velvet, however a pretty linear story, was a violent whirlwind of crazy evil and unreal suburban wholesomeness(not that that's at all a bad thing). Wild at Heart, though, had Lynch trademark crazy characters and weird happenings, but he really allowed the audience to follow the somewhat simple story of Lula and Sailor uninterrupted.I also really enjoyed the motif's that Lynch placed throughout the film. The flames of the matches whenever Lula and Sailor made love, the recurring shot of the fire, and about a billion references to the wizard of oz gave this film a close yet surreal quality.And any review of Wild At Heart is not complete without a mention of Laura Dern and Dianne Ladd's performances. Lula is so vulnerable right from the beginning, but Sailor makes her strong, and Dern portrays that with the most realism and sympathy one can in a world where you meet munchkins at bars and Glenda the Good Witch in parking lots. The final scene where she cries "Sailor!" with such desperation would make a grown man cry. And her real life mother, Dianne Ladd, also gives an impeccable performance as her whacked out mother/antagonist/wicked witch of the east. The scene where she smears lipstick all over her face is so powerful and that's all on her.Any Lynch fan or Lynch hater should see Wild at Heart. In my opinion, the director's best work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>abysmal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt compelled to write a review here given the positive feedback that this movie somehow got. This is by far the worst David Lynch film I have ever seen and one film I wished I never bothered renting. The acting is mediocre. Cage, although a talented actor on occasion, her exemplifies what happens if he does not have a good director. This is the really terrible side of Cages abilities, the overacting, the lack of character motivation and in the end sophomoric displays of emotion. Dern and Ladd, normally capable actresses here are simply adequate. It pained me to see Defoe wading through bad dialogue and trite set ups. Production quality is really pretty bad even for the early 90's. All around just the worst effort Lynch has ever put forth. Yet my biggest qualm with this movie is that it was perfectly acceptable, even if it didn't live up to the Lynch name, for most of the movie. The Wizard of Oz stuff got really annoying, but at the end it became downright repulsive. For those who actually want to see this tripe I won't give it away, but there is a scene that utilizes Glenda the Good Witch. The dialogue and the scene are so incredibly bad it tainted everything that came before it. The ending of any work is the most important part and for an ending to fail this bad just made everything a wreck. Yet it was decent until the end so I'll give it a little credit for that. But at all costs do not see this film. I don't care if you're a Cage fan, this truly is worth missing. If you want a good Cage movie see Adaptation, Leaving Las Vegas or Matchstickmen. If you want to see a good Lynch movie catch Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, or my personal favorite of his, Mulholland Dr.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A love story, David Lynch style. Sailor and Lula on the run from Lula's off the wall mother. Even more off the wall is some of the characters and situations in this film. There are a lot of references to "The Wizard Of Oz," including a visit from The Good Witch! Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern are hot as Sailor and Lula, but it's Diane Ladd as Lula's momma, that steals the film (And should have won the Oscar for supporting actress). If you are a TRUE Lynch fan, then you can understand a lot of the weirdness going on ("Twin Peaks" was on during this period, too). Best parts: The story of "Jingle Dell," with Crispin Glover; Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe) with Lula and ANY scene with Diane Ladd. There's a lot of unexpected violence (The first few minutes are INCREDIBLY VIOLENT!)that may gross you out, but it is an incredibly good film, especially the music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*warning, some spoilers*I caught this film on IFC a couple of days ago and was really looking forward to it; I really enjoyed other Lynch works like "Mulholland Drive" and "Lost Highway", so needless to say, I was looking forward to see Lynch's take on the whole "lover's road movie" thing. Unfortunately, most of the movie was rather dull; there was just not a lot going on. It would always go in the same cycle; Lula and Sailor would travel to some small town, have sex in the hotel, meet some weirdos, and then travel to another town and start that cycle all over again. There was nothing wrong with the acting from our two leads; Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern do a fine job with what they have, but they don't have much to work with. However, there is one very good thing about this film, and that's Diane Ladd. She kept this film from being a total bore with her zany, psychotic, and comic portrayl of Lula's slightly strange mother. Her character was the only multi-dimensional one in the film, and I really wish the focus had been more on her instead of Sailor and Lula. It's easy to see how Ms. Ladd got the film's only Oscar nomination, as she's really quite interesting to watch in this movie... for example, you won't know whether to laugh or be shocked when she paints her entire face red with her lipstick. Anyway, all I have to say about "Wild at Heart" is that it doesn't match up to the rest of David Lynch's work, and if you liked "Mullholland Drive" and "Lost Highway" (like I did), chances are you will be disappointed, but it's worth seeing for Diane Ladd's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild At Heart &amp; David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild At Heart is a (some might say) typical 'Lynch' movie. I've been an avid David Lynch fan ever since I saw EraserHead. If your anything like me, it is hard to think anything else while watching a Lynch movie except "What the...!" Nicolas Cage plays Sailor Ripley, a young gangster that is trying to leave 'the life' behind, and Laura Dern (Lula Fortune) who plays his girlfriend, have to sneek behind her mother's back to see each other. As soon as Ripley is released from prison, he and Lula decide to take a trip to New Orleans. Harry Dean Stanton (a Lynch essential) is then hired by Lula's mother to track down her daughter and 'that monster' and before he knows it, he's being stabbed in the back from every which angle (from the back) and it becomes a coin toss to see who is the real bad guy(s). Willem Dafoe plays a vetarin loose cannon (Bobby Peru) who is joined by Lynch vetarin Isabella Rosellini to sway the scales. One of the noteworthy things about Wild At Heart is that it has a sub plot akinned to the Wizard Of Oz, which makes it that much more interesting, and which is where Sheryl Lee takes the stage in her first Lynch role (you'll recognize Sheryl Lee from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer). Crispen Glover is also a welcome addition to the movie. His role is hilariously disturbing. David Lynch is a master of disguise. I love the fact that his movies (usually) start on such a Fairy Tale note, but then they progress into this awefull 'real' and often 'disturbing ' world type scinario. This is where Sherilyn Fenn comes in with an almost arousingly disturbing scene. He makes you want to look away at the same time your compelled to watch.</fullReview>

I first saw it in the theater. It still disturbs me.80% is the greatest movie ever. 10% is all right. 5% is there. 5% is just stupid without the right combination of alcohol and drugs.It has more memorable quotes than you can shake a stick at. It has fantastic visuals throughout. The story is just cool. Some say it is dated. But, I can't see it. The basis is a love story. I feel that those who see it as dated are simply too close to the time period. It is a "timeless" love story. To the men: Laura Dern's breasts are timeless.Lots of violence. Many sex scenes. Twisted dialog. Groovlicious shots of nothing important. Man on the toilet watching strippers. Heads busted open. Killer heavy metal riff repeated. Crazy lady with lipstick covering face. Sickening laughter. Hitmen. Crazy men. Bank robbery. Wiz-o-Oz.Gotta see it. Twice at least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adored this film from the moment I started watching - and not just because I am a Nicolas Cage fan. I really can't pinpoint what made me enjoy it but after watching it many times it is still as good. Yes, there are a few disturbing scenes but they all build the story of Sailor and Lula, two characters who belong together. Nicolas Cage asking for his snakeskin jacket is one of the best scenes in the film. After seeing the film I purchased the book 'The Wild Life of Sailor and Lula' by Barry Gifford from which the story came and it is just as engrossing.

The final scene has already made it to the pantheon of the most recognizable ones in cinematic history. But of course, if it was only that, it wouldn't be a Lynch movie. Dark humor, unpredictability, gratuitous gore, great angles and fantastic music (from metal to Elvis to classical) compose the whole picture.

		<shortDescription>The Wild Cinema of David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there other way to put it? Wild at heart is by far one of the most spectacular films ever. A film that is wild hearted itself and stands as a unique road film like no other. There so many unforgettable things of this film, that once you've seen it, your mind gets invaded by it.Again, Lynch manages to not only make a strange film but to create a whole new world, a world in which Saylor Ripley is the only good person surrounded by the bad element of the world trying to keep him apart from his love Lula. Every character of this film manage a duality, an internal struggle between good and evil, between obedience and rebellion. And the result is a film that stands to a world that is just like Bobby Peru's teeth, rotten and part of a cynical smile that is mocking at you all the time.Everything in this films is taken to the limits, giving thus the wild element of the film like the glaze of Saylor to Marietta. It goes from extreme love to extreme hate; from extreme adventure to extreme desperation, and even extreme ambition. And at the end, you will see which of all these feelings is stronger than all.From the minute I'd set eyes on this film, I couldn't get away from it, and now is one of my all time favorite films. A film that I could watch until the day that I die and never get bored of it, and that every time I see it there's something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first experience with this film was when a roommate rented it. I didn't watch it with him and his friends. The next day, he came into my room and said, "You have to check out this scene. It's so cool." He then proceeded to show me the opening sequence from the film. I sat and watched horrified as Nick Cage bashed a black man's skull (in full detail) to a grinding death-metal beat. Cool? Did I not get it? This was the most dismal thing I've ever witnessed on film. Watch the black man get his brains bashed in -- this is "cool"? I let my roommate have it. "You are sick!" I exclaimed. He responded, "No, check out the look he gives the woman. With the cigarette and all, that's what's so cool." I felt that the filmaker was playing the old artsy-violence trick on me. It obviously worked on my roommate. but I wasn't buying into it. Later that day I decided to watch the whole film. I enjoyed it to some extent. But part of me still felt like I was being tricked into thinking it was great by all the excess.I enjoy excess as much as the next guy. For example, one of my favorite films is "Total Recall" - a classic example of violent excess. But that film isn't bathed in wink-wink cleverness &amp; let's-laugh-at-the-white-trash, like Wild at Heart. Whatever, I didn't like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A romantic comedy for people who would never admit they like romantic comedy: a romance for the grunge set replete with lots of flowing blood, guns going off, cigarettes apuffing, and slimy bit characters met on the lam. David Lynch directs with snap and shock and a devious sense of humor, but I think he ought to have the courage to make a romantic comedy straight out. He splashes guts and rubs our face in vomit to disguise the simple love story so his leather and chains audience can imagine they're seeing life in the raw instead of being seduced as their parents so often were by yet another Hollywood romance.Nicholas Cage plays Barry Gifford's Sailor like a dumbed-down Elvis Presley (and that was before he grabbed the microphone), and Laura Dern as Lulu captures well the mentality of a sweet, shallow, but meat-eating little thing who just wants to have fun. When I first saw her in Smooth Talk (1985) (from a story by Joyce Carol Oates) I thought she was just flat out sexy, but here she seems a little dull even if she does have "breasts that stand up and say hello." Diane Ladd, as Lulu's mother, employing some Phyllis Diller shtick, is funny as the wicked witch of the east on testosterone.What saves this movie from the ridiculous is the fact that the poor saps, Sailor and Lulu, really love each other. He makes her "hotter than Georgia asphalt," and he finds her "dangerously cute." They have a whole bunch of mindless love-but maybe that's the best kind.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<fullReview>I bought this movie a little while ago without even having seen it. Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I saw that it stood well with all the other David Lynch movies I had seen. This is a road movie with heavy Wizard of Oz symbolism. The actors do a fantastic job at portraying their characters. Laura Dern and Nicolas Cage are fantastic in this movie and Crispin Glover's cameo is pretty strange to say the least but excellent. Compared to most American movies this movie has a pretty strange plotline, but is almost linear compared to Firewalk with Me or Lost Highway. In short, nobody can separate Sailor and Lula - not even Lula's overbearing and nearly psychotic mother who is played by none other than Laura Dern's real life mother Dianne Ladd. To finish, it isn't Lynch's strangest or best film but it still is much better than most films released today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch puts the odd in 'odyssey'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1990, David Lynch was the foremost surrealist of US cinema, a position cemented by Eraserhead, Blue Velvet and his long-running cult TV series 'Twin Peaks', a bizarre deconstructed soap. As a director-for-hire, he'd also displayed versatility for tackling more mainstream fare as evinced by The Elephant Man and Dune, with plaudits for the former and critical brickbats for the latter.Lynchian cinema was more popular in Europe than on his home turf, and came to be synonymous with the perception of the director himself, a former all-American boy (and latterly, Ronald Reagan admirer) distorted by a funhouse mirror to resemble, as Elephant Man producer Mel Brooks wryly observed, "Jimmy Stewart from Mars". The repressed, ultra-conservative "I Like Ike" generation had some very peculiar stuff in its closet. Lynch made it his currency.After 'Twin Peaks', expectations were at fever pitch for Lynch's next project. The director came across Barry Gifford's novella 'Wild At Heart' while still in its proofing stages and fashioned a loose adaptation in six days. Unusually for Lynch, the script's pretty straightforward and chronological; as Wild At Heart star Dafoe noted later, "I was always shocked at how logical it was - its world was so complete." But as ever, El Diablo's in the details.Here, Blue Velvet's yuppie nightmare becomes a white trash ticket to Hell: reckless Sailor Ripley (Cage, in full-on Elvis mode) loves hopeless romantic Lula Fortune (Dern), which drives Marietta Fortune (played by Dern's real-life mother Ladd) round the twist. After her lascivious advances to Sailor are spurned, she sends a hit-man after him, who Sailor kills - graphically, smashing his skull to splinters. On release from prison and defying his probation for "manslaughter", Sailor and lusty Lula hit the pedal for California, encountering all manner of Lynchian freaks en route. Unbeknown to them, Lula's insanely jealous mother has hired seedy PI Johnnie Farragut (Stanton) and various thugs to hunt them down, culminating in a stand-off in one-horse-town 'Big Tuna' with evil gunman Bobby Peru (Dafoe).A dream turning inexorably to nightmare, Wild At Heart's an all-out assault on the senses, aided immeasurably by Angelo Badalamenti's fantastically smoky score. But the director's trademark oddities (from obese prom queens and cockroach-bothering relatives to Ladd's hellish, red lipstick-covered face) seem forced, and unlike Eraserhead there's scant emotional heart.With deliberately over-the-top performances (from Ladd and Defoe, particularly), characterisation always takes a back seat to knowing iconography, along with campy references to The Wizard Of Oz - Dern imagines Ladd as the Wicked Witch of the West, while 'Twin Peaks' star Sheryl Lee portrays Glinda.Nevertheless, amid catcalls and cheers - and much to Lynch's bemusement - the film won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival; a fitting opener to a decade which would see the director's post-modern riff on American pop-culture become de rigeur in independent US cinema, ultimately achieving more cross-over successes than Lynch ever imagined.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw WOH when it first came out and I liked it for its sheer fun and craziness. But nearly ten years later, the movie stays with me. And my love for WOH continues to grow. WOH is so bursting with life full of energy and passion. You will never forget the characters as long as you live - how can anyone ever forget Bobby Peru and his nasty teeth, the psychotic mom, and of course the most passionate screen couple - Sailor and Lula? This is the only hell I'd not mind visiting. This is not the movie to be taken seriously even though in my opinion, WOH is pure cinema. Let Sailor and Lula take you for a ride.. the ride you will never forget. WOH is not currently available on VHS or DVD which I think is a pure travesty."You got me hotter than Georgia asphalt." - Lula</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked Blue velvet and Mulholland Drive and other David Lynch films. However, Wild at Heart is one of Lynch's weaker efforts. I just don't think any of the characters are believable and at no point in the film did I care what happened to any of them. Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern are both talented actors, but they don't have a lot to work with here. A lot of the scenes and dialog seems contrived and unreal and just plain odd. All in all not a very good film. By the time the last half hour rolled around I was hoping that some Aliens would suddenly appear from out of nowhere and annihilate the entire cast and crew. Don't waste your time on this one unless you're doing a 30-year stretch in Folsom Prison and this is the only flick they have available to rent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a great fan of Laura Dern and her father Bruce Dern, I have always loved their great acting skills and in this picture Laura as Lula, kept this movie really moving with fantastic WILD dancing, red hot sex scenes along with Nicolas Cage(Sailor) who tried real hard to keep up with Lula's every desire even though she had visions of the good and bad witch from the Wizard of Oz. Lula was a very unusual role to play, who loved her man more than anything else in this entire world and it was great to see that Sailor finally found his place in her life along with his cute son. Dern fans, this is a must and if you admired and respect Nicolas Cage's great talents, view this film over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Young lovers Sailor and Lula run from the variety of weirdos that Lula's mom has hired to kill Sailor. Lula's psychopathic mother goes crazy at the thought of Lula being with Sailor, who just got free from jail. Ignoring Sailor's probation, they set out for California. However their mother hires a killer to hunt down Sailor. Unaware of this, the two enjoy their journey and themselves being together... until they witness a young woman dying after a car accident - a bad omen. Roger Ebert wrote "Take away the surprises and you can see the method more clearly. Like "Blue Velvet," this is a film without the courage to declare its own darkest fantasies. Lynch wraps his violence in humor, not as a style, but as a strategy. Luis Bunuel, the late and gifted Spanish surrealist, made films as cheerfully perverted and decadent as anything Lynch has ever dreamed of, but he had the courage to declare himself. Lynch seems to be doing a Bunuel script with a Jerry Lewis rewrite. He is a good director, yes. If he ever goes ahead and makes a film about what's really on his mind, instead of hiding behind sophomoric humor and the cop-out of "parody," he may realize the early promise of his "Eraserhead." But he likes the box office prizes that go along with his pop satires, so he makes dishonest movies like this one." There are fine scenes in this film however to make this film worth watching. Wild at heart is astonishingly powerful, and genuinely moving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...This isn't that good. Too disturbing for buds and Buds, as one would do in a Cage flick, yet too stupid for Lynch standards. The plot has elements of disgust, such as a flash back of Laura Dern's character raped by her 'uncle' because Cage brought it up, unnaturally so. Out of the blue, he's like, "But your uncle raped you at thirteen, right?", which is stupid for multiple reasons. A, that was extremely likely traumatizing, B, it was out of nowhere, C, how the heck talks like that, and D, blatant exposition! Now the plot has Laura Dern's mother hiring hit men left and right to kill Cage and perhaps Dern because they love each other. Who, even in Carolina, would do that crazy a thing? It is just so outlandish! Also right before Cage brings up the afore mentioned rape, Dern says, "My mama said I'm sexually mature at fifteen." which, most people in Carolina are conservative, right? Heart pushed up against a bible and all, right? I dare say it, but this is a bigger mess by Lynch than Dune. Also it title drops, I don't like title drops. Now the writer of the novel and Lynch had a more collaborative effort known as Lost Highway, which is a really great film, but this film's production was how they met. That is the good thing to come out of this, Lost Highway being a freaking masterwork, Lynch's best since Blue Velvet, it is completely astonishing, watch that. But this one is terrible and at points I didn't mention, is sheerly surreal for the sake of it, multiple times at that. Granted, Blue Velvet had a surreal for the sake of it scene, but it felt a little bit more natural, but in here we have fat woman porn because nothing. Most of the clips on YouTube have the good scenes, the concert scene where Cage beats the heck out of this one punk, and the first scene for how stupidly awesome it is. This isn't what you're looking for out of artistic Lynch, crazy Dafoe, or batty Cage. Three out of ten. Watch Lost Highway or Blue Velvet to see a good Lynch movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch can tell a story and takes chances - HIS way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mr. Lynch is genuine and this is evident by the strange, unorthodox movies he makes. Strong characterizations, vivid imagery makes his films unforgettable. Let's face it - it is the unforgettable ones have a most profound effect on the audiences, thus this filmmaker has done the job - told the story in a way that you are going to remember - for a long, long time! Yes Mr. Lynch has some audience members that do not like his films. Those who don't give Mr. Lynch a fair shake can go back to their secure, Hollywood cookie-cutter cinematic jokes-for-products, and that way they will remain happy in their own world. Mr. Lynch's world, as we can see in this movie Wild at Heart, is much more complex and emphasizes on the bizarre, macabre, and almost the unthinkable. Mr. Lynch takes chances in this Industry, and chance-takers are not really made to be felt welcome; too much controversy scares the Majors into thinking that future ticket sales will slump. Be they right or not, the Studios should not be afraid to hire Directors like Mr. Lynch - for every one who will be "offended" for unsuitable content, there will be someone else who will buy the tickets. Nevertheless, Directors that have an "edge" may find work hard to obtain. The trade-off is that they are their own people and their artistry enables the to hold their heads up high for not "selling out" to the conservative Studios. I have seen Eraserhead, Elephant Man, and now this one. Because it is Mr. Lynch as Director, I will get Mulholland Drive and the Twin Peaks TV shows on DVD. Mr. Lynch also went to American Film Institute( AFI), not too far from where I live.Mr. Lynch also did a good job on the Special Features interviews regarding this very different movie. He appears to not have an ego whatsoever - he gave me the impression he truly loves and believes in what he does - tells the story - HIS way - not the Hollywood machine cash-cow-easy-on-the-masses way! Mr. Lynch keep up the good work! You ARE appreciated!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild at Heart is a classic in full force David Lynch style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at Heart is brilliantly twisted, bringing you all the warped out type of characters you would hope for from a film by David Lynch. The plot and story are so original and bizarre that you won't see what's coming next. Just when you think this film couldn't get any more depraved it will. The characters and situations are so insane that if you miss the satire then your eyes must be closed. It's like True Romance on L.S.D. Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Bobby Peru will both give you the creeps and leave you no choice but to laugh it off. This film is a visual marvel and a masterpiece of modern writing. However be forewarned this film may not be for everyone so I suggest that before you watch it you ask yourself if you are truly Wild at Heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from Lynch's best, but very enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly after beginning work on the TV show "Twin Peaks", David Lynch made "Wild at Heart", an adaptation of Barry Gifford's novel. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern play Sailor and Lula, two lovers who are driving cross-country to escape from Lula's mother, Marietta (played by Diane Ladd, Dern's real-life mother). Marietta goes insane at the thought of any boys going near her daughter, but Sailor Ripley especially, because she suspects that he saw her murder her husband years ago.Marietta has half the country out looking for Sailor and Lula, including the murderer duo of Reggie (Calvin Lockhart) and Juana (Grace Zabriskie); the bizarre hit-man Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe), and his partner, the beautiful Perdita Durango (Isabella Rossellini); and Marietta's ex-lover, the murderous Santos (J.E. Freeman). The only sane person searching for the lovers is Johnnie Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton), a level-headed man completely dedicated to Marietta.David Lynch is famous for his weird movies, which are often incomprehensible during the first viewing. "Wild at Heart" is considerably less weird than Lynch's other movies, but that doesn't mean it isn't weirder than most movies. It also happens to be funny in many scenes. Of course, it can also be disturbing; there are many scenes of violence.The cast is great. Cage is very funny with his Elvis-style accent. Dafoe is great. Harry Dean Stanton is very fine and quite likable as Johnnie Farragut. Diane Ladd is wonderful as Lula's mother.Interestingly, there are numerous references to "The Wizard of Oz" in here; what made Lynch think of Oz is anyone's guess. "Twin Peaks" fans will notice many cast members from the show, including Zabriskie, Sherilyn Fenn, and Sheryl Lee.The film features a very good soundtrack, a combination of country, Angelo Badalamenti's easygoing score and the occasional heavy metal.All in all, I think "Wild at Heart" is an underrated movie that, while far from Lynch's best, is very enjoyable. It is well-filmed and -directed, and there is a feeling of strength and energy that makes the film even more appealing. Not everyone will enjoy the movie, but I sure as hell did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this so long ago and can't remember everything but the essense of the movie stuck with me and still after all this time I'm unsure whether I liked this strange tale. Wild at heart definetly ranks up there as one of the oddest movies I've ever seen, yet despite certain moments of almost unwatchableness, the movie had that surreal feeling I love and great acting. This was the best role I've ever seen Laura Dern in and look for a small cameo from Cherlynn Fenn(2 moon junction). The movie's atmosphere actually was similiar to Junction.Still, as I'm not a fan of violent movies in general I do remember a bit much of that and I also remember just not being comfortable with certain scenes. I guess this is a movie that kind of holds you to your seat and presents itself so strongly that it really doesn't matter whether you like it alot, you'r just compelled to watch.I may have to watch this one again, I'm not sure how the movie would appear to me now and if I'd still feel that way after so many years but if I had to describe "Wild at heart" I'd have to say you may not love the movie but you can't stop watching if you start. Definetly a really odd film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch Misses the Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie again for the third or fourth time since its release, desperately wanting to like it. I believe David Lynch is a genius (Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, and Eraserhead are among my favorites of all time) and I love Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. Sadly, I was again disappointed. Wild at Heart is simply a boring movie that has not aged well. Although I am not a big fan of Natural Born Killers, I thought it was a much better bad-boy-and-bad-girl-on-the-run movie. The only bright spot in this film is Diane Ladd in the role of Lula's (Laura Dern) slightly deranged mother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just one question. Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a Sunday night and since I have been on such an IFC kick lately I decided to record the Lynch movie that was going to be on later called "Wild at Heart." When I saw that it won the highest honor at Cannes I really started to prep myself for some great cinema. Once the movie started I felt wrong, disturbed, and sinful. The violence isn't just violence, it is gore, and the sex isn't just sex it is, well, ferocious? This movie pushes boundaries that I didn't even know we had. But I must say, like a gruesome car wreck, I could not turn away. For the next day all I could think about was morbidly overweight naked women, abortions, and heads being blown off. It is now that I ask David Lynch... WHY? I know that he is a great film maker but I didn't need to see this movie. I feel as though I am a worse person for viewing it. But I encourage you all to watch it so you can talk to your friends about it at the office. It definitely has shock value.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Lynch's best and rather inconsistent, but with some truly great set pieces and performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, this should not be your first David Lynch movie. First-timers are recommended to check out episodes of "Twin Peaks" or possibly "Blue Velvet". Its also not his finest achievement, that being either "Blue Velvet" or "Eraserhead". Still, "Wild At Heart" has enough weirdness to please fans of Lynch's trademark style and alienate those unfamiliar with his unique output.The film could largely be divided into two halves for me. I didn't really enjoy the first half that much. Outside of a great as usual performance from Harry Dean Stanton, I found it to be a bit dull. Unlike "Blue Velvet", this jumps right into the action and may be a bit confusing. Nothing much happens outside of a few amusing cameos (particularly Crispin Glover). Fortunately, from the scene-stealing entrance of Willem Dafoe on, this becomes a surreal roller coaster ride that never lets up. The last half hour in particular is Lynch at his finest. The acting all around is quite good, despite Laura Dern being miscast.Overall, this is not Lynch's best film. Its inconsistent despite some truly great set pieces. However, even his lesser efforts are still more interesting than most other director's best works. Fans will enjoy, others will be confused. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My rough description of Wild at heart: Sailor and Lula are unbreakable couple, true definition of young modern people, that are living in a corrupted, violent world that is hard to understand and to be part of. OK. Maybe Lynch really had that on his mind, but I thing that audience will never understand his vision of any movie. For example, Wild at heart. What is the point of character of cousin Dell? Mentally unstable person, OK. But what is with his moves on the street? He can't wait for Christmas?!? What is his character doing in the movie at all? Maybe he is just contributing to the bizarreness of film. And then, maybe you remember old woman in a dance club, just walking through the cadre with bizarre smile on her face. Disturbing scene. What does she presents? Nothing? I afraid that David Lynch also don't know answer to these questions. David Lynch's world is very attractable and enjoyable. But whats the point of it if we can never understand it. It would be disappointing if we never hear an explanation from director. Whole audience is waiting for that thing. Maybe its necessary for director to keep his thoughts in his head, but for us its very irritating.</fullReview>

This is clearly a bit of a make-weight given that the plot is pretty thin (almost a standard road movie with bells and whistles) and not altogether life affirming. One of these movies that presents the 9-2-5 world as boring so "why not go out and rob a bank instead?"I was very forgiving when I first saw this movie because it has enough plot and action to let you slide along with it, but it fails to hit the heights because I didn't really like anybody all that much, even the sexpot Laura Dern turned me off after a while with her smoking and yack-yack-yack. It gets sillier and more immoral as it goes along, but it had to because it had said everything it had to say pretty early in the piece and had no where else to go.As I said before - not good, not bad, somewhere in the middle...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Joltingly violent, shockingly erotic retelling of `The Wizard of Oz'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Upon hearing the words `David Lynch', dozens of words spring to mind. `Weirdo, bizarre, insane, articulate, violent, erotic, and above all else, crazy'. Such is the case with the cult classic `Wild at Heart'- the movie which epitomises his very existence. The styles and characteristics rank to a very acquired taste. If you are the slightest bit squeamish, then give this film a miss. But if you can take it, then you'll find `Wild at Heart' to be one of the oddest cinematic experiences in history.The plot may seem simple enough, but there are plenty of surreal and indefinable elements thrown in, to make sure that you will not forget this movie for a long, long time. As he has done in the past, the notoriously perverse director explores the underbelly of sex and violence that lurks in southern America. He definitely succeeds in what he sets out to do ? single-handedly destroy the American dream. Not only that, he tramples over it several times and then shreds it up in a lawnmower. The end result is a bleak, over-violent road movie given the extra surreal touches along with far too many ferociously explicit sex scenes. This is a very loose retelling of `The Wizard of Oz', and one that certainly won't have you look at the former the same way again. Our two main characters ? Sailor and Lula are the star-crossed lovers who travel across the country (the road supposedly representing the Yellow Brick Road), much to the chagrin of Lula's mother (the Wicked Witch?). By the end, they've encountered many deranged psychos and even a delightfully odd visit from Glinda the Good Witch. For the most part, this is a guilty displeasure (if such a thing exists). One receives a voyeuristic sense whilst watching the movie. Instead of being compelling, this is more often mind numbing, but as the scenes become increasingly insane, you can't stop watching it. And by the end, it leaves a surprisingly good taste despite all that proceeds.Never funny enough to make you laugh, never realistic enough to leave you shocked but never boring enough to have you repelled. It continuously dizzies the mind enough to make you believe that through all the blood and perversity, there is an invigorating story. Effectively eccentric performances all round from a good cast. Nicholas Cage, snakeskin jacket in tow, is always believable as the parolee- turned criminal. And what a beautiful singing voice (hee-hee). A 35-year-old Laura Dern doesn't for a second pass for a 20-year-old. But the accent is top-notch and the white-trash characteristics are exemplary. An Oscar nominated Diane Ladd makes for a thoroughly engrossing character. But Willem Dafoe steals the show as ultra-psycho Bobby Peru- intimidating, odd and psychotic. Underused support is generated from a supporting cast including Crispin Glover, Issabella Rossellini and Harry Dean Stanton. The abnormal bravura styles of David Lynch leave their mark, bringing the movie style, violence and surrealness, but no heart. A captivating, often insane and consistently shocking cinematic experience, this bleak oddessy through a hellish landscape is audacious and deserving of its status of a cult-classic. While it will probably only appeal to about 6% of the world, this is a dazzling, dark and strangely vivid movie. My IMDb rating: 7.4/10.</fullReview>

In spite of this it is watchable and keeps the attention going (how could it not). I don't know if Lynch realized what he was doing by casting Cage (Coppola) and Laura Dern. But whether intentional or not, he put together the ugliest leading pair in cinema history. Oh, sure, Nicholas Cage has done some surgery in the meantime to make his face look more jagged. (There can be no doubts he had plastic surgery when one looks at his earlier films such as "Arizona Junior" and "Peggy Sue Got Married" - compare this face with the one he's got now.) And Laura Dern is so homely that even Cage deserves better. I mean, the leading couple doesn't have to look like it walked away from a fashion show, but this is ridiculous.The film is quite manic, with a lot of overacting, but grotesquely entertaining. The usual Lynch bizarreness. However, the film also reminds me just how promising his career was at the outset when he made "Eraserhead" and "The Elephant Man". Everything he did after that was totally inferior to those movies.If you're interested in reading my biographies of Laura Dern and other Hollywood "beauties", contact me by e-mail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild at Heart has some memorable moments in this good Lynch movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A filmmaker, in particular a surrealist like David Lynch, has to be kind of careful with the way he makes his films, so that all of the abstract images and set-pieces and little moments in the stranger-than-life stories he makes can bring some awe or amazement to the viewer. He has done this in the past wonderfully with Eraserhead (his most disturbing movie to me) and Mulholland Drive, as well to a degree with Blue Velvet. With Wild at Heart, his second adaptation of a novel, he brings to the screen some moments that stick in your head, but some of them aren't really the kind that strike me crazy like with some of his other films. For example (and I have a feeling this might be part Lynch, part novelist Barry Gifford, but I'm not sure) he laces in a sort of subtext with the Wizard of Oz, as the two (anti) heroes of the film, Sailor and Lula (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) keep on seeing images of them. It's an effective image the first time, but working it into the plot makes it a little ridiculous; I knew that the film was part pulp-fantasy, yet with the climax including a small speech from Glenda the Good witch to Sailor, it's very unfulfilled. It brought the film to a close with melodrama, but it left nothing mysterious, nothing that usually has me floored by Lynch in not explaining where these people will go. There are also other abstractions at times that go a little too overboard, a little too clever for Lynch's own good.These gripes aside, Wild at Heart is quite the entertainer, a sort of romantic exploitation picture that fuses elements from 1950's cinema (Elvis, rock and roll, cool cars) and gives its audience what it wants for the better part of two hours. The basic premise involves two young people, played Cage and Dern, who are very well matched, as Cage gives a believable turn with half-hammed up, half sincere attitude, and Dern giving one of her best so far. They meet each other and can't keep their hands or minds off of each other, eloping constantly throughout the film. But there are problems from the start- Sailor has just been released from prison, with a dark past, and can be a very violent person. Lula's mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd in one of two very twisted performances in the film), can't stand Lula's choice, and will stop at nothing to see that Sailor doesn't get her, including hiring strong-men and a hit-man (Harry Dean Stanton) to track them down. Along the way, they run into some mishaps, and bad people (one being Willem Dafoe, the other twisted performance) as a lurid figure in the third act.There has been a lot written about the violence in the film, which is in fact very over-the-top (almost in an Oliver Stone NBK way, but done in Lynch's own style of course). It's not offensive, but it isn't as if its entertaining. It's just, well, there, and it does work to fit into the story. What one can criticize is, like with the other abstractions I mentioned before, it leaves one a little empty or feeling out-of-place. The violence has to be there, there's no question about that, and it is in an exaggerated form of the obviously fake violence in the 1950's road movies. But it takes itself so not seriously, it's hard to take it into account with the rest of the story. There's a sense of some realism in the film, but I don't know if Lynch knows at times how to combat it with his surrealism. Still, this isn't to say he hasn't made a good film, he has: it contains a lot of his wit, a lot of flashes of great use of color, used expressively like the painter he is, and it does blend much of the time as an art film-cum-drive-in flick, and it contains some of the sexiest scenes Lynch has filmed (he seems better with sex than violence). I just wouldn't say it's one of Lynch's very best works. Maybe I'll like it more the second time, or less. As Ebert put it, this is like a Luis Bunuel film done with a Jerry Lewis re-write. I'm a big fan of Bunuel, not so much of Lewis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Lynch's greatest movie but one full of great Lynchian moments and a terrific performance from Nicholas Cage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sick and tired of waiting for 'Wild At Heart' to get a DVD release I dragged out my old VHS copy to watch it for the umpteenth time. I originally saw it on its first cinema release (and believe me if you've never seen it on the big screen you're really missing a lot!) when still high on 'Blue Velvet' (then my favourite movie) and the truth is I was a little disappointed. All these years and several viewings later I've come to accept 'Wild At Heart' for what it is, and while I still don't think it's as astonishing as 'Blue Velvet' and 'Lost Highway', I enjoy it a great deal. Some people regard this as Lynch's most accessible movie. Well the plot is I suppose, being a variation on the lovers-on-the-run road movie, but the characters are so bizarre that if you're unfamiliar with Lynch's work you might find it hard to get into. My only real criticism of the movie is Laura Dern, who is badly miscast and unconvincing. Dern as the sweet plain girl next door in 'Blue Velvet' I can buy, but as a sex bomb, no way! Especially when Sherilyn Fenn has a bit part later on. How much better this movie would have been if she'd played Lula! Nicholas Cage however makes up for this flaw with a terrific performance as Sailor. This was from the pre-action hero days when he specialized in quirky roles like 'Birdy', 'Raising Arizona' and 'Vampire's Kiss'. Diane Ladd ('The Wild Angels'), Dern's real life mother, plays her on screen mother, and veteran character actor Harry Dean Stanton ('Paris, Texas') plays Ladd's beau Johnnie Farragut. Exploitation movie fans will get a kick out of their scenes together, their only movie pairing since the Bruce Dern/Cameron Mitchell biker flick 'The Rebel Rousers' twenty years earlier. The rest of the supporting cast features many Lynch regulars, including the legendary Jack Nance (Henry from 'Eraserhead') and Isabella Rossellini, who incidentally plays the same character Rosie Perez later depicted in Alex de la Iglesia's 'Perdita Durango'. The best of the lot is Willem Dafoe's slimeball Bobby Peru, a character as repulsive as Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth in 'Blue Velvet'. One of my favourite scenes in the movie is the one with Sailor and Lula being introduced to Bobby Peru for the first time while sitting around with John Lurie, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Jack Nance outside a low rent motel. It's one of those great Lynchian moments and I wish there was more of it. Maybe one day we'll get to see a director's cut. I'm sure these sequences were originally longer and I'd love to see what character Tracey Walter ('Repo Man') played (he's cut from the version we have). 'Wild At Heart' is full of great Lynchian moments - the opening fight, Cage dancing with karate moves to a metal band, the extreme close ups of matches being lit, the recurring 'Wizard Of Oz' theme, Crispin Glover's unforgettable cameo as Lula's seriously disturbed cousin Dell, Lula's father on fire, the silver dollars, the 'Yojimbo' nod in the bank sequence with the dog, and especially the scenes on a lonely highway where Sailor and Lula see the aftermath of a car crash with Chris Isaak's 'Wicked Game' playing on the soundtrack. For all these things and more I love 'Wild At Heart'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of creative unique movies. With more meaningful and artistic writing and directing. Lynch usually never let's me down in this sense. Therefor I couldn't wait to watch Wild At Heart. However, don't let Lynch's name attached to this film fool you. It just honestly isn't that good. I hate to say it but I was really let down by this piece of Lynch's work. Most of all the story was just weak it never grips you, you are never excited about what's happening and what's going to happen next. The symbolism shots and Wizard of Oz references just were not genius...they seemed weak, almost pointless and most of all cheesy. The movie also has a very dated feel to it, it didn't hold up well. This movie is 4 years newer than BLUE VELVET but seems so much older. I gave this movie 4/10 stars...those points are only for the fact the movie at least is different than most movies &amp; for WILLEM DAFOE's character and scenes. Sorry, but this is probably Lynch's worst piece of work. Please don't judge him by this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director David Lynch excels at the weird magic he weaves. A love starved young woman is on the run with a paroled murderer. A psycho mother puts a private eye and a deranged hit man on their trail. Some scenes are hard to watch; and then there are those typical Lynch scenes that you still don't know what the hell you saw. Very wicked soundtrack featuring Chris Isaak and Gene Vincent.Nicolas Cage is infatuated with Elvis. Laura Dern is down right NASTY. Willem Dafoe, definitely bizarre. Diane Ladd is way over the edge. Crispin Glover is clever as a cabbage. Harry Dean Stanton always seems to be at ease being clueless. Sherilyn Fenn, a waste of beauty to play a corpse. The erotic, violent and irreverent script is what holds this cast together.David Lynch fans get everything they could expect and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What were the judges at Cannes thinking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film goes in my memory archives as one of the worst ever. How this dreadful waste of time was awarded best film at Cannes is beyond me, and especially after the year that "sex, lies, and videotape" was awarded the same honor. The latter was a great film; this one is not. Even though I loved "Blue Velvet", I've never been a big fan of David Lynch, and this movie is one of the reasons why. His overuse of descriptive imagery in this work is senseless. In particular, the desert scene where the witch on a broom flies by, indicating a reference to Lula's evil, spiteful mother, who has a detective and hitman trail them after they leave together for California. The scene where she was showing her anger after Sailor and Lula's departure was something out of a movie from the 30's or 40's; way too overacted. It was just her grimacing and menacing music playing. Nuts!! Listening to Nicholas Cage sing "Love Me Tender", and with a straight face, just about capped it for me. About 30 minutes into the film, I was planning to hit the eject button, but kept watching to see if it would improve. It only got worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you thought Lost Highway was David Lynch at his strangest, wait until you see Wild At Heart!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at Heart is not David Lynch at his best, personally much prefer Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story and is definitely not going to be everybody's cup of tea. But while it has its flaws Wild at Heart still impresses and fascinates in many ways, also don't think that it's his worst like some people I know in the past have said(that'd be Dune). The story does feel very randomly structured at times, especially true with Crispin Glover, and some of the pacing slackens; the film could have done with being shorter as some scenes did feel too padded and underdeveloped, and the script can be a confused jumble and not always easy to understand completely(though admittedly there are some quotable lines). There are many great things with Wild at Heart however because the cinematography is stunning, the scenery is bursting with vivid colour and there are plenty of bold colours and lighting with some of the visuals being wonderfully deranged. There is also a hypnotic soundtrack that adds so much to the feel of the film, the music choices being also quite interesting, while Lynch's direction while not the best he's ever done(tied between Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive) but it is very adept and has his unique style all over. The story is not the best but the atmosphere is just great, just loved the campiness, the eroticism and haunting weirdness, it's hardly uneventful and there are some memorable moments like the incredibly chilling robbery sequence and the ending. The Wizard of Oz references while a little over-used are fun. The characters are not likable at all, in fact in the cases of Marietta and Bobby a few of them could be seen as loathsome, but considering the atmosphere and viciously violent but also sexy content of the film it is clear that they weren't intended to be. The performances are fine, Nicholas Cage will induce polarising opinions but while he was wooden to start with he was charming and entertaining once he warmed up. Laura Dern is alluring with the two working comfortably together, while Diana Ladd manages to be both hilarious and scary and Willem Dafoe is unforgettably creepy. The cameos acquit themselves well too. All in all, incredibly strange and not without flaws but also fascinating. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Lynch's mastery is present in every single frame. What brings down his movie is that his story is only potentially interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a scene in David Lynch's "Wild at Heart" that, I think, defines the meaning of the word classic. Nicolas Cage, perfectly matched to the role of an Elvis-like tramp in a snakeskin jacket, actually sings "Love Me Tender." Mr. Cage does his own singing and man, does he have a voice! The scene, beautifully shot and magnificently directed by Mr. Lynch, is mesmerizing. If this isn't memorable, then I just don't know what is. However, paradoxical as it sounds, this very scene is evidence of the film's downfall. How come? Because not only is this the best scene in the movie, it's the one where the credits are scrolling over. The last shot in the movie upstages everything that came before it.The sad thing is that this parody/homage to "The Wizard of Oz" based on a novel by Barry Gifford (which I have not read) suffers from a story that is only potentially interesting. As it opens, Sailor Ripley (Mr. Cage) kills a hit-man coming after him with a knife and is sentenced to prison. Upon being released, he and his girlfriend Lula (Laura Dern) embark on a wild and rampant road trip composed of them dancing, drinking, and lovemaking...a lot. All would be going well for them, if it weren't for the fact that Lula's mother (Miss Dern's real-life mother, Diane Ladd) is still out to see Sailor dead.How does this resemble "The Wizard of Oz"? Well, without giving too much away, it accomplish it because it Mr. Lynch is, probably without doubt, the most daring surrealist in the business today. And his craftsmanship and humor is omnipresent at all times. Some have objected to this picture because of its violence or its, to quote one critic, "sly excuses." But that is not what bothers me about "Wild at Heart." What made it fall flat for me was because, in spite of Mr. Lynch's mastery, there was very little of anything for him to really work with here.The first half of the movie is essentially a retread of the same thing. We see Sailor and Lula on their erotic adventures and we see the mother, Marietta, scheming and planning. That wears thin rather quickly. In the second half, we get a little more energy and a little more going on, with some plot twists, but by that point, I was completely exhausted by the redundancy of what preceded it.There are great performances in the movie. Mr. Cage and Miss Dern are sexy and work extremely well together. Miss Ladd, nominated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for this film, is superb and screen-commanding, Harry Dean Stanton makes for yet another excellent straight man, and Willem Dafoe is absolutely brilliant as a sneaky, snarling scoundrel with an eye for trouble. The lovely Isabella Rossellini also makes a small appearance. But none of these actors, in spite of their talent, have interesting characters or dynamics to build themselves up on. The central love story between Sailor and Lula is only passionate in ostensible terms; there is little in the name of chemistry here. Miss Ladd's motives are cheap and sometimes hard to follow, making her a dismissible villain. Mr. Dafoe is interesting while he's on screen, but is forgotten as soon as he's not anymore.The movie just rumbles along like the characters' cars, going over the same territory and scenario again and again. When a twist comes, and we have to wait a whole hour for that, it's intended shock is dumbed down by the monotonous nature of what came before it. The dialog, written by director Lynch, shows traces of the wit that he so magnificently assembled in "Blue Velvet" but only traces. On and on it goes up until its great ending scene. And once that had concluded, I sat there aghast for I had realized a key flaw in the movie. There was a long-going plot element involving Miss Ladd and a couple of monotonous baddies played by J.E. Freeman and William Morgan Shepphard, and out of the blue, the movie completely forgot about it. Was it intended? I don't know and frankly, I don't care because it meant so little when compared to the amass of boredom I had to suffer through.There are some very fine moments, especially the ending scene, and again, Mr. Lynch's mastery is evident in every single frame. But "Wild at Heart" suffers from a dumbed-down story lacking any real passionate spark and instead of dousing me with excitement, plunged me into ennui within twenty minutes. It's endurable, but not memorable. It's not up there with Mr. Lynch's greats like "The Elephant Man" and, what I feel is his best, "Blue Velvet." Toward the end, there is a scene, completing Mr. Lynch's homage to "The Wizard of Oz" where a characters lectures to Mr. Cage that he should never "turn away from love." That's good advice. Better advice would be to turn away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern Romeo and Juliet with lots of sex and violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is movie is somewhat a modern version of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or a mixture of movies such as "Bonnie &amp; Clyde", "The wizard of Oz" and David Lynch's previous "Blue velvet". It is a road movie about unconditional love and how a relationship can mature and become more than a running free romance. As for all of David Lynch's movies, there are many weird, retarded and brutal characters in this flick, a lot of violence and especially a lot of sex. Some mysterious and surreal scenes are also in this movie though not as many as in the later works of David Lynch. The movie is one of the rare ones of David Lynch that has no slow development as it begins with a quite heavy and rude scene and it is quite easy to follow and understand as the weird elements are often just details and little sidekick gems that have nothing to do with the main story. This movie may in that way please to the usual fans of the works of David lynch but also and especially to a larger public. The movie is surely entertaining, well acted and well filmed and that's why this flick gained a larger attention and success.If you liked "Blue velvet", you might like this movie without a doubt. Once again, there are many well known actors in this movie that have often worked with David Lynch. Laura Dern plays Lula, a young woman that escapes from her controlling and conservative mother and her past as a raped and abused child confronted with the mysterious death of her father. Jack Nance plays a strange vagabond that tells a strange tale of his dog. Sherilyn Fenn plays a car accident victim that acts like a porcelain doll. Along side those actors, you get some new ones that are also doing convincing job. Nicolas Cage plays a romantic and naive rebel looking for his attachment to unconditional freedom. Willem Dafoe plays a strange and ugly villain. Once again, almost every character has something special and unique to offer even if some of them seem to be slightly over the top or even ridiculous but that's a well known brand of Lynch's movies.The reason why this movie doesn't get a higher rating from me is that it doesn't have the unconditional way to freedom that main actor Nicolas Cage is always talking about. David Lynch seems to have been somewhat tamed to fit to a Hollywood movie and doesn't create a truly unique movie. Even the "Dune" movie about which Lynch wasn't happy at all in the end was more surreal and atmospheric than this one. I am missing the last kick of courage and genius to which I have been used by watching Lynch's entire movie collection. This movie is a less original one by him even though it is still a very good movie and not completely ordinary and tamed. I also think that some characters that are well introduced and seem promising aren't lead any further, like the menacing "Santos" that doesn't seem that frightening and evil in the end (he isn't comparable at all with the last villain of a Lynch movie before, Dennis Hopper in "Blue velvet"), the strange and uneasy "00 Spool" (played by Jack Nance that doesn't get the chance to play as excellent as in "Twin Peaks" or even "Eraserhead") or the crazy cousin "Dell" (that doesn't have the charm of the crazy characters from "Twin Peaks" for example). This movie seems to be a quick shot and Lynch didn't put that much time and passion into the characters as he usually did.Finally, this is surely one of David Lynch's less convincing flicks but for any one that is looking for an entertaining and well played road movie with some surreal elements and a lot of sex, violence and rock'n'roll (the speed/thrash metal band "Powermad" is featured in this flick as well as songs by Elvis Presley), you will surely get an explosive mixture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you think about it, "Wild at Heart" is really a movie that goes nowhere, except to put two lovers on a road trip so a nice assortment of weird characters can be introduced along the way. The film is above average, not dull, but feels stretched at two hours plus. A partly surreal, violent, sexy, nightmare would be a good place to begin describing this film. Most definitely the cream of the bizarre is William Dafoe's "Bobby Peru", but really no one appears normal, except for perhaps the police officer who stumbles upon Bobby Peru's sure thing robbery. This is definitely an acquired taste, so if you are prepared for the weirdness, you might find "Wild at Heart" intriguing. - MERK</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anything, David Lynch' Wild at Heart (1990) is a unique film. It shows a story in an unconventional way, with Shakespearean elements, strange characters, Elvis references, romance, disturbing images and much more, all rolled into a fairly decent film.Despite its unusual nature and its originality, I was not really moved or blown away by this movie. The colors, music and words do create a certain mood, but I found it lacked the quality to really draw me in. It's not really as thought-provoking, intense or funny as it aims to be. It is hard to name specific things, but the movie as a whole left me quite unaffected. On a brighter note, the acting is adequate and some of characters are brilliant.All in all, Wild at Heart is a decently interesting but instantly forgettable film. An attempt at crafting a universal and abstract portrayal of human beings, which, to me, falls short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wizard of Oz meets True Romance, that is the first thought i have after watching this masterpiece. Being new to films by the legend that is David Lynch, i am working my way through his films and creations. All of which i am extremely fond of. Back to Wild at Heart, The film really IS something else in my eyes especially for its time of release obviously with Lynch films audiences never know what to expect but can always expect the out of the ordinary. The plot when summarised to someone can only expect an action thriller of sorts, when informed David Lynch is behind it no one knows what quite to expect. The lead character is Nicholas Cage who i must so was fantastic for the part the way he delivers all of his dialogue which i must add the film is extremely well written in every sense. The dialogue seems somewhat very real aside strange moments within the film.But as a whole the film is a love story and a very good one at that. As throughout id say the film raises high emotion. Some scenes i must say have rather high suspense and on top of this the music is utilised so well.This review may be rather vague but i want viewers to go watch the film in a similar frame of mind as myself, and thats knowing very little about the film i was about to watch other than expectations i already had from Lynch.All in all fantastic watch. Though a little slow at times.</fullReview>

That being said, I admired Lynch's daring in deciding to take on the whole of American pop culture with this project. The Elvis and Wizard of Oz references, as well as the overt violence and sexuality, are not all that subtle, which is part of the reason I think that overall the picture misses the mark. Thinking about it from this angle, the picture ends up seeming like a lighter-weight, low intensity Natural Born Killers in one sense, Oliver Stone's brilliant, excessive, shiv-to-the-ribs of Americans and what entertains them.This picture is entertaining, interesting, even offensive at times, but all in all, far from Lynch's best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't be too shocked by my 5 out of 10. I mark harshly. I'd heard a lot of Hype about David Lynch. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about so I borrowed "Wild at Heart" from a friend. To be honest I don't see what all the fuss is about...although I've heard Blue Velvet is the one to watch. However just because a director has made something great , it doesn't excuse them from any horrible film they made prior to or after. Anyway...without much further ado welcome to my next review:CONS: I did not care for the main story of the Sailor and Lulu, nor did I feel like there was enough character development for me to warrant care. The characters were just there doing things and there didn't seem to be any real explanation as to why.The story didn't really make a whole lot of sense. Sure the basic plot did, but there were other things going on that just seemed to come out of nowhere and took away from your interest in the main story overall.Too violent. There has been violence in films for a long time, but there is a difference between warranted violence, which is there to help the story or shock you or even be a stylized and funny thing (ie, city of god, kill bill) and pointless violence just there to disgust you (ie, saw). This film contained several scenes of pointless violence.Sexually explicit. Unnecessary nudity. There is some nudity in a character named Mr.reindeer's house which suits his character and is quite funny, but the nudity of the character lulu and others is pointless. Also some of the things they talk about were unnecessary and just seemed in the same category as the pointless violence, and a scene with sailor grabbing a woman's "parts" from behind seemed a little graphic.This film has several moments that made me think, "The director gets that, but I'm pretty sure no one else could unless he explained it to them in person." This isn't clever, it's bad directing.Too long. Being a film that never really explains why things are happening, you loose interest in finding out what happens quite quickly. PROS: This film was well done technically. There were some good shots and you never felt left out due to a technical reason. Also the various close up shots of matches and cigarettes and the use of color filters over the sex scenes was intriguing.This film is weird. If you are sick of "cut copy" "same old same old" characters and story, then this film is for you. It's full of wonderfully weirdo characters and strange story elements. The prime example being a man in a bar in new Orleans who sounds like a duck and talks about pigeons carrying disease.Also in a similar vein this film has a nice dreamy quality. It's not quite on par with Donny Darko, but it will be for some quite intriguing. Kind of like late night early 90's video clips.MIDDLE GROUND: The acting never shone through as brilliance, but never really seemed to drag things down either. None of the character's really had enough of an emotional background to work with anyway, except maybe Laura Dern's character which was played reasonably well.The soundtrack was sometimes great sometimes bad. Mostly the heavy metal didn't work for me (even though I'm a heavy metal fan.)ALL IN ALL: Really not that good, a bit too strange and unnerving, however has some interesting characters and a dream like quality.SIMILAR TO: An early 90's video clip. ANTITHESIS: "The Usual Suspects."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who is David Lynch, and why are his films so strange??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is from Missoula, Montana, and if you've ever been there, it would strike you as one of the most ordinary, and probably conservative, places in America. It just shows that what we become is mainly unrelated to where we came from."Wild at Heart" is a very strange film, not the kind of film most viewers would enjoy. Not only is there violence, but Lynch goes out of his way to make it gory. Blood everywhere, a hand blown off, a head blown off. Or, less gory but as disgusting, a pile of vomit on the carpet with worms and flies around it. Nicolas Cage stars as Sailor, completely in love with and devoted to Lula (Laura Dern). Diane Ladd, Dern's real life mother, player her mother here, who seems willing to do anything to eradicate Sailor and save her daughter. Ladd player her role utterly and completely "over the top" for the duration. Near the beginning of the movie we see Sailor's temper, when a man threatens him with a knife, Sailor beats him so badly that he dies, earning him a couple of years in jail. But when he gets out, and back with Lula, that's when the movie really begins. Most of it involves them driving west, with stops in New Orleans and various Texas stops, breaking his parole. Chasing them are various characters out to eliminate Sailor. Willem Dafoe has a good time as the dastardly Bobby Peru. Crispin Glover (of BTTF fame) has a strange role as Dell who likes to have cockroaches in his underwear. Isabella Rossellini has an unusual role as Perdita. Harry Dean Stanton is Johnnie Farragut, who thinks he is Ladd's boyfriend. And cute Sherilyn Fenn is seen briefly as the girl in the accident, dying at the side of the road. So, do I like this movie? Of course, I like this movie. When you are a movie fan, you owe it to yourself to see all kinds. It isn't my favorite genre, but Lynch does some things that no one else does, and creates a different kind of "art." But it isn't for everyone.SPOILERS FOLLOW. When Bobby Peru sets up Sailor by recruiting him to help in a "simple" robbery, he really intends to kill Sailor. He is one of the hired assassins. But things go wrong for Bobby, a local policeman ends up being quite a marksman, shooting Bobby who falls back and accidentally blasts his own head off. Sailor is captured, sent to prison, Lula has their son who is almost 6 when Sailor gets out, they meet, but Sailor does not want to cause them any more grief, kisses them bye and walks away (shot in Dallas or San Antonio). But he encounters 6 or 8 thugs who beat him, when he gets up he realizes his mistake, and runs back and finds and rejoins Lula and their young son. They are just wild at heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous and original story telling...Lynch at his Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People really just crack me up. I read reviews on this site saying that this film is a pointless piece of junk from a dull and overrated director, made only so that Lynch could show off his "trademarks". I read reviews saying that the Cannes jury must have been bribed the year this film won Best Picture. I read reviews saying that normally the reviewer is a Lynch fan, and that they loved "Twin Peaks," but that this film did nothing for them. I really just don't understand. Does originality mean anything in this day and age? Have new and wonderful ideas on ways to tell a story lost their value in our world? How is it that so many human beings, with a brain in their cranium, can hate movies like "Wild At Heart," or "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon," or "Being John Malkovich?" Maybe I'm a moron, or just a complete individual, but I really feel like I'm the only person who thought that this film was an incredible work of art. I thought that the acting was great, that the story was fascinating, and that the dialogue complimented the film wonderfully. What people don't seem to understand is that film is not about endings that explain everything and wrap it all up for you in a neat little package. Film isn't about special effects, loud explosions, and $500 million budgets. When watching a Lynch film, one can't expect it to be like a Spielberg movie...you have to look at it as an art. And art doesn't tell you what to think, it's completely interpretive--that's what's so great about music, poetry, paintings, sculpture, writing, ect. In the world of art you aren't told what to think, and you can have your own opinion that never can be wrong. If you look at film as art, than Lynch is the van Gogh of the film industry. His films are smart and intriguing, and draw you into a plot that grabs hold of you and never lets go. I can't say any more about this...you either like Lynch or you don't I suppose, but I really just feel sorry for those that can't understand his films--you are missing out. I highly recommend this film...don't miss it, Lynch fan or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ugly, violent and disturbing would best describe 1990's 'Wild at Heart'. Normally a fan of David Lynch, it took all I had to keep from throwing up after watching this morbid and sickening road trip to hell. Only the solid work of Harry Dean Stanton and Crispin Glover were the saving graces in this utterly worthless movie experience. I really wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone, except, perhaps my worst enemy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch Shot His Creative Wad with "Blue Velvet"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just awful. Contrived in the worst way and straining so hard to be weird and offbeat that the film comes off as pedestrian. The horror and weirdness in "Blue Velvet" was rooted in the real world---strange and offbeat but horrific because it was oddly familiar and the spectator could recognize enough elements of "real life" amidst the odd landscape that it took on the quality of a nightmare. Here, Lynch just creates a vacuum of weirdness that has nothing familiar to resonate or bounce off of, so the experience is just tedious and...dare I saw it?...pretentious. Ditto for "Lost Highway", an even worse film for almost the same reasons. Rent "Blue Velvet" again and avoid this overwrought and disappointing turkey.The genius is trying too hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, cheesy mess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I'm a worse person for having seen this film. The other two people watching it with me were certainly displeased at me for having suggested it (based on another friend's recommendation). Aside from a few funny/weird-cool scenes, i.e. Crispin Glover's segment and the character of Bobby Peru, this movie is a stupid ordeal. The bad 80's hard rock, line after line of cliche, badly-directed shock scenes, and poorly dating slang and fashion sap all the fun away from this movie. "Fargo" did all the gore/botched crime scenes better, and there are far better road movies. Telling line: "Oh, Sailor. This world's Wild At Heart and weird on top." Intentionally kitsch or not, who cares? Give this a pass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical Lynch film - I'll leave it to you to decide if that's a good thing or bad thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost two years after beating a man to death in a fight, Sailor is released from prison and restarts his relationship with Lula - much to the disapproval of Lula's mother. When Sailor and Lula break parole and head for California, she hires a hitman after them to kill Sailor. Unaware of this, Sailor and Lula continue west, encountering all manner of weird and wonderful people on their way.I first tried to watch this when it first came on television, but I was watching it with family and felt uncomfortable with the nudity and turned it off. Years later I have seen many other Lynch films, have loved Twin Peaks and looked forward to a chance to watch it. I sat to watch it aware of the basic plot and that it was to be full of references to Wizard of Oz, but I wasn't prepared for the biggest surprise - that it just wasn't that good a film. I am not adverse to Lynch's universe of weird characters but I don't like it when I get the feeling that he is simply being weird for the sake of it.Certainly that seemed to be the case here: the plot is so loose and meaningless to almost be pointless even as a frame for weirdness - which is what it really is. The references to Wizard of Oz are all there but, rather than being part of the film, they are stuck in with clumsiness all the way - they seem like a gimmicky afterthought rather than a carefully scripted part of the film. The plot is more a collected of the usual Lynchian weirdness and gore. Sometimes this works really well when it is framed within an engaging film, but here the characters, images and action are all just left drifting in a relatively empty film. It's a shame because I really like many of Lynch's films and was looking forward to this, but even I am forced to admit that this film just isn't that good.The cast features many of Lynch regulars, but many seem to be lost due to the fact that they haven't got the material to do their stuff within. Cage is really quite good despite his simple character. Dern is given more to do but comes across rather hammy with it - her character should have had the emotional buy in to the film but she can't deliver it. Turns from Dafoe, Stanton, Rossellini, Fenn, Glover and others are all good but they exist as free floating weird characters rather than part of the film in the way I would have liked.Overall this is a typical Lynchian film in it's imagery, weird characters, strange story and violent/sexual content. Usually these would be good things in this context but here they aren't put together very well creating a film that, although worth seeing and weirdly fascinating, is not actually that good a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wild at Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director David Lynch, this film (along with The Elephant Man and Blue Velvet) makes more sense than many of his others, and is really good. It is all about Nicolas Cage as Sailor, the film pretty much starts with the explanation for the title, when he murders a black man. 20 or so years later he is released and is reunited with his true love, Lula (Laura Dern). This film has quite a few flashbacks with both characters, and you kind of have to pay attention to them, but Lula's Mum character is one of the nastiest and most unusual stories of the film. In real life Cage is an Elvis fan, and the character having a real enthusiasm about him is really important to the story, especially at the very end. The ending is the best part, besides when Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe) blows his head off, when he is beaten up by thugs he calls homosexuals, he waken up by The Wizard of Oz's good fairy, and he runs back to Lula, and he sings a fantastic version of Elvis's "Love Me Tender", it was quite emotional. Also starring J.E. Freeman as Santos, Back to the Future's Crispin Glover as Dell, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Diane Ladd as the horrible Marietta Fortune, Calvin Lockhart as Reggie, Isabella Rossellini as Perdita and Harry Dean Stanton as Johnnie Farragut. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound. Nicolas Cage was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wild at heart is in my opinion one of the worst films ever made. The director tries really hard to make a film that is unlike most of the other films. (And that is almost all he manages). OK, this is not a mainstream film from the Hollywood-factory, but what is the point of making a film that is so repulsing and dull. Lynch tries once again to fool some of the audience to think that movies which are different from mainstream-films are good movies, but that's not true in this case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For once, David Lynch's nightmarish visions repulse instead of fascinate...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch's films, although unsettling (intentionally) and occasionally off-putting, are usually very exciting to watch. He's such a visceral filmmaker, with an uncanny grasp of bringing personal nightmares right out into the daylight, that it sets an audience off. Viewers are immediately taken aback, and it takes a while to get used to his rhythm all over again whenever a new picture of his comes out. But "Wild at Heart" isn't even much of an attempt, and there's nothing gossamer or delicate about it, nothing mysterious; it seems to have been made by a truck driver, barreling his way through a traffic jam. Lynch's penchant for in-your-face vulgarity reaches its zenith; in fact, this is just vulgar bravado in search of a movie, with characters that are like fingernails raking a chalkboard. Lynch transposes "fairy tale" elements onto a mostly-familiar lovers-on-the-run story with Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern playing the sweethearts, anti-heroes trying to evade Dern's mother (the degraded Diane Ladd) but, alas, leaving havoc in their wake. Overlong and crummy-looking, the film is twisted, foul-mouthed...and yet much worse, it is debased. It's another chapter in Lynch's fascination with the classes (trailer-trash life vs. suburbia), with the requisite desert psychos and doomed Lolitas, but I found it incredibly repetitive and not all that wild. * from ****</fullReview>
