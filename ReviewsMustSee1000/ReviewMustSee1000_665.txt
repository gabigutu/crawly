		<shortDescription>Funny AND intelligent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much more to this film than Dustin Hoffman running around in a dress trying to act like a woman. Tootsie is one of the most intelligent comedies I've ever seen. It is perfectly cast, well-layered, and full of surprises.Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey. He seems to know everything about acting except how to stay employed as an actor. In an early montage we see him auditioning for numerous plays where he is either too old, too young, too short, simply not the right guy for the part, or in some cases impossible to work with. We also see him trying to teach his craft to some young wannabe actors, and working at a restaurant to pay the bills. After a hilarious argument with his agent, he is simply told "No one will hire you!" The very next shot has Hoffman in drag walking down the street to an audition for a soap opera part his friend (Terri Garr) was unable to land. So intent is the chauvinistic director (Coleman) on casting a woman that looks tough enough for the part of a hospital administrator, Hoffman is denied without so much as a reading. He responds with a hilarious tirade that opens the door to his television career. Hoffman lands the part, and is soon winning over fans all over the country.While Hoffman finds it wonderful to be working regularly, his personal life is understandably put to the test. He alienates Garr, is constantly made fun of by his roommate (Murray) and falls in love with one of his co-stars (Lange) who of course cannot learn his secret or he's out of a job. Things are further complicated when two older men fall in love with him. It would be pointless to try and describe some of the awkward situations he finds himself in. You must see the movie to experience them for yourself.The film is so well-cast it's incredible. There are so many fine actors at work here that it almost becomes a contest of who can steal the scene first. Murray gets his share with his improvised lines. His lamenting of the state of his plays during a party scene will have you howling. The icing on the cake was director Sydney Pollack agreeing to play Hoffman's agent. They only have a few scenes together, but they are the film's best.Tootsie is head and shoulders above other films I've seen that deal with men in women's clothing. Mrs. Doubtfire for example was all slapstick without much heart. In the end it tried to redeem itself in that department and just got way too sappy. Tootsie also wisely holds back in the feminism department. Although Hoffman's Dorothy Michaels is clearly a woman who inspires others to stand up for themselves, he is advised to tone it down by Pollack in one scene. Hoffman feels his Dorothy character should be doing specials and giving advice and whatnot, but Pollack reminds him, "You have NOTHING to say to women, Michael." In other words, you're lucky you've gotten away with the stunt up to this point, now you should be looking for a way to get out.Overall Tootsie is wonderful experience. It made a fortune when released, and is still very relevant today. Don't miss it! 10 of 10 stars from the Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Don't Get Better Than This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember when comedies used to be actual movies with actual stories with actual points and the funny just flowed out of them, instead of just a flimsy excuse to string together jokes and funny scenes and stock situations? Yeah, me too. What happened? If you're in the mood for a great movie that will get you to cough up a boatload of honest laughs, then you ain't gonna do better than TOOTSIE. You are not going to find a better written, acted, and directed comedy anywhere. There are plenty as good - but none better. This is a career highpoint for all involved, and when "all" includes names such as Sydney Pollack and Dustin Hoffman, you know that's a sentiment that carries some significant weight. And it just reaffirms the old adage that every single comedy should have Bill Murray in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A shining comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael, an unemployed actor in New York, takes desperate measures by dressing up as a woman called Dorothy Michaels and gets a job at an TV soap opera, where he falls in love with Julie. But how to tell her that he is actually a man...? Winner of 3 Golden Globes ( Best movie comedy/musical, best actors Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange ) and one Oscar ( Best actress Jessica Lange ), "Tootsie" is a small masterpiece of intelligent comedy, full of emotions, love and interesting observations about the relationship between women and men.-------The situations are deliciously written. Just take the scene where Dorothy is auditioning for the role in the TV soap opera but is turned down because she is "too soft". Her response is gold: "Yes, I know what you want! You want some gross caricature of a woman to prove some idiotic point, like power makes women masculine, or masculine women are ugly...! Well, shame on you, you macho sh*t a**!" When later asked from the producer if she was just acting when she said that or if she was natural, she responded: "Which answer will get me the job?" Needless to say she got the job that instant, and a special place in my heart. But the best scenes are the ones where Dorothy is constantly improvising on the set, like when she was supposed to say to a woman who was beaten up by her man to take a therapy, but instead decided to tell that she would never let a man raise his hand on her( and then she threw a vase of flowers into the wall! ). Wonderful fun! Billy Wilder would be proud!Dustin Hoffman is pure genius, more as a woman then as a man, as are Terri Garr and Bill Murray, before his critical fame with "Lost in translation" and "Broken flowers". "Tootsie" is quite simply a classic all the way through!Grade: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the best gender comedy of all time! Everything in this baby clicks: A script that is both clever, endearing and realistic in its depiction of the emotional transformation within Michael Dorsey, incredible acting performances (with Dustin Hoffman, Terri Garr and unbilled Bill Murray as standouts) and a great soundtrack that adds volumes to the mood of the film.This is a 10!

		<fullReview>It's more than a movie about a man in drag and it's more than just a great movie. This movie goes to show that Dustin Hoffman is best at playing the oh-so-very-different characters. Whether it's his unforgettable character in Rainman or Michael Dorsey/Dorthy Michael in this, Dustin is at his best when he plays someone DIFFERENT, someone who is not your average person.This film will make you laugh, that's for sure, but it'll also make you rethink about the things that really make you happy in your life, something too few of us think about...almost never.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE COMMENTS OF A FILM ADDICT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow!, what a film anyone who has seen this film would definetly agree with me that this film touches you in so many different places. It's funny, sad but also appealing to so many different people. Dustin Hoffman is superb in it, so is Jessica Lange the way they act on set together is very amusing but when they are alone, it's always an emotional scene. Especially the scene in which Julie (Lange) throws a glass of champagne at him when he tries to come on to her at a party, it's so funny. Murray is also good as Hoffman's mixed-up flat mate. Sydney Pollack the director also takes a small role as Hoffman's Agent who unsuccesfully tries to find him work. The viewer sees the struggle of all the characters in their everyday life. There is also a touch of romance in the fim for the sentimentals in this world. The whole team bonds together to create a funny, imaginative film suitable for anyone who is in the mood for a laugh or a cry. I thouroughly reccomend it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lange, Hoffman Fun To Watch In This Justifiable Hit Of Its Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's strange how seeing a man dressed up as a woman always seems to be funny and popular with the audiences. Milton Berle helped make television with skits like this on his early 1950s show. It works here, too, with Dustin Hoffman applying the makeup and playing the role to the hilt.Helping Hoffman is Jessica Lange in, by far, her most attractive role. I'm not particularly a fan of hers but she looked spectacular in here, almost like Marilyn Monroe. This was a popular film because the humor was good and the two leads did a nice job, and people like a good romance story, too. Hoffman, like him or not, is a fabulous, able to play so many diverse roles. He's an amazing actor.Sometimes overlooked is the big-name supporting cast which includes Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Chares Durning and Geena Davis. The latter was making her screen debut in here!This isn't as "cute" as it was 25 years ago but it sure was a justifiable bit hit back in the early '80s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 2nd thing you do before you die. See 'Tootsie'!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is 10 things I would advise my grandchildren to do in their life, watching this film is the 2nd. You think I'm joking though, I am not.Over the years of cinema the entire trend of men in drag has been used, abused then labeled as being gay. For all you homo-phobics that think this is purely a 'girly flick' with cheeky unfunny drag gags, then stop right there. You couldn't be more wrong. I agree that a man dressing up in womens clothing is no longer a big deal and is never humorous, after centuries of it. This is the most witty, hilarious and relaxed movie that so many actors and directors have missed completely when dealing with the whole 'drag' subject.The storyline is a hot tempered and highly opinionated out-of-work actor(Dustin Hoffman) is told by his agent (Sydney Pollack) in all kindness that nobody will hire him. He takes it upon himself to dress as a woman just so he is not recognized by those he has p'ed off in the past. From Michael Dorsey to Dorothy Michaels, Hoffman plays a woman with such a justice you forget she's not real. Just like everyone in the movie, you will fall for Tootsie head over heals!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to deny this as a funny film, because it is so hilarious! I find myself still cracking up after all these years, each time I see it. I've seen it countless times, and it's still a great watch.Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, an unemployed actor, who can't seem to get along with any director or writer in town. One day, he takes his friend, Sandy to audition for a part in a soap opera. She is turned down, and because he is so desperate for work, he dresses up like a woman, and goes in for the interview himself. He is hired because of his ( I mean, her) defiant attitude, and throughout the rest of the film, he is now known as, Dorothy Michaels.The film is hysterical, and well-written. There is not a time that I've seen this film, where I didn't laugh or smile. It's light, but has some adult material that might not be appropriate for anyone under twelve. It's cute, and there's really not much more to it than that. I think everyone will love it, once they give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful J. Lange Performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is Hoffman's film (and he's very good), Jessica Lange steals the show as Julie. Charles Durning adds another great performance to this growing gallery as Lange's old man. Terri Garr is bearable for a change and there is a slew of interesting character performances, especially by the director Sydney Pollack. A 7 out of 10. Best performance = Jessica Lange. A comedy that has not dated (Bill Murray is also exceptional). I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this New York tale. Hoffman deserved his Oscar nomination and I'm glad Lange won a supporting Oscar since she lost to Mess Streep instead of winning for FRANCES.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine the problems Michael Dorsey, an unemployed New York actor, has to face in his daily life. Auditions that lead to rejections don't set well with his ego, or his livelihood. Since he can't land a part on a soap opera as a man, he decides to try it as a woman, only to become an instant success. But the problem is to keep the fictitious Dorothy Michaels alive and not make an obvious mistake that will make him lose the badly needed income.Little does Michael know he will become friendly with the beautiful female star Julie Nichols, who sees in Dorothy a kind soul who she can identify with. To make matters worse, Julie's father Lee, also finds beauty and possibly romance with the her daughter's co-star! In the meantime, Michael must juggle his newly found fame with the dwindling relationship he has with Sandy, his long time girlfriend. Michael is playing with fire and it will be only a matter of when he will be found out.Sydney Pollack, a director not associated with comedy, made a tremendous contribution to this film. He must have been having a great time because it shows in the end product, which is a satisfying comedy that can be seen again, and again. It helps too that a talented man like Larry Gelbart wrote a great screen play that is fun and light.Dustin Hoffman did a wonderful job of Michael/Dorothy. He is always a joy to watch as a man, or as a woman. Mr. Hoffman always gives his everything to anything in which he appears, as it's the case in this movie. Jessica Lange made the most out of the beautiful Julie Nichols, a girl with the heart in the right place. Charles Durning also is at his best playing Lee Nichols a man that thinks he has found love with this earthy Dorothy. The rest of the cast does amazing work. Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Geena Davis, and even the director himself, bring conviction to their characters."Tootsie" has the right ingredients and intelligent contributions by Mr. Pollack and its star, Dustin Hoffman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.The standard for actors these days is folded acting. That's where an actor acts the part of an actor and communicates both to the audience. I have a database of hundreds of such projects.There are two jokes this time around. The first joke is that the character is an obsessive method actor and is played by the most obsessive method actor of the time. This is pretty sweet, turning his usually obnoxious excesses into humorous prancing. To accentuate the joke, he is surrounded by actors who can communicate without showing us that they are trying. Bill Murray is so natural and Jessica Lange so real, they bracket the self-reference.To further guide us in this layering, the director himself has a major role, and in fact most of the funniest reactions. His role outside the film is roughly analogous to that within the film.The second joke is the old Shakespearean bit: lovers disguised to each other. I thought this humor was substantially less clever. The thread seems to exist only to distract from the more clever joke. Part of that distraction is Geena Davis in underthings, one of a couple stage jokes.I like to recommend movies in pairs. Watch this. Think about the self-reference bit. Then wonder what it would be like if Jessica's character's character (Nurse Charles) got confused about the levels too. Wouldn't that be the obvious next step in the self- referential humor, and from precisely the other direction? Then see `Nurse Betty' and watch Rene play Jessica playing Charles play Betty and pretending not to.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another man as woman comedy...but one that really works!!...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There must have been something in the drinking water at around the time of TOOTSIE because Julie Andrews had just played a woman pretending to be a man and here we have DUSTIN Hoffman in the same situation and for the same reason--gainful employment.Anyway, Dustin does a believable job as Dorothy Michaels, the character he invents when it seems his job tryouts are all in vain. He's a man who seems to attract enemies like flies but when he puts on his Dorothy make-up they're more like moths attracted to a flame.This makes dealing with his girlfriend TERI GARR even more difficult, not to mention the fact that he's smitten with JESSICA LANGE, the soap opera actress who treats him like her best girl friend.With director Sydney Pollack and Bill Murray in supporting roles, TOOTSIE gets by because Dustin's Dorothy character is so appealing and believable. She has to be, otherwise all the other cast members would be able to see through the disguise.It's enjoyable light comedy fluff that wound up getting so many Oscar nominations I lost count. JESSICA LANGE did win for her Best Supporting Role and DUSTIN Hoffman at least did win a Golden Globe for his impersonation of the title character. An Oscar win would have been justified.Forgive the upper and lower type discrepancies. For some reason, my software doesn't type Hoffman in capital letters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Perfect Screen Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If someone ever wanted to write a textbook on how to make the perfect movie comedy, this film should be the number one reference point. The 1982 film TOOTSIE became an instant classic and is just as funny twenty-three years later as it was at the time of initial release. I love this movie because, like THE WIZARD OF OZ, no matter how many times I watch it, I always see something I never noticed before. Sidney Pollack's inspired direction (and those who know Hoffman, know he probably "collaborated" with Pollack)perfectly brought together all the elements of this winning story about an unemployed actor/acting teacher/waiter named Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) who, despite being a wonderful actor, cannot get work as he has earned a reputation for being "difficult." Desperate to earn $8000.00 in order to produce a play that his roommate (Bill Murray) wrote, he dresses in drag and auditions for a role on a soap opera and actually gets the part. Complications ensue when he falls in love with the soap's leading lady (Jessica Lange), butts head with the soap's creepy director (Dabney Coleman), and has to hide what he's doing from his neurotic friend (Teri Garr, in a performance that should have won her the Oscar)who also auditioned for the soap role he got, a ruse that has the woman convinced Michael is gay. And if that weren't enough, Lange's father, played by the always solid Charles Durning, falls in love with Michael's female alter ego, Dorothy Michaels. Everything works in this film. Towering above everything is the amazing performance by Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels. Unlike Julie Andrews in VICTOR/VICTORIA, Hoffman is completely believable as a woman. As a matter of fact, his screen time as Dorothy is the strongest part of his performance. Jessica Lange is a charming leading lady (though I still think the Best Supporting Actress Oscar should have gone to Garr, not Lange)and even director Pollack makes his scenes count as Michael's agent George Fields. This film demands and deserves multiple viewings and will always be considered a benchmark of American film comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Brilliant Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie just has to be one of the greatest comedies ever made. It is hilirious. Struggling and notoriously hard to work with actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) takes on the role of a woman in a daytime television soap opera, basically because he cannot get any more jobs as a male actor due to his reputation. The fun starts early on in the film with Dorothy Michaels appearing in the New York crowd suddenly and going for the script reading. From then on the film is sentimental, touching, dry and absolutely side-splittingly funny. The other actors/actresses in the film really do make it work. It is brilliantly cast with comedic moments from Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning and the ever-brilliant and sarcastic Bill Murray. I wasn't even born until two years after the movie came out, but it's still so fresh and full of life after 22 years that you just have to love it. It's definately a five star for this. ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unemployed actor with a reputation for being difficult disguises himself as a woman to get a role in a soap opera. Michael Dorsey is an unemployed actor with an impossible reputation. In order to find work and fund his friend's play he dresses as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and lands the part in a daytime drama. Dorsey loses himself in this woman role and essentially becomes Dorothy Michaels, captivating women all around the city and inspiring them to break free from the control of men and become more like Dorsey's initial identity. This newfound role, however, lands Dorsey in a hot spot between a female friend/'lover,' a female co-star he falls in love with, that co-star's father who falls in love with him, and a male co-star who yearns for his affection. Roger Ebert wrote ""Tootsie" has a lot of fun with its plot complications; we get almost every possible variation on the theme of mistaken sexual identities. The movie also manages to make some lighthearted but well-aimed observations about sexism. It also pokes satirical fun at soap operas, New York show business agents and the Manhattan social pecking order. And it turns out to be a touching love story, after all - so touching that you may be surprised how moved you are at the conclusion of this comedy." Dustin Hoffman's acting skills are exemplified by acting as an actor pretending to be a woman an extraordinary challenge. Tootsie is a true classic. It fires on every cylinder. Hits every target. And provides non-stop laughter, heartfelt moments where you least expect them, and even finds the time to gently satirise soap operas and they're often quite ludicrous plot lines.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great tribute to Sydney Pollak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today the great Jewish-American Director, Producer and Actor Sydney Pollak lost his battle with cancer. Associated with films such as "The Firm", "Eyes Wide Shut", "Random Hearts", "Out of Africa", "Michael Clayton" and "Cold Mountain" just to name a few. He directed this film which stars Dustin Hoffman as a struggling actor Michael Dorsey. Michael Dorsey is struggling to get an acting role and when his girl friend Sandy (Terry Gar) fails to get a TV soapy role he becomes infuriated. He decides to pretend to be a women "Dorothy Michaels" and auditions for a role in the TV Hospital soapy and succeeds. He is able to fund his friend's play and continue with the disguise. He becomes exceptionally successful when his true masculine self emerges through his female nurse character. Dorothy Michaels becomes a national phenomena with her persona as a mature and emancipated liberated feminist and women including the female cast and crew look up to her. Dorothy becomes close to fellow actress the beautiful Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange) and they spend much time together. As he develops feelings for Julie her father also develops feelings for him and his disguise as a women commences to unravel. The film has great acting performance by all characters and won an Oscar for Jessica Lange and nominations in several categories. A delightful blend of comedy and romance this film explores the meretricious TV soapy and the struggles in undertaking an acting career if your poor. The film was released during the era of women's liberation as was a great success for its contemporary relevance and original story. Dustin Hoffman's acting skills are exemplified by acting as an actor pretending to be a women an extraordinary challenge. The film's elements and actors brought it such uniqueness that it would be very difficult to remake this film. A great tribute to the great Sydney Pollak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warm, witty and humane. A comedy that's withstood the test of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film with such a troubled production history, Tootsie emerges as a surprisingly polished, tightly plotted comedy. Despite numerous rewrites, a turnover in directors, and some off-screen conflicts between star Dustin Hoffman and director Sydney Pollack, its all the more remarkable that Tootsie is so successful.The film is like a well-oiled machine. Everything about it works. Right down the middle. From its inspired ensemble casting to its slick direction and witty script, Tootsie has endured for 25 years and is still going strong.Of all the films Dustin Hoffman has starred in, this surely must count as his finest. Perhaps because the character of Michael Dorsey so neatly captures aspects of Hoffman in real life.In the opening scenes, Michael is shown as an exacting method actor. He has tremendous range, an incredible variety of vocal chords, and a lot of interesting ideas. But they're ideas at odds with every director and co-star he works with.Michael may be a terrific actor, but he's rubbed a number of people up the wrong way through his constant critiquing and reinterpretations of the parts he's supposed to be playing. This has all given him a very bad reputation. And its gotten to the point where nobody in Hollywood will hire him.Now of course Dustin Hoffman has been constantly employed for the past 40 years. But everything else I said about Michael is pretty much the story of Hoffman's life. And its that key that allows Tootsie to flow as smoothly as it does.Hoffman must realise on some subconscious level he's playing a character not all that far removed from himself. And that's the genius of Tootsie. We already know and identify with Michael Dorsey, making it that much easier to go a further distance and identify with his alter ego, Dorothy Michaels.Michael hits on the idea if he can't get work as a man, maybe he can get work as a woman. So he invents Dorothy Michaels. A ballsy, brassy Southern belle with an acid tongue and opinions aplenty. And the ruse works! 'She' becomes the new hospital administrator on daytime TV's hottest soap opera, Southwest General.But what happens when Dorothy becomes an unexpected success? And the studio refuses to release Michael/Dorothy from his/her contract? The result? An hilariously madcap series of neverending complications! Tootsie is not the first film of course to tackle the themes of cross-dressing. But its every bit as accomplished as Some Like It Hot. Tootsie is a film I find very difficult to dislike. It's such a good natured film. And disarming in its ways. I've never met a single person who didn't find something to enjoy about Tootsie.The delights come from a wide variety of areas. Not only does Sydney Pollack's direction move at a marvellous gallop, but the wonderful cast breathes such life into an already witty screenplay. Its the efforts of everyone involved that gives Tootsie such spirit.Dustin Hoffman's performance is quite faultless. Not only does he excel as Michael, but he pulls out all the stops and turns Dorothy into a completely different person altogether. But its not just on Hoffman's shoulders. The rest of the cast do their part too.Tootsie has one of the most wonderful ensemble casts I've ever seen in a comedy. They all add something. And not a single actor is wasted. Jessica Lange turns in a nicely defined performance as Julie Nichols, Dorothy's co-star on Southwest General. The woman he falls for. Something that only adds more complications to Michael's life.Teri Garr does a wonderfully ditzy performance as Michael's neurotic girlfriend Sandy, who becomes more and more flustered by his increasingly odd behaviour. Dabney Coleman's on fine obnoxious form as Ron, the director of Southwest General and Julie's two-timing boyfriend. And Charles Durning adds a bit of sweetness as Les, Julie's father who falls for Dorothy. Talk about a bizarre love triangle!In a nice touch, Sydney Pollack also co-stars as Michael's exasperated agent George. Their disagreements so obviously mirrors the exact same thing that occurred between Hoffman and Pollack off-set. But they're just as funny as anything else in the film. Also look out for an early appearance from Geena Davis as one of Southwest General's hospital sluts.But of course its the wonderful Bill Murray who steals every scene he's in as Michael's laidback laconic roommate Jeff. It sometimes seems like Jeff is the sanest person in the entire film. His dry observations on the shifting complications in Michael's life are positively sidesplitting. And his response to walking in on Dorothy and a male co-star making out holds one of the funniest lines Murray has ever delivered in his entire illustrious career.Pollack's direction is right on the nose, allowing Tootsie to glide from one classic scenario to the next. I'm especially partial to the part of the film where Dorothy has to babysit Julie's daughter, go on a date with Les, and fight off the sex-starved affections of a co-star all within the course of a single night.But Tootsie is a screwball comedy with a heart. Its not only an hilarious pileup of spiralling difficulties, but an extremely touching love story. Michael loves Julie, but she only sees Dorothy. There are many character arcs surrounding Hoffman and Lange, but they're relationship is the heart and soul of the picture. And everything converges beautifully in the final ten minutes. When Michael unmasks himself on live TV! And professes his love for Julie. His confession is not only sweet. But funny too.Tootsie is a true classic. It fires on every cylinder. Hits every target. And provides non-stop laughter, heartfelt moments where you least expect them, and even finds the time to gently satirise soap operas and they're often quite ludicrous plot lines.Unmissable entertainment!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable triple threat: as Michael, Dorothy, and Emily Kimberly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unemployable actor dresses in drag and gets a juicy female part on a popular television soap opera. Dustin Hoffman, at this point in his illustrious career, would hardly seem convincing as a struggling New York City actor who has to beg his agent for work, but his comic desperation here is funny and real at the same time. He's so likably obnoxious that we understand both his predicament and that of his poor agent's (played wonderfully by Sydney Pollack, who also directed). "Tootsie" doesn't come on like gangbusters, like a razor-sharp satire of show business; it is almost nonchalant about how clever it is, how consistently smart and beguiling. After it's over, one may feel energized by the sheer good will of the whole thing. The film leaves such a lasting impression that, thinking it over a few days later, it brings back some big laughs. It also features one of the greatest comedic ensembles of the last 40 years, with Jessica Lange winning a Supporting Oscar playing a TV nurse (her lazy, honeydew drawl is infectious and lovely). The film represents a milestone: a savvy humdinger of a comedy that is also a sweet story of self-discovery, and one that never condescends to its audience. ***1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Charming comedy about gender switches and underemployed actors.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like Syndey Pollack, he knows movies, and also how to make good ones. He not only directs "Tootsie", he also has a key role as the agent of difficult actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman in one of his very best roles). This movie was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Hoffman). And, Jessica Lange actually won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.Michael has a reputation for being difficult, although he is a talented actor, who coaches actors to help make ends meet. He was fired from his last gig making a commercial, dressed as a tomato, because he thought it was out of character for a tomato to be able to sit or stand. His break comes when a daytime soap opera is looking for someone to play a female character. With padding, female clothes, and dentures, he reverses his name and auditions as Dorothy Michaels, playing a tough character which the producers loved immediately and he got the job. That might have been the end of the story had he not fallen for pretty Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange), who treated him as a female best friend. All of that presents many opportunities for comedy, some subtle, some slapstick, as in the male character who makes passes at "her".The movie features a number of other fine actors and actresses, like Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Bill Murray, and Geena Davis. A fine and funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can't believe it took me 20 years to get around to seeing this movie; saw it about 15 minutes ago.It's got a great "period" feel to it (*if* you'll pardon the expression). The feel is partially 70's throwback feminism (I know the movie was made in 1982), partially great comic/entertainment values, to wit: A great script, great character development, excellent comic timing (including the editing). I mean, the movie walks a tightrope between espousing feminist "strong woman" ideals, and standing back and laughing at how funny we could look espousing those ideals. Quite an accomplishment for the time, and a sterling counterexample to the suggestion that Hollywood at that time had an unrelenting, strident "P.C." voice.Very good acting, all 'round. I really can't fault anybody. Though I do want to extend a special reference to Teri Garr. Man, she was one of the most fun people in that movie!It's got me thinking. I'm thinking of all times I've criticized movies because "the premise wasn't believable." But this movie reminds me of what is really important. Tootsie's premise was plainly not believable, yet it's still a perfectly fine movie. Why? Because the point is not the premise; the point is the invisible, mysterious process that invites your to suspend your disbelief, makes you *want* to suspend your disbelief, and *take that ride* with the creators. Everyone involved in this film did their part and won me completely over.Kudos, and thanks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1st watched 5/13/2001 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Pollack): Well done comedy/drama with excellent performance by Hoffman as the man posing as a woman to get a job as an actor or is it actress. Without Hoffman and the directing talent of Pollack this could have been a silly movie, but instead it's a smart, funny and thought-provoking film. The ending could have been sentimental trash, but it made us think about how men should treat women in everyday life. Hoffman is actually believable as Dorothy and that's really why this movie works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actors and writers rake in the chips</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This weekend, if you feel like having a piece of popcorn entertainment, make it a good run for the money by buying tickets to Sydney Pollack's new film Tootsie, a story about a job that requires the most greed, acting, sorry to anyone who believed it was a gig at a Las Vegas casino. But really, this person must be really self-conceited if he thinks that dressing up like a woman will really get him calls from casting agencies. Of course, as a Hollywood story would have it, the plan works but slowly unravels like a cheaply made tapestry. The story is a poorly made fairy tale about how a ridiculous plan always works and when it falls to pieces and the guy gets the girl. But it is not the story itself that makes this movie a winner. It is the actors playing the characters in this guilt-ridden fable.In this story we have Oscar winning actor, Dustin Hoffman playing Michael Dorsey, an out of work actor who is getting no slack from his talent agent played by director, Sydney Pollack. Michael also has his experimental and often quirky roommate played by Bill Murray. There is also Michael's love interest, played by the brilliant Jessica Lange. The story may sound ridiculous but we have the actors that reel in the audience. Dustin Hoffman, a magnificent actor if I do say so myself, I remember when the world really got a taste of him in Kramer vs. Kramer, which got him his first win as best male actor in a lead role. To be honest, anybody could play this role, John Candy could've played a role like this even Jerry Lewis, but none of them could project the charm that Hoffman gives us in this film. Then there is Sydney Pollack, who plays Michael's talent agent. The lines written for the agent were witty and hysterical and who knows how to give witty and hysterical lines better than the director himself? When Pollack said the lines, "YOU WERE A TOMATO," I couldn't help it but I had to laugh it up because the delivery by Pollack is just gold. There is also the ravishing Jessica Lange who plays actress Julie Nichols, who is also Michael's love interest in this story. Most Hollywood movies of today cast no-talent blondes with bosoms as big as a man's head to play love interests but this time we have a woman with substance to play the part. A woman who uses words to express herself, not shaking her breasts to receive rave reviews by the male critics, a woman who is smart and articulate to play a role in a movie, a woman named Jessica Lange. Then there is the surprise cast member, Mr. Bill Murray, also known as the Ghostbuster, Carl the grounds keeper and Tripper Harrison. It has been reported that Mr. Murray asked not to have his name mentioned in the trailer or any other advertisements because people would mistake this as one of his comedies. But a man such as myself was rather surprised to see Bill Murray's name in the opening titles and more surprised when I didn't see him eating a Babe Ruth candy bar from out of the pool. The players in the story were an educated pick to make this story a hit, but there were also the writers who gave us the witty dialog.Larry Gelbart, the writer to the hilarious George Burns comedy Oh God!, returns to save a clichéd story with snappy and witty dialog to make the audience laugh. When Bill Murray's character came up and said, "I don't like when somebody comes up to me the next day and says, "Hey, man, I saw your play. It touched me; I cried." I like it when a guy comes up to me a week later and says, "Hey, man, I saw your play... what happened?" I thanked the lord himself that Larry Gelbart was here to give this movie the humorous dialog it needed. There was also dialog that was more dramatic and thought provoking, for example this quote from Dustin Hoffman, "I don't believe in hell. I believe in UNEMPLOYMENT, but not hell," this line made me think that Gelbart reached into my brain and wrote it down on a piece of paper that happened to be a page to the script of Tootsie.Tootsie, is a story about greed, courage, self-discovery and, what every movie needs, love. Basically, what every movie nowadays already has, very clichéd. Please, by all means, do not see this movie for its story but for great acting done by Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Sydney Pollack and Bill Murray. But let us not forget where the words coming out of their mouths come from, Larry Gelbart the screen writing genius. So when you go to the theaters to see Tootsie, be ready for a night of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Another Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey who plays Dorothy Michaels who plays Emily Kimberly, who plays characters in the film's staged soap opera like a violin. Maybe it's just me. But the whole concept of the film seems dated and crass. It harks back to the era when Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari disguised themselves as women, in the American TV sitcom "Bosom Buddies", or when John Ritter played straight Jack Tripper who pretended to be gay, in the 70's sitcom "Three's Company"."Tootsie", to me, seems like an extension of some 1970's TV sitcom that's exploring gender bending issues. The film's dreadful sitcom-like music amplifies that perception. Characters are shallow. The script is talky.And the plot is wildly improbable. Maybe Michael Dorsey could fool everyone back in the early 80s as Dorothy Michaels ... but not today. Twenty-five years after the film was released, Dorothy looks and sounds like a man in drag. Her vocal intonations veritably scream falseness. And that makes the story all the more preposterous.But then, as was "Bosom Buddies" and "Three's Company", the film is played for cheap laughs. It's a comedy. Yet so much of the comedy is based on deep-seated anger and frustration. At the outset, Michael has a genuine dilemma. Yet, how can I empathize with a protagonist who deceives so many, over such an extended period of time?For all that, the film's script does contain a few laughs, like when Michael and his agent George (well played by Sydney Pollack) argue about the logic of a tomato. And when the camera is focused on Emily in the New York based soap opera, a director inquires of the cameraman: "I'd like to make her (Hoffman in drag) a little more attractive; how far can you pull back"? To which the cameraman responds in a deadpan tone: "How do you feel about Cleveland"?A number of fine performances include Jessica Lange, Charles Durning, and Bill Murray. The film's production design, costumes, and color cinematography are all quite acceptable.I guess in its day the film's subject matter was novel. Certainly, the film was wildly popular, then. But times have changed. The underlying premise has not aged well. Despite some really fine acting and credible production values, "Tootsie" is very much a product of a gone-bye-bye entertainment era.</fullReview>

To me, it seemed extremely laughless and predictable for most of its running time. Nothing that I saw made me laugh all that much. Nothing surprised me at all. The only person who made me laugh in the entire movie was Bill Murray, who perhaps gives the funniest performance he has ever given in this film.Never, never will I understand why people think this movie is one of the best films of all time.

		<fullReview>Fairly amusing to begin with, this film quickly descends into realms of implausibility bordering on the absurd. The simple fact that Dustin Hoffman required hours of make-up work before each scene should be enough to make that obvious. Despite the film's flaws, Hoffman actually does pull it off and makes a convincing female soap-opera actor. The ending brings the whole film down to the level of a soap-opera, perhaps intentionally so. Enjoy Hoffman's performance but don't expect anything profound; this movie does not aim at gender politics, merely cliches and predictable audience tittering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Comedies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tootsie (1982) **** (out of 4)Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is an unemployed actor who is told by his agent (Sydney Pollack) that there's no one in the country that will hire him due to his attitude. Dorsey, seeing this as a challenge, decides to dress as a woman calling herself Dorothy Michaels and gets a job on a soap opera where he strikes up a relationship with one of the stars (Jessica Lange) on the show. As more and more pressure begins to mount, Michael must decide how to get out of the woman's outfit and reveal the truth.TOOTSIE is in my opinion one of the greatest comedies of the decade and I'd go even further and call it one of the greatest comedies ever made. There are so many wonderful things in the film and it works on so many levels that it's almost shocking when you look back at the film and see how wonderful it is. Not only does the "comedy" of a man dressing as a woman work but the film is more than just laughs as it hits on what it means to be an actor struggling to get work but there's also a lot of heart to the film and there's certainly many underline themes dealing with the differences between men and women.There are a lot of great things in this movie but there's no question that the true magic belongs to Hoffman who turns in one of his greatest performances. It's rather amazing to see him work here because he's basically got two different characters that share certain things but in the end they have to be separate characters. What impressed me the most was how believable he was as the female character. Not only does the supporting characters have to be able to believe he's a woman but the magic comes because when you see Hoffman as the woman, you believe it to. I think it's somewhat fitting that during the closing credits the character gets separate credits as does Hoffman. I think his performance as the woman is so great that many probably would believe that a real woman was playing her.The supporting cast is wonderful as well with Lange certainly deserving her Best Supporting Actress Oscar. She gives her character so much heart and pain that you can't help but root for her. Dabney Coleman and Charles Durning are both terrific in their roles as is Teri Garr who is downright hilarious as a somewhat psychotic friend. THen there's Pollack who is simply great as the agent. Bill Murray gives one of his greatest performances here because the story itself is quite out there yet his dry one-liners are just so hilarious that you can't help but have tears running down your face.Again, the film works perfectly as a comedy but it's so much more than that. The relationship between Dorothy and her co-worker is very believable and the various twists that happen in the plot seem real and they're never forced. The comedy comes in a very natural way and the realistic characters seem real and not something faked or made up. To me TOOTSIE is a flawless movie that manages to get funnier the more times you see it, which is something hard for a comedy to do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Male Fraud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A 1982 classic by Sydney Pollack, "Tootsie" stars Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey, a temperamental, opinionated and so unemployed actor. Desperately seeking cash, Michael adopts the identity of a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and applies for a role on a successful television soap. He gets the job. Much hilarity ensues."Tootsie" was released at the tail end of America's cinematic sweet-spot, a period when many high-concept comedies were directed with a neo-realist touch. And so "Tootsie" is as gritty and naturalistic as it is farcical. These two poles give the film qualities which are now almost obsolete in American cinema.Elsewhere "Tootsie" attempts to get political. Pollack portrays a world in which women are marginalised, patronised by chauvinists and reduced to sexual doormats. Michael gradually becomes aware of this sexism, experiences it himself, his cross-dressing opening his eyes to a form of all-pervasive "soft" oppression.Though well-intentioned, "Tootsie" was attacked by feminists of its time. For many, the film portrays women as weak, vapid or wildly hysterical, each saved only by a man's inspiring assertiveness. Likewise, Dorothy is ridiculed for her plain, homely appearance, and it is ultimately the "manliness" of Hoffman's character, and her supposedly non-threateningly asexuality, that is admired. Others criticised the film for its supposedly condescending attitude. In "Tootsie", simply putting on a dress allows a man to "know what it feels like to be a woman", allows a man to be a "better woman and actress" than a real women altogether, and allows a man to be praised for "recognising sexism", a stance which would get most women labelled bitter, sensitive, angry or man-hating.Politics aside, "Tootsie" is a very funny film, packed with witty one liners, another iconic performance by Hoffman and a small but memorable appearance by Bill Murray. The film ends with Michael revealing his gender on live television via a massively hilarious bit of improvised acting. Sydney Pollack co-stars as Michael's booking agent. The film would become one of Pollack's biggest hits.8.5/10 ? See "Holy Smoke" (1999).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't tell Tootsie goodbye, she's grand, one of the great despair-eradicators ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is a great actor in Manhattan but he's also unemployable. This is because he makes so many critical comments to the directors of plays, commercials, etc, that he is viewed as a major pain. His agent (Sydney Pollack) can't recommend him for any new project and he urges Michael to get "some therapy". Meanwhile, Michael's roommate Jeff (Bill Murray) and his best acting friend, Sandy (Teri Garr) are still in his corner. In fact, Michael is hoping to do a new play by Jeff at a playhouse in upstate New York. But, funds are dry. So, when Sandy tells Michael about a soap opera job she didn't get, Michael decides to "show the world" that someone will hire him. Dressing as a woman and calling himself Dorothy Michaels, Dottie lands the soap job. Absolutely no one thinks he is a man, not even a beautiful co-star, Julie (Jessica Lange) who is involved with the jerk director (Dabney Coleman). Making the most of his smaller part, Dorothy is soon so popular that her role becomes much larger. But, because Dottie may be falling in love with Julie and she/he doesn't want to spend the rest of his acting days as a female, just what will Dot do to become Michael again? Then, too, when the truth comes out, will Michael ever act again? Especially tricky is the fact that Julie's father (Charles Durning) is smitten with Dottie! Anyone see fun times ahead? This is a belly-bouncing, thigh-slapping comedy that chases away despair, in a big way. Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is the cat's meow as Dorothy, while Lange, Coleman, Geena Davis, Durning, Garr, Murray and all the rest are mighty fine as well. Naturally, one must applaud the costumes, since Dorothy has a certain look that must be maintained, while the sets, dazzling script and perfectly-timed direction should be praised highly, too. What, you've never seen Tootsie? Don't miss the chance to let go of any and all worldly cares and get it very soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That is one nutty hospital</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening sequence of Michael Dorsey teaching an acting class, intertwined with him applying the appropriate make-up while going for auditions and failing is a telling one. We see Dustin Hoffman's character as a consummate professional who will do anything he can for a role. This is very much like the Dustin we know from other films, and we feel that there are certainly strong elements of his own personality in here. However in this film it is taken to a ridiculous level as his attention to detail make it impossible to move out of character for the sake of a part to understand a director's point of view and putting him at loggerheads with his agent who cannot find work for him due to this meticulous attention to detail. Having been told that he will get no work in either New York or Hollywood due to people finding him unmanageable, he takes the drastic step of going for an audition as a woman in order to try and get an acting job.Thus begins the best cross-dressing film of all time. The script from this point on is superb as Michael Dorsey's alter ego Dorothy Michael's star rises, due to her appearance in a daytime soap, beyond anything that he thought would have been possible, Michael has to contend with both his lives becoming ever more confused as each life imposes restrictions of the other one.Unable to tell the woman he loves how he feels as she thinks he's Dorothy, unable to tell his girlfriend that he has got the role she originally auditioned for, and getting great counselling from his best friend and playwright, superbly brought to life by Bill Murray, who steals every scene he is in, within the film, we are treated to a film that could so easily have wound up in the farce category but manages deftly to avoid it.The rest of the cast in the form of Dabney Coleman, Jessica Lange and Sydney Pollock are great in their roles as Director, object of affection and agent respectively with everyone else in equally splendid form it's a masterclass in acting for anyone wanting to know what it takes to become a great actor.One of the films of the eighties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masculin/Feminin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been called a one-note joke as well as the best romantic comedy of the Eighties. Sydney Pollack's sharp contemporary comedy about gender-bending in a world that values artificiality struck like lightning at the time of its release. It took the premise started (and hinted) in SOME LIKE IT HOT and ran with it. Dustin Hoffman gives one of his immortal performances as the abrasive Michael Dorsey, a man purportedly based on his younger persona, a virtually unemployable actor who just won't take orders, even when playing a tomato for a commercial. Coming upon a casting advert for a role on a popular soap opera and at the edge of desperation for a job, Michael takes a big leap and decides to apply -- except that the role is meant for a woman. Dressed to the nines as Dorothy Michaels (something of a reverse form of his own name), he manages to win the part (even when it's a guest spot, slated to end after a short appearance). As Dorothy, however, Michael creates a vibrant character and his part is expanded, mainly due to Dorothy's unwillingness to play her role by the rules. Such a bold move -- which includes Michael's disdain for his director (Dabney Coleman) who insists on calling Dorothy "Tootsie" -- has raised ratings and thus created a media frenzy over this strangely empowered woman. Julie (Jessica Lange in an equally textured performance), a co-star, becomes Dorothy's friend and confidant.In the meantime, where Dorothy is gaining a cyclonic force, Michael's life is unraveling. His girlfriend Sandy (Teri Garr) suspects Michael may be cheating on her (since he frequently leaves her hanging), another fellow actor, John van Horn (George Gaynes) has the hots for Dorothy, and Julie's father Les (Charles Durning) has also become enamored of her. Sitting quietly by as the madness takes conscious shape is Jeff (Bill Murray), who is seeing Michael taking his role as Dorothy a little too seriously and stressing over what item goes with what in terms of dressing. Virtually every combination of gender confusion is thrown at the viewer, especially in a virtuoso sequence where poor Michael has to all but perform a miracle in order not to become another statistic on the front page of the New York Post, but when his contract becomes extended indefinitely, he decides he has to take matters into his own hands if he is to have his own life as a man.TOOTSIE is, plain and simple, excellent. It takes its subject matter seriously. Hoffman doesn't play the role like a man playing a woman but a man learning to be a woman and thusly, understanding how they tick, but using his natural abrasiveness to create an assertive female in a world that tends to treat women (like Julie) as submissive objects. His performance is so spot-on that it's no wonder the men in the movie fall for Dorothy: he inhabits Dorothy down to her vaguely Southern mannerisms and ante-bellum decorum. Just watch the montage in which Dorothy, now a media sensation, is being photographed in an assortment of outfits. It's what today's premiere drag performer Charles Busch would also do in his performances: use the nuances of a strong yet feminine energy to its fullest advantage. (As a matter of fact, Charles Busch himself would play a variation of the Michael Dorsey role in a soap opera.) TOOTSIE is a tour-de-force of Hoffman's acting as he is in perfect control of his character's duality. One of the premiere examples of gender-bending comedies -- VICTOR/VICTORIA being its feminine counterpart -- this is a movie that paved the way for future incursions into men not just donning women's clothes, but inhabiting a feminine persona. It's extremely sensitive as well: once the climactic sequence takes place and all is revealed, it's a surprise how affecting and emotionally satisfying this movie is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dustin Hoffman dressed as a woman...brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest strength of the movie is in the fact that the main character is being played by a well known and much acclaimed actor. Hoffman was nominated several times for an Oscar before this movie and even won one in 1979 for his role in "Kramer vs. Kramer". This is not the sort of role you would expect an Oscar winning actor to appear in. All the more reason why this movie works surprising as well as brilliant. Hoffman prevents the movie from getting silly and adds some seriousness to the movie, even though the story itself is of course still quite silly on its own.But it is of course more than just the leading actor that makes this movie work. The movie is also very well and clever written, unlike most comedies that are being released today. The movie doesn't rely on visual or comical situations but more on the cleverly written and directed situations and also the more realistic situations. "Tootsie" is a silly movie but not an unlikely one. Movies like this one and others like these from the same period are the reason why the '80's are often regarded as the golden decade for comedies.It's not only Hoffman that acts fine in this movie. Besides the Oscar nomination for Hoffman, it was Jessica Lange who actually got to take the statue home with her. Also nominated was Teri Garr (perhaps still best known for her role in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind") for her role in this movie. Other fine well known actors in this movie are Charles Durning, Lynne Thigpen, Sydney Pollack himself Geena Davis in her first movie role and Bill Murray (I had totally forgotten he also was in this movie, until my recent last viewing).The movie was actually nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, which is a real big achievement for a comedy. No way this could ever happen this present day, especially not with the sort of comedies that are being made now.But still there are some issues that I have with this movie. First of all this movie carries the curse of almost every '80's movie, it has a typical '80's soundtrack which sounds incredibly dreadful now this present day. The movie could had also used some more style on its own. It's an overall pretty formulaic made and even predictable movie that still works fine and powerful enough thanks to its clever story and professional actors. Sydney Pollack never really has been my favorite director. Don't get me wrong, he did a good job with this movie and its story but his movies always feel like they are lacking something, mostly in its style and perhaps also pace.All in all this movie surely will become and maybe already is a comedy classic, mainly thanks to the surprising Hoffman and the well written script.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kinda silly but it ain't no drag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sydney Pollack really had a good run for about 20 years as a versatile film director during which he made such films as They Shoot Horses Don't They, Jerimiah Johnson, The Way We Were, Three Days of the Condor, the electric Horsemen, Our of Africa, The Firm and of course Tootsie. If you can get past the implausibility of a man playing a woman and all the characters who know him as a man don't recognize him in his disguise than this film will work for you much the same way as in Mrs. Doubtfire years later. Then add to that premise that it is one of the world's most well known dramatic actors, Dustin Hoffman in the role of the guy in drag which continues to stretch the plot beyond belief. But you know what? Hoffman is so good and funny and surrounded by such a great cast that somehow it actually works. Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Bill Murray and Director Sydney Pollack co star in this film penned by comic writers Larry Gelbart and Elaine May along with Murry Schisgal, Don McGuire and Barry Levinson. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards including most of the majors for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in Dustin Hoffman, two Best Supporting Actress nominations for Teri Garr and Jessica Lange in her Oscar winning role and Best Screenplay in addition to Film editing, Cinematography, Music and sound. Like many films it looks and sounds a little dated today but it's still a bright comedy and I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best film comedies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tootsie" is that rarity, an extremely funny movie that doesn't drop down to the lowest common denominator. This is a story, that while somewhat off the wall is believable. The characters' motivations are plain as day, from Michael/Dorothy taking on a feminine persona to work in the soap, to Julie and Sandy's relationship to Michael/Dorothy. Dustin Hoffman is at his peak in the dual role, Jessica Lange is beautiful as Julie, Terri Garr is sweet and loyal as Sandy, and Charles Durning as fantastic as Les, Julie's Dad and Dorothy's suitor. The supporting cast is also top notch, featuring Dabney Coleman as the smarmy soap director, George Gaynes as a hammy soap doctor, Geena Davis in her big screen debut as a soap opera ingenue, and Sidney Pollack as Michael's agent among others. Bill Murray is hilarious as Michael's roommate, who helps with his deceptions and disguises, even though Bill didn't want a top billing. There are several hilarious scenes, my favorite is the one where Dorothy forces John Van Horn (George Gaynes) to look at her instead of the teleprompter. If you're looking for a real comedy that won't insult your intelligence, this is one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unemployed New York actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) goes through harsh measures in order to establish a name for him self. His arrogant attitude and stubborn temper irritated every producer in the city leaving him job-less. Michael's room mate, Jeff (Bill Murray) plays a witty, positive character that has an offer to make. If Michael can come up with eight thousand dollars in order to fund his production, Michael can play the lead role. In bringing an acting friend/love interest, Sandy (Teri Garr), to an audition Michael is overcome with an idea that would change his acting career in the most positive way. No producer would higher the arrogant Michael Dorsey, but Dorothy Michaels who is a strong-hearted, threatening woman would be sure to get the job as Emily Kimberly in "Southwest General" a day time drama series. This comedy would not be complete without a silly love twist involving a "Southwest General" nurse (Jessica Lange), her father (Charles Durning) and another co-worker (George Gaynes). The complications of having two identities provoke hilarious encounters with both of the sexes interested in Michael-Dorothy. You may not be a fan of the cheesy music and some of the corny humor, but seeing Dustin Hoffman dressed up as a woman and actually caring about how a dress hugs her hips could put a smile on anyone's face. The dialogue adds to this humor with sharp, quick wit often referring to the stereo types portrayed in both men and women. I would suggest Sydney Pollack's "Tootsie" to people of all ages looking for a light-hearted comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can anyone not love 'Tootsie'? This movie could have gone wrong in so many different ways. Plagued with production problems (I think the budget blew up to 25M), the producers hired at least eight writers to complete the script - usually a sign of major trouble. But it all works beautifully!I watched this movie recently (after the AFI Top 100 Comedies special) and fell in love with it all over again. I remember my parents taking me to see this twice in theaters back in 1982, which was kinda unusual. Now I understand why. It totally deserves its high rank on AFI's list. A movie that combines the considerable talents of Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange (yeah!), Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Charles Durning, Sidney Pollack, Geena Davis, Estelle Getty (don't blink or you'll miss her!), a sparkling, intelligent screenplay and Pollack's flawless direction -- what more could anyone ask for? It doesn't get much better than this.Moments to rewind: Murray's line, "You Slut!", Lange answering a corn cob (not the phone), Dorothy accosting Pollack in the Russian Tea Room, any scene with Teri Garr, Dorothy revealing her "true" identity at the end - among many, many others. In fact, do yourself a favor and rewind the whole darn thing &amp; watch it again. Forget 'Mrs. Doubtfire' and other imitations. 'Tootsie' is the perfect antidote for a dismal Sunday afternoon.P.S. I was very surprised how moved I felt when the final credits rolled. Lange's forgiveness of Hoffman's (unintentional) emotional deception added poignancy to a movie full of huge belly laughs. How many comedies can you say THAT about? Three cheers for 'Tootsie'!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic comedy well worth re-visiting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw Tootsie again last night (for the fifth time since 1982) and am moved to add my pennyworth. This really is a tautly-scripted, beautifully-acted, finely-paced comedy.Criticisms I've read elsewhere just don't hold up: the believability of the situation is not an issue - witness Shakespearian comedy in its gender-bending complexity and farcical development - very few films replicate reality. Also, the Oscar-nominated song "It might be you" perfectly serves its purpose, providing the touching backdrop to Michael's increasing awareness of the strength of feminine qualities - the touch of the baby to his cheek, the poignant sight of Julie's skirt swishing in the kitchen, and the offering to Dorothy of her chocolate-covered finger to suck. The images that go with the song are vivid and laced with tender irony. None of the actors strike a wrong tone - all the leading players are superb, but so are the bit players, including the frosty woman producer and black floor manager. Tune in to some of the the throwaway asides from characters at the edge of the screen (e.g. moving round the two contrasting party scenes) and you get a real sense of scriptwriters, performers and editors working to capacity. Classic moments include Teri Garr's locked-bathroom scene and Bill Murray's arrival home to prevent Dorothy's seduction by the tragic Dr Van Horn. Sidney Pollock has given himself a part to die for, but plays it with the frustration, speed and wit it needs - his contribution as an actor is all the more remarkable, given his primary role as director. Dustin Hoffman must have committed to this project big-time and I would love to read the book about the making of the film which I notice exists but is currently out of print. It has pertinent things to say about gender roles (male as well as female - witness the hyper-sensitive bar-scene between Hoffman and Durning) as well as work/home/life priorities, the "daytime drama" industry, and self-awareness and self-esteem. But all these issues are dealt with in a deceptively light-hearted way. It's a film with its heart and soul in the right place - a classic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most comedies are insulting to the audience, because its so easy to be stupid and silly in a comedy. This movie happens to be extremely intelligent, and very well acted. Recently I saw Dustin Hoffman on television speaking about this movie. He started crying and said 'it was never a comedy to me', and something about how he had rejected women in his life because they were not attractive like Dorothy. I watched the movie with his thoughts in mind, which made it even better. Dorothy is constantly insulted but is lovable beyond reproach - a truly great character in American cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why I waited thirty years to see this comedy classic. A first rate cast, first rate writing, and directing make this a classic overall. Dustin Hoffman should have won his second Academy Award as Michael Dorsey, a brilliant but difficult unemployed actor in New York City. In 1982, there were plenty of soaps there. Now they are none in the city. There are only four soaps and all in Los Angeles. This film made me realize that I miss New York City of the 1980s. I love the relationship between Michael Dorsey and Julie. The theme song is one of my favorites. I love the city scenes too. Great actors fill the screen even a young Geena Davis.

		<fullReview>After digging through loads of garbage in search of a message, Angry_Arguer has finally uncovered a comedy with a soul.Tootsie was better than I expected, much better. Dustin Hoffman finally becomes the expressive actor that he couldn't do in The Graduate. He isn't perfect, but he understands the role this time around and juggles it in a fashion similar to Face/Off.Thankfully, the movie isn't a "Women's Lib" type. The message is buried under the humor, but it isn't there. Hoffman is able to convey it without overacting or resorting to cliche. Bill Murray is once again delivering one-liners, but this time his character has more depth (just a little more) than in Ghostbusters or Caddyshack.True credit goes to the trio of screenwriters that worked on the movie because they sorely deserved an Oscar for it. The movie isn't loaded with the crass humor you would find today and doesn't resort to belittling itself and the audience like Mrs. Doubtfire.While the artistry of the film is minimal so the cast is what keeps it afloat. Most of the humor is effective and the editing is better than average. Thankfully, the movie hasn't dated as horribly as one may think.Overall, I recommend this. It was more than I expected and completely different. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great comedy about Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman). He's a struggling actor who's a perfectionist and is so difficult nobody will hire him. So he dons drag and becomes Dorothy Michaels. "She" gets a job on a soap opera and falls in love with one of the actresses--Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange). But Lange tries to hook Dorothy up with her widowed father (Charles Durning). Now the plot is ridiculous--it could NEVER happen in real life. But great performances, good direction and a sharp script make this work. Hoffman is believable (probably because he IS a perfectionist) as Michael and Dorothy. Lange won a Best Supporting Actress Award for this....and she's just great. Durning isn't in the movie much but he IS funny. Also on board are Teri Garr (terribly unfunny and whiny), Dabney Coleman (playing a sexist jerk--again) and Bill Murray (unbilled) who is HYSTERICAL as Hoffman's roommate (he also has the funniest line). Also it's Geena Davis' first role (a good sport considering she's introduced wearing very revealing underwear).Now this was considered ground-breaking for its discussion of sexual roles--but that's where I have a problem with this. The women are portrayed as whiny, borderline alcoholics with no self-esteem. Yet when Hoffman enters as a woman who makes them stand up for themselves and become stronger. The message here seems to be a woman needs another man to teach them to be self-sufficient. Basically a man is better being a woman than a real woman! It does play some lip service to Hoffman saying playing a woman made him a better man but I didn't believe it for a second.Still, this IS a great comedy and ground-breaking in its day. Also Hoffman is VERY convincing in drag! An 8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tootsie could be divided into two parts: the first hour, though not exceptional, is rather enjoyable and dynamic; the rest from the escapade to the country is a lot more flat and boring until the sloppy ending. And if there is a common denominator to all of that, it's the cruel lack of consistency on every level, whether the story itself quite predictable and linear, or the under-developed characters who lack charisma, or the gags... because yes, though it's supposed to be a comedy, the humour is very little present, you barely laugh which is inevitably extremely penalizing. As for the romantic aspect, everything is corny and little credible.In the end it's Dustin Hoffman, who is very committed in his role, that manages to get this movie the average grade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie built good themes. It set up strong plot points. And then, it branched into the worst possible direction. Add to this the deadwood thrown in solely for the purpose of soliciting cheap laughs and you can't help but be disappointed once it's over.As a comedy, there are laughs, but they are spaced out intermittently. Much of the comedy came from the awkward moments of tension from the natural flow the movie. It could have stood on it's own, but they decided to keep in about 30 minutes of dead end gags which just make the movie feel crassly commercial. The main story arc goes completely unresolved, and you feel like the protagonist has learned nothing by the time the movie is over. It's harder to get a more shallow feeling from a so-called "happy" ending.If you want a deep romantic comedy, watch Groundhog Day instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman remains popular among movie fans especially when it comes to portraying difficult roles such as the autistic brother of Tom Cruise in the "Rain Man" and that being a woman in this film entitled "Tootsie".The late Sydney Pollack directed this film about Michael Dorsey,an unemployed actor who is unable to get a job due to being difficult to work with despite the fact that he is extremely talented. When he could no longer find any work,he decided to disguise as Dorothy Michaels,an actress who lands a role in a popular soap opera.Here is where the fun begins.....No question that the viewer will definitely be amazed by Hoffman's performance considering anyone who does not know would surely never doubt him at all as a drag.Even his voice which is of a Southern accent is pitch perfect.Aside from it, we also are treated to an intelligent comedic screenplay that revolves around Michael/Dorothy from his relationships with his friends Jeff and Sandy as well as his cast mates Les and April.We also get to see how Dorothy's career takes off and how he finally reveals in the end who he really ends. Finally, the development of the relationship between Michael and April was definitely worth watching.It was a big hit when it was released back in '82.But despite the fact that a lot of things have changed since then particularly when it comes to many themes it made fun with such as the increase of women in workplace together with the limited acceptance of LGBT's which are no longer issues today,it remains one of the most popular comedies at present. Watching Hoffman alone is a big delight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top Movies of Its Kind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tootsie may be one of the best comedies ever made. There's many hilarious iconic scenes that are just perfect. But what makes this the timeless hit is the stuff other than the humour. The comedy is laugh-out-loud and the other stuff has a lasting impact. In one Dustin Hoffman's finest roles, he plays a talented actor from New York named Michael Dorsey who is still looking for his big break. The problem is he is very mean and nobody will work with him. Desperate for money, he transforms himself into a woman named Dorothy Michaels and lands a leading role in a soap opera. Dorothy becomes an international success and influence on woman across America. As a gender-bending comedy, there's some funny scenes where he struggles to changes sexes. But the serious factor is really what separates this from other gender-bending films like Mrs. Doubtfire and Some Like it Hot. As Michael tries to keep his real identity under wraps, he gets a chance to see what life is like as a woman in the early 80s. That affects his relationship with his girlfriend (Garr) and co-star (Lange) who he falls for.This is one of the few times where Dustin Hoffman fairly lost an Oscar, which was to Ben Kingsley as Gandhi. If no Gandhi, the gold would have been his. He is so awesome as a talented yet difficult actor and even better when he puts on the dress. This multi-layer portrayal is one of the hardest to do and most entertaining to watch. Dustin Hoffman plays a guy who plays a woman who plays another woman. Most other actor would miss layers to the portrayal. Hoffman also brings layers to each layer of his performance. Each make for one of cinema's most illustrious roles. The love triangle that erupts is also one of the best. Tootsie is the best gender-bender ever. The performances, character development, humour and drama are above all else in its category.</fullReview>

I dunno if that's common or if that says something weird about me it's not a flattering comparison for the latter. "Mrs. Doubtfire" is all about seeing Robin Williams in drag (really not that much there).Sure, you could argue that "Tootsie" is pretty much all Dustin Hoffman, but he's backed by one hell of a cast. And this movie's main draw - besides seeing the lead in ghastly makeup - is its unimpeachable ability to draw you into Hoffman's story and then cold-cock you with a priceless one-liner. This happens a lot. And it doesn't just play gender confusion for laughs, there's actual sympathy for the plight of the modern working woman.And don't let me forget Bill Murray, whose deadpan deliveries are a big chunk of the movie's humor.7/10</fullReview>

Absolutely hilarious, the right amount of montages and exposition, nice romance and performances out of this world ? in front of, behind and again, in front of the cameras. The fact that this movie that includes one of the best movie songs of all time (It Must Be You by Stephen Bishop,) was so horribly all-but snubbed at the Oscars for so many awards, it proves some crimes go unpunished.Practically everything worked here, including, but not exclusively Dustin Hoffman. It's a wonderful film that brings up issues (of 1982ish and beyond) and never asks us to take them too seriously. Likewise, this plus the two years prior Nine to Five would make a perfect double feature.I loved this movie. No matter how many times I see it, I laugh and in the end tear up. And the entire Dorothy/Michael may/may not be gay/lesbian dialogue is not just priceless, but one of the best in film history. I actually put that clip on my (1990s) answering machine once. My mom did NOT appreciate that.I know more people appreciate Mrs. Doubtfire, and I love that movie too. But, see the movie that took the risks first and is probably 5x the movie the Robin Williams drag-for-hire take was. * * *Final thoughts: If I could "choose" my lifestyle, I would certainly chase after Jessica Lange.

It never feels old, everything in it feels modern and fresh, and to be honest, I haven't seen a film like it ever (except maybe for Mrs. Doubtfire). The story is original, and the directing phenomenal, whilst the cameos and minor parts of other big actors shines through to make this more than a film about Dustin Hoffman. A great comedy, suitable for everyone and funny enough for the majority of the family to get stitches from. Whilst it's not always a laugh fest, what fills in between the humour is beautiful characterization, which furthers the development of this iconic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic Comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tootsie is a film that is remarkably ahead of its own time as it deals with issues such as feminism and cross dressing. I also find it an 80's classic that is really funny at times. It also features a poignant story and heartwarming acting. I didn't think this movie would be all that special, but it looks like I was wrong. Dustin Hoffman shows remarkable range as an actor by playing a woman, and he pulls it off big time.Sydney Pollack's film is about an actor named Michael Dorsey who is known for his reputation for being hard to work with. In dire need of money, he accepts a role in a soap opera.....but playing as his opposite gender. Once he is on the show, he is instantly loved but problems arrive when he falls in love with one of the actresses, Julie Nichols.The film has a well-respected cast and they all churn out marvelous performances. Dustin Hoffman simply is amazing as Dorsey/Dorothy. He really pulled off the role of Dorothy and made her role a likable woman. Jessica Lange likewise does an excellent job as Julie, the woman who needs the support of Dorothy. Charles Durning had some great scenes as Julie's father who falls in love with Dorothy. Bill Murray is really funny as Dorsey's roommate. Finally, Teri Garr is funny as Dorsey's other lover. Her monologue with Hoffman is very, very good. Overall, Tootsie is an American comedy classic and one of the best comedies of the 80's. The movie may have themes regarding feminism and women's rights in the entertainment industry, which of course are valid themes. The movie is an unthinkable romance, one that likely took Hollywood by surprise, but in a good way. I had a very good time with the film and I couldn't stop laughing. I also though the ending was one of the sweetest endings I have ever seen. My Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a brilliantly made comedy, TOOTSIE stands tall among director Pollock's otherwise patchy filmography!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The synopsis of Sydney Pollack's drag comedy TOOTSIE can be construed as follows: a struggling thespian/acting coach Michael Dorsey (Huffman) cross-dresses as a woman Dorothy Michaels to secure a role in a popular daytime soapie, and scoops up massive acclamation as a single, middle-aged role model who disseminate fresh air of women being independent and self-confident, which profoundly inspires her fellow actress Julie (Lange), whom Michael has a huge crush on. If one has yet watched the film, the synopsis might get on someone's nerves, how on earth a man at the end of his tether can so easily thrive in the same line of business as soon as he acts in the opposite sex? What is more, he even becomes some sort of the guiding light to the dismissive gender while sporting a hard-on under his dress, it could only be a straight guy's pipe-dream with a penchant for sexism and male chauvinism, the movie could have been a total train wreck under a lesser brain. Thankfully, TOOTSIE is never the case with Pollack on board and a scintillating script bristles with no-hyperbole but heartfelt dialogue and organic humor and romance, plus an all-star cast spearheaded the ever so androgynous Hoffman. Instead it becomes one of the best and the most successful comedies ever in US. A giant crowd-pleaser and a top-dog in the Oscar-game too (although only Lange won one out of its overall 10 nominations, even that golden statue is a bit iffy in hindsight, since it is more like a consolation prize for her breathtaking turn in a biopic of Frances Farmer FRANCES 1982, 7/10 ). Michael's double personae is the refraction of his personality from different genders, as a man, he is an impulsive prick towards Sandy (Garr), the altruistic girl in his acting class who believes they click together, but in fact they only have a one-time shagging based on an inopportune occasion, Sandy is given the cold shoulder whenever Julie is available for him. However, as a woman, Dorothy, she not only has to keep an eye on her leery co-star, the old goat John Van Horn (Gaynes), as her attachment with Julie becomes stronger, she accidentally becomes the apple-of-the-eye of Julie's widower father Les (Durning), who is somehow convinced Dorothy should be Julie's new mom. You see, as a woman, Dorothy not only being objectified for her sex appeal (truth to be told, Hoffman's female outlook does look superior to his normal bearing), more reassuringly she is also courted as a true lady for a serious marriage, which creatively justifies the dual standards in the present man's world (although this film is made 33 years ago), it is a farce for sure, but it is a revealing one. Apart from the accomplishments of the make-up and costume sections, Hoffman's performance is terrific, the tricky part is his voice changeover since it is so dialog-ridden, Dorothy has an old-maidish front but inside she is quintessentially a feminist cannot tolerate women being bullied, belittled or indulging themselves in self-pity, that's why she is one-of-a-kind and so riveting to watch on screen. Hoffman's acting is wholesomely fluid, our laughter is being accordingly induced up until the premeditated big reveal - again the script rounds up a pragmatic scenario for Dorothy to perform the live act - it is a cliché, but indeed a perfectly engineered one.Lange is also letting out her impactful presence in a less demanding role, Julie is that kind of pretty girl with a degree of integrity, often curbed by her own indecisiveness, and needs a little extra push to find her self-worth, she is always on the rational side of the line, by contrast, Garr (also Oscar-nominated, but criminally lost to Lange in an unfair game), brings about an adorable and spontaneous adroitness as an excellent comedienne, her Sandy is the irrational type of gal often being exploited by men for her kindness and innocuousness, Garr pushes the limit in her well-timed fit of rage sprinkled with just-right-amount-of mockery, in a perfect world, Michael should have ended up with her. Bill Murray is knowingly not billed in the opening credit, but as Michael's roomie, he has a medium-sized role to balance out Hoffman's edginess with deadpan drollness and occasional wisecrack. Two veterans Gaynes and Durning, both manifest their caricatural segments at full throttle. All in all, it is just a brilliantly made comedy, TOOTSIE stands tall among director Pollock's otherwise patchy filmography!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tootsie is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast that succeed in both comedic and dramatic scenes.There are plenty of very funny parts,which is exactly what I expected from a movie were Dustin Hoffman pretends to be a woman to succeed as an actor,but the movie also contains a lot of very sympathetic and dramatic scenes that make us connect and feel for these characters so much more.There is great chemistry between Hoffman and Jessica Lange which is what made this unusual love story so great,you can tell that they loved working together and are both some of the best actors Hollywood has ever been lucky enough to discover.A near perfect mix of both comedy and drama,Tootsie is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for either genre. A desperate unemployed actor gets the role of his dreams and instant fame,but no one knows this new female television star is actually a man.Best Performance: Dustin Hoffman Worst Performance: Geena Davis If you have any recommendations on films/TV series I should watch or review,or any questions to ask me,just tweet me @DillonTheHarris</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More To This Than Just Hoffman In Drag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is so much more to this film than Dustin Hoffman running around in a dressed like a woman. Tootsie is one of the most intelligent comedies It is perfectly cast and full of surprises.Plot In A Paragraph: Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey. He knows everything about acting except how to get employed as an actor. We see him auditioning for numerous jobs where he is either too old, too young, too tall, too short, simply not the right guy for the part, or in some cases impossible to work with. We also see him teaching some young wannabe actors, and working at a restaurant to pay the bills. After his agent says "No one will hire you!" The very next shot has Hoffman in drag walking down the street to an audition for a soap opera part his friend (Terri Garr) was unable to land. Hoffman lands the part, and is soon winning over fans all over the country.Hoffman should be very proud of his work here, as should Garr and Jessica Lange (but I was surprised she got an Oscar for this) Charles Durning was a delight here (He always is) George Gaynes is a lot of fun and Geena Davis shines in her first movie. I didn't even know the brilliant Bill Murray was in this, and whilst browsing the trivia section on here it states that he agreed to omit his name from the opening credits to prevent audiences expecting a "Bill Murray movie? along the lines of 'Meatballs' or 'Caddyshack'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this got so many Oscar nominations. Well, I can, the AMPAS went for different things back then and this certainly reminds me of Kramer VS Kramer in that way, sort of heart in right place but doesn't necessarily hold up all that well today to the point of actually being remembered as this great masterpiece. Still, the acting is as good as it needs to be, although not particularly deep from Dustin Hoffman. He's very good, but that sort of role is hard to pull off, if impossible, without feeling like a gimmick and it does feel like one. Jessica Lange provides a nice complimentary, more natural presence alongside Hoffman. This is good stuff, if unremarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedic but conscientious variation on the "Kramer vs. Kramer" theme, with some bumps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tootsie" is a socially conscious movie, so it requires some realism to engage with and critique. But it's also a comedy, which means that realism is sometimes secondary to laughs. The way "Tootsie" manages its dual nature is that the premise provides a platform for commentary, while the way it actually plays out is unbelievable but very funny. Dustin Hoffman is not a believable woman. Maybe he could have been, but his dollar-bin clothes and clownish makeup and mincing voice are all wrong and come off like cosplay or parody. Who could believe that a major actress like Hoffman's character could do four photo shoots for major magazine covers in those clothes and that wig, or that she would be allowed to do her own makeup at home before filming her daily soap, or that as a new and unknown hire she could walk onto an established TV set run by a tyrant director and so thoroughly blow everyone away with one-take improvised line readings that the crew would abandon scripts and camera cues to suit her whims? Nobody, but it's funny to see Hoffman do those things. Sometimes the jokes are found in the likeliest places, like the banter between Hoffman and slovenly roommate Bill Murray about dieting and whether certain clothes make one's ass look big. A lot of the best lines, both the dramatic and the humorous, go to Teri Garr in a supporting role that is more interesting but smaller than Jessica Lange's, and this creates a certain imbalance in the romantic chemistry. But such misses are excusable in a movie with its heart so clearly in the right place. The premise is a broad one to match the occasionally broad humor, and it's really the same one that drove Hoffman's earlier starring vehicle "Kramer vs. Kramer": that society's assigned roles for men and women are artificial. "Tootsie"'s way of saying this is less sharp than "Kramer"'s, and while the latter is carefully structured so as to leave no room to interpret is as anything but a powerful statement of equality, it is possible to see "Tootsie" as a movie that plays with social conventions without fundamentally overturning them. In the final analysis, though, the movie's intent is to challenge the status quo of male privilege. This is made clear in a scene in which Hoffman calls out the sleazy director who's dating and cheating on his leading lady, only to have the director ruefully acknowledge his behavior in a way that highlights how similar it is to Hoffman's. The movie may have its cake and eat it too, mixing comedy and commentary, but it doesn't let its characters get away with inconsistency. That is to say, it's a smart movie and a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sydney Pollack's Tootsie is a smart and sometimes bizarre comedy movie with Dustin Hoffman playing an actor who can't find work then dresses up as a middle actress and then finds work on a soap opera show (funny isn't it). There were a lot of other good performances form a young Bill Murray as his roommate, Sydney Pollack as his agent, Jessica Lange, and Charles Durning. When Hoffman dresses up as Dorothy Michaels he comes up with funny things to say in his girl voice, Director Sydney Pollack has crafted the best comedy since Dr. Strangelove. This movie is one of the best movies of 1982 because of the strange story, the humor, and especially the acting. What a great comedy.</fullReview>

Is very funny at times though, with some hilarious scenes and lines.However, it does get rather silly and farcical at times. Just when you want it to get serious and make a point, it has some silly scene, just to extend the farce. Dustin Hoffman is great (as you would expect) in the lead role. Jessica Lange deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar win. Good support from Bill Murray, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman and director Sydney Pollack himself.

		<fullReview>While I disliked the intense 80s vibe this film carries, I fully enjoyed the script and the performances.i don't think Sydney Pollack is a good director, but his (annoying) vision turned Tootsie a classic. Yes, It's unimaginable this film being made in another age, even if - In my opinion - it would work much better as a 90s or 00s comedy. The screenplay is fantastic, it depicts very well the struggle of unemployment, the struggle of being a woman and also the egocentricity and self-awareness of the protagonist, which as 'Dorothy' conquered US with 'her' charisma and different attitude. Looks like a metaphor to Margaret Tatcher government, if you think well.The film is one of my favorite comedies from the 80s, so I hope you'll enjoy as well. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot of anticipation for a film I thought was...just good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Dustin Hoffman, he is a master of his craft and easily one of the best actors in history. I don't know how I managed to never see Tootsie until this afternoon at a Classic Cinema presentation at our local theatre. I was very excited to see it! Now please don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Tootsie but it was the furthest thing from flooring me. I thought it was a decent film, a representation of its times (early 80's) and the pacing of the film felt a little off to me at times. Now I am the last person to trash a film that is absolutely considered a classic and beloved by millions so I won't do that. Tootsie is a good film. I just failed to see it as a great one. I suppose if I had seen it sooner than I did I would see the social commentary aspect as more important. There are some genuinely funny moments, and some iconic lines that are well deserving of their status. It wasn't until after I had seen the film that I read which lines were considering "iconic" and yet as soon as I heard them in the movie I knew there was something special about them. The chemistry with the cast was good and Hoffman's performance is excellent and yet I still felt like certain parts of the film dragged and even stumbled more than it should have.This is Dustin Hoffman doing what he does best. He completely becomes this character both as struggling actor Michael Dorsey and then of course as the legendary Dorothy Michaels or "Tootsie." Hoffman really is a complete ass and sort of irritatingly pompous as Dorsey and because of that you see the complete change he does as Dorothy. Most importantly he truly is believable as a woman and that's the heart and soul of this film. Jessica Lange is stunningly beautiful and in a subtle role is excellent as the successful actress struggling to make her personal life work. Her and Hoffman have great chemistry and she is good enough that her character grows on you as you learn more about her. Teri Garr is an interesting character because she is a complete mess. She is manic and over the top and her character is sort of pointless and you just constantly feel terrible for her. Hoffman really does treat her like crap. There is no particular development or arc to her character but that's not a reflection of her performance because she is good. Bill Murray is also very good as Hoffman's roommate and best friend. Murray is very often Murray in his scenes but that is what we want from him. He is definitely sidekick to Hoffman but it works very well. I was very impressed with the supporting cast of this film. Every face nearly was familiar. Truly great performances from Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, George Gaynes and Geena Davis. Also the director Sydney Pollack. Easily some of the best scenes in this film are the often fiery confrontations between Hoffman and Pollack (which allegedly were more real than staged.) Their chemistry is epic and some of the best dialogue is done in their scenes together.Pollack really does craft a great story. Obviously because the film is without a doubt a classic. I think perhaps the film was victim to my extremely high expectations so I was less than amazed by the film. I found some of the relationships a little drawn out and the comedy is definitely overshadowed by a dark undertone. With any film like this the build up to the reveal is a big part of the movie and when Hoffman confesses what he has done to everyone it is definitely memorable and one of the great scenes in the film. I don't know why I didn't "love" it but don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it and thought certain aspects of the film were very near brilliant but other little things dragged it down just a little. Regardless of what I say, this film is a hands down classic and a must see. You will have your own opinions on it bad or good. This was just my Tootsie experience. Perhaps it will grow on me even more in future viewings. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was 31 years ago last week that Dustin Hoffman reminded us that beauty is not the only thin that makes women attractive. The comedy, which received 10 Academy Award nominations, did more than make people laugh, though ? it made them think. Tootsie's feminism is equivalent to Avatar's respect for native culture.Now, it wasn't just Hoffman that made this picture great. The cast also included Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, and Bill Murray. Lange won an Oscar. Hoffman and Garr were nominated.Has anything changed in the intervening 31 years? Just tune in next year to the Super Bowl to find out. Super Bowl commercials too often opt for sexual objectification in place of a clever idea, with negative results for both men and women. Many of the commercials objectifying women are not particularly flattering to men either, portraying them as mindless, gullible and sex-obsessed.But, they are STILL objectifying women. We have a long way to go, baby.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Seriously Good Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without any doubt, I would have to rank this as one of Dustin Hoffman's best movies. He plays, in essence, two characters - or, really, one character who is both the character and another character. And the issue is that the other character the character is playing is a woman. And Hoffman pulls it off brilliantly. Both as Michael Dorsey and as Dorothy Michaels, he never misses a beat in his performance, and he's completely believable.As Michael, Hoffman is an unemployed, struggling actor who can't find work and ends up working as a waiter - which is probably not unlike what happens to a lot of actors. But then, needing money to help a friend finance a play that he's going to star in, Michael stumbles upon an opportunity to be in a soap opera. The catch? The part is for a woman. So he disguises himself as Dorothy (Hoffman can be surprisingly convincing as a woman) and he gets the part, but it spins totally out of control. Dorothy becomes a huge star, and what was supposed to be just a limited and minor role becomes his life. In the midst of the situation, Michael falls in love with his female co-star Julie (Jessica Lange) - but because she knows him as Dorothy, Julie can't be anything other than his (or her) best friend. But, after being invited to spend a weekend at Julie's family's farm, Julie's widowed father (Charles Durning) falls in love with Dorothy - a relationship Dorothy can't reciprocate because she's actually a man. In the meantime, Michael's friends Sandy (Teri Garr) and Jeff (Bill Murray) get drawn into the situation in different ways, and his lecherous soap co-star John Van Horn (George Gaynes) decides that he wants Dorothy. In a way it's all quite straightforward and yet it's wonderfully bewildering at the same time.The two hours moves by quickly, and the movie is fun. You never lose interest, you chuckle (and sympathize) with some of the situations all the characters find themselves in, and you wonder how Michael is going to get out of this unexpected stardom that he wanted - except that he wanted it as himself, not as Dorothy. Definitely a strong 80's movie, and one of Hoffman's best. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman and the humour are great but unfortunately Lange and the drama are no match.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman's 80s was surprisingly sparse especially after a busy and successful 70s. Before his longest break from acting and after his first Oscar, he starred in Tootsie and it's the strongest testament to his power as an actor, especially as his character is an actor who takes acting deathly seriously. He drives the film with such powerful energy with his performance having layers of acting upon acting upon acting and pitch perfect delivery in every moment. It's a truly astounding performance and ranks among his best. My favourite of his is his portrayal of Lenny Bruce in Bob Fosse's Lenny which make my top 20 performances of all-time, but Tootsie is an easy number two. This is only my second Sydney Pollack film too, my first being They Shoot Horses Don't They, which is exactly the opposite end of the tonal spectrum so he has an impressive range (and gives an impressive performance as Hoffman's agent here). It's a very witty and sharp film focusing on the comedy before the drama, reminiscent of the His Girl Friday style as well as a very obvious influence, the cross-dressing Some Like It Hot. It's often laugh out loud funny even if there are many moments sacrificed to mere gags rather than jokes which deaden the pace rather than quicken it. The drama isn't as powerful though, partially due to Jessica Lange's character being severely underwritten and not very impressive in general. I have no idea why she won the Oscar (particularly over the more eccentric Teri Garr) as she didn't seem to do enough with the material she was given. It was very pleasant to see Bill Murray and Geena Davis in supporting roles here too, though most of the other characters besides Hoffman feel somewhat one dimensional. Tootsie is a very entertaining (if not powerful) film showcasing an incredible performance, also a great 80s soundtrack of original songs.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go, Tootsie, Go!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the late sixties and seventies, Dustin Hoffman never seemed to be away from the cinema screen for long, but in the eighties he made far fewer films, probably because he was concentrating more on his work in the theatre. I have never seen "Ishtar" or "Family Business"- in the case of the former I have been dissuaded by its reputation as one of the great turkeys of all time- but his other three films from the decade, "Tootsie", "Death of a Salesman" and "Rain Man", although very different from one another, are all among his best.Here Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a New York actor who is finding it difficult to obtain work. Not through any lack of talent, but because he is so difficult to work with. He is the sort of perfectionist whose obsessive attention to detail and inability to suffer fools gladly make him the bane of every director's life and the despair of his long-suffering agent George. Michael decides that desperate measures are needed. He decides to audition for a part in the popular, hospital-set soap opera "Southwest General", and does not allow himself to be deterred by the fact that the audition is for a female role. He disguises himself as a woman, renames himself "Dorothy Michaels" and wins the part. The film explores the complications which arise, especially after Michael finds himself strongly attracted to his pretty co-star Julie Nichols. How can he declare his love to Julie without exposing his deception? To make matters worse, Julie's widowed father Les is equally attracted to the supposed "Dorothy".There are obvious similarities between "Tootsie" and that other great American cross-dressing comedy from around a decade later, "Mrs Doubtfire". In that film too the main character, played by Robin Williams, is also a talented but temperamental out-of-work actor, although his motives for dressing as a woman are different. There are, however, also important differences between the two films (quite apart from the fact that Hoffman makes a more convincing woman than does Williams)."Tootsie" is, like "Nine to Five" from two years earlier, a comedy with feminist overtones which satirises male sexism in the workplace. Julie is in a relationship with the show's director Ron, who treats her badly both on and off the set, and both she and "Dorothy" have to cope with the unwanted attentions of the show's ageing star John Van Horn who despite his advancing years still fancies himself as a ladies' man. The satire in "Mrs Doubtfire", by contrast, is not so much feminist as masculinist, criticising the way in which the American divorce system discriminates against fathers and the distress that such discrimination can cause to the children of broken marriages. The other targets of the film's satire include soap operas; there must be plenty of real-life examples which share the low production values and abysmal acting standards of "Southwest General". (One infamously bad example that comes to mind is the British-made "Crossroads"). Even Michael himself is sent up; he might be the film's hero and, strictly speaking, in the right in most of his confrontations, but his short fuse and his dogmatic, self-righteous manner make us realise just why everyone else finds it so difficult to work with him.The main reason for the film's success is Hoffman's brilliant performance in what is essentially the double role of Michael and Dorothy. Although Michael becomes quite unrecognisable, both in voice and appearance, when he assumes his feminine persona, Dorothy is similar in personality to her male alter ego, being just as feisty and bloody-minded as he is. The difference is that she can get away with it, and is even applauded for being a strong, determined woman, whereas he is just dismissed as a pain in the ass.Jessica Lange well deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the only one the film won out of the ten for which it was nominated. The previous year Lange had achieved some notoriety for her role in the steamy remake of "The Postman Always Rings Twice", but here she shows a quite different side to her talents as the sweet and gentle Julie, who, under the influence of "Dorothy" finds the strength to stand up for herself. Julie is a single mother, something which shows how much social attitudes had changed by the eighties; at one time the idea of a romantic comedy heroine who had produced a child out of wedlock would have been unthinkable. There are also good contributions from Teri Garr as Michael's neurotic, self-pitying ex-girlfriend Sandy, a sort of female Woody Allen, from Charles Durning as Les, Bill Murray as Michael's playwright friend Jeff and Sydney Pollack, who also produced and directed, as George. A young Geena Davis appears briefly in her first film role.The film was nominated for the "Best Picture" Oscar but did not win. It would, in fact, have been surprising if it had won; the Academy in the eighties and early nineties was going through a prolonged bout of high seriousness, and no comedy won "Best Picture" between "Annie Hall" in 1977 and "Shakespeare in Love" in 1998. At least 1982 did produce a worthy winner in Attenborough's "Gandhi". "Tootsie" did, however, achieve belated recognition when the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, something well-deserved as it must rank as one of the greatest film comedies of the eighties. It is one of the few comedies which can successfully combine satirical social comment with real human emotions. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delicious Little Classic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late Sidney Pollack's 'Tootsie' is a charming little comedy that has already, and deservingly so, earned classic status. Next to providing plenty of laugh out loud sequences, the film is also a social commentary about gender role and gender bias in modern society. Women have come a long way in the last 50 years but at the same time, the popular media still tends objectify them. This is depicted in a very subtle and non-preachy way with a touch of humour.The humour is mostly satirical, dry and sometimes situational but it's always clever and works all the time. I didn't know that Pollack had a flair for humour. I wish he had made for comedies. Even here in his supporting role, he's impressive.Credit should also go to the art direction, props and makeup. I liked that they didn't go all the way to make Hoffman look like a woman. He does look very feminine but at the same time is somewhat recognizable which works excellently.Moreover Dustin Hoffman is amazing. While his performance is very natural as Michael, he is also terrific as Dorothy, never, even for a glimpse, over the top. This is certainly one of the many films that showcases his acting. Luminous Jessica Lange is very likable. Who wouldn't fall in love with her? Teri Garr is hilarious. Bill Murray shows yet again how great he is in subtle comedy. Dabney Coleman is terrific too.For me 'Tootsie' is an unforgettable comedy and the kind I could watch over and over again (not consecutively of course) without losing its charm and freshness</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Tootsie were made today, it would be absolutely awful. Some hack actor would be yucking it up in the leading role and the entire thing would be based around it's one-joke premise; an out of work actor dresses in drag to finally land a role on a soap opera. It would have been two hours of jokes about a man putting on stockings, with a few lazy subplots tossed in to fill up time. Thankfully, this one was made in 1982, before the "hilarious" idea of a man dressing as a woman became a tired and trite excuse to get a few cheap laughs from the people shameless enough to shell out money for a ticket.Tootsie is a sign of how far we've fallen, because thirty years ago a film like this was made and was actually good. Yes, it's relatively light entertainment, but it's entertaining and so enjoyable and filled with good humor, life and, most of all, heart. That's where it really shines and what the difference comes down to here; this movie has so much heart that it's overflowing with it. Things don't feel staged and the jokes don't feel like they are being forced down the audience's throat; sure the premise is hard to buy, but once you move past it there is so much to gain here.They set up the premise and then the rest of the film happens organically, as opposed to one ridiculously staged and flat joke after another. The care that they take into establishing Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels as their own separate characters is mightily impressive. When I was watching Dorothy on screen, I felt like I was watching a real woman, not watching Michael in drag. Part of this can be attributed to the care and depth of the script and of Sydney Pollack's direction, but of course a lot of it must be credited to Dustin Hoffman's masterful performance.This is a whacky premise, but where the brilliance of it comes is how everyone, especially Hoffman, plays it completely straight. You never doubt that he is fully absorbed into this character, as Michael Dorsey is as well. There's never a wink at the audience or a tongue in the cheek, and that's what makes it so enjoyable and good-hearted. They couldn't make one like this these days, so I'm very glad they got one done before it was too late. A very enjoyable picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I was a better man with you, as a woman... than I ever was with a woman, as a man." This impenetrable quote should be the movie's tag-line.There's a moment when Jessica Lange mentions how it's "complicated" to be a woman in the 80's. This summarizes Dustin Hoffman's realization in the film, but the real challenge is to make first a convincing woman out of Dustin Hoffman, not a drag with a falsetto voice, but an attractive woman, as far as you can pull back your camera. And God, not only he's totally believable, but it's also one of the greatest performances by an actor, as a male character Michael Dorsey, playing a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and this woman playing a TV soap character, Emily Kimberley.That would undermined the credibility of the film, even for a screwball comedy, if the main character wasn't an excellent actor. Through this convenient plot device, we can believe that Michael is so good, he can play even better than a woman. In a scene where he rehearses with his friend, Teri Garr as Sandy, for the role he would ultimately play, she admits "I can't be as good as you" while the tactfully edited opening credits sequences proved how the man's ego and temper were the major obstacles for his career.When you look at the AFI's Top 100 comedies, you find "Some Like it Hot" at the top, followed by "Tootsie". but cross-dressing is not the theme that would systematically make a great comedy work, and "Tootsie" would have never had the same success and appeal if it was a 80's version of Wilder's classic. Interestingly, both are rarely compared, "Tootsie" stands on its own because contrarily to its gloriously screwball predecessor, it relies on a realism that makes slapstick even more irresistible, and a sincere sensitivity while the movie tackles more serious issues.The realism is indeed the key element, because we laugh at the situations, not the characters. When Michael as Dorothy meets the director of the TV soap, Ron, played by Dabney Coleman, and he immediately dismisses her because of a too gentile appearance, we have a first glimpse on how it feels to be like a woman, treated with this condescending smoothness. And Michael's improvised reaction is incredibly authentic in its defensiveness, and ironically got him right into the character, Emily Kimberley, a woman treated by Dr. Brewster, George Gaynes (as John Van Horn) like Dorothy by Ron. No wonder he became a feminist icon, he was literally a woman with balls.The actors' world setting is perfect to give an authentic flavor to all the zaniness. "You were a tomato, a tomato doesn't have logic, a tomato can't move!" This hilarious line shouted by an angry George Fields, Michael's agent played by an excellent Sidney Pollack, is surrealistic but I'm sure this kind of dialog would be plausible between an actor and his agent. Pollack isn't a comedic director but when you think of it, nothing is funnier than serious people facing funny situations. When Michael as Dorothy sees Geena Davis's tits hitting him right in the face; we can imagine his surprise as a man, and the next hilarious slip of the tongue. When he yells for the taxi, and his voice is too high, he uses his man's voice. And the realism of the film is enriched by the friendship growing between Dorothy and Julie. There is an inner tenderness in Jessica Lange as she really provides the love involvement that would develop Michael's character whose disguise was the only way to reach Julie. As a man, he tried, and he got quite a wet treatment."Tootsie" is a characters' films, on the scene-stealing department, Michael's irresistible roommate, Bill Murray as Jeff Slater, who improvised all his lines, for our greatest delight. There is absolutely no line he doesn't deliver that is not hilarious, either its from its nonsensical absurdity or hilarious cynicism, Bill Murray is just the spice that gives the film a sort of unique flavor, when it could have been only a romantic comedy. And from the hysterical Sandy, to the sweet and tender Charles Durning as Les, Julie's father who develops a fondness on Dorothy, and Van Horn, who takes Dorothy's resistance as an encouragement to seduce her, each character has one line, one scene, one occasion to shine. And all these misunderstandings lead to one of the most nightmarish episodes where everything gets mixed up, including a tender marriage proposal and an uproarious 'rape' attempt and concluded by Michael explaining to George that Sandy thinks he's gay, and Julie that he's a lesbian.All the comedies have the excuse to be disorganized as long as they make you laugh. "Tootsie" is perfectly orchestrated by Sidney Pollack: take the climactic scene, where Michael reveals his identity, the timing, the editing, the build-up conclude in an apotheosis while we've get to watch all the protagonist's reactions. A perfect musicality ending up with the dramatic reaction of Julie, the betrayed one, and his reaction is so brutal, it needed Van Horn asking if "Jeff knows" and Michael pushing the pantomime in the scene after.The movie ends with the right tone anyway, with Michael's apology to Les, and then Julie. After delivering the line I mentioned in the top, he concluded it with the most beautiful declaration of love "the hardest part's done, we were good friends" and this touches something in Julie's heart, as she wonders if finally, conducted by the beautiful Stephen Bishop's song, 'something's telling her it might be Michael'."Tootsie" is the movie I genuinely laughed at as a kid, and after 20 years, I still love the film with all my heart ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film but not for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you hear the idea of Dustin Hoffman in drag you can't help but think, "No way. That's just wrong." But that's just what Tootsie is. Hoffman in drag. And lo and behold it was a huge critical success that garnered multiple Oscar nominations including best picture, as well as an Oscar win for Jessica Lange. The film is about out of work actor Michael Dorsey, played by Dustin Hoffman. Dorsey has built his reputation as one of the most difficult actors to work with and so now he is hopelessly desperate for a role. He is so desperate that he dresses up as a woman and becomes actress Dorothy Michaels. He tries out for a role in a soap opera as Dorothy and scores the part, becoming a media icon and a role model for empowered women everywhere. The film sounds absurd and impossible but it is surprisingly believable and very entertaining. It's the sort of film with a wide audience appeal and a crowd pleasing attitude that comes off so well that it is hard to criticize the film harshly. Instead you just want to enjoy it and have a good time.The nice thing about this film is how tasteful it is. The story is told in a friendly and respectable manner that I'm not sure could be twisted into something offensive and tasteless no matter how hard you tried. The film is not exploitative in any way and instead it is a human story about love and life. It's a story with a message that we are all fond of and can easily warm our hearts, only in a very unconventional way. It's a film full of spirit and life that transfers so well to the audience. The film has a sharp script that I can buy into every detail of, never feeling my intelligence insulted. This isn't easy to do when you have a plot as outrageous as the one in Tootsie so the film deserves a ton of credit for pulling off a feat like that.I will say on a more personal note that, despite the quality of this film, it's not exactly my style. This isn't a film for me to fall in love with and the romantic aspect doesn't really intrigue me or draw me in. Instead I just have to sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is. These are things that can't be changed because that is what the movie is. It is a romantic comedy told in an amusingly unorthodox manner. I did enjoy the quirkiness of it and I did find it funny, but overall this isn't a film that I would die for or call a masterpiece. But it is a good film, don't get me wrong, and I can respect the quality in the script and creative storyline, and, most of all, the acting.Dustin Hoffman truly delivers one of his best performances. As Michael Dorsey he is determined and stalwart, playing a character motif he plays a lot of the time. It is the typical hard headed Hoffman that we are all familiar with. But as Dorothy Michaels he is something completely different. For one, he plays a female almost too well. He dons one of the most convincing accents ever, as well as hitting the mannerisms of a southern belle so perfectly. His makeup is impressive, as he really does look like a woman in this film, but everything aside from the physical aspects is perfect as well. He shines in such an odd way but it works all too well. The supporting cast is excellent as well with fine actors such as Jessica Lange and Bill Murray. Murray plays one of the funniest characters in the film. He is Jeff, Michael's roommate who doesn't want any involvement in Michael's shenanigans yet always enjoys throwing his own opinions into what Michael is doing with lines that guarantee copious amounts of laughter. It is obvious that this film wouldn't be complete without all of its fine actors.Tootsie is a well acted, well written, well put together film, but it is not one I would watch again. I enjoyed it as a fun and entertaining use of two hours of my day but that's it. I don't see the film sticking with me but I have undying respect for its quality. Hoffman's performance is incredible, the film is so hilariously unique, and it actually elicited quite a few laughs from me. Tootsie is a fine film that is hard to dislike but requires a certain taste to truly love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tootsie still remains to this day, nearly 30 years later, as one of the funniest and most endearing of American comedies. In many ways, it is like the classic screwball comedies like Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday, which combined rapid dialogue with absurd situations to create a story about people whose lives are on the verge of collapsing, causing them to put themselves in impossible circumstances to survive.Beyond the comedic items of cross-dressing and duplicity, there is also great tenderness and decency amongst these characters. The least likable, Michael Dorsey, must undergo the most dramatic change in order to better himself. This gives way to several hilarious moments but also shows how in the modern world men and women have had to meet on a level plane in society. Indeed, an underlying theme of this film is the societal construct men and women have had to deal with and how it would seem that now those roles can either be reversed or discarded. Whether you agree with that or not, there is no denying this is a true statement.Even so, this is a wonderfully entertaining film with a brilliant performance by Dustin Hoffman as the unemployed actor turned woman soap star that holds the film at its center. Supporting him are a beautiful and sweet Jessica Lange, sturdy Sydney Pollack who pulls double duty as the agent and the film's director, and Bill Murray as Michael's roommate whose dead-pan deliveries keep the audience on an even keel so that we have some sense of realism in this crazy story. Nevertheless, all the plot threads come together in a most exciting and funny conclusion along with new insight into how men can be deceitful, women can be self- loathing and both need to compromise. Simple but true, isn't it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recall thinking how daring it must have been for Dustin Hoffman to put it all out there on the line when this film first came out. Sure, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis did it in "Some Like It Hot", but they went mostly for laughs. Hoffman plays it straight (in a manner of speaking), and even though the film has many funny moments, there's also an understated nuance in the way he handles his character in serious situations. I'll have to credit that to Hoffman's unique ability to take entirely disparate characters and make them his own, just as he did with Ratso Rizzo, Jack Crabb and Raymond Babbitt.The supporting players here are first rate, and perfectly cast to match their characters. The surprise for me was seeing director Sidney Pollack in front of the camera as Michael Dorsey's agent. My favorite scene is the one where Michael reveals he's Dorothy, and Pollack is completely beside himself with disbelief. It's just what you'd expect from an agent who just reamed his most temperamental client for being impossible to work with.The picture does have it's expected situations that attempt to compromise Dorothy Michaels' relationship with men, but they're intelligently done and don't resort to slapstick. Les Nichols' (Charle Durning) attempt to romance Dorothy was handled discreetly by the script, and the ensuing confrontation between the two as men was handled professionally. This all could have been done quite differently with an over the top approach to Michael Dorsey's 'womanhood', but then you would have had a mediocre film filled with stereotype and caricature. Instead, you have one that offers the viewer a good time without sacrificing intelligence at the expense of humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This IS A Great Comedy But Its Also VERY Disturbing. I Always Thought Dustin Hoffman Was A Horrible Actor But Then I Saw This Now I Believe He Can Play Any Role. The Plot Is That Michael Dorsey is an unemployed actor with an impossible reputation. In order to find work and fund his friend's play he dresses as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and lands the part in a daytime drama. Dorsey loses himself in this woman role and essentially becomes Dorothy Michaels, captivating women all around the city and inspiring them to break free from the control of men and become more like Dorsey's initial identity. This newfound role, however, lands Dorsey in a hot spot between a female friend/'lover,' a female co-star he falls in love with, that co-star's father who falls in love with him, and a male co-star who yearns for his affection. Now You Gotta Give Credit To Bill Murray He Has The Best Lines Like "That Is One Nutty Hospital" When Dustin Hoffman Reveals Dorothy Michaels Was Him That Was Funny &amp; When They Said Cut Everyone Went For Drinks As If To Say "Need A Drink After *That* One". All In All A Funny Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when in doubt, a dress works wonders....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Previously tackled in Shakespearean plays and films like "Glen or Glenda" and "Some Like It Hot," a man masquerading as a woman was not an innovative storyline by the time "Tootsie" was released in 1982. Unlike its in-drag predecessors, though, "Tootsie" successfully captures a thoughtful, although improbable, portrayal of a man who discovers his inner beauty by wearing a wig and a dress. The theme of self-transformation is two-fold in the film; man dresses as a woman and physically becomes an actress, and man dresses like a woman and becomes emotionally whole. Both the internal and external development of "Tootsie"'s leading man/woman, Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels, is unearthed simultaneously. Although Michael voluntarily changes his looks, he is unsuspecting of the inward overhaul he is about to experience as well. Dustin Hoffman is at the helm of the film as the dual characters, giving a doubly honest, uncensored performance to secure his future stardom. As a blacklisted actor in New York, Michael is impossible to work with and utterly self-obsessed. To himself, he is a class act, a star awaiting his big break. His agent, however, bursts his bubble, asserting that Michael will be permanently unemployed because of his defiant attitude. After this eye-opening conversation, Michael hatches a plan, determined to find work as an actor.In the subsequent shot we spy a petite, unbecoming woman walking down the bustling streets of New York. It is very obviously Michael in drag. Because of the spitfire alter ego he creates in Dorothy Michaels, he lands the coveted role of Miss Kimberly on a popular soap opera?the exact role his best friend, Sandy, auditioned for but was rejected. Terri Garr, who is luminous as Sandy, portrays her struggling actress character with just the right combination of insecurity and spunk to make her completely likable. She remains in the dark during Michael's stint as a woman, but gleefully feeding the ruse is Michael's roommate, Jeff, a subdued yet hysterical Bill Murray fresh from his "Stripes" performance.Flash forward to a couple of weeks into his gig, and Michael has already achieved soap glory as Miss Kimberly while utilizing his disguise to gain the trust of enchanting television starlet, Julie. By spending time with Julie, a beauty with a heart of gold, effortlessly portrayed by Jessica Lange, Michael begins to feel the twinge of love. What is intended as an acting job soon blossoms into a way of life; he encompasses the character of Dorothy to the point that he is more comfortable in her heels than his own shoes. For this reason, he prefers to be in the company of Julie, who brings out the best version of him, even if it means he has put on makeup to feel this way. Later in the film, Michael confesses to Julie that, "I was a better man with you, as a woman...than I ever was with a woman, as a man." While hiding in his female counterpart, Michael's self-transformation runs full circle. Once an egocentric, self-important Lothario, Dorothy opens him up to genuine sensitivity and compassion. He is able to step outside of the role of playboy actor he reveled in and find the decency in himself as well as others, most notably with the aid of Julie and her father Les, an impeccable Charles Durning. The emotionally closed-off Les finds himself inexplicably falling for Dorothy with disastrous results. Because Les is a true gentleman who believes he has found a kindred spirit in Dorothy, we root for him to get the girl, even though impossible and hopeless. When Michael finally confronts his suitor, sans the Dorothy costume, it is heartbreaking and heartwarming in the same breath. Director Sydney Pollack eliminates any question of Dorothy's affect on Michael by capturing his transformation through elements like extreme close-ups and montage. Throughout the film, while Michael is playing Dorothy, the audience gets up close and personal with every cosmetic product used on Dorothy's face. Some shots are almost too invasive, but this serves as a constant reminder that the gentle, loving woman behind the mask is actually a man. While viewers may get lost in the character of Dorothy, those close-ups?like during his reveal speech on live television?pull us back to seeing the man under the makeup when the shots are magnified. The montage summarizing Dorothy's trip with Julie to her father's farm is another route Pollack takes to illustrate self-transformation. Clips of the threesome eating dinner, talking, sitting outside, etc., are edited together to confirm Michael's emotional changes and his first acts of selfless love, all to the glorious tune of Stephen Bishop's "It Might Be You."Many films parallel the theme of "Tootsie" while experimenting with gender roles. The concept was not novel in the 1980's, and tons of more of the same sprung up after its release. Among my favorites is the sappy, and equally implausible, guilty pleasure of a film, "Just One of the Guys." Released three years after "Tootsie," this film depicts what transpires when a self-centered, yet charismatic, high school female tries a boy's pants on for size while seeking validation of her writing talent. Comedy and mistaken identities ensue, and when her spell as a teenage boy ends, she has learned life lessons, matured on the inside, and fallen in love with a fooled, and forgiving, guy. In films, like "Tootsie," that fearlessly explore appearance alterations, inescapable self-transformation is brilliantly expounded. Michael sets off on his journey as a conceited joke of an actor with the vendetta to prove his worth, but comes into his own when he switches genders. The trick to self-discovery may not involve cross-dressing, but rather just examining the world through an untarnished, new perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman makes "Tootsie" an original cross-dressing classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Men playing women is far from unheard of in film and especially the theater, so why does "Tootsie" feel so original? Perhaps it's the fact that based on the plot, it's intended to be deceptive cross-dressing, or maybe it's simply because Dustin Hoffman is such a prominent male actor that it gave the concept a renewed intrigue. Either way, there's no doubt that "Tootsie" played a role in redefining character acting in movies.The film stars Hoffman as Michael Dorsey, an actor who has been out of work and according to his agent, played by the film's director Sydney Pollack, is impossible to work with. To prove everyone wrong, he takes on the guise of Dorothy Michaels and lands a part on a daytime soap opera. Not only does being a woman change Michael's perspective, but he also happens to fall for the show's leading lady (Jessica Lange).Hoffman truly steals this film. He's incredibly convincing as Dorothy while also nailing the ignorant, conceited fool that is Michael. While the script could better show how his dual life changes his perspective as a man, Hoffman makes the most out of it. His versatility is astounding. "Tootsie" also brags an impressive supporting cast that aside from Oscar- winning Lange includes Bill Murray as Michael's odd roommate, Charles Durning and Teri Garr.As a comedy, "Tootsie" is not exactly laugh-out-loud funny. There are some classic lines, but most of the jokes comes from the plot itself and how the events unfold. As a drama, it sort of acts as the first film to make feminism a central theme. The goal of the film in one sense is sort of to address feminism, or at least what at the time was sort of the growing movement among women to claim back their independence and womanhood. By creating a character who is a man both literally and figuratively walking in a woman's shoes and surrounding him with a couple women characters struggling with their independence, the writers have set up an interesting perspective for audiences to look at the differences between men and women. Seeing men hit on Dorothy not knowing she's a man is humorous but also eye-opening.On the comedy/drama spectrum, "Tootsie" might clearly belong on the comedy side, but neither aspect of the film is too extreme. It's a comedy that tries to reveal some of the most basic struggles that people in the working world deal with every day that often aren't at the center of attention in both our lives and on the silver screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent cast in hilarious comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Tootsie' is, first and foremost, a marvelous updating of the old screwball comedies of the thirties and forties. It's almost a shame to burden it with any deeper meanings than that, as that is quite sufficient. But there are some 'messages' in it, I suppose... more on them shortly. Dustin Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey, a pain-in-the-ass actor who can't get hired anywhere because he's a pain in the ass. So he hits upon the idea of posing as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, to get hired for a soap opera. It works. Is Hoffman really so convincing impersonating a woman? No, I don't think so. But he's dead-on in his portrayal of a man pretending to be one. He's always just a little too made up and well-dressed and perfectly-coiffed to be believable next to the more natural (and real) women he interacts with, mainly Jessica Lange and Teri Garr. But aside from a stray comment here and there, nobody seems to notice. The entire cast is wonderful; I have to single out Teri Garr though. Her character, Sandy, is a very complicated and moody variation on the classic ditzy blonde and Garr is perfect in the role. Her mood can change in the blink of an eye, and it does, often. At a party early on, Sandy comes bursting out of the bathroom holding a plunger and says to the first person she sees, "I've been trapped in there for a half hour! Didn't anybody hear me?" Then she looks around, instantly cheerful again, and says, "Wow, so everyone's having a great time, huh?" Her prepping for an audition for the soap opera part is priceless too. To say complications arise from Michael becoming Dorothy would be an understatement. John Van Horn (an actor in the soap opera) lusts after her, and Les Nichols (Charles Durning), who is the father of Jessica Lange's Julie Nichols, actually proposes marriage. With a ring. But it's Julie that Michael/Dorothy is interested in and of course he can't do anything about it with revealing his identity and losing the job. Jessica Lange won an Oscar; the film was nominated for ten Academy Awards altogether. Not surprisingly in a story like this, the men are portrayed none-too-flatteringly, and Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman), the soap's director, is the worst of them all- a vain, male chauvinist egomaniac. The role fits Coleman like a glove (how many times has he played a variation on THIS character?) and he too has his share of funny lines and moments. Okay, so the 'messages.' One of course is that men are clueless when it comes to women and their feelings. Michael himself, even though he is now able to see things through a woman's eyes, doesn't necessarily understand them any better. His general reaction seems to be, what a crazy way to act, dress, and live; after a certain point, he can't stand it any more and can't wait to go back to being a man. There are some gentle digs at women too. That some females have an undying capacity to feel victimized no matter what the situation has Michael/Dorothy falling back on typical male feelings. As in, if a guy abused 'her', Dorothy would kick him in the nuts. And so on. Oh and Bill Murray is in it too, unbilled in the opening credits, as Michael's roommate, and he's quite funny, essentially playing, well, Bill Murray and offering wry commentary on the goings-on. So, as they said in the forties, 'Tootsie' is a laff-riot, and the chuckle quotient is sky high. It's definitely right up there with 'Ed Wood' as one of the best cross-dressing movies ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Dorsey is an out of work actor, unable to get work because he is either too small, too old, too young and etc. After final getting to the end of his tether he decides to drag up as a woman and audition for the role of Dorothy Michaels on a daytime soap opera. He not only gets the job but Dorothy becomes a massive hit with the television audiences and studio bosses alike, but success has its drawbacks, it plays havoc with his love life and brings unwanted attentions from members of the same sex!Terrificly entertaining comedy that showcases the best of Dustin Hoffman and brings our attention to a whole ream of quality supporting actors. Feeling very much like an old school type comedy, Tootsie (superbly directed by Sydney Pollack) fuses all the traits needed to hold the audience right to the credits role. What's noticeable now when revisiting the film is just how cheeky the piece is, poking the ribs of soaps, the pedal stool building of celebrities, and of course the bad taste that is left in the mouth because of sexism.....especially in the film industry, yes Tootsie is pretty astute work from Pollack and his team of writers (way too many to mention here).Though very much a blunderbuss vehicle for Hoffman's range (he may be difficult to work with but he's one of his generations best actors), Tootsie's ultimate success is down to the ensemble cast. The twin sexiness that is Jessica Lange and Teri Garr both put in tremendous work as the two women in Michael/Dorothy's life, then there is Bill Murray as Michael's flat mate, Jeff, deadpan comedy gold from the sozzled face master. Sydney Pollack (yes the same), Charles Durning, Dabney Coleman and Geena Davis round out the roll call for excellent performances fleshing the bones of this delightful picture. Not without its bitter sweet moments, or indeed a touch of drama, it's with the comedy that Tootsie is most remembered for, and rightly so. As Dorothy struggles to fight off amorous men, or the simplest thing like hailing a taxi, the laughs come fast and furious in this cross dressing delight. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The second funniest comedy I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my second favorite on my list of favorite comedies, behind the Marx Brother's film "A Night at the Opera." "Tootsie" is entirely unpredictable and implausible, and watching Dustin Hoffman pull off the act of dressing up as a woman makes me laugh hysterically every time I see it. Hoffman was robbed of winning the best actor Oscar for 1982. The supporting cast, including Bill Murray, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Teri Garr, and Jessica Lange, is also excellent. Syndey Pollack also proves to be as great an actor as a director. The song "It Might Be You" is one of the best original movie songs I've heard, and it really adds to the film. "Tootsie" is similar to films such as "Some Like It Hot" and "Mrs. Doubtfire," but this movie is much funnier, as it doesn't deal with topics such as divorce or trying to escape from gangsters. One of my top ten movies. See it and have some real good laughs.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Really Love You, But I Can't Love You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great comedy, no doubt, but perhaps lacking a trifle more to transcend the genre even more impressively, and to be ranked among the very greatest movies *as such*, independently from the genre it belongs to. It is certainly entertaining and fun to watch from start to finish. What else could you expect from a movie starring two of the greatest American actors of all time: Dustin Hoffman and Charles Durning? (They were to repeat their collaboration 3 years later, to an even more impressive effect, in the 1985 definitive screen version of Arthur Miller's classic ''Death of a Salesman''.) Plus, Bill Murray is another icon, of course. Sydney Pollack himself, the movie's director, is hilarious as the egomaniacal TV producer. True, there were a few moments where you could see the film-makers were trying to evoke a few cheap laughs from the audience; such as the baby throwing food at Dustin Hoffman in disguise; or Dustin struggling with his women's apparel, much reminiscent of Tony Curtis's similar afflictions in _Some Like It Hot_. However, apart from such upper-layer, obvious comedic moments, there were others, truly unforgettable ones: such as, when Michael delivers "the perfect line" to his beloved girl, only to receive the content of the girl's drink in her face; now *that*'s what illustrates the difference between theory and practice so picturesquely. What's more, the screenwriters *repeat* that amazing feat once again later in the movie's action; with Michael again, but another girl; and the other girl's hysterical shriek upon learning the truth -- the very thing she had demanded to hear from Michael a few moments ago -- is one of the movie's greatest moments. So is the line delivered by her following her shriek: "I can't take this s*it from friends -- only from lovers." Yet *another* way to powerfully illustrate the difference between theory and practice -- as experienced by women. And, it's admirable that both of these unforgettable scenes and women's explosions center around their love interests; yes *love* is the movie's central theme; and there is at least one immortal moment of insuperable greatness in _Tootsie_. That is when, appropriately stuttering and rolling her big eyes, the beautiful Jessica Lange impeccably delivers the wondrous line, "I really love you, but I can't love you." That is a line of genius; in no other sentence has the paradox of love been better captured; or the paradox of humans using language and words that are woefully inadequate and imprecise -- such as the verb "to love" that involves so many meanings, some of them contradictory, that Jessica Lange can deliver her line and this line can seem perfectly logical *and* impossible at the very same time! The actors' performances are uniformly excellent. And there's a nice touch towards the end, when we see Bill Murray reading an ultimate tough guy's novel (a Dashiell Hammett book) in a movie that purports to examine the nature and essence of femininity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tootsie Is A Hoot (sie)!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams have two things in common: 1) they both starred in Steven Spielberg's Peter Pan remake,'Hook' opposite each other as Captain Hook and a grown-up Peter Pan and 2) both actors appeared in drag in Tootsie and Mrs Doubtfire. But whereas Mrs Doubtfire played on sentimentality and comic laughs, Tootsie was a straight out comedy film for much older audiences and yet, this was arguably the original and best.Hoffman plays Michael Dorsey an unemployed actor, who eventually takes on the role and the identity of Dorothy Michaels, who ends up on a soap opera as the character, Emily Kimberly. He shares his apartment with his friend, Jeff played by Bill Murray before he had hit the big time with Ghostbusters. There are also appearances by Sydney Pollock and Geena Davis, of whom was making her debut role in Tootsie. Along the way he falls for his co-star, Julie played by Jessica Lange, whilst experiencing relationship problems of his own with his girlfriend: the neurotic and slightly mad, Stacy. She herself has no idea that Michael has been dressing in women's clothing that when she discovers a dress on the table for instance in one scene, she assumes that Michael is seeing another woman. He tries to convince her that it's not the case, although as the film develops, so does his feelings for Julie as well.It's not long before two other guys have the hots for Dorothy- one of them of whom is Julie's father, and thus complications set in afterwards. Alas, the charade takes a turn towards the end when Michael finally reveals his true identity to everyone.I saw Tootsie for the first time this year when it was on TV and I have also seen Mrs Doubtfire countless times. The similarities and links associated with these two movies are somewhat evident. The thing is that with Mrs Doubtfire, the wisecracks whilst they were humorous became silly but also, it tackled the whole 'drag' theme in a kind of kiddie-friendly-yet in a corny, cheese ball and sugar-coated way that some people found nauseating. Tootsie, in contrast, did so in an intelligent, witty,-yet mature way.Therefore, unlike Daniel/Mrs Doubtfire and Miranda, with Michael/Dorothy and Julie, you really felt for them and the emotions and feelings that they had to deal with each other and Michael's attempts to convince Julie that he does indeed love her. Particularly when Michael suddenly realises his feelings for Julie have become more serious that he is livid- well not that livid but startled when, as Dorothy he sees Julie in the arms of his director, Ron Carlisle. Daniel and Miranda though argued most of the time and to be honest, in Robin Williams and Sally Field, they were miscasted in Mrs Doubtfire, well Sally Field was- but still they didn't look that convincing as a couple on-screen.Dustin Hoffman offers an sterling performance as Michael; his versatility as an actor is as such that he can play almost any part- be it serious or humorous- and still he gives it everything, 9 times out of 10. Yes he is more renowned for doing dramatic film work; the Graduate, Rain Man, Kramer vs Kramer to name but many but its always nice to see him play a character that we generally don't associate him with, and to do it as well as he does in Tootsie and Meet the Fockers. Although with the latter, Hoffman is not at his very best.The closure of the film, disappointed me a little because whilst Michael got his woman, Julie, the way it had unfolded was a slight letdown, given how great the rest of the movie was. Nevertheless, they got together in the end and alas, romance blossoms for the pair.Overall, Tootsie is a wonderful film: amusing, witty, interesting and also subtle too, Dustin Hoffman excels as the guy who becomes a woman. This is more than just a film about drag, it is a definite must-see. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael cannot seem to get a job as and actor and he has tried for twenty years. He doesn't get a job until he dresses up as a woman and soon enough he cannot stand it. I really liked this movie and thought that it was similar to "Mrs. Doubtfire." I liked the whole scene where "Dorothy" has to look after the baby and it drives him/her? crazy! I also liked the part where the actor didn't know that she was really a he and tried to kiss him. Then Dorothy hit him with the book I think.It is just a really funny movie. The ending is sort of unfinished but the main thing is Micheal and Dorothy.Great movie if you need a laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliantly realized, man-in-drag comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is one of the best actors around. A gifted performer who's dedicated and knowledgeable of his craft, he knows the ins and outs of an actor's life and can capture every nuance of every character he is assigned to play. So how come he hasn't any steady work in almost twenty years? It's because Michael is cursed with an artist's temper, a demanding, know-it-all attitude that makes him a pain to work with. For instance, Michael loses a job in a commercial when he accuses the director of logic problems regarding his part. Michael's role in the commercial? A tomato ("tomatoes don't sit!"). According to his fed-up agent (Sydney Pollack, "Tootsie"'s director), no one, in New York or even Hollywood, wants to hire Michael. As if that weren't bad enough, Michael is struggling to raise money for his friend Jeff's (Bill Murray, never more deadpan) avant-garde play that he's agreed to star in. When Michael's high-strung, platonic friend Sandy (Teri Garr) loses a part on the soap opera "Southwest General", Michael stumbles upon a solution to his problems. No one will hire Michael Dorsey... but surely someone will give "Dorothy Michaels" a chance. So with a red wig, lots of makeup, a fake Southern accent, and an outfit fit for a schoolmarm, "Dorothy" wins the part of strong-willed Emily Kimberly on "Southwest General". Michael's plan is simple: he'll slum it on a hit soap for a season or two, get the money he needs for Jeff's play, and just have "Dorothy" disappear into oblivion. Since he's such a good actor, everyone falls for his charade and his portrayal of a strong female character makes "Dorothy" a star overnight. Michael is initially thrilled with his newfound success, but it soon brings unexpected difficulties. In his guise as a woman, he is faced with sexual harassment by the show's heartless director (Dabney Coleman, pretty much doing a rehash of his "9 to 5" character). Michael is also forced to share love scenes with his fatuous, untalented co-star John Van Horn (George Gaynes), who develops a crush on "Dorothy" off-screen. Things are further complicated when Michael falls deeply in love with one of "Southwest General"'s actresses, the beautiful but insecure Julie (Jessica Lange). Still, they are able to become close friends, even though Michael longs to tell Julie the horrible truth. Julie admires the fun and feisty "Dorothy"... and so does her widowed father Les (Charles Durning). Michael's life spins even further out of control when the producers want "Dorothy" on the show for three more years. He's going to have a hell of a time climbing out of the hole he's dug for himself, and an even harder time trying to win the woman he loves. "Tootsie" is easily the best comedy of the '80s. A sophisticated, intelligent update of one of comedy's oldest conventions (men in drag), it's Dustin Hoffman's brightest moment. True, he's not that physically convincing as a woman, but he manages to capture women's mannerisms and quirks so well that with just a little suspension of disbelief, you buy the act. What a shame he didn't win the Oscar. Hoffman's not only a hoot in drag, he brings a lot of depth and character development to Michael, who starts off as a selfish opportunist but who grows into a nicer, more empathetic man who now knows how difficult it is to be a woman. Bill Murray nearly steals the movie as Michael's pretentious, decidedly weird friend whose only goal in life is to have people watch his plays and ask, "hey, man? what was that about?" The only acting Oscar went to Jessica Lange (for Best Supporting Actress). Though her performance in "Tootsie" isn't as compelling as her role in "Frances" (coincidentally, she was nominated for the Best Actress statuette that same year for "Frances"), she really brings a lot of dimension to the typical love interest character. Plus, Lange has excelled in playing hardened femme fatales throughout the years, so it's refreshing seeing her kinder, gentler side. She also never looked lovelier than she does in "Tootsie". She and Hoffman have a deliciously tense chemistry, and even though what Michael did was wrong (on so many levels, really), you still want these two to get together. I must make special mention of Teri Garr, who is hilarious and sympathetic as Sandy, who has no idea that Michael is not only in love with someone else, but that he indirectly stole her part on the show. Whenever people mention comedies about cross-dressing, "Some Like it Hot" is always mentioned first, followed by "Mrs. Doubtfire". If life were fair, "Tootsie" would be the undisputed first choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, witty comedy of an actor dressed for success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a few years since I saw this hilarious comedy, one of the absolute best ever, but I recall vividly the rip roaring laughter and the cute, yet intelligent story. Dustin Hoffman is brilliant in his dual role, for which he earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, portraying both the unemployed male actor, Michael, and the highly successful female TV soap star, Dorothy.This wonderful comedy revolves around an unemployed actor named Michael Dorsey, who disguises himself as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, in order to land a part in a TV soap opera...a role which proves incredibly successful. Meanwhile, Michael falls in love with the soap's female star, Julie, but cannot divulge Dorothy's secret or will lose his acting job. Unfolding events are further complicated by the fact that Julie's father, Les, is in love with Dorothy herself. Really, it's all too much...I'm still cracking up. There's an excellent story here too, not just detached laughs, and of course all the while, you're cheering for the romance, which naturally cannot possibly run smoothly. The love interest, Julie, in fact treats Dorothy like her female best friend. Situations are by turns awkward, emotional, moving, outrageous, and most often simply side splitting hilarious.The lovely and talented Jessica Lange deserves her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Julie. The other supporting cast is good here as well, Charles Durning portraying Julie's dad and Terri Carr as Michael's original girlfriend, Sandy.This seems to be a genre which, when well done, can be pretty funny, as in the older Some Like it Hot (Jack Lemmon / Marilyn Munroe) and the modern Mrs. Doubtfire (Robin Williams / Sally Field), another of my favorites. Tootsie's Dustin Hoffman offers a marvelous performance that would by no means have been an easy act for Robin Williams to follow, though in my opinion, the perennially funny Williams managed to succeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If it hadn't been for Some Like It Hot, cross dressing comedies like Mrs. Doubtfire, Big Momma's House and She's the Man (and, ahem, White Chicks) would not have existed, and this one of the most remembered, from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Sidney Pollack (They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, The Way We Were, Out of Africa). Basically Michael Dorsey (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Dustin Hoffman) is a talented actor, but he out of work and no-one wants to hire him because he is so difficult to work with, he has been unemployed for four months, and his long suffering agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack) is tired of it. George tells Michael that he will never got a job in the city, but when Michael hears from his friend Sandy Lester (Dumb and Dumber's Oscar BAFTA nominated Teri Garr) that the soap opera Southwest General are auditioning for a new female character, he dresses as a woman, to become Dorothy Michaels, and he gets the part after "her" feisty performance. As Dorothy, Michaels raises the $8,000 to give his friend and roommate Jeff Slater (Bill Murray) to produce his play Return To Love Canal, and as time goes by, and as Dorothy improvises more dramatic and feisty lines and scenes in the show, she becomes the most popular character. Michael does not want "girlfriend" Sandy to know what he is up to, as she wanted the part in the soap opera, and she seems too fragile to be told the truth, and this relationship and his covering up of his cross dressing is becoming complicated. He is also finding himself, as Dorothy, attracted to single mother and female co-star Julie Nichols (King Kong's Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Jessica Lange), who is already seeing sexist director Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman), but she really admires Dorothy. As Dorothy, Michael almost kisses Julie, and of she can only say that she likes "her" as a friend, and dressed as a woman he has admirers as well, including older co-star John Van Horn (George Gaynes) and Julie's widowed father Leslie 'Les' (The Muppet Movie's Charles Durning), who even proposes to "her". Michael is getting increasingly uncomfortable carrying on pretending to be a woman playing the popular hospital administrator, and it gets worse when the producers want to extend Dorothy's contract for another year. He decides to finally reveal the truth when the cast are forced to perform a scene live, and as Dorothy Michaels he performs a stirring moment, and as part of his own storyline, he reveals himself as "twin brother" to the character, everyone is shocked by this double revelation. Weeks later, Michael wants to confess all to Julie, having lost Sandy, and after explaining himself and his feelings for her, she does forgive him and they happily walk down the street together, we don't know what happened in terms of his acting career though. Also starring Geena Davis as April Page, Doris Belack as Rita Marshall, Saw's Tobin Bell as Waiter and Andy Warhol. In his regular manly role Hoffman is a likable guy, and he really shines under the wig and make up dressing up as the woman, Lange gives a really sweet award winning performance as the woman he loves and has her problems, Garr gets her moments as the suspicious and easily irritated "girlfriend", and the co-stars including Pollack and Murray gets their fair amount of funny moments too. The cross dressing aspect is played in both a funny and an interesting way, with the story being about a soap opera it also satirises the ideas that these programmes can come up with, all in all it makes up for a most watchable comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Song for "It Might Be You", Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Original Song for the title song, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Dustin Hoffman was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 21 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 62 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gem of a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tootsie is one of these all-too rare comedies; it just never stops being funny, no matter how many times you watch it.Hoffman plays a struggling actor who, in desperation, disguises himself as a woman and gets a part in very popular daytime soap. He succeeds brilliantly and becomes a very prominent public figure, but things get very complicated for him when he falls in love with one of his co-stars who only knows him as a woman (and to top it off, her father falls in love with him, as her...).An incredibly witty script, with an endless number of funny (and quotable) one-liners, a flawless cast, superb direction; Tootsie quite simply has it all. Dustin Hoffman has never been funnier, Bill Murray is a riot as his roommate Jeff, Dabney Coleman is hilarious as Hoffman's boss and complete scene stealer Sidney Pollack (also the film's director) nearly walks off with the movie.The intelligent script is also rich in characterization and is firmly grounded in reality, this never succumbs to slapstick. The film also benefits heavily for using the "drag thing" before it became tiresome and ultimately boring and unbelievable (Mrs. Doubtfire springs to mind). Never too sentimental (again, Mrs. Doubtfire...) but always right on the mark, Tootsie is a gem of a comedy that only gets better with age and repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unemployed and getting desperate, actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) comes up with the perfect idea: dress up as a woman. Not only does he do that, but he gets a job. The only problem is, he's in love with a woman, and now he has this other identity to contend with.When "Tootsie" was first released, it was apparently hailed as a feminist movie. But is it? Granted, Michael comes to understand women better through his double identity, but he continues mistreating Sandy Lester (Teri Garr). Oh well. I guess that overall, the movie succeeds in other places, namely Michael's various embarrassing situations. You'll probably like it, especially with great supporting performances by Jessica Lange, Charles Durning, Dabney Coleman, Bill Murray, and even director Sydney Pollack as Michael's agent. This was also Geena Davis' film debut. A real hoot, although I can see how some people might get a little offended by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You thought "The Graduate" was a hit. Well THINK AGAIN! You haven't seen anything like this before. It's "Tootsie". This movie has an all star cast, a very excellent plot, and a very surprising twist. I think out of all the movies where men disguise themselves as women, this movie is the tops. Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey AND Dorothy Michaels. This is hilarious as it would get. Hoffman in my opinion was the best woman in any movie. he looks great in any movie perhaps. Sharing a room with Geena Davis would be nerve-racking. Both feeling would come to mind. being aroused and nervous at the same time. Watch it1 Don't blow the cover. Teri Garr is always great in any movie. Playing the sad sack actress and girlfriend of Dorsey. I would say, "Get a Life woman", "you're making me look down at ya!" This is a movie I can really relate to. Being from New York is really a no brainer, but it's good to reminisce those times being there. Fooling everyone is a crime, getting away with is sometimes worth it, but when the scheme goes too far, there are consequences. At least Dorsey got himself a new girl. So it was worth something, right? Eventually, this move is worth anyone's watch, it's most definitely worth my time. 5 STARS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was ages, having had a tremendous crush on Jessica Lange, who was absolutely gorgeous in this film, before I realized how enjoyable TOOTSIE is as a comedy on it's own. After a truthful opening credit sequence in which the trials and tribulations of acting etc (and having done acting classes similar to those on show in this film, I know what it is like!!), we are introduced to Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman), an out-of-work actor whose reputation for being difficult denies him any glory. At an audition for a TV soap which is being attended by his girlfriend Sandy (Teri Garr), who is rejected before she even has a chance to read, Michael learns that a regular on the show has taken a part in THE ICEMAN COMETH on Broadway. Incensed, Michael visits his agent (played by director Sydney Pollack in a brilliant supporting performance) who tells him to 'get some therapy'. Cue Dorothy Michaels, Dorsey in drag, who not only gets a part in his new guise, but also falls in love with the show director's girlfriend, Julie (Jessica Lange. May I just say that the first time we clearly see her on screen was the moment I gained an immediate crush on her!!. Anyway, enough about that!!) Funny, perceptive and truthful, TOOTSIE was worthy of it's box-office success worldwide in 1982-83.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Tootsie" is one of the funniest, most charming comedies ever made. Dustin Hoffman gives a terrific performance here as Michael Dorsey, an actor who has alot of bad luck getting acting jobs. His agent (riotously played by director Sydney Pollack) says that no one will hire him because he's impossible to work with. So he decides to do the inevitable: dresses up as a woman named Dorothy Michaels and auditions for a role on a soap opera. And guess what? He/she wins the part! Michael begins to have great success as Dorothy as he receives letters from fans all over the country, and appears on numerous magazine covers. There are also the other people in his life. There's Sandy (Teri Garr), Michael's girlfriend; Jeff (Bill Murray), Michael's roommate; Julie (Jessica Lange), the popular actress on the soap opera who forms a close friendship with Dorothy who Michael falls in love with; Les (Charles Durning), Julie's father who falls in love with Dorothy; Ron (Dabney Coleman), the sexist director of the soap; Rita (Doris Belack), the sharp tongued producer of the soap; and John Van Horn (George Gaynes), the womanizing actor of the soap who's crazy about Dorothy too. All these actors give great performances because all of these roles are so well written and their roles come to life thanks to Pollack's outstanding direction. Hoffman gives one of the best performances of his career in "Tootsie" and this was one tough challenge that only he could pull off. "Tootsie" was a huge hit at the box office, received 10 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and two nominations for Best Supporting Actress for Teri Garr and Jessica Lange (Lange won the Oscar here). Great film.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

Dustin Hoffman gives a terrific performance here as Michael Dorsey, an actor who has alot of bad luck getting acting jobs. His agent (riotously played by director Sydney Pollack) says that no one will hire him because he's impossible to work with. So he decides to do the inevitable: dresses up as a woman named Dorothy Michaels and auditions for a role on a soap opera. And guess what? He/she wins the part! Michael begins to have great success as Dorothy as he receives letters from fans all over the country, and appears on numerous magazine covers. There are also the other people in his life. There's Sandy (Teri Garr), Michael's girlfriend who doesn't know about his cross-dressing secret; Jeff (Bill Murray), Michael's roommate who's the only one who knows Michael is leading a double life; Julie (Jessica Lange), the popular actress on the soap opera who forms a close friendship with Dorothy and who Michael falls in love with; Les (Charles Durning), Julie's father who falls in love with Dorothy; Ron (Dabney Coleman), the sexist director of the soap; Rita (Doris Belack), the sharp tongued producer of the soap; and John Van Horn (George Gaynes), the womanizing actor of the soap who's crazy about Dorothy too. All these actors (including Geena Davis in her film debut) give great performances because all of these roles are so well written and their roles come to life thanks to Pollack's outstanding direction. Hoffman gives one of the best performances of his career in "Tootsie" and this was one tough challenge that only he could pull off. "Tootsie" was a huge hit at the box office, received 10 Oscar nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and two nominations for Best Supporting Actress for Teri Garr and Jessica Lange (Lange won the Oscar here). Great film. **** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most laugh out loud funny movies I have ever seen. Yet with all the hilarity, the film has a lot to say. Dustin Hoffman gives the performance of his career. Reading about the making of this film almost gave me a heart attack! Somehow through all the travails, a true cinematic masterpiece was produced! From the rapid fire editing, incredible screenplay, and sharp direction to one of the greatest ensemble casts ever assembled, this film is gold mine of entertainment and cinema language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charming comedy about a desperate actor who masquerades as a middle aged woman to win a role on a soap opera. It's more than a comedy about a man in drag; it's a story about a man who becomes wiser for his experiences as a woman. Acting triumph for Hoffman and Oscar winner Lange, as the girl who thinks Hoffman's a girl too. Wonderfully written by Larry Gelbart, Murray Schisgal and Don McGuire and directed with care by the great Sydney Pollack.</fullReview>

All this to win a role on a soap opera...and it's all heartfelt and funny. Lange is standout as the girl who thinks Hoffman's a girl too. She won a much deserved Oscar for her performance. Sydney Pollack's direction and eye for great casting includes Garr, Coleman, Durning and Bill Murray. A magnificent triumph!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One brilliant scene after another</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tootsie ranks just behind "A Fish Called Wanda" on my all-time funniest list, and the two are interchangeable. What they both have in common is a wicked, twisted screenplay and solid acting from every character.You can't talk about Tootsie without making specific mention to Dustin Hoffman. At that time, there was not another actor alive who could have tackled that role so brilliantly. The frustrated actor, cross-dressing to get a role to raise money to finance a play that no-one is likely to see, and becoming a national icon without anyone catching on - the premise is ludicrous but Hoffman makes it believable, and even makes you sympathize with him along the way.Every scene in this movie works. From the pie-in-the-face one-liners delivered by Bill Murray, to the wonderful scene near the end when Dustin Hoffman goes to return the engagement ring to his otherwise would-be fiance, the father of the girl he longs for.The best example of just how good the writing is in this movie takes place in a conversation between Hoffman and his agent, played by the movie's Director, Sydney Pollack. By this point, every far-fetched, over the top plot line has been played out. The two characters discuss Hoffman's stressful situation, and in a sense, summarize the movie to that point. In the process, they give the plot more credibility, rather than less.Quite simply, a brilliant comedy, suitable for just about anyone. **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Somebody describes Tootsie as "an older movie", and you remember it well, seeing it in the theatre on your 25th birthday, but I digress.Don't think that this is some low-brow film that focuses on cross-dressing. It's not. This smart comedy is about how both sexes perceive themselves and each other. Dustin Hoffman plays actor Michael Dorsey, who's a dramatic purist. He wants to bring pure art to theatre whether people like it or not, like feeding spinach to a toddler. He's trying to raise money for a rather dismal play about people moving back to the location of a toxic waste disaster, Love Canal. In the meantime Michael is trying to get his aspiring actress friend, Sandy, a job on a soap opera. She doesn't even make the first cut. Later Michael has a show-down with his agent, George, who basically tells him he's been labeled as trouble and nobody will ever hire him.These two events come together and the next shot - on the streets of New York City - is Dustin Hoffman dressed as a middle aged lady going after the part that Sandy crashed and burned at the previous day -he's going to prove his agent wrong. At first Michael/Dorothy looks like she's going to be snubbed too, but by using what he knows the soap opera wants in the character as fake personal characteristics he gets a reading and gets the part.Now the hard part, he has to keep up this charade without anybody knowing, especially Sandy, since as an actual woman she couldn't get this job. Here is where Michael makes his first mistake. Waiting for Sandy to come out of the bathroom he undresses and tries on some of her clothes since he is going to need a wardrobe. Sandy comes out unexpectedly, Michael is standing in his underwear. Michael's reaction? Tell this extremely vulnerable woman that you want her and sleep with her of course! This really made me dislike Michael. Sandy even recognizes this might just be sex and says "she'd like her pain now". But, no, Michael falsely promises it's the beginning of a relationship. It is not.Michael starts out his job with two quests - to raise enough money to do the Love Canal play himself, and to prove to his agent that people can work with him. But then the problems begin. He begins to catch on as a performer and his/her little bits about handling difficult men in the workplace cause Michael/Dorothy to become a feminist hero, the show's ratings rise, and scads of fan mail arrive. Most of all, Michael becomes interested in Julie (Jessica Lange) an actress on the show who is involved with the lecherous director of the show (Dabney Coleman). Although Michael demonizes the guy, he really isn't treating Julie any worse than Michael is treating Sandy. Remember Sandy? Waiting for dinners that never happen and dates that are never kept? Michael/Dorothy also gets a taste of how aggressive men can be when they want something or someone, and in the process of courting Julie he attracts the romantic attention of Julie's father, old fashioned widower Les (Charles Durning). Michael also discovers what women say they want from men isn't always the truth, even when they (think they) are talking to another woman.Special mention to Sydney Pollack as Michael's agent. He was perfect as a guy at his wit's end dealing with a person (Michael) who doesn't exactly have normal coping skills. Bill Murray gets honorable mention as a self important guy who hangs around when the others are talking theatre like he's some great philosopher when he's actually just a chronically unemployed bag of wind, but at least he's an amusing bag of wind.They just don't make smart modern films like this anymore that take a few chances. Think about it, if this film had been done badly, it would be the stuff of cult film fans such as Faye Dunaway in Mommy Dearest screaming "No Wire Hangers Ever!". I think there's no chance you won't like it if you give it a try and look at all the subtle stuff going on as well as the big picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tootsie was a sweet movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Mrs. Doubtfire ever donned a dress, Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) did. Tootsie was on a popular roll that follow up the same humor as Some Like it Hot (1953). Hoffman does an incredible job as the nervous, slightly overbearing, not-so-slightly arrogant theater teacher Michael Dorsey who is forced into an unbelievable set of circumstances as a result of his rather unorthodox method of finding work. Michael's agent George Fields (movie director Sydney Pollack) can't even get his client a commercial since Michael complained that the tomato he was playing wasn't properly motivated. After screaming at Michael for being so obnoxious, he warns Dorsey that he might never find work as actor again. Dorsey doesn't think so, so when he hears of an opening on a popular Hospital soap opera for a woman role. He applies for the job by posing as 'Miss Dorothy Michaels'. The debut camera shot of Dorothy walking on the New York City's Street is amazing. Michael wins the part and becomes a widely known popular actress due to Michael acting out his character as a feisty, feminist administrator, which surprises the other actors and crew who expected her to be another swooning female in the plot. While Michael is on the soap, he falls for his co-star Julie (Jessica Lange, in an Oscar-winning performance) but, as Dorothy, is courted by Julie's widowed father (Charles Durning). The vocal exchange between Charles and Dustin is just funny as hell in the film. Michael ultimately finds that his disguise as a woman has made him a better man when dealing with women, due to quickly learning a little about what life is like for the opposite sex. The movie has this great message about gender equality in its humor. Still, he cannot hide in the role any longer. Michael must finds a clever way to extricate his character before he lose Julie's love forever. The final scene with Dorothy is funny and need to be watch. Yes, it's truly a nutty hospital. Tootsie's gender bending premise was great. The movie work with all the main leads, and support by memorable comic performances from Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr, George Gaynes, and Bill Murray. Also the movie makes the film debut of future Oscar winner Geena Davis. "It Might Be You," sung by singer Stephen Bishop was a work of genius. I also like to mention Metamorphosis Blues by Dave Grusin being a great song in the film as well. I love how they were trying to avoid writing a farce while making the film, but still at 116 minutes Tootsie is simply too long to support its one gag; Hoffman as a woman. While the movie offers its share of amusing moments, it eventually wears out its welcome and emerges as a fairly forgettable. Dustin Hoffman's acting as Dorothy can be a bit over acting. While I don't know if it's on purpose or not. It get kind of annoying hearing a cheat mocking Southern accent from him. Some homosexuals might find the movie a bit offending or degrading. The reason for this is because of movies with male cross dressing tend to be comical or mock about. Also straights being confront by homosexual acts in film tend to be funny. Not only homosexuals, but women can find this movie a bit offended as the movie is saying that strong independent women have to be manly. Cross dressing for example in comedy usually revolves around caricaturing and making fun of the other sex like women, albeit in a lighthearted way. Still, Tootsie was a pop hit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps a Bit Overrated, But Still Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unemployed actor with a reputation for being difficult (Dustin Hoffman) disguises himself as a woman to get a role in a soap opera.Understandably, this film was successful and well-received by people.Dustin Hoffman is an amazing actor and he goes the whole way on this (though I found his voice a bit hard to accept as a woman's voice). Much of his dialogue is actually improvised, which is amazing... more impressive is how the other actors are able to react genuinely to his improv.The supporting actors are well-cast, too. Bill Murray was still young, but always improves any scene he is in. Interestingly, he plays a very "straight" character, which is not what we have come to expect from him, and suggests his range is greater than generally given credit. Teri Garr and Jessica Lange were both cast without the script even being finished, with Lange being picked solely because Pollack's daughter liked "King Kong"!But it is not perfect, either. It is definitely dated, with a horrendous soundtrack that should be thrown in the fire. And the same theme has been done over and over again, making this film (even if original) seem stale. That is not their fault, of course, but unfortunately it rubs off on them.Somewhat unusually, the film was picked up by the Criterion Collection. Whether it deserves to be there or not is open to debate, but they did a fantastic job with the Blu-Ray and it looks great. The commentary track from director Sydney Pollack is very informative and shows how much Hoffman really carried the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Go, Tootsie, Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1980s cinema mostly sucked, but one thing the 80s got right was the R-rated comedy. "Tootsie" is perhaps the premier example of 80s adult comedy at its best, and it's a dynamite film.Dustin Hoffman plays a struggling actor who lands a job on a soap opera under the guise of a tough-talking woman. Things get complicated (as such things do, of course) when he/she becomes a national sensation and has to face the prospect of pretending to be a woman for the indefinite future.Hoffman gives a master class in screen comedy, and the success of the entire film rests primarily on his ability to pull off a tricky role. At one point, his character says something about being a better man as a woman than he ever was being a man, and the movie, and his performance, conveys just that. He's ably abetted by a terrific ensemble that includes Bill Murray, Teri Garr, Charles Durning and Sydney Pollack, who also directed. Jessica Lange plays his love interest and won an Oscar for her performance, though I've always found Lange's mannerisms to be distracting and she's not comfortable with some of the more comedic elements.The film is so well written that you can sit back and enjoy it without having to roll your eyes at how implausible it all is. Sometimes clichés say it the best, and such is the case here: they just don't make 'em like this anymore.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood has never made a better comedy than this. An American Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot believe it has been 25 years since "Tootsie" was first released in 1982. I was not alive then and there have been many funny movies from the last 25 years. But I guarantee you none of them were as original, as hilarious and as entertaining as "Tootsie". It might be my love for Dustin Hoffman as an actor but I have never seen a better comedy than this. This was also rehashed sort of as "Mrs. Doubtfire" 11 years later and that film was a terrific story and was excellent in its own way. But it did not have the entertainment or comedy value of "Tootsie". I also think with the exception of "E.T." there was not a better film in 1982 and I think it is ridiculous that the Academy gave "Gandhi" Best Picture when that Oscar most definitely belonged to either "E.T." or this. That was a huge mistake. I also don't like the fact that people when they want to watch a comedy watch some dumb and mindless garbage when they can be watching terrific entertainment like this. This is not mindless but you do not have to overly think. I also have not seen Sydney Pollack do a better film and if it had not been for "The Graduate" or "E.T." "Tootsie without a doubt would have been my all-time favorite movie. I also think Dustin Hoffman should have picked up his second Oscar for this rather than "Rain Man". Yes he was terrific in that movie, but there has never been one actor who dresses up as a woman and has played a woman to perfection like Dustin Hoffman. Jessica Lange also deserved her Oscar for this as well. I urge you if you have not seen this get a copy of it immediately. I mean sure Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler might come out with another good movie coming up but it will not be to perfection like "Tootsie". Simply put there is no other way to describe this film other than an American masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A funny film with some things to say in terms of relationships, it is nevertheless predictable with a capital P, taking a very familiar concept, and using the familiar clichés. But for all the film's problems, it is at least well acted by Dustin Hoffman, both in and out of costume, and the film's director, Sydney Pollack, who has a great supporting role. Jessica Lange won the 1982 Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her role, and Teri Garr was nominated, but it is only really Hoffman and Pollack who actually stand out in this enjoyable and rather well made, but ultimately far off being perfect, or special, film.</fullReview>

Tootsie is an experience more than entertainment. and this is the essence of its freshness against decades of cinema, fashion, styles, special effects and 3D.so, Dorothy Michaels. and her brilliant triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>as bad as an adam sandler comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm no Dustin Hoffman expert but I really enjoy his performances in The Graduate and Rain Man. Diverse and talented actor, no doubt. I found Tootise however to be low grade, patronising garbage on just about every level. I'm aware it's a comedy (well, duh) but the whole tone of the film is as mercilessly shallow and inane as the average Adam Sandler movie. It just isn't funny. All the characters squawk around like wind-up dummies, oblivious to the obvious, and react to utterly implausible situations like hypnotised gerbils. The whole thing gets repetitive and boring too early, and lost me well before the end. Even a fine musical score by soundtrack king Dave Grusin can't save this pretentious, hammy mess from its own campy stupidity. I know I'm in a minority here but, considering its near legendary reputation I was disappointed by just about every aspect of Tootsie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman in Drag.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tootsie (1982): Dir: Sydney Pollack / Cast: Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Bill Murray: Easily the best male in drag film since Some Like It Hot. Dustin Hoffman plays struggling stage actor Micheal Dorsey whose difficult reputation has him losing acting opportunities. To prove his value to his agent he accepts a part in a hospital soap opera but the catch being that he shows up in drag as Dorothy Michaels and wins over everyone with her direct attitude. Trouble is that Dorothy is a hit on the soap leading to all sorts of amusing dilemmas. Director Sydney Pollack delivers a film that showcases the genders in the work place as seen from the opposite perspective. Hoffman is brilliant going from struggling actor to someone whose suddenly popular despite co-worker not knowing that Dorothy is really a male. He often wings his scenes and also deals with two suitors, one being an older co-star while the other is the father of his co-star Julie. As played by Jessica Lange she is a single mother dealing with a low level relationship with the sexist egotistical director, played by Dabney Coleman. Teri Garr plays an acting student confused with regards to her relationship with Michael. Bill Murray plays Michael's roommate and fellow actor looking to get a play going. Hoffman's transformation into Dorothy is convincing thus mirroring the pains and gains of womanhood. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny heartfelt film that proves one will go to extreme measures for success, while still remaining the same underneath.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1982's "Tootsie" is one film as you watch you laugh and are entertained all at the same time while your emotions are touched as you see what a person will do to gain some success in dire moments when push comes to shove one will even take a gender identity transformation! The cast rounds out well too as the chemistry on screen between the characters is what makes the film go, as director Sydney Pollack moves the film along just fine while trying to show the inner conflict of the central character Michael Dorsey.Anyway the story involves one Michael Dorsey(Dustin Hoffman one of the best actors of all-time)who's in New York city and all of a sudden he's hit a bump in his acting life he can no longer find any work no one will take him no roles are left he even struggles to find work in commercials so maybe it's back to the stage for him. His only side life aside from still trying for auditions is living with his roommate Jeff(in a early turn from Bill Murray)and on occasion he has one night stands with a fellow actress named Sandy(Teri Garr). So you guessed it Michael decides to disguise himself as a woman to land some work! And it works he gets what he takes or should I say that Dorothy takes her new part on a trashy hospital soap and his audition did impress director Ron(Dabney Coleman) and slowly but surely Dorothy/Michael finds new fame as his role takes off making the show a hit and it gives his acting work new life again! And along the way a relationship is formed with an onset actress named Julie(in a strong performance from Jessica Lange)who's a single mother only in the end truth is revealed between the two and love and understanding is reached. Also look for a good supporting turn from a young Gina Davis as a sexy actress named April who spices up the set with Julie and Dorothy.Thru it all this film proves that even though one changes identity still it doesn't change what's inside of you deep down and that what's is in one's heart matters most as still even though one may wear a mask they feel and love the same and still bring affection to others. Overall beautiful film that's funny and heartfelt and the Stephen Bishop song "All of my Life: "I've Been Waiting For You" played during the film moves the picture along so nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gender pretzel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gender bending is always a good method for getting comedy laughs. It's tried and true with such examples as Katherine Hepburn in boy drag in Sylvia Scarlett and Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as female musicians in Some Like It Hot. It's also lent itself to horrific tragedy as in Boys Don't Cry. The serious part is more and more as the transgender community has spun out of the LGBT community with their own identity and issues. Still comedy can teach us some great lessons about love and who you love can be packaged any way you find attractive.Tootsie gained Dustin Hoffman a nomination for Best Actor and won for Jessica Lange a Best Supporting Actress Award as the woman who hates him as a man, but loves his warm and matronly woman.Hoffman is one of that large group people in New York, struggling actors. In his own God given gender he can't get work and when he does inevitably blows the job up. But one day, desperate for a job he dons drag and becomes a regular on a soap opera in the role of a new cast member as a hospital administrator. Some of the creative changes he brings to the part frustrate people like director Dabney Coleman, but give the show its greatest boost in popularity. He also turns Jessica Lange into a real soul mate. Hoffman is nothing short of marvelous in the part. So deep does he go into the role you forget he's both a man and Dustin Hoffman. Lange who was also nominated for Frances that year in the Best Actress category did well with the part that got her the accolade of her peers. I also liked Charles Durning as Lange's father who gets his old mojo going when Hoffman's around in drag.With transgender civil rights now an issue Tootsie has a lot of a good if subtle things to say and say entertainingly. Not to be missed if shown or broadcast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) is a perfectionist New York actor and teacher. He's a waiter with his best friend playwright roommate Jeff Slater (Bill Murray). He trains his student Sandy Lester (Teri Garr) for a soap opera audition but they won't even let her read. He's not getting the roles. His agent George Fields (Sydney Pollack) tells him that nobody wants to work with him because he's too difficult. In desperation, he cross-dresses and auditions as Dorothy Michaels to raise $8k to put on Slater's play. He clashes with the womanizing director Ron Carlisle (Dabney Coleman). He is put into a dressing room with the statuette April (Geena Davis). The sweet star Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange) finds a new confidant. Cast member John Van Horn and Julie's widowed father Les (Charles Durning) fall for Dorothy.The most important aspect of this movie is that it's funny. It has some really big laughs. It is absurd but it's never illogical. It takes on some social issues but it never gets bogged down by them. It's a relationship movie that could have gone off the rails. Instead, it hits all the sweet spots with a touching turn from Lange. The majority of the praise has to be for Hoffman but there is plenty for everybody in the cast. Bill Murray does deadpan humor in this one and he's hilarious. There are too many great performances to list. This is not just a comedy classic but an iconic movie.</fullReview>

The acting is excellent and it's quirky and genuinely funny in all the right places. It's easy to understand why it has earned a reputation as one of the all time classic comedies. Dustin Hoffman plays the main role perfectly and Bill Murray is a suitably witty co star. I never knew he was in this movie and didn't realise he was acting in movies as early as 1982.On a slightly negative note it does take a bit to get going and the cinematography isn't brilliant. Most of the film is obviously filmed in a studio and it did seem a bit low budget at times.But overall this is a belter of a movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>83's big hit comedy surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Birdman, if you're an actor, or more correctly, an out of work actor, you'll truly identify with this movie. Straight down the line, Tootsie is constructed brilliantly. I loved this movie, ever since I saw it, when verging on 13. Hoffman, an actor's actor, is wonderful, parading as an old woman on a soap, called Mass General. His character, Michael Dorsey, is an out of work actor, desperate for work. And why? Cause he's a difficult actor. No one will work with him. He had even argued over a tomato, having feelings. Hey, I've been there where Michael was, but luckily, on a much smaller degree. Michael is a good actor, where in a very smart opening of shots, we see the pitfalls of going to auditions. "You're too tall, you're not exactly what we're looking for". Never more true. The wonderful, and beautifully crafted script, the writer has really honed in here on what it's like, and what it takes if you really wanna crack it. To make matters worse, Michael has of course, fallen in love with a co actress, Julie (Lang, wonderful of course) so of course, you're waiting for the fireworks, to inevitably ensue, and it's a killer comic moment. As shown in Mrs Doubtfire that came out a decade later, complications arise and as Hoffman's roommate, Bill Murray is a hoot, playing it deadpan, in wonderful Murray style, while Dabney Coleman, as the sleazy smooth director, doing every woman on the show is great. Although it doesn't have the best of endings, Tootsie is an honor to watch, where Dorothy's wine red glitzy dress, and that march pose, has created another legendary character. Seeing Geena Davis in bra and panties is truly an honor as well. Excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes it's hard to be a woman, such as when you're really a man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an utterly hilarious, side-splitting comedy which skilfully combines farce, social commentary and genuinely emotional scenes. It has an incredible script by Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal based on a story by Gelbart and Don McGuire while Sydney Pollack's direction is more than up to the task. The film crackles with wit and there was seldom a moment when I was neither laughing out loud nor grinning from ear to ear. It was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar but it lost to "Gandhi". While "Gandhi" is a wonderful film and Richard Attenborough is my favourite director of all time, I think that this is the better film.The film stars Dustin Hoffman in two absolutely fantastic performances as Michael Dorsey and his alter ego Dorothy Michaels. Michael is a serious, thoughtful and extremely talented actor but he is an unrelenting perfectionist with a tendency to rub people up the wrong way, meaning that he is basically persona non grata in both New York and LA. As such, he is in desperate need of cash, with which he will finance his friend and roommate Jeff Slater's play which will also serve as an acting vehicle for himself. In his desperate search for employment, he takes a rather avant-garde approach and disguises himself as a woman to audition for the role of Emily Kimberley in the trashy soap...sorry, daytime drama "Southwest General", a thinly veiled version of "General Hospital" and other shows of the same ilk. Rather than simply adding another dippy female character to a show that is already full of them, Michael plays Emily as an assertive, strong- willed and capable professional who happens to be a woman. The character takes the TV world by storm and the show's ratings and popularity increase considerably. Much of the credit for the film's success has to go to Hoffman since he plays Dorothy as if he really were a woman rather than sending it up and winking to the audience as if to say, "I know I'm a man and so do you." Instead, his attitude was clearly, "I believe that I am a woman and so should you," which was the perfect attitude for the material. Consistent with Michael's seriousness about his chosen profession, Hoffman is careful to give Michael and Dorothy very different personas and it is very appropriate that he was credited separately as both characters in the end credits. The stark contrast between the two is helped by the fact that Michael's speaking voice is naturally very deep but he uses a high, lilting Southern accent for Dorothy. It is easy to see why no one suspects that Dorothy is actually a man in drag.As Dorothy, Michael gets to experience first hand some of the crap that women have to put up with. He is routinely subjected to the sexist condescension of the show's director, a sleazy, obnoxious lothario named Ron Carlisle, played by a perfectly cast Dabney Coleman. The scenes in which Dorothy puts him in his place are a joy to behold. Jessica Lange, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, is brilliant as the sweet, kind Julie Nichols. She is dating Ron and he habitually mistreats her, not physically but emotionally by lying to her, degrading her in public or neglecting her. The soap's new star becomes Julie's trusted friend and confidante as Dorothy but gradually falls in love with her as Michael. She tells him things that she would never say to him if she knew that he was a man. Between these experiences, Michael gains a new insight into womankind and women's relationships with men. Consequently, he starts to feel extremely guilty about leading on his neurotic, emotionally vulnerable friend Sandy Lester, played very well by Teri Garr. Hoffman does an excellent job at playing Michael's attempt to hide his feelings for Julie. He communicates a great deal through his eyes, particularly during the dinner table scene at the farm. Michael's relationship with Julie forms the bedrock of the film and there were many very touching moments between them. After she learns the truth about him, Michael says to Julie, "I was a better man with you as a woman than I ever was with a woman as a man." That sums it up very well.In two incredibly funny subplots, one of which receives far more attention than the other, Michael is the object of two men's affections: Julie's equally sweet, old-fashioned father Les and the soap's resident hack / old lech John Van Horn. At one point, Les even proposes to Dorothy and Michael is guilt-stricken. After he returns home, things gets even more complicated and uncomfortable when John throws himself all over Dorothy. Charles Durning and George Gaynes, who play Les and John respectively, are both wonderful character actors and their scenes with Hoffman hit all of the right notes. Michael's discomfort is never less than hilarious. As Jeff, Bill Murray has most of the best lines which did not go to the star and he delivers them in his priceless deadpan manner. The film also features strong performances from its director (making his first major acting appearance since his film debut "War Hunt" 20 years earlier) as Michael's unfortunate agent George Fields, Doris Belack as the soap's producer Rita Marshall and a very young Geena Davis as Michael and Julie's co-star April Page.Overall, this is easily one of the ten funniest films that I have seen in my life. My throat is still a little sore from laughing so hard at it. It also has some very interesting things to say about the way that men and women interact and the casual sexism that unfortunately still exists in society.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film with Hoffman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really thought Dustin Hoffman looked absolutely spot on dressing up as a drag! He actually did look like a woman with a deep voice, you would be mistaken so easily for his alter ego! I say the Drag queen community would have love to see him wear his woman clothes and that way, he would party with them lol! I honestly never knew Bill Murray was his roommate! He really didn't have enough scene's in this film and I think he was still in "Saturday Night Live" at the time. I would've loved to have seen him more in the movie, he is just such a legend to be left out! I even liked the movie soundtrack, I remember hearing the song "It might Be You" at my first horrible year in secondary school. It's a good song though!It's a really enjoyable film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply the best cross-dressing movie of all-time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With no disrespect for the classic, "Some Like It Hot", I love "Tootsie" even more. While "Some Like It Hot" was designed for laughs and had Billy Wilder at the helm of a fantastic movie, "Tootsie" was a comedy set in real-life situations without the intention of getting a cheap laugh at anyone's expense. It's still marvelous these many decades later.In today's movies, cross-dressing has become a punch line. It has become so time-worn that if the character isn't flaming gay, people don't "get" the character. That's why this movie has been all but forgotten for the ground-breaking skill and imagination it took for a very straight Dustin Hoffman to inhabit the body and female persona of "Dorothy Michaels". The desperation he portrayed on screen is as real as it gets for out-of-work actors in that profession. He was willing to do ANYTHING for a role. He knocked it out of the park. For those of you too young to have seen the periodicals of the day, Hoffman was borderline nominated for an Academy Award in BOTH the Best Actor AND Best Actress category. He was simply that special. Some people believed voters were confused as to whether to vote him in as Best Actor or write him in as Best Actress. He was that compelling. The fact he lost to Ben Kingsley for "Gandhi" and was nominated with the likes of Jack Lemmon, Paul Newman, &amp; Peter O'Toole tells you just how competitive a field with which he was competing.This movie is special not because of how funny it is. It is special because while they were making this cross-gender story, the entire cast and crew treated the subject matter with grace, class and seriousness. Director Sidney Pollack makes a point in his retrospective on the DVD of how there wasn't a single laugh on the entire set during the shooting. The only laughs they heard where once the movie was screened for a live audience.Dustin Hoffman plays both characters of Michael Dorsey and Dorothy Michaels with such passion, energy and honesty, you would never know it wasn't the real Hoffman out there on screen. In reading about this movie, I understood Hoffman even started relating to women more on an honestly level than superficially as he had done his entire life up to the making of this movie. When you have an actor who tells us that before the movie was made, he wouldn't have spoken to the woman/character he portrayed simply because he/she wasn't pretty enough and that he regretted not speaking to other non-attractive women who were interesting people... It tells you this character touched his soul. Plus you have one of the most accomplished supporting casts in recent history. Teri Garr (Oscar-nominated for this role), Jessica Lange (Oscar-winner for this role), Bill Murray, Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, George Gaynes, Geena Davis (her first role), Estelle Getty (in cameo before she was famous), Sidney Pollack as the agent... Simply "WOW!!!" casting. The payoff at the end of the movie with each and every character getting their own reaction on film is a revelation in movie direction. Pollack deserved more than just a nomination for this masterwork.There's nothing about the movie that isn't stated in the reviews on this site. The clothes, hairstyles and music may be a bit dated now since it's original 1982 date. However, the concept and the frustrations/humor/flawless execution are as pertinent today as they ever were. If you haven't watched it, please do. You won't be sorry. And if you are like me and have watched it more times than you can count, please stand with me for my standing ovation for a true classic movie. This one is near-perfection. Easily 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eighties Feminism = Gender Confusion &amp; Homosexual Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tootsie, like Shakespeare's comedy Twelfth Night, explores the nature of attraction between people of the same and of different sexes. The film was produced in the early eighties when the feminist movement had already challenged and changed many institutions, rapidly closing the gender discrepancy in the work force. Because of this supposed sexual equality, viewers' attention focused on relationships between the sexes. Tootsie is concerned with the impact of fluid gender identity on relationships. If there is no meaningful distinction between the sexes, than there exists a threat of homosexual relationships to disrupt the social order.By the eighties, gender roles were increasingly bleeding together with the advent of feminism. Whereas the challenge in Shakespeare's time was to eliminate gender distinctions subordinating women, the challenge in the eighties was to create gender distinctions in order to define the social boundaries of acceptable attraction. Without distinctions between the sexes, heterosexual marriage could not be maintained.Dorothy's female gender increasingly becomes an internalized part of Michael's identity. After he makes the transformation, he becomes absorbed in female shopping, shows concern about his hips, and develops an emotional female-logic on set. He displays a nurturing aspect of his personality when watching Julie's baby, and stroking Julie's head at night. He proudly tells his agent, "I am Dorothy. Dorothy is me. Those lines are coming from me. It is the woman in me." He has integrated the two personas and balanced them within himself, even as Julie balances her independence and career with her family life, as a man would. Since gender affects actions and speech, it is logical to conclude it also affects desire.Dorothy attracts both men and women by her gendered identity. Julie reveals that since she has known Dorothy, she has never been lonelier in her life. It is like she wants something she knows she cannot have. Yet, as a woman, Julie cannot accept Dorothy's advances though she admits to having the same impulses. She claims not to be "liberated" enough. She loves Dorothy, but she cannot let herself love her because of societal concerns. Meanwhile, her father Les pops the question after a brief interlude, having never even kissed Dorothy. The homosexual desire Dorothy creates in both Julie and her father are entirely based on perceived gender. Julie is not attracted to Michael when he approaches her at a party, and Les makes very clear by his embarrassment at the bar that he would not have been interested if he knew Dorothy was a man. There is no real resolution to the gender confusion in Tootsie. Because Michael has integrated both his masculine and feminine personas in one person, there can be no clear distinction that will create a socially approved attraction.Julie punches Michael after he comes out on-camera about his true identity. Instead of being relieved that the object of her affection turns out to be marriageable, Julie disregards the intrinsic value she saw in Dorothy when she is no longer a woman. She valued Dorothy as a woman confidant and maternal figure, and her dislike of Michael is similarly based on his sex. The fact that his person integrated the two gender roles makes it impossible for the ending to be satisfying. Any future relationship would be a challenge to societal conventions because it is a woman Julie fell in love with, and a woman that Michael must prove himself to be in order for them to even walk down the street together. The film leaves the homosexual nature of their relations unsettled. The ending begs for gender distinctions so such confusion will not occur again.The film explicitly tries to depict what it means to be a woman opposed to what it means to be a man. As a woman, Dorothy has to field offers and fend off attacks. As a man, Michael is deceptive and inconsiderate of Sandy. He reveals that he must play a woman to be a full man, and for this integration he is almost raped as punishment. Les states the film's general standpoint quite clearly in his tirade against feminism. He thinks that women want to be entitled to be men, and sees feminism as an attempt for one sex to imitate the other so we can all be equal. He feels that men should be men and women should be women. There is a need for a distinction.Often what is more revealing than what is being challenged is the way in which it is presented. In Tootsie, despite supposed female equality, Dorothy almost does not get her role on the show because the director believes that power makes a woman masculine. Ironically, apparently so does the director of this film! Julie and Sandy allow themselves to be taken advantage of, while Dorothy (who is really a man) is the only woman able to defend herself. Even in this time of equality, it is interesting to see that women are still portrayed as weak. The only strong woman is a man, and her contract is extended because she is the only woman who asserts her character without detracting from another's. This detail sets up a gender distinction very derogatory towards women and reveals the way men felt threatened by the feminist movement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Film!!! Funny, Intelligent and Full of Heart. (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tootsie is a wonderfully told story about Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman), a twenty-year down on his luck perfectionist, self serving, struggling actor who is told in no uncertain terms by his agent that he will never work as an actor in either New York City or in Hollywood again, so he decides to dress up as a woman named Dorothy Michaels and auditions for a hit soap opera and gets the job. Now he must maintain the facade for as long as he is under contract and risk alienating himself from the many friends he has who he must keep the secret from, and the new people he has now developed personal relationships with as Dorothy on the set, including his pretty and talented co-star who he has fallen deeply in love with.Michael Dorsey is a deeply complex character. To quote him, "He busts his ass to get every audition right", but in the process he has become that "difficult actor" that directors don't wish to work with. Michael hasn't worked on a paid acting gig in a couple years, so to make ends meet he teaches an acting class, waiters at a local restaurant, and does free theater. He has celebrated a birthday and seeing himself get older and not achieve the success he thought he would have attained by now has left him feeling inadequate. He is selfish even if he insists that he never does his acting work for the great reviews. His next great venture is to get his roommate's play produced for eight thousand dollars for him and his best friend, Sandy, to star in. Michael is desperate which lends to the credibility that he would go to any lengths to book a gig and make some money. Even so far as to secretly dress up like a woman and work on a soap opera.The only two people in on Michael's secret are his quirky roommate, Jeff, (Bill Murrary) who prefers people not like his play, but rather question "What happened?", and his overworked agent (Sydney Pollack) who insists that Michael seek some therapy. Sandy (Teri Garr) is an actress and Michael's best friend of six years who has her own deep seeded issues of inadequacy and insecurity. All the while longing for acceptance and insisting she receive her pain and rejection from her male lovers upfront rather than prolong the agony over a period of time. Due to some mitigating circumstances that leaves Michael caught red handed trying on some of Sandy's dresses, he lies and says he wants her sexually and she agrees. Michael never tells Sandy about him dressing up as a woman to work on a soap opera because she was up for the same exact role and was told she wasn't right for it, thus complicating the lies Michael has to make up to not see her because of his busy soap opera schedule.Dorothy Michaels is Michael's female alter ego. The talented actor that Michael is allows him to portray Dorothy with a sweet southern charm and personality, but the man that Michael is gives Dorothy a male foundation which comes across as a strong, take no nonsense kind of woman who speaks her mind. To the surprise of everyone, including Michael, Dorothy Michaels becomes a huge soap star that receives thousands of fan mail per week. Dorothy's persona positively intrigues Rita, the soap's main executive producer and befuddles Ron (Dabnet Coleman), the show's womanizing director who doesn't understand why Dorothy is not only immune to his charms, but also doesn't like him.Julie (Jessica Lange) is the talented, gorgeous single mom and the soap opera's biggest star who becomes Dorothy's best friend and confidant. She is dating Ron much to Michael's dismay, who witnesses how sexist and disrespectful Ron is towards Julie and every woman on set, much like how Michael is in his real life. All Michael/Dorothy can do is be a friend and keep giving good advice to Julie about being a strong woman who stands up for herself, and in the process Michael falls in love with Julie. To further complicate matters, Julie's dad, Les, (Charles Durning) has developed an infatuation with Dorothy after a few meetings together and proposes marriage.During this entire process, Michael has developed a deep level of guilt at the continuous lies he is forced to commit knowing that the truth of who he is will eventually come out hurting a lot of people who trusted and cared for him. He has also learned that the man he once was wasn't always the nicest or best person to be with especially around women. In a rather fortuitous and desperate attempt at making amends, Michael/Dorothy is forced to perform a soap scene live in front of the camera for the world to see and decides to disrobe and let the truth be known to all that he is not a woman, but in fact a man.In conclusion, Tootsie is one of those laugh out loud, touching, moving and human films that is easy to connect with and leaves you wanting to know more as the movie progresses. Everyone who got to know and interact with the Dorothy persona has become a better person including Michael. The once sad and selfish character that Michael is in the beginning of the film has become this deeper, likable and more human character by films end. One can't help but feel good that Michael and Julie do wind up together in the end because the Michael of old one would figure would have somehow ruined the relationship, while this new humbled and experienced Michael has the great potential to have a long lasting loving relationship with Julie.Tootsie stands the test of time and continues to be relevant and funny today as it was back when it first premiered in the early 1980's. Highly recommend!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful and intelligent comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When most people think of this film, they would probably think of something much like Mrs. Doubtfire with lots of slapstick and Dustin Hoffman running around in a dress. That's not what I got out of this film.What I saw was a well-layered, well-acted and well directed comedy. I'm a high Dustin Hoffman fan and he didn't disappoint in this film. Hoffman plays a struggling actor who can't seem to stay employed because he's just not the right fit for the part or in some cases, is just too difficult to work with, and in order to win a part on a TV show, he dresses up as a woman and starting winning fans. While he finds it great to be have a regular acting job, Dustin's personal life is put to the test. He isolates his girlfriend (Terri Garr), is made fun of by his roommate (Bill Murray), and falls for one of his co-stars (Jessica Lang) who can't find out who he is or his career is finished. Things get even more interesting when a older man puts the moves on him.Like I stated before, this film is well-casted and man, is it fantastic! It seems that in every scene in the movie is a contest to see who can steal the scene. Bill Murray really got me laughing with the improvised lines, but the topping on this comical sundae is Dustin Hoffman as the lead. Man, oh man does he shine in this film! While Mrs. Doubtfire is a hilarious film and can be touching at times, I think Tootsie is head and shoulders above it because the movie doesn't make use of any of the humor that Doubtfire does and it holds back in the feminism section very well.It really does anger me that Dustin Hoffman didn't win an Oscar for his role in Tootsie, because he definitely deserved it. Ben Kingsley is a good actor, but Hoffman's performance is this film beats Kingsley's role in Gandhi any day of the week. This is a 10 out of 10 movie. Go see it if you haven't already. You'll love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do Midnight Cowboy, Kramer vs Kramer and the Graduate have in common, if you don't know already because you haven't seen any of those films, and then you my friend are in bad need of Netflix, otherwise as you are going to go through life always feeling like that there is a small part of you missing. What those films all have in common is the fantastic, electrifying and unpredictable acting juggernaut that is Dustin Hoffman. Claiming to love cinema and at the same time not having seen a Hoffman film, would be like going to Disney land and not seeing Mickey Mouse or meeting the President of America and not asking him if area 51 exits, because it simply means you're missing put on the best part! The multitalented Sydney Pollack (Out of Africa) directs this transvestite-tastic comedy caper about a talented actor called Michael (Dustin Hoffman) who lives in new York, but despite his years of experience still can't land a gig because he thinks he knows better than everyone else, so one day to boost his chances of success he decides to adopts an identity as a women to gain a role in a local TV soap opera, oh damn I mean day time drama, going by the name of Dorothy, much to the bemusement of his house mate Jeff (Bill Murray) and his agent George (Sidney Pollack). Things start of great, Dorothy proves to be an instant hit on the show; she is loud, confident and vivacious, much to enjoyment of all the female fans of the show, whilst being to the annoyance of her womanising director Ron. But things quickly get a whole lot more complicated as a massive love triangle, with his fellow cast members and best friend soon manifests itself with the potential of creating a lot of broken hearts. Clearly in the same mould as Some Like it Hot, where cross dressing is involved, but while SLH nailed the love triangles with such humorous precision, I felt the ones in Tootsie were far too complicated and drawn out as if the writers ran out of material and used them as filler for dead space. I also didn't like how the most entertaining characters were marginalised, they had a great comedic weapon in Bill Murray yet they refused to exploit for all its laugh inducing potential and I would have preferred to have seen a whole lot more of Sandy. Ultimately I felt the film was just another imitator of SLH, although competent in its own right, it just didn't give you anything fresh and unique. Not the best of Hoffman's CV, but certainly way above the worst (cough, cough Meet the Fockers and Runaway Jury)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Special Film (in its time)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time I watched Tootsie (early in 2012) I actually came away from the experience feeling a little depressed. No specific scene got me down this time, nor did the behavior or personality of any character. No particular performance disappointed me either. In my eyes the story remained the same. My reaction to Tootsie, however, had definitely changed.I gave Tootsie a high rating based on the effect the movie had on me the first time I saw it within a few months of its release. The various characters in supporting roles delivered clever lines naturally, Dustin Hoffman played a difficult part convincingly, and the writers presented social issues intelligently. Tootsie received awards and deserved them.Older movies don't show their age all at once. As a story about actors and acting, television production and direction, scripts and improvisation, Tootsie has not lost any appeal. As a story about romance, it hasn't become entirely dated either. Because the nature of relationships (despite the communication afforded by cell phones and computers) between men and women has evolved little since Tootsie -- many men still pursue women for sex, and women live to regret their choices -- Sandy's (Terri Garr) overly accommodating approach and frustrations regarding Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) and Ron's (Dabney Coleman) macho style in his less than ethical romance with Julie (Jessica Lange) remain relevant. Michael Dorsey's astute words at the end of the film, in fact, when he tells Julie in a final effort to win her over that he knows much better now how to treat women because he has lived as one, still sound profound.I don't consider women's struggles to gain understanding and respect from men, whether in social, professional, or political settings, then, as an issue that has had its time, but I do think that humorous films that feature men who carry on double lives by dressing and conducting themselves as women have lost much of their power to suspend disbelief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman's best comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film follows the struggling actor Michael Dorsey played by Dustin Hoffman as he tries to seek an acting job but finds it difficult to find because of his "know it all" mentality. After being shot down on several casting calls he takes his girlfriend Sandy played by Terri Garr to an interview for a new daytime soap opera. After coaching her unsuccessfully he comes up with the brilliant idea to change his identity to a woman and try out for the role himself. He lands the job and quickly becomes one of the more popular characters on the show. Unknown by the rest of his coworkers, girlfriend, and agent, he continues this charade of being a woman even off of the stage. He quickly becomes attracted to one of his cast mates, Julie, played by Jessica Lange and several awkward moments occur thereafter.This comedy was excellently done and is one of director Sydney Pollack's triumphs. The movie does a good job of exploring what could happen when one person tries to become someone else, and the lives that could effect in the process. The film does a good job doing this while not taking itself too seriously. This is probably Hoffman's best comedy. It reminds me of some of the funnier parts in the Meet the Parents film he did.This picture is at times essentially a play within a play at times. When Hoffman is on stage as Dorothy all attempts have to be made by the film crew to make her not look to "manly." Makeup artists also comment on the "five o'clock shadow" that Dorothy has. These are just a few little things done that add to the comedy in this film.The film finishes with everyone being surprised at Hoffman's double life. The "coming out" of Hoffman helps him realize some of his priorities. Even though he did a lot of good things, and gave out great advice as Dorothy, his priorities were neglected as Michael. He mends old friendships and makes new ones as himself. The soap opera gets enormous ratings as a hilarious plot twist occurs, unknown to the cast mates, producers and director. In the end everything works out for everyone involved, as Michael turns this situation into one of the more funny moments I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Academy Award nominated "Tootsie," stars Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Bill Murray, and Geena Davis. It's directed by Sydney Pollack with the screenplay written by Murray Schisgal. It is an upbeat, gender-bending romantic comedy that is as fun to watch the 3rd time as the 1st. Nominated for 9 Academy Awards, and winning one for Jessica Lange as Best Supporting Actress, the film is most notably remembered for Dustin Hoffman's outstanding portrayal of Dorthy Michaels, a conservative, masculine looking woman whose no-nonsense approach to life and female discrimination are an inspiration to all women. Much like Robin William's Mrs Doubtfire, Dustin Hoffman's Dorothy, is a character who comes to life out of necessity. Michael Dorsey, (Dustin Hoffman), is an actor with a bad reputation for being exceedingly difficult to work with. Unable to obtain and keep an acting job, he is forced to wait tables and teach acting to others. Viewed as a challenge because his agent tells him he will never be hired as an actor again, Dorsey decides to disguise himself as a woman and auditions and lands a role on a soap opera. Michael's adds her own spin on the hospital-based soap script and takes this tired show to new heights. Dorothy Michael's rise to fame is almost instantaneous. Her character portrays a liberated women who is strong and independent which makes her a quick hit with women dedicated to the soap. Dorsey takes turns being a mother to some, confessor to others, best friend, and object of lust. Dorothy and Julie Nichols (Jessica Lange), who plays a nurse on the soap, become fast friends. Julie looks at Dorothy as an inspiration and comes to her for advise and support, while Dorsey's feelings for her continue to grow. Dorothy is courted by Julie's father and in fact is presented with a marriage proposal. Julie admits she has feelings for Dorothy, that she can't quite understand, and wants to break off the friendship as she feels her feelings for her/him are wrong. Dorsey realizes he can no longer play this charade and outs himself on a live filming of the soap. He confesses to Julie "I was a better man with you, as a woman... than I ever was with a woman, as a man." Julie misses Dorothy and decides that she sees Dorothy in Micheal and agrees to a second chance. Dustin Hoffman gives a priceless performance. Tootsie is a funny, well-done, entertaining movie, definitely a must see!! The cast and script work together in perfect harmony and certain to be enjoyable for anyone who loves romantic comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All men aren't created equal, either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When did the "age of feminist political correctness in cinema" begin? I don't know but before "Tootsie", apparently. One of the most honest exchanges happens between Ron and Dorothy which might have ended differently if Dorothy/Michael hadn't been dressed as a woman and hadn't been in love with Julie: Ron: Look at it from my side. See, if a woman wants me to seduce her, well, I usually do. But then she starts pretending like I promised her something- then I start pretending like I promised her something but, in the end, I'm the one that's exploited. Is truth a question of character-likability? If an ass speaks the truth does that make the truth untrue? Answer: No. Ron is speaking TRUTH here.Dorothy: Bullshit, Ron.Except that it isn't. In the deleted "Chicken Soup" scene, we see the same dynamic repeated with Teri Garr as the exploited victim and Michael as the exploiter. The idea is that they had sex and now Michael owes her a relationship. Why didn't Michael say "it was just sex"? Because if he did, he might have lost a friend over it. Should he have been honest RIGHT AFTER SEX and said "it was just sex"? Yes, but Sandy places the burden of that statement on him when Sandy could have made it just as easily herself. Typically, she's putting the burden on him to be honest because honesty is difficult. If it was easy, everyone would do it.Because why DOES Julie date Ron? He's a dick, he's insensitive, he's not sexy. Why is she seeing him? Why date a dick? If she's not exploiting him because she thinks he has power/$$, why IS she with him? Because she's lonely? Fear of commitment? Job security? Opportunism? Stupidity? Someone to help support her kid? Yes, she's exploiting him and he knows it.At the cornball end of this pleasant film, Michael begs Julie to forgive him and she relents after making him beg a little. Boring. He's kissing her ass but more on that later.The other aspect of this film that I didn't love was Dustin's revelations about women. The only revelations he was entitled to were those pertaining to what it was like to be an ugly woman. Gina Davis and Jessica Lange are sexy women who have the power that go with that. Dorothy wasn't sexy so she had to find her power in a more honest place. Also, if it's a lot of work for women to be sexy, it's 72 times harder for a man pretending to be a woman to pull it off, so Dustin's appraisals weren't relevant there, either.Julie's problem in the film is that Dorothy is teaching her to be honest and not take the easy path of dating a bastard. What do you call a woman who dates a bastard because he has power? I don't know but the answer isn't "a victim" unless she's the victim of her own exploitation as Ron suggests. That, while she's exploiting Ron, she's also exploiting herself.Bill Murray is at his casual, comic best in this film with everything coming out of his mouth beautifully and easily. Not as easy as it looks, I bet.Teri Garr is sexy, cute and conflicted and my favorite exchange is when she's going in to audition and says to Michael, who is there to enrage her, "wish me luck" and he responds "fuck you" like the excellent actor/enrager friend he is. He's not there to kiss her ass and wipe her tears, he's there to get her to a place where she can be an adult and not a whining baby/wannabe.That's the kind of scene I like to see, the kind without a lot of counter-productive ass-kissing.Charles Durning had a great and important line re: feminism that I'm too lazy to verify, to the end that "all men aren't equal either" which is in direct contradiction to the preamble to the Constitution. Too bad it happens to be true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the good fortune of revisiting this film recently and I had forgotten a lot of the detail. Suffice to say it is a water tight and flawless script, the pace of comedy and emerging anxst is perfectly timed. The story involves Hoffman as a good but "difficult" actor, struggling to find work and love in the Big Apple. His success rate at both tasks is becoming evermore elusive and impossible. After a disaster of a Birthday Party in which his dilemmas are acutely focused, he consoles himself by helping a struggling female friend and actor, to prepare for an audition; the part of a hospital soap matriarch. When the friend fails to get the part the idea to try himself as herself emerges. Truly brilliant themes are comedically explored, sexual politics, self identity and exploration and the equality of the difficulties of being either male or female emerge. Made all the more powerful by it's lead performances, Hoffman and Lang are outstanding, the film is also strengthened by having being made in the 80's; the ultimate sexual politics era! A must see, you'll miss "Dorothy" just like Lang does!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-written story overcomes very bad disguise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I see a man pretending to be a woman in a movie or vice-versa, I can't stop thinking "are you kidding me?" Whether it's Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in "Some Like It Hot" or Greta Garbo in "Queen Christina," I just can't accept that people around them are fooled by very bad disguises."Tootsie" is no different. Dustin Hoffman was superb as Michael Dorsey, but he was just not credible as Dorothy Michaels. "Dorothy" just doesn't look, talk, nor dress like any woman I've ever seen.Besides, Dorsey ? like the Curtis, Lemmon and Garbo characters ? acts stupid. You'd think he'd breathe a sigh of relief after each work day that he wasn't unmasked. Instead, he dramatically increases his chances of getting caught by spending a weekend as a woman with Jessica Lange's Julie Nichols character, not inventing a boyfriend so men won't pursue him/her, and stunningly, uttering a pickup line as Dorsey to Nichols that Nichols told Michaels she wanted to hear.Nichols was beyond dumb not to realize Michaels was Dorsey. Even their names were very similar. And how could no one working for the soap opera he/she acted on nor the magazine and TV reporters who interviewed him/her not be suspicious of a middle-aged person with no proof of a pre-soap opera life?Given my history of cynicism, though, I have to accept that I will never find cross-dressing disguises credible and judge "Tootsie" by other criteria, including its many funny scenes. The best laughs occur while Dorsey is talking to his roommate (played by Bill Murray) or his agent (played by Sydney Pollack). Murray and Pollack, the movie's director, are superb.The best thing about "Tootsie," though, is that its well-written script has a lot of heart. While pretending to be a woman, Dorsey inspires other women on the soap opera to be more assertive and less accepting of misogynistic behavior by standing up to men and he transforms his TV character into someone who inspires females around the U.S. to become more independent. Being treated as an inferior as Michaels also gives Dorsey a new perspective that makes him more respectful toward women.Dorsey also exhibits heart by choosing friends over wealth. He only wants to make enough money in TV to ensure that a play written by Murray will be produced and give a financially struggling friend played by Teri Garr a co-starring role. Thus, Dorsey wants to leave the soap opera although it could make him rich.The story also sets up a lot of interesting character conflicts, including an overall man vs. woman conflict. Since Dorsey is both, his internal battle as he pursues a woman as a man, spurns two men as a woman, wrestles with how to treat Garr as she pursues a relationship with him that he is not interested in, and hides his identity while dressed as a woman is the most compelling conflict.The conflict between a macho director played by Dabney Coleman and Michaels is probably the most interesting external conflict, but there are several other examples of women challenging men. The conflicts lure viewers deeper into the story and make us more interested in what happens to Hoffman, Lange, Coleman, Murray, Garr, and Charles Durning, who plays Lange's father.If I had seen a movie where a man credibly posed as a woman, I would harshly penalize "Tootsie" in my rating. I haven't so I will have to focus on the fact that the story, dialogue, comedy, acting, and character conflicts are almost good enough to give "Tootsie" a 9.I deducted one point because Dorsey should have been smarter around Nichols, she should have been more suspicious about Michaels, and the climactic speech was way too convoluted. I gave "Tootsie" an 8. ZWrite</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1982 was the year of E.T. in the box office world but in the Oscar world it was Gandhi.....while I really like both of these movies, I found Tootsie to be the best film of 1982.Everything about it was top notch!! Dustin Hoffman gives one of his best performances as Michael/Dorothy and he was def. Oscar worthy but he was overshadowed by the powerful Ben Kingsley who did deserve his Oscar IMO.Jessica Lange was good but there was no way she deserved her Oscar win. She indirectly won for Frances and in the process left her Tootsie co-star Teri Garr along with Glenn Close out in the cold.The screenplay and "It Might Be You" deserved wins as well.This is a very smart and witty romcom that I love to death!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is awesome!! At first it seems like a cheesy, goofy comedy (Dustin Hoffman becomes a woman to pick up Jessica Lange) but as you watch this movie you see his character come out. Michael Dorsey is emotional, caring, intuitive, and smart. He is also funny and you'll find plenty of humor in this movie (Dorothy getting kissed by the older doctor, the awkwardness of him pretending to be a woman) but there is drama in this. It's your typical guy chases the girl romance with that cool twist. Set in the backdrop of your typical 1980s movies, this movie will keep you watching. The music of Stephen Bishop (It Might be you) ,David Gushin (An Actor's life),is a nice touch to some of the great scenes of the movie. Watch it!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tootsie is a classic. Hoffman, Murray, Coleman, Garr and company create a laugh out loud movie. There are many great lines in the film and Sid Pollack's scene with Dorothy in the old Russian Tea Room is priceless. The Russian Tea Room was on 57th street and Dustin changed for the scene in a nearby apartment. When he was coming down on the elevator he noticed Jose Ferrer on the elevator. To test his costume and makeup he asked Ferrer' " I heard you were not circumcised, Mr Ferrer, is that true?" Ferrer did not recognize Hoffman and thought he was trapped by an unbalanced woman . He was getting panicked when Hoffman identified himself and they both had a good laugh</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not only is this a tremendous comedy, but it's one of the finest films I have seen about the process, the art and the trans-formative power of acting.In playing the part of Dorothy Michaels, "difficult" actor Michael Dorsey learns not only how to be a less difficult actor, but a better man and better human being. In interviews I've heard Dustin Hoffman say that he learned the same thing, and I believe it. I am STILL bitter that Hoffman didn't win the Oscar for this film. The transformation he makes in his performance as Dorothy is so complete and engaging and subtle that one almost forgets she is a man until with one tiny peek over the tops of her glasses at a pretty girl's derri?re, we are shocked into remembering. In a career as exemplary as Dustin Hoffman's I share his sentiments that this is his finest film.The writing and direction are unparalleled. There is simply not a mis-step in the production. Filled with some of the most hilarious, memorable, and lovable moments in cinematic history, this is a film you simply must not miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tootsie review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman, the esteemed character actor, finds a role in which he can play himself-sort of. Tootsie is a comedy with many streaming-to-life ironies, yet one Hoffman is able to call his own. The Graduate star has been depicted by the film industry as a toughie to work with. The opening scene takes full-fledged knowledge of this by inserting a struggling stage character, Michael, who is too demanding for his own good. When his friend Sandy is turned down a role on `daytime drama' before being given the opportunity to read the script, Michael realizes (from assisting her with the role) that he'd be better off to play it. And the conclusion isn't as ridiculously over-the-top, as let's say, Mrs. Doubtfire-despite Hoffman not bearing much resemblance to a woman-the film takes major issues and hides them through Hoffman's thick skin.While many will approach Tootsie with the perception of a feminist-liberal label, even Michael Dorsey.excuse me.Dorothy Michaels claims, `I only play that on TV.' The film doesn't necessarily staple on any women-to-power moments either, which seem more relevant in today's society, because, of course, the film is about a man as a woman to power. Tootsie does hit across the point of sexual discrimination several times, yet it does with cross-examination. For every sleaze-bag director Ron, we gain a viably-sane man in Les who enjoys Dorothy's good company. Then again, John, who plays the villainous tongue-crazed doctor on camera and apparently off (P.S. Dr. Brewster is played by Punky Brewster's dad...), is a confusing blend of both Ron and Les in his feelings towards Dorothy. Despite Michael, earlier, using the same cheesy `are you an actress, you have a beautiful face' line to just about every woman, his standup actions as Dorothy help fellow actress Julie (Jessica Lange) deal with her own relationship problems. Julie often takes the easy way out, yet learns through Michael's transformation that it sometimes takes a little (in this case, a lot) more to reach the peak of your own eccentricity. This issue seems very plausible twenty years later.The viewing experience of Tootsie proves spectacular and worthy of multiple viewings, despite the dreadful sappiness of the early 80's music that accompanies the score. Sydney Pollack has an acute eye for framing, as all the shots are still and near-perfect. While this may take away some of the realism, Tootsie presents a drama within a drama within a drama-Michael as Dorothy as Emily. It seems the only time we feel close to Michael is in the streets of New York; it remains the only isolation point for Michael as the struggling actor, even when spotted walking with either Teri Garr or Bill Murray (in an unusually straight-forward unbilled role). Many of the scenes in the first half use quick takes, which unfold to a leaner, more loosely and episodic structure.Tootsie the title is that indirect delightfulness Dorothy carries everywhere she goes. Michael is able to carry that on in `her' persona despite being unattractive. This quality of sweetness not always proves spectacular; it leads Michael to a disaster day series of scenes, with a proposal from Les, some singing/stalking from John, and a final rejection from Sandy. Alongside the usual `doing what it takes' sense of morality, the film also proves point in that any woman-of size, appearance, and mustache hair-can go through equivalent matters of sexual congestion. Michael seconds that with some clogging of his own: `I was a better man with you, when I was a woman, than I ever was with any woman when I was a man.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, Great, Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, the only criteria for what makes a film great is: does it stand up over multiple viewings? If you know every line, every cut, every camera angle, every note of the score, and every costume, does it still get your attention? If you're channel surfing at 3AM and you see the movie in question, no matter how far along it is, will you stop and watch it anyway? When the answer is yes--and for me, it is "yes" to very few films--then it's great. "Tootsie" is GREAT. The writing is sharp, the performances are uniformly excellent, and the subject matter remains timely, even now, twenty years later. The casting people outdid themselves with "Tootsie", as every role, even those where the actor has only a line or two, is so well done. Sydney Pollack--what a find! His performance as the totally hassled agent is superb, and honed, no doubt, by a professional lifetime of dealing with real agents. Bill Murray (why was he uncredited, anyway?) is, as usual, a joy. (His reaction when he interrupts Dustin Hoffman and his much-too-ardent admirer--"You slut"--is hysterical even after 100 viewings.) Jessica Lange and her cute little overbite have never been used more effectively. Charles Durning's portrayal of Les strikes a perfect note of old-fashioned sanity in this movie's crazy world. And Teri Garr is priceless! When she screams in frustration over having been stood up AGAIN by Hoffman she is the icon for every woman who's ever been forgotten, thrown over, dissed, or dropped. I could go on and on--Dabney Coleman, George Gaynes, Doris Belack--they are all fantastic.Somehow the Oscar voters got carried away by "Gandhi" and voted it the Best Original Screenplay award. Of the other nominees I think either "Tootsie" or "ET" deserved it far more--they were, after all, ORIGINAL stories! The only Oscar for "Tootsie" was to Jessica Lange for Best Supporting Actress, but I think she was given it as a consolation prize for losing Best Actress to Meryl Streep in "Sophie's Choice"; really Teri Garr, who was also nominated, was more deserving. Hoffman lost, too, but perhaps deservedly so, given the competition. Again, however, I'd quibble with the winner (Ben Kingsley for "Gandhi"). Personally I would have given the statuette to Peter O'Toole for his great work in "My Favorite Year".If you haven't seen "Tootsie", watch it. You'll never regret whiling away a couple of hours with this wonderful ensemble. And it will get you thinking about gender roles, something we as a society are still struggling with today. I've often thought of Hoffman's moment of truth, when he explains to Lange near the end, "I was a better man with you, when I was a woman, than I ever was with any woman when I was a man." If you can puzzle through the logic you'll see that this simple statement holds a world of truth in its couple of dozen words. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tootsie has all the ingredients that make a great comedy. Wonderful acting, an intresting story, and most of all great humor.The movie opens with Michael Dorsey(Dustin Hoffman)auditioning for different roles on the stage without any luck. Everyone turns him down because they are looking for a different type. He works on the side as a waiter at a restaurant and lives with his friend(Bill Murray)who writes plays. Michael then finds out that he missed out on a role for which he was promised an audition. He complains to his agent(Sydney Pollack)about the part and his agent explains that no one will hire him because he is too difficult to work with. Not anyone. Michael sets out to prove him wrong. This is where the name "Tootsie" comes in. Michael dresses up like a woman and auditions for a part in a soap opera.The movie really takes off from there. It is filled with hilarious moments as well as terrific performances. Dustin Hoffman is wonderful as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels. He knows just how to carry his character as both a man and a woman. A truly memorable performance. Jessica Lange is both tender and full of life. She gives her character just enough edge without going over the top. Other very good supporting roles belong to Teri Garr,(a truly terrific performance)Charles Durning, Sydney Pollack, Dabney Coleman, and Bill Murray.I completely enjoyed myself both times I have watched this movie. A comedy with an actual story. I would recommend this film to anyone. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say, that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. There's something about deceitful cross dressing (when done well) that makes people laugh. Some Like It Hot established itself with the same gag. Tootsie was a different movie though, it was far more serious and dealt with feminist issues in a way that wasn't preachy or annoying. For an example of that check out the abominable Adam's Rib with Tracy and Hepburn.Dustin Hoffman is simply amazing. He is the reason you are drawn into this movie. His Dorothy Michaels is so convincing that its hilarious (because you're in on the gag too). This film is never silly though, because there are well-established relationships between the characters. Miraculously, the feminist message of the film does not come off as corny as most issue based movies tend to be. I wouldn't even say this is a feminist film, its many more things at the same time. That is why it is so effective. 9/10</fullReview>

Not so with Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of "Dorothy" She actually seems to be "holding her own" so well that we can almost forget that she's a character being played by a man!

Instead, I see a talented and frustrated Michael Dorsey, who must step away from his own identity (and into Dorothy Michaels) to discover that his troubles aren't with everyone else. They are with himself. Yes, it's an old theme, but it's one most of us wrestle with on a daily basis. My pleasure comes from watching Michael's slow redemption while all of the zany sub-plots of this wonderfully convoluted story swirl around him. Sheer perfection!STORY: A- (the only weakness: Why is the baby-sitting scene included? It doesn't propel the plot, and seems contrived. The rest is top-notch!) //// ACTING: A+ (a superb ensemble) //// DIRECTING: A //// EDITING: A //// CINEMATOGRAPHY: A //// MUSIC: A //// overall: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to smile constantly for about an hour and 45 minutes, you should watch this movie. It's easy and entertaining and it will definitely make you laugh. Even though I like Jessica Lange as an actress, I have to say that I can't understand why she got an Oscar for her performance and Dustin Hoffman didn't. He did such a great job of playing a woman that most of time you just forget that that is a man. There is a story. It's not just another stupid comedy where actors make clowns of them selves and try to make public laugh by jumping around and saying stupid lines. Anyway, it's a must-see witch you want to put in your library!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest Screenplays by more than 10 people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This file is one of those films that can be watched more than 4 times a year and still have its desired effect. It should be a lesson for all those attempting to write a middle of the road comedic script. It is nothing revolutionary.. and there are those taut questions of gender politics... HOWEVER.. it is a lesson in the craft of writing a solid comedic script! Other than that it has Murray and Hoffman performing at the time in which those names really meant something. If you need one reason to watch this flawed classic it is to see a prime historical example of the progression of modern Hollywood cinema in its time. I dare anyone to mention a single mainstream hollywood comedy produced in the last 10 years that shows possibility for long life that this does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good commercial production comedy. The casting is spot-on, timing excellent, storyline FUNNY, cutting masterful (no wasted or dragging scenes) Hoffman is SUPERB - AND some of us hopeless perennial juveniles are treated to Teri Garr. Jessica Lange gets out of the melodrama mold with this film. Dabney Coleman does his usual great job in his usual role. Bill Murray plays a serious Bill Murray (cuts the smart-ass cracks by half). They could have done more with Charles Durning, but it's ALSO one of his best roles.Catch Geena Davis' expressivity during the "revelation".Notice I DIDN'T say GREAT FILM, because it's not. Schindler's List is a great film, Gary Senise's "Of Mice and Men" is a great film... I used those as examples only because many of you can relate to them.If you like farce as entertainment, there is NO reason NOT to rent and enjoy this film. Even if you've seen it several times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the premise of a man dressing as a woman may be a cliche in the world of slapstick comedy, this film is so much more.There are so many great characters and lines in this movie, but what truly makes it great is the development of Hoffman's character as he adapts to life as a "woman." He begins the film as a typical male chauvinist, but as the story goes on, he finds himself being increasingly empowered as he becomes a feminist. There's a line near the end where he says something to the effect of that he was a better man as a woman than he ever was as a man. This movie managed to make me laugh and think at the same time.Best line: "Does Jeff know?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie--one of the best modern comedies ever. As wonderful as everyone in the cast is -- Dustin Hoffman, Bill Murray, Sydney Pollack, et al -- special mention should be made of Teri Garr, who manages to steal every scene she's in here. I still think she should have gotten the Best Supporting Actress Oscar over Jessica Lange (who was, in fact, the Leading Lady), but that's just me. I can watch this one over and over and I never get tired of it. Major-but-hardly-fatal debits: the totally bland, muzak-cum-lite-jazz score by Dave Grusin, augmented with a pair of cheesy Stephen Sills ballads (the "Roll Tootsie Roll" song in particular is pretty dire). Overlooking those unfortunate musical choices, this movie is about as perfect a comedy as you are likely to find.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman), an idealistic actor who had a reputation for being difficult to work with, had been unemployed for two years (jobs that concerned acting) and therefore working at a restaurant as a waiter in New York City with his room-mate Jeff (Bill Murray). Michael had to raise 8000 dollars immediately for a new play written by Jeff. He disguised himself as a woman to take a female role in a soap, because there seemed to be no other ways to get the money he needed. But Michael didn't know that this would become an unexpectedly educational experience in his life.Later in the film he gradually realized how hard a woman's life could be, people's (especially men's) discrimination, prejudices against women and he also found out that he had been one of the other men who didn't treat women as well as they should had. In the end he became a better person and understood that men and women are people. The ending suggested that men and women should treat one another as friends."Tootsie" is a hilarious film, and it also means something more, not just another ordinary (or even hollow) comedy that makes you laugh only. It is probably the best comedy I've ever seen. A comedy of quality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the greatest comedies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest film comedies of all time. Interestingly enough, it came out at about the same time as Blake Edward's Victor Victoria, which was another film about cross dressing and also terrific - that time as a woman disguised as a man disguised as a woman. But whereas V/V was a brilliant screwball period farce, Tootsie has more heart as a story about sexual stereotyping and woman's rights. The performances are all extraordinary. Jessica Lange's performance as a sad, self-abusing soap-opera star, who has all the tools for a wonderful life - phenomenal beauty, a good heart, and brains - yet traps herself within the bounds of her boyfriend's definition of what her life should be even though she knows better, is wonderful. Hoffman pulls off his two roles virtually flawlessly. Even the bit parts, supporting roles, and cameos are done well; Sydney Pollack directs as well as playing the role of Michael's agent. Bill Murray's turn as Hoffman's roommate is hilarious. Of lesser note but just as funny is George Gaynes as the aging, lecherous thespian who can't act. An actor who can act playing an actor who can't. Wonderful. A great, great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My summary is not bright but the two taxi moments of the movie are really funny and in a way symbolizes the coolness of NYC in the 80s ! It was really a place in where the small, tenacious nobody could become famous and successful by working hard! Trying to find characters like that today is like hoping for a swimming pool in the desert! Next, the movie asks the question of gender and the answer it gives is surprising as it seems to say that a gender is a visual identity: if you are dressed like a woman, so you are a woman! Around those notions, the movie have a good fun when Dustin has romances being a woman and being a man as well! His acting is very good and predates Robin as Miss Doubtfire: Being the same generation with Pacino, Dustin has his features to be more playful . Here he has as well a strong support with Jessica Lange, Geena Davis, Bill Murray and the late Charles During (for me, seen in « home for the holidays », « dick Tracy », « Etoile », « dog day afternoon »). And Pollack is also quite convincing as an actor !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Woman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does being a woman mean? Beautiful, docile, soft spoken, and most importantly submissive? And is that a definition by men? If so, will they be interested in this woman? If yes, do these men stop there? Do they really be happy with the woman that you are? The more weepy, needy you are the more they would pretend to be interested in you. And before you know there is already another woman in their life's. And this does not end cause a man who's interest is just skin deep is as weaker as a woman he wants. On the other hand, not many men appreciate a level-headed, strong-willed woman. These are some ghastly traits that a woman should have according to them. But there are gentlemen who really admire a strong woman and find them interesting. And the movie Tootsie just shows that in the most dramatic way possible ;).Tootsie is a movie from Comedy Genre. How did I end up watching this? One of my friends shared a link where the actor in from the movie Tootise, Dustin Huffman tears up talking about making this movie and about every woman who wants to meet and match the expectations of a man. Michael Dorsey, has trouble getting a role in acting. Mostly cause of his nature and behavior. He finds it foolish to enact a scene which is beyond logic or reasoning. In a scene where he plays a man on his death bed, when the director asks him to walk across to the center and deliver few dialogs, he flares up asking how can a man who is dying walk across just because the director thinks that is what the audience want.In this struggle to meet the ends, he decides to dress up like a woman for a female role in a SOAP. His desperate attempt somehow wins the role to his surprise. As he starts acting like a woman on the sets and in his real life, he himself falls in love with Dorothy Michaels, taking care of her looks and dignity. He influences people around him, especially women. They feel empowered by him. Who believes in no phony, to be what you are and to stand for what you are and not let anyone treat you less than what you deserve.He meets Julie, on the sets who he instantly falls in love with. And like any other clichéd movie, she falls for the wrong guy Ron, the director of the show. Ron treats Julie like a doormat, and he cheats on her, hitting on every other woman. And has a convenient explanation of why he does so. And there goes a love triangle, but would Julie ever get to know who Dorothy is? And that the man behind Dorothy is really in love with her?If its a movie made in 20's, I sure would not have appreciated it. But I can understand the applause or awards this movie/ actors got. Dustin Huffman/ Dorothy Michaels is really an interesting woman ;-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unemployed actor goes drag and not only finds work but also becomes a hit on a soap opera. Hoffman is fairly convincing as a woman, but really comes off more as a caricature than a person. Also, given her homely looks, it's hard to believe that men are attracted to her. Although the cross-dressing premise is used to make points about feminism and becoming a better man after walking in a woman's shoes, the film tends to be a bit preachy in doing so. While the film is enjoyable, the humor is mostly understated and the drama never reaches the levels of poignancy that is intended. Lange, Garr, Murray, and Durning all turn in fine performances. Director Pollack is wonderful as Hoffman's agent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unblemished performance that leaves us all spellbound.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very few actors get a breakthrough in their first few movies. A majority of them struggle their way into limelight by doing any role and every role they are offered. Only those who stand the test of time emerge acquire legendary status. Dustin Hoffman belongs to that elite category.He couldn't deny the fact that Michael Dorsy was Dustin Hoffman himself- the way he had to struggle as an actor, how directors despised his imperiousness. In short, he felt it was a semi-fictional autobiography.Michael Dorsy is a universally rejected actor. Directors despise his improvisation and often end up in heated altercations. He offers tips to fellow aspiring actors on the Do's and Don'ts of acting from his personal experiences. Being unemployed and penniless, he decides to disguise himself as a woman to get a part in a soap opera. Beautifully dressed as a woman, he doesn't shed the man in him and his life as a well-mannered woman who speaks for the rights of women, Dorothy Michaels makes him (or her) the symbol of an ideal woman across America. She is offered a bounty for her role and her fan base explodes. He tries to balance his love for a fellow actress with his on-screen persona and reveals his true-self to the television world one fine day.Whether it's the brilliant script or Sydney Pollack's equally-brilliant direction that made this one of the greatest comedies ever made, is a ridiculous question if one is ignorant of one of the greatest performances of all-time, a performance an actor of Dustin's stature with the filmography- Midnight Cowboy, The Graduate, Kramer vs Kramer, Marathon Man, and Lenny- would deny without a second thought.The movie and Dustin were unfortunately victims of 'Oscar-snubs'. A 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a movie about cross-dressing that I actually liked. This movie makes Martin Lawrence Big Momma look like a high school prank.Starring Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange and directed by Sydney Pollack (Cold Mountain 2003), it was nominated for 10 Academy Awards but only took home one for best supporting actress.Sydney Pollack the director/producer also played Hoffman's agent in the movie.Tootsie takes a while getting into, but the moment you do you find yourself smiling all the way to the very end.It is about a perfectionist, talented but volatile actor Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman) who was difficult to work with and because of that was finding it hard to get a role.Because of his difficulty, he decided to change a bit, when i say a bit i mean he changed from a man to a woman to land some acting gig so as to raise money to do a stage play.After becoming famous and falling in love with his co star he was now finding it difficult to keep up appearance.Dustin Hoffman's acting was flawless making the other actors in the movie look like they were struggling to keep up.I did enjoy this movie a lot and would recommend it if you don't mind watching cross dressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's not to like?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is perhaps my favorite comedy of the 1980s--it's that good. But what makes it different from most comedies is that the film is VERY character-driven. And, apart from some hilarious ad-libs by Bill Murray, the film is played very straight--and the end results are fabulous. What's not to like about this film? The story is about Michael Dorsey (Dustin Hoffman)--an out of work actor who is very talented but so temperamental no one wants to work with him. So, after losing role after role, he's desperate and goes in drag to a casting call. And, oddly, he gets the part. Not only is the female Michael a better actor but also a better person--and that causes a lot of problems. Why? Because although it's hard to love Michael, 'Dorothy' is sweet and soon the object of several folks' attentions! How will Hoffman extricate himself--especially after he's/she's become a huge soap opera star?! Great music, great acting, a couple nice romances and a lot of laughs--this one is a keeper and one of the best date movies I can think of because men and women can both enjoy it equally. Well worth seeing--I nearly gave this one a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent comedy but vastly overrated by critics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Tootsie", according to the AFI, is the second best American comedy of all time. At the time of its release, the film was lavished with ten Oscar nominations, virtually unheard of for a comedy. Does the film live up its reputation? I don't think so.For one thing, I just don't think that the film is that funny. Sure, it's funny, to a degree. However, the romantic/dramatic elements of the plot are just as prominent, if not moreso. Also, I find that this is a film that is preoccupied with a 'message', though at least it isn't delivered heavy-handedly.I see no reason to complain about the acting, though. Dustin Hoffman, in a dual role, delivers the sort of performance upon which his reputation is built. There are some good performances in supporting roles too; notably Teri Garr, Bill Murray, Charles Durning, Dabney Coleman &amp; George Gaynes. Jessica Lange won an Oscar for her role but I didn't think that there was anything special about her performance.Sydney Pollack's direction is solid and keeps things simple. The music, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. Personally, I can't stand the glossy, commercial eighties sound which the Dave Grusin score typifies. The two original songs don't help matters though the Oscar-nominated hit "It Might be You" isn't completely without its charms.In the end, this is a decent romantic comedy but I wouldn't accord it classic status by any means. That being said, there seem to be plenty of folks out there who love this movie, so maybe I represent the minority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly a *drag*....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not too long after the dawn of film, when comedy writers were desperate for something envelope pushing but not tawdry, they threw a guy in a dress. The old reliable: guy in make-up, fidgeting with his new clothes, and basically, his new body. Flash forward several decades and it's still in full force.The only difference in "Tootsie" is that this typical "one joke" formula is only relied on a couple of times. A tug of pantyhose from the butt, a stumble on the heels, but that's about it. Fortunately for us (and something completely lost on today's screenwriters), the scribes decided to write a COMPLETE movie around this premise! Hoffman is tapped to portray a struggling actor who --- much like many unemployed thespians --- teaches acting classes on the side to make money, as well as wait tables. (Which is one of the extra aspects of the film that will delight those living the Unknown Actor life.) After watching a female friend bomb out at an audition, as well a finely scripted argument with his agent (Pollack, who is lights out), cut to Hoffman in womanly transformation, stumbling his way down a New York City block.As mentioned, because the screenplay doesn't rely on stand-by schenanigans involving bodily jokes, Hoffman ends up fleshing out a completely believable firebrand type female. Even admitting at one point, he wishes he had her aggressiveness. A strong intro to his "Dorothy" involves some spit-fire dialogue directed at a womanizing Coleman, his potential director on the soap opera he's auditioning for.But it's shortly after this where I was the most impressed. This script doesn't just introduce a second tier, but a third, and even a fourth. The complications faced by Hoffman --- and the way they are so masterfully juxtaposed --- layers this story like you wouldn't expect. Garr wants Hoffman, but Hoffman wants Lange. Lange's father wants Hoffman, but so does Gaynes. Garr thinks Hoffman is either cheating or gay. Lange believes Hoffman to be a lesbian. It really does present an ordeal of endless exploring for a screenwriter. And they nail it.A fine supporting cast includes Murray, not overdoing it as he was at that time, and Garr is nicely manic. Lange is a little bland, but acceptable. Coleman shines in another limited role, and Durning even gets time to win us over. But really it's Pollock as Hoffman's agent that grabs your attention. Not only directing this classic, but delivering such an embattled, comic performance that you wish you could've seen more of him.The film is only sluggish a few times, and some of the mechanics of the soap opera are stretched (teleprompters, going live, auditioning for a director instead of a casting director), but are hardly enough to detract. Throw in a terrific score from Dave Grusin and one of the most heartfelt movie theme songs from Stephen Bishop, and you've got a flick that'll be playable for another 25 years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tootsie Rolls! ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uproarious film with Dustin Hoffman, desperate for a job, who lands a part of a female in a soap opera that his girl-friend, Sandy, Teri Garr, was supposed to audition for.The laughs come a mile a minute. With the excellent director Sydney Pollack, who goes in front of the camera as Hoffman's agent, and a phenomenal cast, this film can't miss and it doesn't.Hoffman is positively brilliant in the role of Michael Dorsey who becomes Dorothy Michaels. All I can say is that Tony Curtis, ("Some Like it Hot"-move over.)Problem is that the role of Dorothy begins to interfere with Michael's personal life. Co-star in the soap opera, Jessica Lange, in a supporting Oscar performance, believes he is a lesbian. Dorothy meets her widowed father, the wonderful Charles Durning, a redneck, who begins to have designs on Dorothy for himself. Teri Garr is Michael's girl friend who doesn't know that Michael has gone drag and further believes that he is carrying on with Julie (Lange)Of course, there is Dabney Coleman as the director of the soap opera who mistreats Julie as well.It appears that Dorothy is able to solve the problems of others whether it be on the show or off camera. How she finally shows herself to be Michael is brilliant film-making.Tootsie received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for best picture. It lost to "Gandhi." Hoffman was nominated for best actor. Did anyone think of nominating him for best actress? Teri Garr was also nominated in the supporting actress division.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overly indulgent movie, saved by great acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this movie is rather weak. The idea is of a man who cannot find any roles, so decides to play a woman on a soap opera. Of course, it ends up being the same old story of the woman versus "the overly played in this kind of role" "Dabney Coleman, as the male chauvinistic director. What saves this movie is the acting. Dustin Hoffman plays both Michael Dorsey (struggling actor) and Dorothy Michaels (soap star). What I like this is that it is an authentic portrayal of a woman, not the usual over exaggerated role. Hoffman plays well the prim and proper Dorothy Michaels. Sydney Pollack plays a very funny and witty acting agent, who can't believe and is downright embarrassed by Dorsey's charades. Jessica Lange is her usual good self as Julie Nichols. I was most impressed by the Finnish-born actor - John Van Horn. As one of the only good things about the Police Academy series, he certainly showed acting talent. Charles Durning plays the Father. He is very believable. I guess it wasn't that great a plot, but the acting was good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That is one nutty hospital!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TOOTSIE (1982) **** Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Charles Durning, Teri Garr, Dabney Coleman, Bill Murray, Geena Davis, George Gaynes. Classic contemporary comedy and one of the most popular movies ever made. Hoffman (Best Actor nominee) is trouble-making actor Michael Dorsey who is so unbearable and unemployable, so says his agent (director Sydney Pollack, fellow Oscar nominee, in a very funny performance) that he dons drag as "Dorothy Michaels" and lands a gig as a recurring character as a successful soap opera. There he learns what it's like to really be a woman including the sexism, harrassment and daily regimen of just getting dressed that women face every day. Hoffman is great fun and adds dignity to what easily could have been a kitschy role and some excellent performances by Garr (Best Supporting Actress nominee) as his no-longer platonic girlfriend and neurotic actress; Coleman as his chauvanist pig director with glee and unbridled insensitivity; Murray (who received no billing on his own accord) is dead-pan perfect with one of the film's best lines at its climax ("that is one nutty hospital!"); and Lange, lastly, is a pure and perfect delight as the soap's ingenue who learns some life lessons and earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar.Crackling nominated screenplay by legendary writer Larry Gelbart.A comic gem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...I really get tired of Dustin Hoffman's "I can do anything better than a woman" shtick. In Little Big Man, he was a better gunslinger than his sister, in Kramer vs. Kramer he was a better mom than Meryl Streep, and in Tootsie, he's a better woman than ALL woman. I just keep thinking of that Jack Nicholson line in "As Good as it Gets" when asked how he can portray women so well..."I think of a man, and I take away reason and accountability..."...anyway, Hoffman's anti-female attitude rather ruins any "comedy" this movie might have had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slickly commercial, and funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unemployed actor Dustin Hoffman poses as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and lands a part on a soap opera where he falls for another cast member, Jessica Lange. Hoffman gets into the role and begins improvising snotty remarks and put-downs against his overbearing male costars, as well as coaching Lange on standing up for her rights instead of letting men walk all over her.Hoffman becomes the most popular person on the show and is irreplaceable. He's in hot water, however, since no one on the show realizes that he's a man, Lange included. (The makeup is superb.) Then things get all complicated. Lange's father, Charles Durning, develops a passion for Hoffman's Dorothy and offers him a ring. And Hoffman is locked into a contract that he can't get out of without inviting professional ruin.It's a very funny movie with clever gags that break little new ground in the transvestite genre. Example: After a friendly dinner, Lange confides to Dorothy that she, Lange, is tired of men hitting on her and fabulating compliments. It would be so much simpler, say Lange, is a man just came up to her, said, "I could lay a long line on you, but what I really want to say is that I find you very interesting and would like to make love to you." Hoffman, as Dorothy, nods eagerly. Shortly afterward, in his male persona, he runs into Lange at a party. She of course doesn't recognize him without his Dorothy disguise. "You know something?", Hoffman asks. "I could lay a long line on you, but what I'd really like to say is that I find you very interesting and would like to make love to you." Lange throws a glass of wine in his face and walks away.There are unusually good performances from Dustin Hoffman (looking and acting convincingly feminine), Bill Murray, Sidney Pollack, and Jessica Lange in particular.I won't give away any more gags, I guess, though there are many amusing scenes. The chief problem with the movie is that it's structured for popular taste. It's burdened with a "meaningfulness", namely the empowerment of women, that "Some Like It Hot" never dreamed of. And there are times when it's soft and cloying like the chocolate-covered cherries that someone gives Dorothy as a present. Lange and Hoffman are sharing a bed at Lange's family farm and the scene is loving and tender. A sappy love song swells in the background. It played under the end credits with a saxophone lead that sounds like Kenny G.And most of the comic situations are derivative too, as perforce they just about must be, because how many twists can be wrung out of a plot that has become this familiar. There isn't as much outright slapstick as in "Mrs. Doubtfire." Nobody's bosom catches on fire. But there's the same quick-change problem when Hoffman's girl friend (Terry Garr) bursts into his apartment while he's still in costume.There's something else too. It's a little demeaning to women. I don't watch soap operas ("afternoon dramas"), but I wonder if female characters are really treated as doormats. If they're called "Tootsie," or "Doll," or "Sweetie," behind the camera, how terrible is that? How different is it from calling a man "Pal" or "Mac" or "Buddy"? And if it were true that women were subtly trashed behind and in front of the camera, does it really take a man in a woman's guise to wake them up? The impression the film leaves with the viewer is that a good deal of thought and expense went into the production, but most of the effort was aimed not at making a good comedy but at appealing to the widest possible audience and raking in the shekels at the box office, at which I believe it succeeded.</fullReview>

Tootsie may be considered the best comedy ever made. No one would suspect how difficult it would be to change your sex; you can't love the right person, and the wrong person falls in love with you. It is a hilarious film that will keep you laughing for decades; a must see for movie fans of all kinds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy Period Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this is 1982, criticizing this film with today's woman in mind is not an accurate way to do it. The same goes for the outdated main plot of a woman doing a soap opera the way it is done in this film. Soap Operas are withering on the vine today with only a scant few left. Women now have much more meaningful careers than that line of work. In fact many women have now passed their husbands as the money maker in the household. There are still equal rights issues but as Manufacturing Jobs have gone off shore men are being reduced in importance in their roles in marriage.Then there is the gay marriage issue which is not really addressed here at all as only ground breaking TV series like M*A*S*H had addressed homosexuality much at all by 1982. HIV/AIDS was just getting started in this time period.This Sydney Pollack directed Comedy is all about fun, but is rooted in the type of role reversals that had been done many years prior to this film. That is why Dustin Hoffman is the perfect choice for the lead here. He always does sexual comedy well as if you witness The Graduate, Meet The Fockers, and others, his biggest successes have to do with comedy based on this genre.This film is a lot more than Dustin as the supporting cast sparkles and is very talented around him. There is a lot to like about the movie but this update of Some Like It Hot is not at the same level as Lemmon-Curtis-Monroe were many years earlier.I like the movie, but it is not great. This is not one to release in IMAX 3D. It actually is very stereotypical of this type of comedy in the 1950's and before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dustin Hoffman plays two roles; he plays Michael Dorsey an unemployed actor with a reputation for being difficult and Dorothy Michaels in both roles but unforgettable a as the woman he disguises himself as to land a role in a soap opera. Hoffman is terrific s Dorothy. The film has a terrific script great direction and good acting. With all of that and the hilarious story, this falls as one of the greatest movies to come out of the eighties. Michael Dorsey is struggling with is acting career. He seems to know a lot about acting and the way it's supposed to be done, in a realistic sense anyway. While the movies credits are being shown in the beginning, there is a terrific montage of Michael talking to people about acting and trying to land roles as an actor. It's kind of ironic because he is giving what looks to be his students advice and telling how things should be done but he can't even get a role himself. Some good direction comes in, in the montage when Michael is trying out for parts. One of my favorite parts in the montage is when he is dressed up a little older and he is up on this stage and the director yells out, `stop', from the darkness of the audience seats and says something like no, no you're no good we need someone who looks a little older. In the next scene Michael is dressed as a kid a new director says no, no we need someone who looks younger. This is when he gets the truth that people just don't want him for any parts. Then we go back to him telling what looks to be his students about acting. He tells them that ninety five percent of actors are unemployed and that there is no reason for this. Then we got another shot of him being rejected and them a scene with him working at a restaurant, which is also ironic. Then we go to Michael and his roommate Jeff's (Bill Murray) apartment, where there is a surprise birthday for him. Michael is going around asking for girls' numbers and etc. He goes up to this one girl and asks if she is an actress, she says yes and then he goes on and on about how good she was. We then go to a scene where Jeff is talking to people about how he hates it when people come up to him and say `hey you were that guy in that movie, you were great'. So from that we can assume the director was probably trying to tell us something, it could mean many things, but I came to the conclusion that it probably was what the girl was thinking. So there is a lot of good scenes with good ides in them that I don't think were scripted, I think that were Pollack's directing.  Michael then takes his friend Julie, who is played by Jessica Lange, who won an Oscar for her role, to try out for a part in a soap opera. She just can't seem to be as good at the part as Michael can. She doesn't get the part. Michael is determined to become an actor and prove his agent wrong for saying that no wants to hire him. Well in a sense his agent was right, no one really wants to hire Michael, they want Dorothy. Dorothy is someone Michael makes up in order to get hired for the part in the soap opera. Dorothy gets hired for the part in the soap opera. Then Dorothy meets Sandy (Terri Garr) who is playing a nurse on the soap opera. They become attached and soon bond. Sandy wants Dorothy to meet her dad because he is lonely since his wife died. This of course becomes hilarious because Dorothy is really Michael. Meanwhile Michael is getting attached to Sandy, but can't express his feelings because he has to be Dorothy. There is a funny montage at Sandy's farmhouse where her dad and Dorothy are staying for the weekend. There is this sort of love music playing with shots of the dad falling for Dorothy and Dorothy falling for Sandy. But, that doesn't really make since because in the whole movie everyone is on tight schedule and all of the sudden they just go away for a couple of days, but whatever. I don't want to ruin anymore so I'll leave it at that.  Tootsie follows the same format as Some Like it Hot and Mrs. Doubtfire would follow. A man desperately wants some thing, he wants it so bad he will do any thing, even if it requires dressing as a woman. In Some Like it Hot the men are dressing as women to get to Florida. In Tootsie the man wants to be an actor and get enough money to produce his friends script. And in Mrs. Doubtfire a man wants his wife back so bad he dresses as a nanny and watches her kids. So they all basically follow the same format and really its a very successful format, all of those movies have mad a lot of money and have gotten very good reviews and that can all be thanked to Billy Wilder. I found some little interesting facts from Entertainment Weekly magazine. It said that the title actually came form Hoffman, whose mother `used to throw me up in the air and say, How' my tootsie wootsie?' And that Hoffman's four-pound silicone breasts cost one hundred and seventy five dollars each. Overall the film was pretty good. I was expecting it to be pretty bad. I had watched the first ten minutes of it like a year ago and turned it off. I guess the reason I didn't like it then was because it was so acclaimed and that it really didn't look that good. But after seeing it I still don't completely agree with the critics and I have to say I definitely don't agree with it being on the American Film Institutes top one hundred movies of all time. But if you haven't seen it I would recommend watching it sometime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Plainly Commercial Sitcom Exercise in Star Ego and Basically Juvenile Clowning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the AFI released their list of the 100 Funniest American Films long ago now, two cross-dressing comedies, Some Like It Hot and Tootsie, ranked at the top. Funny is a wholly biased term though, so I don't especially resent the organization's pick. I never have had much conviction in honors granted by committee, as the broadest, most mainstream films viable are inclined be awarded, as the Oscars reliably demonstrate. Nevertheless, I don't think that I would be able to provide a sure response to the question asked by the survey. Even some of my favorite comedies wouldn't truly meet the criteria as funniest.Tootsie rests on an actor that's so tarnished for his fastidiousness that he gets black-flagged. The film puts him into women's attire with much less complaint than Some Like It Hot does, fortunately, but once he's disguised as a woman, no genuine comic dilemmas are produced. He develops an acquaintance in his masquerade with his female co-star, and, unsurprisingly, grows to love her. In chorus, he acquires the admiration of his co-star's father, and a national viewing audience. The film doesn't appear to be much involved with Hoffman's gender swap past the detail that it inhibits his relationship with Lange's character. The political principles of the film appear to be somewhat misaligned, too. The interpretation of Dorothy seems to imply that an empowered woman is on some level behaving as a man beneath her feminine pretense. The film seems somewhat homophobic too. Much of the intended hilarity surfaces when men are made to unsuspectingly kiss another man. Scandalous.The main thing is that it's not that funny. It handles its peak comic appeal when it works at its simplest level, but continuously manages to elaborate on its laugh cues for too long. It entertains through merely showing its lanky male lead as he uncomfortably moves about in women's outfits. It's disappointing that the director of They Shoot Horses, Don't They? felt it essential to make a significant film about such an ultimately childish subject. Maybe that's why the proceedings feel strained.Sydney Pollack was a straightforwardly commercial director who was happily a part of the mainstream for most of his career behind the camera, unlike such contemporaries as Sidney Lumet and Woody Allen. He worked in staple genres, this time the classic, star-studded Hollywood comedy. And as a Pollack film, there is strong acting all around. But save for Charles Durning, playing the mistaken father of Lange, who plays a stereotype with such unforced straightforwardness that she nearly steals the film, and Murray, who does steal the film, the remainder of the cast, while not deficient in comic energy, gets nothing particularly funny to say or do.One of the more engaging elements of Tootsie is that the middle-aged actress is able to hold most of her own scenes as herself, even if she weren't a man's disguise. The male actor under the dress discovers to his curiosity and ultimate panic that Dorothy begins to take on a life of her own. Although his rise to fame as Dorothy Michaels is shockingly instantaneous at the same time his personal relationships become a minefield, I'll concede that Tootsie has a lot of fun with its plot hurtles. We get just about every likely variation on the premise of mistaken gender identities. The movie also manages to make some blithe but well-aimed notes about chauvinism. It also nudges satirically at soap operas, New York show business agents and the Manhattan social ladder. But all in all, it's just a sitcom ode to the Hoffman ego. Like Hoffman in drag, it doesn't look at itself very carefully. Instead of meeting what it sets up head-on, it takes the one joke and runs, till it runs out of steam. Paging Billy Wilder.</fullReview>

Only this time probably a man wearing woman clothes but with a character like tootsie.I only give one star to Hoffman for playing the role that good and laying the ground for Robbin Williams in "Mrs. Doubtfire".Finally I gave the movie 5 out of 10 just for the sake that it's a Sydney Pollack movie and Hoffman again did great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This story simply does not work any more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when this was made, there was probably something funny about a man dressing up as a woman, but now it is not an uncommon occurrence, that a movie like this, to me, comes across more boring than funny.The story is that an actor is having so much trouble getting a job that he decides that he will pretend to be a woman and become an actor that way. The thing is that the reason he is having problems getting work is that he is simply way to difficult to work with, doesn't bring in the money, and basically is one big pain in the butt. Also, the way he treats the girl that he takes to bed (simply so that nobody, other than his flatmate, knows that he is the woman) is far less than honourable.I guess the comedy is supposed to be in the fact that people are treating him like a woman and don't know that in reality he is a man. In a sense, his characters are quite similar, both Micheal Dorsey and Dorothy Micheals. Micheal has practically ostracised himself from the entertainment industry with his attitude, while Dorothy gets away with saying and doing what she does simply because she is a woman.I guess this movie irritated me, especially at the end where they wind it up far too quickly. After revealing that he actually made a fool of everybody he worked with, and of Julie's father, he is simply able to make up with them all too conveniently. Most people, especially somebody in the shoes of Julie's father, would be so ashamed and embarrassed as to what happened, that upon seeing them again, they would be flattened. Julie also caves in a bit to quickly for my liking.The critics praised this film as being a masterpiece and a work of literature. I label it a potential garbage. Sure Bill Murray and Dustin Hoffman were good actors, and Dorsey's sexual identity was supposed to be confusing, but for what he did, he seemed to get off way to lightly, and it seemed that he was very easily able to uphold the façade, and then able to remove it at his own timing when things started to get a little hot. The critics praised it for its ingenuity, but when one considers that women are from Venus while men are from Mars, I find it quite unbelievable that a man, even a trained actor, could pull off such a stunt so successfully.</fullReview>

That makes her interesting!) over the older woman who is less attractive, but is at least an interesting character.Now I could forgive this in a movie that wasn't claiming to be a powerful feminist piece.
