		<shortDescription>i love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have seen this movie so many times and it is still hilarious. regardless of what others have said i think this movie is great. the plot is not that well written but who cares this movie wants to make u laugh and it succeeds admirably. I think that this movie is great and is one of my favorite all time movies. It is absolutely hilarious. Many think that Tom Hanks is a dramatic actor, but his roots are in comedy. This movie proves that, he is absolutely perfect and hillarious. Shelley Long although not great, is the best she has ever been in a movie. Her timing and emotions are well fit for this movie. You will laugh and be touched, please vote afterwards and make this rating go up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Hanks builds his dream (make that "nightmare") house</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know, the critics ripped at "The Money Pit" when it got released. They apparently didn't realize that it wasn't pretending to be a masterpiece; it was a big excuse to be funny, and they succeed. Some of the gags her seem to forecast the equally funny "Mousehunt". Personally, I think that Tom Hanks needs to act in some more comedies, and Shelley Long needs to get more roles in movies. My favorite scene? Well, I get the giggles whenever I think of the whole chain reaction. Just the kinds of things about which anyone should worry when moving into a new house (although my family didn't have such experiences when we moved into our house).All in all, it shows that Richard Benjamin is as great a director as he is an actor. My generation ought to give him the recognition that my parents' generation gave him. Also starring Alexander Godunov (one of the Amish guys in "Witness"), Maureen Stapleton, Joe Mantegna and Josh Mostel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Granted, I was a teen when I first saw it, but even so, I laughed often and that is my standard of judgment. Shelley Long is as good as she was in Cheers (which is gooood). Tom Hanks shows off the early "Bosom Buddies" hopes of physical comedy genius here in a way that he never did again. The bee-attack scene to the flight of the Bumblebee violin solo is fabulous. the whole "We're Sitting on a Dream" sequence with the stairs and doorbell and raccoon and the bathtub is hilarious but PEOPLE. Come on. The entire collapsing stairs bit is the best, capped off by Hanks sweet little blown kiss at the end ... slayed me. My brother and I still reference it whenever everything is more crap than bearable, and we always will. I think this is an overlooked gem and will always have it in my video catalogue. Finally, a quote: Paint. Don't tickle. Alexander Gudonow will be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the rarest of the rare: a one-joke comedy where the one-joke is able to sustain the whole film. It all begins when Hanks and Long buy a big, grand, dream house in the New York countryside. It is, of course, too good to be true, after the sob-story old lady has sold it to them it begins to crumble into disaster. But because there are so many angles for the filmmakers to come from---collapse of stairs, wild animals lurking, bad wiring---it manages to hold itself together for around ninety minutes. A big credit goes to Hanks, who's facial expressions are priceless at times. Such as when he accidentally hammers his thumb. Too stunned to curse, he does what we all do, as he begins to beat the hell out of the object he was hammering. Even his charm in the earlier scenes, like dealing with a bratty kid-star, are funny. Long is good as his sort of straight-(wo)man, but Godunov steals all his scenes as her self-absorbed ex husband. Bosco is great as the grandfather of the entire construction crew, and even the sub-sub-characters are engaging as everyone always has a goofy line to chime in with, i.e. the infamous "Two weeks". But the coup de gras of the entire thing is a slapstick set-piece that brings down the house, literally. All I'll say is that involves Hanks going on a proverbial roller-coaster ride in and around the house for a good two minutes. The choreography and timing, starting with Hanks and going all the way down the extras, is amazing. Even if you aren't into the film, at least stay until that moment. There's an extra-marital subplot, that usually in a comedy, never fits. But because we like Hanks and Long so much, we get into it. And it leads to one of Hanks' funnier line readings ever. To the longtime fans of the movie: "YOU WH*RE!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film when it first came out was not given credit, it fell into the categories with the "Ghostbusters sequel" and other silly 80's movies. But, if you watch it again, it may have you laughing.Shelley Long, while not a favorite, is good, and Tom Hanks, as a young couple finally buying that country mansion dream house every American should want. Maureen Stapleton is selling it; she is classic.Joe Mantegna as Art Shirk, one of the many contractors and plumbers who take the young couple for a ride. Richard Benjamin has done a good job directing (You may want to watch "Goodbye, Columbus" again; he was excellent in that film).The story is predictable, but will lighten your mood; it is not just a romantic comedy with a ridiculous premise. Anyone who has ever had to deal with house repairs and contractors will find this to be a good tonic. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Hanks at his Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly the era when Tom Hanks was a comedian. He really made me laugh in this movie. Especially when the bath tub falls through the flooring. The best parts happen when something goes wrong. Tom Hanks has moved on since this time period to make Oscar winning movies such as Forrest Gump and the Green Mile, but this is truly when he was at his best. I have to admit, I never thought that Tom Hanks could be funny until I saw this film. I inspire anyone to give this movie a try. I guarantee that it will make you laugh at least once or twice. So go on and try the Money Pit. It is when Tom Hanks was not in it for the awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>hanks at his physical comedy best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It continually amazes me that Tom hanks will go down as one of the best dramatic actors of our generation and little will be spoken of how good a physical comedian he was before "Philadelphia" changed his career. Hanks made a string of movies in the 80s relying on his physical comedy ability, most notable "Big", "the burbs", "dragnet", "turner &amp; hooch" etc. But I think that with the POSSIBLE exception of "Big" - "The Money Pit" is his best. Some of the scenes involving Hanks in this movie made me laugh so hard I couldn't breathe. This movie is intended to be a farce and it succeeds totally. The rest of the cast is not very strong - I have never, and I assume never will be, a Shelley Long fan - she doesn't do anything but provide a sounding board for Hanks anyway. But then again, she really doesn't need to. This movie is definitely worth taking a look at if you haven't seen it - the first time you watch it, it is genuinely hilarious. I just watched it again after about three years without seeing it and found it to still hold up. The scene when the chimney falls apart is my favorite. I wish hanks would do another comedy, but he's all serious now. oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another film, I love from 86, sees Hanks, again impressing us, with great comic timing, and soon to be wife, Shelly Long (always good in any role) buy the lemon from hell. There are laughs here and there, but the fun is in just watching this place come apart and crumble. Not sounding morbid or dastardly here. Here, anything and everything comes apart, you have to ask yourself, "How the hell did they stage all of the faults". It must of taken hours. Some of the defects are bloody dangerous to watch, mostly concerning wires blowing apart and power outlets. Poor Hanks getting sucked in through a hole in the second story floor, was one of the fun moments. No other actor could fit this role, and I wouldn't want to see any other actor in this role. Joe Mantegna as a randy carpenter who makes the moves on Long, I liked. Shelly's ex-Alexander Gordonuv provided a likable character of flair, despite being shallow, and narcissistic. After not seeing this film in a very long time, I still enjoyed it today as I did then. By the way, in the house is amazingly, revamped, where in the end, for first home buyers, hope is possible. Lets face it, at the start, this crumbling house made the one in Emoh Ruo, look like a dream, it's faults, coming in small pittance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have lost count of the amount of times I have watched this film. It's one of those films you put on when you need cheering up. So many scenes were funny to watch, love the one where Tom Hanks gets his fingers stepped on, because the stairs is "out"!!!!You really feel for them, as everything they touch falls apart...and the saying: how long will this take to finish? TWO WEEKS, TWO WEEKS!! Yeh...right the job to mend/repair the house lasts months.There are so many funny scenes...which I love, Tom Hanks is a legend, what a talent, funny or sad he's magic. Loved Shelley Long in this film, she's very good doing comedy.Great movie xxx xx</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Shelley Long star in this hilarious film about a couple who buy a million dollar home for $200,000 - only to find out it's going to cost close to a million to repair it! Wood rot, raccoons in the dumbwaiter, a bad roof, bad plumbing, bad electricity - you name it, this house has it. Hard to choose the funniest scene - the staircase collapse or Hanks getting dumped in cement.The entire cast is excellent, from Maureen Stapleton, the former homeowner whose boyfriend is being deported, Hanks' clients (he's an entertainment attorney), the many workers who populate the house, or Douglass Watson, Hanks' embezzler father who now lives in Rio.It would also be hard to choose the funniest line, but for anyone who has owned a home, probably the Shirks Brothers line when their team comes to repair the house - "Your name came up in a drawing - we work today!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early Tom Hanks comedy where the jokes don't come very early</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shelley Long was so good in the first five years of sitcom 'Cheers' that i've always been surprised that she's never made more of a dent on the silver screen. Here I think is one of the few films she's made where she gets star billing.'The Money Pit' is a decent enough film and certainly has a lot of charm. Once it gets going,with all the slapstick and mishaps it's a good laugh.However I found the start very slow going and had to try hard not to give up on the film all together. There's so much set up before the fun starts and that doesn't make great viewing.If you want a fun film then this is one for you, I'd just skip the first twenty minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Social Commentary And Relevant Satire. It's Also Flat Out Hilarious Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>people usually underestimate the 'Money Pit'. even though they like it. i read a review in a Film Quarterly, or one of those esoteric cinema journals, some twenty or so years ago that called the film "brilliant social commentary". even though that's not how i originally perceived the film, i found i agreed with this analysis.'The Money Pit' deals with things like real estate fraud and bad investments. something that probably plagues this country more today than it did at the time it was made. Tom Hank's chubby real estate buddy refers to the whole housing market as often "making a quick dollar off of other people's misfortune". that remark is so true it's actually more depressing than funny. especially for person's who have lost homes or been ripped off in a ruthless market. but somehow, through great comic perception, the 'Money Pit' makes this unhappy aspect of our times, into something screamingly funny.it also features some outstanding performances by Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Hanks in particular gives a performance of a man under excruciating stress. this is one of the best capture of human stress i have seen in acting. and Hanks makes it work in such a bittersweet way. stress is something all too real in our times and stress really isn't very funny, but somehow Hanks makes it so. and you actually feel and sympathize when he begins to fall apart at the seams.this film makes a very important statement on how human lives get caught up in their finances and the money they invest in their homes. the couple here literally needs the house or they have nowhere else to really go. their whole livelihood is invested here and financial stress takes it toll. and in the end, almost tragically for their relationship.this film makes so many good statements about finance, housing as shelter, and about the stress that living in a world dominated by a market can take on people.it's also a movie that let's people know that stress and breaking under pressure is only human. there's a lot of humanity in this film and it's very touching and comforting.our times now are especially trying for the home owner. it seems that so many people these days are losing their homes or in financial distress. i don't know if there can be anyone who can say much, especially if they don't know or are going through it themselves. i dunno. all i can offer is, hold on. hang in there. someone, somewhere does understand, and cares. otherwise they never would have made a movie like this in the first place. and there are people like me that care about ALL people who stand to lose their homes.anyone buying real estate should watch this film first. and always remember it's timely statement, BUYER BEWARE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny remake of a remake of a.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the things that makes this movie so enjoyable is that millions of Americans can easily empathize and draw upon their own experiences with the travails of fixing up a dilapidated house. The plot is a familiar one and follows in the footsteps (which usually collapse) of such classic films as "George Washington Slept Here," "The Egg and I" and "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House."Shelley Long and Tom Hanks seem evenly matched as the tormented couple who suffer almost every wacky indignity and calamity imaginable. Tom Hanks has a flair for physical comedy, which he rarely got the chance to exploit in his later films. Unfortunately, except for Philip Bosco and Maureen Stapleton, the supporting players in "The Money Pit" are not in the same league as the actors who added so much flavor to films in the old studio days.Indeed, as a classic movie buff, I find today's crop of character actors pallid in comparison with their counterparts of more than 50 years ago.Who can forget Percy Kilbride and Hattie McDaniel as Mr. Kimber and Hester the maid in "George Washington," and Harry Shannon As Mr. Tesander, the well digger, in "Blandings"? Don't forget Donald MacBride and the coupling of Marjorie Main and Percy Kilbride as Ma and Pa Kettle in "The Egg." We'll never see the likes of them again.Still, "The Money Pit" is all good fun and very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing before buying a house as a couple</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got a chance to watch this movie during a real estate class. And I am kinda glad the professor decided to show it. Cause although this movie was made in the 80's it still sorta holds up today. Tom Hanks is young in this and him and his fiancé decides to buy a house...Without doing any inspections on the house. And that is when there dream house ends up being a nightmare cause all the appliance and stuff in the house are so worn out it turns out to be a major hazard. So there is a bit of some comedic elements in this movie besides it have some romantic comedy aspect to it. But the romantic comedy is just a small portion of this movie. And it educates you what not to do when buying a house while it have some funny moments than and there. This isn't one of the best comedies I seen but it's pretty good. And is worth seeing, especially before buying a house as a couple.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Money Pit is directed by Richard Benjamin and written by David Giler. It stars Tom Hanks, Shelley Long, Alexander Godunov and Maureen Stapleton. Music is by Michael Colombier and cinematography by Gordon Willis. Plot finds Hanks and Long as a young couple who buy what they think is their dream house, only to find the house falling apart around them.Mozart is dead, his troubles are over.He went on to be a big mover in the acting world did Tom Hanks, so much so it's always a little weird revisiting his comedy output in the 1980s because he's a vastly different actor now. Yet for many of us, that decade holds many treasures, where nostalgic fever takes a hold and a warm glow does come with watching the young Hanks bound about with comedic glee. The Money Pit doesn't have the cult worship of Splash or the internet respect of Big, yet it's a wonderfully funny picture that finds Hanks on optimum energised form. The plot might be thin and Long kind of gets pushed to one side, but this has much to enjoy with a bottle of vino and snacks. That is, of course, if you don't mind laughing at the misfortune of new home owners?! I am sinking fast into the money pit.A number of sequences are pure farce, but in the good way, stairs collapse, as does the chimney, doors, floors and a leaking roof bring the mirth, as does a laugh out loud bath moment. It sounds a little chaotic, and it is at times, but the screenplay allows Hanks &amp; Long, and the wonderful Godunov, time to breath life into the characters. There's a lovely romance at the core of the story, one that inevitably will be tested by the chaos of the house renovations and Godunov's third party ex. They are a very likable couple and easy to root for. Helps that Hanks is full of effervescent boyishness and Long is so homely and pretty, the latter of which I don't think has ever looked better than during a red dress sequence here.If the foundation is OK? Then everything else can be fixed.It doesn't have any surprises in store, it goes exactly where you expect it too, which naturally renders the final third as being all about the sentiment and the message. With the comedy gone, picture struggles a touch to put the final coat of paint on the project. But it's nicely underplayed by the actors and really this is about love triumphant against adversity. With the laughs that came previously more than making this a blues lifter for the nostalgic amongst us. 7.5/10</fullReview>

The first movie i ever saw, was ghostbusters, and i was hooked. the 2th movie, was the money pit, because it was recorded on the same VHS tape as ghostbusters was, and it to was just as funny.I remember watching this film over and over again as a very young child, (2-5 years old) and cracking up every time even though i didn't get most of the jokes (what 4 year old knows about the trouble of home repair?) anyhow, after catching a late night viewing of the film (and only the end part of it) i can say from what i viewed, i was laughing my ass off, almost waking up my sleeping parents and brother.

		<fullReview>Tom Hanks rises well above the material, as does Shelley Long and Maureen Stapleton, and it's a shame their talents are not used more to make the film funnier. The screenplay just takes the stars to extremes that are unnecessary. It would have been so much funnier if they just had normal problems with buying a house instead of such unrealistic ones. It's not without a few laughs, but it should have been so much better. It has a good score at least. There is a much better story with a similar theme, 1948's Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, watch that one instead. Supposedly this is based on that film, but only the very basic plot is familiar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pretty interesting to see Tom Hanks the screwball comedian, but I can't really say it's funny. More of a time document really. This movie has one gag, whenever you do anything to the house, something will break/fall apart/collapse. That got a couple of laughs, but it gets so tiresome and they do not know when to stop. And once they bail out on the slapstick ideas they just give up humor in its entirety. There's not a single joke in the ending half hour or so. Just the two leads(who have none of the obligatory "chemistry") bickering like you see in every comedy that somehow involves a relationship. And then obviously things go back to the way it was and a helpful builder wraps it up with an amazingly cheesy metaphor about marriage. But I didn't hate this movie. It's one of those kind-hearted attempts, and it actually looks like some people were trying their best. But failed. I should mention failed. It did make me notice that "Bachelor Party" was actually pretty good. That's something</fullReview>

Well, Steven Spielberg may have been the Executive Producer and comic actor Richard Benjamin may have directed it, but I'm afraid "The Money Pit" is a complete misfire. As others have noted, it's one joke (couple buy their dream house only to discover too late that it's falling apart) stretched out over an hour and a half. Lots of sight gags which initially raise a smile but soon wear out their welcome when they're endlessly repeated with only slight variations. The script fails to build up sympathy for the two leads and the actors struggle to make any of it credible or interesting. Give me Mr Blandings any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A so-so rip-off of "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, two films from the '40s must have served as a guide for the writers to invent jokes around a couple who buy what they hope will be their dream house in the country, only to find that everything they touch has a way of collapsing. The films were MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE (a sophisticated, witty comedy about all the pitfalls of country living for city dwellers), and GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE, in which Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan buy a ramshackle old house which, by screen magic, they finally succeed in turning into something that belongs on the cover of "House Beautiful". And the wonderful Percy Kilbride was so hilarious in his dry monotone voice that Benny and Sheridan cracked up every time they shared a scene with him.A combination of those two flicks has been updated to reflect the Yuppie sensibilities of the '80s. At first, the humor here is pretty savvy and the jokes come fast and furious. But then, by the time TOM HANKS has fallen in cement and endured hundreds of pratfalls at the expense of a weak script, we've had enough. It gets to be a one-joke thing, with a couple of sub-plots thrown in as a means to divert the audience before the set-up for the next house joke that drives the film toward its conclusion.TOM HANKS and SHELLEY LONG are gifted at light comedy and, fortunately, they both have moments to shine as the young couple who put all their money into a house sold to them by MAUREEN STAPLETON. But the jokes wear thin pretty after too many pratfalls and the humor runs out of steam about mid-way through the film.Treat yourself to either MR. BLANDINGS or GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT HERE for better takes on this sort of thing. And there's something quaint about the real estate prices mentioned in these films at a time when mansions could be bought for $20,000!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I looked over all the reviews here and so many people just LOVED this film, it was so FUNNY! What could possibly tie these reviewers together. Surely the film is too old to have the studio bribe them. They can't ALL be the writers of this whimsical farce, can they? What could it be? Then I saw it! They were all kids when The Money Pit was released. They remember their hand-clapping joy at watching a bathtub fall through several floors or seeing a staircase collapse. They were kids and kids love slapstick. Adults used to love slapstick, back when film was young and Buster Keaton was a genius.This contrived Hollyweird potboiler is a throwback to the studio contract player days when they had to regularly crank out formulaic drivel for the masses. You know, like TV. What a piece of unwatchable crap. What a star-studded lineup of talent (look at the credits) gone to waste. What a chance to do something better with your time, like scoop out the litter box and wash the kitchen trash pail; something you can actually enjoy doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravely stretching the definition of Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a rather good effort at making the worst romantic comedy ever. Even being used to films treating me like an idiot, I was mildly surprised by The Money Pit ('Spielberg Presents').The 'film' presents a beautifully symmetric structure. It is framed by a ludicrous prelude and a preposterous postlude. At the centre stands one- long gag, repeated over and over. Lacking any kind of plot or character development this lovely mindless RomCom is brutally brought to a brutally lovely end by the most painful of narrative clichés. --- NO MUCH TO SPOIL SPOILER ---So, here are a little more details if you are curious about Hanks's worst film but have wisely decided not to watch it. If it's surreal fun what you're after, you might be better off going back to Lynch.The central part of the film is one long gag about a house literally - oh yes so very delightfully literally - falling apart. Hanks's character keeps injuring his spinal cord and getting electrocuted but, alas, he does not die. Eheh, that's funny.Then, 20 minutes to the end, when I was almost getting used to the total lack of narrative drive, and was learning how to sink deep into my sofa to enjoy the film as mere abstract visual pleasure, something started to happen. It was like - the film-makers suddenly realising that this was meant to be a romantic comedy. So yes, they come up with the twist: She has dinner with her ex-husband and wakes up in her bed! Ah! Her husband tells her they had sex! Ah! She does not remember but believes him! Ah! OBSTACLE to the ROMANCE! Just now that Hanks had learnt how not to get electrocuted. Oh dear. Hanks is hurt, the two split up. But then, 5 minutes to the end... oh well I am not going to spoil this for you... but you're up for a big surprise!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a real waste of talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing that two such talented actors as Shelley Long and Tom Hanks can produce something that--at its best moments--rises to mediocrity, but spends most of its time lurking in sheer awfulness.If you liked Diane Chambers (on Cheers), you will not like this heroine. She is neither intelligent, nor caring, nor committed, in short there is nothing likable about her. We never have a sense of why she hooked up with Tom in the first place, or why she sticks it out through the long ordeal of the re-construction.There are a number of minor sub-plots, none of which amount to anything and leave you scratching your head at the end, thinking "why was that there?" The transvestites, for instance, what did that contribute? Or Tom's father? Why was he even in this story? On the positive side, there are a few pratfalls and slapstick scenes that will make you chuckle here and there. But it's lost amid the morass of bad writing and predictability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Money Pit" is an underrated, romantic, slapstick comedy. A young couple Tom Hanks and Shelley Long are very much in love with each other and want to buy the home of their dreams. They finally find a large house going cheap and move in; but it's not long before one hilarious disaster after another happens. The house is falling apart along with their bank account and they get deeper and deeper into debt and their relationship starts to fall apart. There are some really great, very colorful characters interspersed throughout, resulting in some great comedy. There's also a lot of slap-stick which even if it's not your usual cup-of-tea would be hard not to enjoy.In this movie, the script writer and set technicians are king. These professionals ought to have a showcase for their talents to be spotlighted from time to time, and they sure made the most of the opportunity with this one. The calamitous frailty of this ostensibly beautiful house renders so many brilliantly done scenes that this movie still makes me laugh out loud after seeing it several times. A joke loses all its power to amuse after the surprise of the punch-line is lost, but these sight-gags are so funny I can break out laughing while driving down a lonely highway just thinking about them. Some movies lose their effectiveness because the makers get confused and try to do too may things - the message gets muddled. The best movies exhibit no such confusion and tell their story with minimal distraction. This movie is about this house, and what these artists do with this prop is brilliantly and enduringly funny.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Good, Could Use Less Emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young couple struggles to repair a hopelessly dilapidated house.This is very much a classic 1980s comedy. And apparently, you can find it packaged with "The Burbs", which makes a lot of sense. Both Tom Hanks at that certainly period in his life, and both what I would call B-level comedies (whereas "Big" would be A-level).Much of the film is pretty funny, but I think it is hindered by the emotional aspect. I understand that is a part of the plot, but the way the characters react at that point is unbelievable -- even in a film full of unbelievable situations. I am also confused why the main character is an attorney. He doesn't seem very bright, and the things they have him doing seem more appropriate for an accountant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheers to the bosom buddies of Hanks and Long.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the epitome of a 1980's popcorn film, the type of date film that appealed to both men and women (of all age) in pre-politically correct America. Filled with a ton of Three Stooges style farce, it is as filled with "Uh oh!" moments as the Mich later released "Home Alone" movies. Unhappilly divorced Shelley Long is loving in her ex-husband's house with boyfriend Tom Hanks when the temperamental former husband returns, putting the two of them out on the street. The couple decides to buy the beautiful but cheap mansion from wacky Maureen Stapleton which turns out to be a HUGE mistake. Falling front doors, collapsing curved stairways, faulty electricity and disgusting plumbing are just a few of the problems. Over-charging carpenters and plumbers, temperamental permit inspectors and the horny ex become a few more issues. Hanks finds himself battling the electricity (which results in a flying cooked turkey shooting out of the stove as a Julia Child program airs in the background, collapsing scaffolding and most hysterically, a carpeting with Hanks inside that slowly sinks through the floor are among the comic highlights.An abundance of over-the-top obnoxious characters make this at times difficult to take, but there were so many moments that had me laughing hysterically that I was able to forgive the dis-likable elements of the script. I would have liked to have seen more of the always lovable Stapleton as well as soap favorite Douglas Watson ("Another World"), seen in a prologue as Hank's father (getting married in Rio) which seems to be instantly forgotten. Alexander Houdenov, as Long's ex, is beyond despicable, and each scene he has makes me cringe. So don't expect a "Mr. Blandings", " The Egg and I" or even "Green Acres", but an occasionally pleasing comedy of moments, if not manners.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great good feeling comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great comedy with Walter (Tom Hanks) and Anna (Shelly Long) buying a big house in the country just to find out all is not what seems. After being kicked out of Anna's ex boyfriend Max's (Alexander Goudonov) apartment because Max has come back from being out of town, Walter and Anna have nowhere to go. I, for one, am surprised that a woman's ex would allow her to stay there with her new boyfriend while he is not there, but Max is also Anna's symphony conductor and she plays the violin in the symphony. Walter is a lawyer who happens to have connections with major celebrities such as a rock band who the band leader says he likes Walter better than his family, a spoiled child star, and a transvestite acting group who wants to use Merryl Streep as the name of their act. With the jobs Walter and Anna have, and the people they know, you would think that they have problems that wouldn't amount to a hill of beans. But Walter still complains when they're kicked out of Max's apartment about how broke they are. But the whole first part of the film is done with humor and wit. And they have an amazingly quick and easy time finding this big, nice looking house and the money to buy it. But it's when they move in when their problems really begin. And that's when the really funny parts of the film happen. The staircase collapses, the kitchen goes all haywire, the front door falls off it's hinges, a bathtub falls through the floor, and the water from their pipes looks like there was a nearby bust in a major sewer line. Not just these events, but Walter and Anne's reactions is what helps make these scenes so funny. Then there's the workmen and they're funny characters too. The carpenter thinks that every time a woman calls a carpenter, she's looking for the "ol hammer and nail". The plumber demands a drink of scotch and a five thousand dollar check, then leaves refusing to even glance at the plumbing. (Look out for the gag at both of them driving away to the same part of the same song) Then the work crew, who looks more like a biker and hot wheels gang, just further tear up their house to shreds and won't repair anything until Walter sees the permit man, who he himself is a rather difficult person. This movie really is one of a kind, a real feel good movie. Then there's the humorous character of Max the symphony conductor, who is so wry and conceded, in a pretty funny way. I've actually only ever seen Alexander Godonov in one other film before, and that's the brief Amish scene in the awful movie " North". And interestingly enough, that brief Amish scene was about the only good scene in that entire horrible film. Anyway, there's even more good scenes in "The money pit" I haven't written here, but you'll have to see the film to see them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Money Pit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the early Hanks comedies that cemented his position as one of the hottest upcoming comedy stars in Hollywood (after 'Splash'). Even though this movie has been overlooked for me its easily one of his better early movies. Although most of Hanks films have an abundance of heart this one also has a relatable subject in house renovation.Tom Hanks (Walter) and Shelley Long (Anna) buy a huge country mansion that would normally go for around one million, but because the place is falling apart (unbeknownst to them) its going for $200,000. The initial joke being in this day and age this ginormous property would be selling for a lot more than one measly million, but that's to be expected. The laughs come thick and fast as they realise the mansion is a lemon and is literately coming apart bit by bit. They have been well and truly had by the previous owner.Now far be it for me to nitpick at a light-hearted piece of comedy gold from the classic Tom Hanks 80's era but...lets go. The couple say they have no money whatsoever, indeed they have to borrow a sh*t-tonne just to buy the place, yet when they move in they are faced with massive repairs. The question that springs to mind is how on earth they afford to pay for all this. Sure both of them work so that will help but my God this mansion clearly requires some hefty workmanship that ain't gonna come cheap. Some of the things that go wrong are definitely laugh out loud worthy but Jesus the cost!!Huge holes in the floor, a new bath tub, new electrics, new TV, new front door and surrounding wooden frame, broken windows, an entire new chimney both interior and exterior plus new fireplace, complete new plumbing, huge new wooden staircase, holes in the roof etc...Take into account that this is a property bordering on a stately home and most fittings will need specialist attention and most probably with handmade craftsmanship to boot! The staircase alone would of cost an absolute fortune, and then the entire chimney stack!! So I am left wondering how they could even begin to pay for all this on top of the fact they have borrowed money to buy the house. Hanks character does put down an initial down payment of $5,000 but I doubt that would even begin to cover much.What is so sickly about the whole thing (so cutesy) is the fact that whilst all this is going on, in between all the horror that unfolds around them...both try and remain calm, expressing their love for each other and with Anna constantly reminding Walter everything will be OK. In reality I'm sure most people would have a break down. The weird aspect in the movie is that the building contractors appear to be this clan of fetish circus freaks. Big muscle men in bondage gear, little people and various types of punks all driving the type of vehicles you'd expect to find in the Mad Max franchise. Not really sure why they went down that route because it isn't particularly funny...just odd. I guess its suppose to freak you out because it looks like they're gonna ruin the place or squat there and the love birds will have more trouble on their hands. I think people can relate to this movie simply because many will have experience of buying a place and having problems occur, be it down the line or straight away. I'm sure some will have experience that will have been just as horrific as in this movie, so watching this will certainly hit home for some. Indeed it does make you wince whilst watching, seeing this amazing mansion slowly crumble bit by bit, it does make your palms sweat at the thought of the spiralling costs whilst at the same time make you glad its not real...or its not you. Its all harmless fun with some good stunts, a bit of slapstick, a lovely real time house presumably combined with sets and an overly energetic Hanks. Oh and what's this...Anna's ex- husband is the main psychotic German henchman terrorist from 'Die Hard', how bout that.6/10</fullReview>

The first hour we are treated with all sorts of construction and other accidents (some of them minutely and ingeniously devised) - a lot of fun at times - and the last hour the film remembers to be a romantic comedy also, which does have its moments; Tom Hanks and Shelley Long prove they carry this.So, yes, a lot of fun with Walter and the bathtub when he... and with that disappearing carpet... and in the romcom part when the bedroom light malfunctions. And so on and so forth. I first thought about 6 out of 10, but after adding things up...7 out of 10, easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Money Pit will make you laugh, even if it's dating a bit. By now, you could consider it a period piece of the 80s. The main idea is very interesting, and the characters mostly interesting.The house is fabulous, and each event is a riot. The first time you view it, it's at its funniest, but you'll like to see it again, just to relive the whole catastrophe.I'd say that the main downside is the construction crew which is exaggerated to a point where it pulls you out of the movie. An other sad point is the final scene, but then it goes with the values of the time.If you're looking for a classic, especially if you like Tom Hanks, this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine 80s Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved Tom Hanks here more than I do in his better films. He was the everyman. Here, he plays a New York City lawyer and his girlfriend is played by Shelley Long. They decide to buy a house in the suburbs from Maureen Stapleton's character. She's a riot in this film. It's weird seeing the Twin Towers that dominated the New York City skyline long before the events of September 11, 2001. Now I fondly look for films set and filmed in New York City. This film was done entirely at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. There are some city shots although not as impressive. Shelley Long's character Anna is a professional violinist who is divorced by a womanizing Russian conductor. Richard Benjamin does a good job in directing the story. Granted, it's not a great film but it's a fine film. I love seeing Another World's Douglass Watson who played Hanks's father in the beginning and end of the film. The rest of the cast included Philip Bosco and others. The writing isn't great but Hanks and Long make it worth watching in the first place as the couple whose life and new home is on the rocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. This movie is starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. This movie is about a young couple who struggles to repair a hopelessly dilapidated house. Some women they don't know sold a house to them but what they did not know is that it is completely broken. So while they are at that house slowly everything starts falling apart. EVEN THE STAIRS,now they have to use a super long ladder to get up stairs, I mean if the up stairs is still there. It is a hilarious comedy. It should have gotten 10 stars out of 10 in my opinion. I watched this movie on a very boring day and this movie made my day. I recommend it to all people that love to watch beyond hilarious comedies. Also what I liked about it is that it had one of my favorite actors, Tom Hanks( Saving Private Ryan, Forest Gump,and Toy Story. I would give it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Buddy, did you really buy this house"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Get out the hammer and nails. For a couple buying a house this should be a dream come true, however for Tom Hanks and Shelley Long they find the home of their dreams is anything but. Being somewhat in already debt, this house only plunges them deeper with only their love holding them together. But that connection is also tested, as one minor disaster leads onto another mishap and again another seeing everything including the kitchen sink succumbs to the money pit. Like Hanks mutters "I'm sinking into the money pit". After being evicted from their Manhattan apartment, Walter and Anna need to find somewhere to live and they come across an old house in the country. The house looks perfect, but they seem unsure to why it's selling so cheap. "Why would someone sell a million dollar house for 200 thousand"? Without any hesitation they purchase it and as soon as they move in they realise that the house is virtually falling apart. In the process of trying to repair the shambles it starts to cause a strain on their relationship. Produced by Steven Spielberg. Richard Benjamin was chosen to direct and populates this flavoursome loud, accident prone romantic comedy with madcap visual gags with the combination of Hanks and Long being charmingly projected. The script is bright and snappy (loved the on- going missile quips "You testing missiles here or what?") with an old- fashion story that's symbolic in its depiction of love and commitment within an elaborate death-trap. What starts of with a narrative becomes a series of problematically creative sketches (sinking carpet) with amusing side-characters. Alexander Godunov is good fun as Anne's pushy European ex-boyfriend and there's fitting small roles for Joe Mantegna, Maureen Stapleton, Philip Bosco and Josh Mostel. Plus the motley crew of workers in what feels like a circus parade have some familiar faces in Mike Starr, Frankie Faison, Nestor Serrano and Jake Steinfeld."The Money Pit" is a strangely transfixing mid-80s comedy that simply brings down the house."Ah, home crap home".</fullReview>

Shelly Long, on the other hand, is very watchable and so there is an almost-reasonable balance here.By and large the story canters along OK and the scenes are decorated with some colourful characters, but it's all a little lightweight and one-dimensional.If 1960s-style comedy and 1980s fashions are your thing, then you will probably enjoy this. Anyone with a taste for more sophisticated or edgy humour will probably not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The House Is The Lead of It !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is undoubtedly a lovely time. It makes you laugh from start to finish. There is a clear intention to pay a big homage to the silent cinema and the slapstick history. The cast did it so fine. The directing made great cartoon for most of the time. But as much this was perfect fun, as much it gave me something to criticize.The house is the actual lead of it, with all the non-stop problems and the different sketches. Which leaves the storyline of the young lovers so thin in comparison. I didn't feel utterly any symbolism in this story; as if the house, one way or another, embodies the ups and downs of the 2 leads' relationship.Ahhh. The 1980s. I have all the passion in the world for such a decade. The movies were innocently enjoyable.. without toilet humor, nasty jokes, naked people, free heavy bad tasting.. to the end of what we're living now. Along with that, but not too far from nostalgia, I was in love with even more factors..(Shelley Long)'s delightful beauty. She's so ordinary yet so sexy (great legs by the way; I feel that the producers intended to show them off in all of her movies as a lead in the 1980s!). I loved the classic music. That was smart touch, especially with a long comic sequence. Look at (Hanks)'s outfits as well. Simply "Classic" is something fills this movie up to a degree charms me.In fact I love this movie as it is. It's my love that pushed me to complain, because with another ? more present ? plot this could have been more than just nice visual farce. To the fans only : in 1986 there were other movies that can compete for being in the 1980s ultimate tops such as (Wise Guys), (Legal Eagles), and (The Boy Who Could Fly).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly slapstick comedy/romance...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 6/14/2010 -- 4 out of 10 (Dir-Richard Benjamin): Silly slapstick comedy/romance about a house that falls down around a couple played by Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. The movie has a few funny bits as different parts of the house crumble at random times, but most of the movie is flat. The story starts as the Hanks' character's father gets married in Rio de Janeiro but this character doesn't come back til the very end of the movie and really isn't developed or mentioned much else. Hank's character is a lawyer who gets people out of trouble after his father supposedly steals from them(what a strange father-son relationship this is?) and Long's character is a musician who used to be married to a conductor -- who pops in and out of the story occasionally. They then buy a house -- which looks good initially -- but then bit-by-bit falls apart to the point where it has to be totally rebuilt. The problem with the movie is that the character's aren't developed very well and the house and it's crumbling(including some interesting sets &amp; special effects) becomes the main plot. Long and Hanks don't really play well together and it shows a little too often, also. They try to bring in a mushy romantic ending, but at this point no-one really cares and we're just waiting for the movie to end. This movie proves that slapstick really doesn't work very well these days in movies and it's embarrassing that Spielberg has his name attached to this. Although, this isn't the only movie with his name attached that flopped --- remember 1941, and at least on this one he's just the executive producer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A typical '80's slapstick farce style comedy that would have been a lot more fun if it wasn't burdened with a lot of needless sub-plot clutter. The film's one-joke premise of a couple trying to renovate a disintegrating fixer-upper house was a clever idea. Apparently, however, the film makers believed peripheral stories should be tossed in.Tom Hanks is a plus for every movie he's in, and he makes the most of what the script offers. Most of the comic material in the script is recycled stuff, but Hanks manages to hit the right level of slapstick to generate some humor from it. Shelley Long displays great comic timing and delivery too, and she and Hanks make a pretty cute couple to look at.The house falling to pieces whenever somebody touches something is an OK idea, but it only can carry a story so far, even with the strong lead actors. After a while, everything falling apart or falling down, or falling on characters gets stale. By the time a long winded scene of a domino-effect series of destructive accidents takes place, the joke is over. Then there's weird characters thrown in that just annoy the principal characters and the audience. The unwanted suitor bit is worthless and unfunny, especially the counterfeit accent the actor does. A few other comic relief characters, based on tiresome stereotypes used way too often in this sort of movie, are just extra baggage with no laughs.The movie has moments, especially early on. If the director had utilized Hanks and Long to the level of their talents, this movie would have been more akin to a Tracy/Hepburn screwball comedy. Instead, some of the comic potential falls apart much like the house does.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually rented 'The Money Pit' a few years ago. After all, a movie with Tom Hanks, how could it go wrong?? Maybe because I have been a home-owner for so many years, and have this irrational fear that something really bad and expensive will happen to mine. But this is a difficult movie for me to watch, and I don't find it funny at all. It is ironic that as much as I like Hanks, two of the movies I find very difficult to watch are his. The other one is 'The 'Burbs.' Anyway, the critic Ebert has a good review of 'The Money Pit', I won't repeat any of it here. Suffice to say I believe the IMDb votes have been unusually kind to this movie, I would rate it '3' on the 10-point scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had Just seen it less than 2 weeks ago on TNT. It was at 1:00 in the morning, I didn't get to see the first 30 minutes but I began to watch it because of Shelley Long. I loved it so much that I stayed up the whole night trying to see when it would be on again. well no luck. I talked to my mom about and she had it taped because she loved it to. We couldn't find it so she went out and bought. It has only been almost 2 weeks and I have seen it about 2.5 billon time. Even though it was made the same year I was born (13 years ago) I love it so much. The end is my fave part. The Argument is so sad then they get back together with a big kiss and get married. If you haven't seen the Movie go out and rent it is soooooooo good. It's about a girl (Shelley Long) and a guy (Tom Hank) and the ex husband. They buy a house and it comes crashing down on them. It is soooooooooo good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first film was great, the second one was good, the third one not so good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It all started with the play "George Washington Slept Here" based on the true story of the need for a bigger home in the country and the problems that would follow. It was subsequently made into an hilarious film starring Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan. Cary Grant and Myrna Loy starred in the remake called "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House." It wasn't quite as funny, and the story line was somewhat abbreviated from the original, but Grant and Loy are perfectly cast and always entertaining. Television made "Mr. Blandings" a classic though video should give "George Washington" it's due. A pre-Oscar Tom Hanks (in his "The Burbs," "Turner and Hooch" days) and a post-Cheers Shelley Long bring the comedy down a knotch or two and pretty much eliminate any of the points made in the first two films. I have heard that many people have enjoyed this film, but if you watch the first two in order, and then this one, you probably will end up tossing this one out of your collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Blandings " Rebuilds" His Dreamhouse...without a permit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an out and out example of plagiarism, at its worst. The story is based upon the earlier film from the late 1940's called "Mr Blandings Builds His Dreamhouse" that starred Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvin Douglas. That film is chock full of sophisticated humor and even slapstick comedy as only the incomparable Cary Grant could perform. Myrna Loy is constant as his seductive but loyal wife and Melvin Douglas as her old college boyfriend who was beat out by Cary. This later adaptation, if you care to call it that for the purpose of keeping it clean, is a writer's and director's mulligan stew of ineptness, not to mention the sophomoric performances of the leading "actors". For me it's like comparing a fine vintage wine with sewer water. Why don't these "indies" really act like indies and write their own stories to screw up instead of messing around with something that was done perfectly the first time around? Miss this one like the plague!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To collapse with laughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film tells the story of a young couple and a house. Walter is a failed showbiz agent who kills himself to work and pay the debts left by his father, who fled with the money of brokered artists. Anna is violinist and member of the orchestra directed by her ex- husband, Max, a conductor with a blonde hair only smaller than your ego. Forced to move from the apartment where they live and faced with the real estate jungle of Manhattan, they end up buying a small mansion in a deal that seems like a dream come true... a dream that will crumbling slowly, as the weaknesses of the old house are becoming evident, for madness of the two lovebirds and delight of the audience.Walter is represented by a young Tom Hanks, in a stage of his career where he made several comedies. Despite the youth, we can recognize many of the characteristics of this actor which we can see, more developed, in films of his maturity. Anna is embodied by Shelley Long, a actress particularly skilled in comedies. Joe Mantegna also has a role as Art Shirk, a quite wealthy plumber. The film was directed by David Giler and Steven Spielberg, and is the beginning of a good collaboration between Spielberg and Hanks, who will result, in the future, in some successes like "Saving Private Ryan". The jokes of context and situation prevails, as well as the hilarious grimacing of the two main actors and a fabulous (and famous) Hanks laugh, well-remembered by those who like this film. In the midst of so many good points, just one less good note: I believe the script superficially explores the comic opportunities brought about by love triangle Walter-Anna-Maestro, introducing elements of conflict very late and giving them lightly solutions at the end of the film.In the beginning, this comedy doesn't seem to have anything new or special. It's just a comedy of the eighties, a decade when this genre was very exploited and, to be honest, battered by several absolutely disastrous films. But is exactly by that, partially, why "The Money Pit" deserves to be noteworthy: because it's so good and works so well. This film, a remake of a forties comedy, is a guarantee of laughter, no matter we are watching for the first time or the hundredth time in our lives. It's a film that does't tire to review over and over again. It is always funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some early belly laughs, then some really misguided moves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Hanks and Shelley Long play a married couple who buy a "dream house" for a ridiculously low price only to find out it is a money-sucking nightmare in this uneven and often misguided comedy.The film makes one fondly remember the much better Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, wherein Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are the couple finding a rather rocky road to success in home ownership. Hanks and Long have adequate (if not spectacular) chemistry and do their best. Unfortunately, they can do nothing to overcome the simplistic screenplay and taciturn direction from Richard Benjamin (has he ever directed a good movie?) There are some genuine laughs, but they all happen fairly early in the proceedings. The film works best when concentrating on the problems the couple has with the house. The sequences with Hanks on the crumbling staircase while Long fights off a nasty raccoon, the bathtub scenes and the chimney scene are pretty amusing. Unfortunately, the screenplay moves away from that into areas that are unfunny and cumbersome, and which also make the lead characters seem unforgivably stupid.One might be able to make the initial jump that these two could be taken in by Maureen Stapleton's obvious con of showing them the house only at night by candlelight (and that is a BIG stretch), but some of their subsequent decisions are equally dumb. Hanks' dealings with a bevy of shady contractors is both unoriginal and irritating. And let's not even discuss the tragically unfunny balletic slapstick sequence in the latter half where Hanks tries to do a Buster Keaton routine on scaffolding and runaway carts purportedly caused by Long trying to find an available plug in the house. It is not only badly choreographed, but cringeworthy.The above could be forgiven to some extent, except the latter portion of the film saddles the leads with an incredibly tiresome did-she-or-didn't-she sleep with her ex-husband subplot. The ex-husband in question is played by the late ballet dancer/actor Alexander Godunov in full lounge lizard mode. We do not believe for one moment that it happened, but this is used to drive a wedge in between Hanks and Long leading to constant bickering, which only succeeds in making them tiresome and unlikable in the moments when we should really be sympathizing with them. It also takes time away from the house, which should be the central comedic force. It also means that the latter portion of the film gives Long almost no comedy sequences and a lot of moments where she is either disagreeable or fretful.By the time the film reaches its conclusion, it seemed longer than it truly is and is fairly forgettable, but for a couple of minor laughs in the opening stretch. Fans of Hanks and Long may rate it slightly higher, but both (especially Hanks) have had better showings elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fear and Loathing of Home Ownership</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every new homeowner's worst nightmare, as experienced by a pair of almost-average mid '80s DINKs. They sink a fortune into this place, a secluded estate that looks too good to be true and, of course, falls apart around them mere moments after key touches palm. Mid-lifers will find it easy to relate with this couple, played by Tom Hanks and Shelley Long, as they seem familiar and good-natured if a bit naive. Their ability to procure huge sums of money at the drop of a hat is a red flag, though, and the soapy complications of their personal lives actually serve to distance them from the audience. Hanks is a riot, especially when he descends into madness at the height of his misery, but Long may as well have been a wooden set piece. Try as he might, our leading man just can't draw a performance out of her and the duo's serious lack of chemistry is a problem. Funny in a Seinfeldian car crash, looking-through-our-fingers kind of way, the plot skips over the moment where its players' fates shift from disaster to redemption and the payoff, as a result, feels flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate House From Hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Money Pit stars Tom Hanks and Shelley Long as a couple who buy what they think is their dream house. It'd old and it seems to need some fixing, but they're young and in love and see it as an interesting adventure.Then the house literally starts falling to pieces.There's nothing in the house that works. The floor has holes; the electric system doesn't work; stairs fall down; even the trees in the garden are so frail one falls down when Hanks' character tries to cut out one of those cute heart-shaped messages with a couple's name inside them.They hire a team to fix the house, which basically involves rebuilding it almost from scratch. The humor in this movie comes from many different sources: there's the acting from Hanks and Long, which is perfect in terms of timing; then there is the situational comedy, involving elaborate gags with props and sets, that would have made Chaplin and Keaton proud. There's also the dialogue, which is full of good lines. Then there's the obnoxious behavior of the construction team, and finally the sadistic car-accident-gazing pleasure of just watching the lives of this couple unravel.The Money Pit is hardly a great movie, but for what it is, it's perfect, one of the best comedies I've ever seen in my life, charming, unpredictable, bittersweet.</fullReview>

When they buy the lemon of a house and things go extremely to a pile of rubble. I think the best part within the film is when tom turns the lights on in the kitchen and the wire sparks with flames, then the TV blows up, the fan turns on and blows out the gas. He takes a match to it and the turkey goes through the window into the bucket in the bathroom. If you like the best bit within the film it is when the bath falls through the floor. These are just some of the highlights within the film. Please, please, please remember this film was made in 1986 and not 2010.

		<shortDescription>The house that roared...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rather enjoyed this mid 80's farce, as, fearing a Brat Pack teen-angst type movie, I was pleasantly surprised to see the film aim at a slightly higher age group. Thus there's little vulgarity, a simple story line any new house-holder can relate to and some genuinely comedic situations to raise a smile. While it may rely a little too much on knockabout farce, hey, it was good enough for Buster Keaton decades ago and the stunts involved are inventive and amusing.Of course the dilapidated house palmed on to young twenty-somethings Hanks and Long is pretty much a character in itself as bit by bit it falls apart on our young charges in ever more improbable ways and steadfastly resists all their plucky attempts at renovation.While the movie focuses on the action in the house it works just fine. Hanks and Long mesh well enough although the latter does seem a little too old for her toy boy lover. Away from the house the exposition is unnecessarily contrived, what with Hanks' job as an accountant for the rock industry and Long's as violinist for a symphony orchestra. Throw in Long's over-the-top hunk of a "not-over-her" ex-husband who's a stereotypically charismatic (= temperamental) orchestra conductor, Hanks' main petulant child-star client and just too many eccentric tradesmen for whom "two weeks" is a lifetime so that the pudding seemed over-egged to me.Nevertheless Hanks sells it for all he's worth, he taking most of the pratfalls as the house collapses around him. Even in this early role he shows a little depth to his character, unlike Long as his co-star who, engaging as she sometimes is, is just too one-dimensional in her trademark "Diane Chambers" persona. Look deeper and you'll also see the great Joe Mantegna wasted in a "blink-and-you-miss-him" supporting role.As for the stunts, some of them are really remarkable and convincing, like when the stairs fall away from Hanks' feet long before "A Nightmare on Elm Street", the bath falling through the floor and the chimney coming down the fireplace. There are some neat one-liners too, I'll settle for Hanks' "Home Crap Home" as the best of themI think viewers like me will probably remember the sight gags of this movie more than the weak romantic comedy narrative or even the acting of the players. But I repeat, if it was good enough for Buster Keaton...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes Funny, Always Loud and Fast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 1950s there were a series of films dealing with problems encountered by an increasingly prosperous and suburban America. Building a house, having your daughter get married, your first child, your first grandchild. Most of them were well written and amusing. "The Money Pit" belongs to that series but, inasmuch as it's already been done, is a little retro. But it's also updated. This isn't the story of a bourgeois family erecting a rural estate, as in "Mister Blandings Builds His Dream House." This couple (Tom Hanks and Shelley Long) aren't married; they're (gasp) cohabiting. Furthermore, it isn't just Daddy who brings home the bacon. Shelley Long works as a violinist in the orchestra of her ex husband, Alex Gudonov.It's different from "Mister Blandings" in other ways too. It's less subdued. The earlier film, which followed in general the same paths to similar laughs, clearly was aimed at an audience of adults who were all moving to Levittowns in 1950. The gags were mostly conversational and situational. Here the pace is pushed and people shout and have arguments, and the laughs depend far more on collapsing staircases and the disintegration of several stages of platforms against the walls. It's closer to Laurel and Hardy.But, aside from the jokes that the kids will appreciate, there are still some stingingly funny exchanges in the dialog, as when Hanks calls the local plumber and is quizzed by the plumber about things like his age, his insurance, his annual income, his job history. Some good lines are given to Gudonov as the orchestra conductor. At a rehearsal: "The union rules say I must release you for lunch. Those of you with a conscience and a taste for Haydn will not be able to eat it." And, commiserating with Hanks after Long leaves him: "You have just lost the best woman you will ever meet and you will regret it the rest of your life. Of course, I lost the same woman but it doesn't matter because I am shallow and self centered." I don't want to give away any more of the jokes because, pratt falls aside, there aren't really that many of them.You've seen most of the jokes before in earlier movies or in sitcoms. The filthy water coming from the faucet, the exploding oven, the collapsing mattress, the leaking roof. But they're still amusing and some of the dialog is sprightly, like Shelley Long, a pretty blond who assumes a most inelegant position while bending over or squatting. She's like a young kid who is unaware of the way she's throwing her limbs around.If there isn't much that's new, the film still floats along good-naturedly and gets the job of diversion done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first 3/4 of the movie I was laughing and it was great. But when you get to the last 1/4 it takes a turn for the worse.This woman got so drunk that she can't remember what happened and then she thinks that she slept with somebody other than good 'ol Tom Hanks. Then she lies to him about it. To Hanks said that he didn't care if she did it as long as she didn't lie. When she finally tells him, after she has lied about it, he gets angry at her (obviously). Then the stupid part, she gets angry at him that he isn't more understanding!! She got so drunk she can't remember what happened, thinks she slept with some other guy, and then she has the audacity to claim that he should be more understanding. That just made me so upset I could not enjoy the rest of the movie. He should have left her on the spot, not because of what she did (or we find out didn't but was so drunk it doesn't matter) but because she is such a colossal stupid person, to keep it PG. She messed up. No matter his reaction, especially after she lied to him, she should be begging to be back with him. There is no logical reason for her to be upset. So much of a double standard it is ridiculous. Lost all respect for her character and didn't like the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MONEY PIT stars Tom Hanks and Shelley Long as an unmarried but together couple who decide to buy a broken down old house in the country and rebuild it. Though the film resembles the old Cray Grant-Myrna Loy film MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE, this film definitely has an 80's sensibility and showcases Hanks' effortless ability to pull off slapstick comedy. I love the scene where he falls through the carpet covering the hole in the floor and gets trapped in the hole. There are very few actors who could have pulled this scene off (Jim Carrey comes to mind) but Hanks makes the scene very funny, especially when he starts singing the "Name Game" song to pass the time. The late Alexander Goudenov is very funny as Long's ex-lover as is Maureen Stapleton as the woman they buy the house from. Not the greatest comedy ever made, but still very watchable due to the effortless charisma of one Tom Hanks.</fullReview>

Given the stress of buying a new home, coupled with the realization of the decrepit nature of the same purchased house- lends believability to the extreme reactions the two lead characters exhibit as they discover to what exact degree they have been duped. Resulting in a catharsis that what matters most is their love for each other not the ownership of material positions...in this case, The Money Pit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Money Pit" is definitely one of the greatest comedies to come out of the 80s. It makes me laugh so hard every time I watch it. Shelley Long and Tom Hanks play a yuppie couple who think they have found the house of their dreams but once they move in they realize that the house is not what it has cracked up to be. It's a trainwreck! The stairs fall apart, the roof leaks, the electricity burns out, the porcelain bathtub falls through the floor and is smashed to pieces, the shelves in the closet fall apart, and a whole bunch of other stuff happens that they hadn't planned on happening. I absolutely love this movie. One of my favorite scenes is where the bathtub falls and Shelley and Tom are standing there looking at it in disbelief. And then all of a sudden Tom starts laughing his head off. The way he is laughing is unforgettable. The scene where the couple are arguing after he thinks she slept with the Max is also one of my favorites."You're so much less attractive when I'm sober." "Thank God it's not that often." "Alright! That's it! I'm leaving!" This is a great comedy and it shouldn't be missed by any fans of this genre. Thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this movie so hated by the critics ? I thought and still think it was a very funny movie about a proverbial white elephant of a house that was falling in on itself accompanied by the slapstick efforts of Tom Hanks and Shelley Long to keep it together. While some of the disasters border on the surreal, the infidelity sub-plot is unnecessary, but Hanks' efforts to collect on all of his IOU's could have been expanded. The repeated catch phrase "It looks like they test missiles here." still kills me every time I watch this movie. This movie, though, probably has become somewhat of a cult hit because it features actress Louise Robey in her rocker persona before her successful role in the short-lived "Friday The Thirteenth" tv series. I say let this movie stand as a warning to anyone buying a house who thinks he is getting a great deal.</fullReview>

One of the best, IMHO, is when Tom wanders around with something over his face obstructing his view. He finally falls into a cart up on the roof of their house which is being "fixed" and everything begins to topple, to great music. -- in slow motion. I cannot describe it at all decently. It will make you howl with laughter... Tom Hanks is fabulous in this role. Heck both he and Diane are.

So-so domestic farce/screwball comedy homage to the thirties and forties genre with Yuppies Hanks and Long buying the house from hell watching it fall apart just as their relationship does the same. Best bit: Hanks' slapstick attempt to get a bucket of water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Witty, harmless and pleasant slapstick-comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that part of me is missing the sympathetic Tom Hanks who used to do exclusively comedies like "Big" and "Turner &amp; Hooch". Then again the day when he started to act in serious roles was the day when the world of cinema was utterly blessed. "The Bonfire of the vanities", "Forrest Gump", "Saving Private Ryan", "The Green mile"...you name it. During the 90's he made himself one of the big ones. "The Money pit" is a funny memento of the time when Hanks was generally known as a comedian. Slapstick-comedy like this was a very rare, almost dead genre in the 80's. This film brought back the amusement of the old silent shorts. They don't make 'em like this anymore. What a pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Money Pit may not deserve to be on top of everybody's list, but sure as hell it's one of the most hilarious films I've ever seen. For all of you who claim it's flawed, I get it, but please forget about that and enjoy the string of accidents that happen in that house. Do not tell me they're not funny. I like both Tom Hanks and Shelley Long's performances, although his is funnier, as the hapless guy who can't find reliable workers for his new-bought house. Anyway, I have always liked Shelley Long since I first saw her in Cheers. She's always been very cute.Perhaps The Money Pit is not a must have, but certainly a MUST SEE.7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny movie with classic performances by all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who doesn't laugh at this movie (and you know who you are) doesn't have a funny bone. I read a review here that Leonard Maltin thought the Cary Grant movie "Mr. Blandings...Dream Home" was funnier than Money Pit. Well, I just saw that movie a couple of months ago and although it is charming as all get out, funny it ain't. Not funny ha-ha. (I appreciate Mr. Maltin cataloging movies for us freaks, but he and his reviewers have no taste.) The performances in this flick -- Shelly Long, Tom Hanks (altho not a favorite of mine), Alexander Godunov, are perfect, but there are three priceless supporting roles by Maureen Stapleton, Joe Mantegna (before he hit it big), and Philip Bosco. Stapleton's performance alone is worth seeing, along with Godunov's. This movie is perfect in every way and I think Richard Benjamin's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny Movie With a Ridiculous Beginning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walter Fielding Jr. is a broken manager, paying the debts of his crooked father (Douglass Watson), who escaped from USA and is living in Brazil. Walter and Anna (Shelley Long, with wonderful legs) live together in the apartment of her former husband, The Maestro, who is in Europe. However, The Maestro comes back unexpectedly. They have to move to a new place, and a friend of Walter advises him to tell a US$ 1,000,000 house in a bargain of US$ 200,000 from an old lady, who needs the money due to an extradition problem with her husband Carlos. They borrow the money and when they start living in their new home, they find out that the house is not exactly what they expected for. Although having a ridiculous beginning, this movie is really funny. The marriage of Walter Fielding Sr. in Rio de Janeiro in a `macumba' may be funny for foreigners. However, this type of marriage indeed does not exist. `Macumba' is a kind of religion for some persons, but it does not have marriage as showed in the movie. Anyway, the rest of the story is so funny, that it is a worthwhile entertainment. My vote is seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walter Fielding (Tom Hanks) and Anna Crowley (Shelley Long) are a New York couple who has to search for a new place after her wild ex-husband the Maestro Max Beissart comes home. They find a grand mansion at a very low price. The lonely old woman at the house con them with a wild story that force them to buy blindly. Only when they move in, things fall apart.This was probably the height of Shelley Long's popularity. Tom Hanks is as lovable as ever. There are great pratfalls and great physical humor. It should be so much better than it actually is.Both her character and her acting don't lend itself to be likable. The role needs to be more sweet and cute. She's neither of those things. Their constant bickering and her constant complaining really makes it hard to root for these guys. The good part is the funny physical stuff. Those hold up great after all these years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very cute movie, and actually one of my favorites. Like a few reviewers pointed out previously, the script got muddied up a bit with little side stories that didn't seem to fit with the movie. I especially felt that Anna (Long) would never in a million years have gotten together with a character like Max. That part of the story was very hard to watch and totally unbelievable. In fact the character of Max himself was pretty nauseating and the casting of Alexander Godunov to play him was a mistake. Surely they could have come up with someone with better acting capabilities. But if you take that and a few other side stories out of the picture, or at least rework them a little, you have an entertaining and fun movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Money Pit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that it starred Tom Hanks, and I knew it was meant to be a remake of Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House, so I decided to try it, from director Richard Benjamin (My Stepmother Is an Alien). Basically Walter Fielding, Jr. (Hanks) and Anna Crowley Beissart (Outrageous Fortune's Shelley Long) are looking for a new house, when they find out Anna's ex-husband Max Beissart, the Maestro (Alexander Godunov) wants his residence back. They can't find a house they can afford for themselves, but then they find a nice big house, given to them by an old con-artist at a ridiculously low price. Soon enough they find out day by day how they got it so low priced, the house slowly falls apart, starting with the staircase, and continuing with the plumbing, the bath tub, the floor boards and ceilings, the chimney, all of these troubles are landing them in "The Money Pit". They do eventually begin renovation, but even that is causing problems for the couple, it is even starting to strain their relationship, but everything is settled in the end. Also starring Maureen Stapleton as Estelle, The Simpsons' Joe Mantegna as Art Shirk, Philip Bosco as Curly and Josh Mostel as Jack Schnittman. Hanks may not be as funny like he was in Splash or Big, but with Long he doesn't do too badly, but to be honest, parts of the house falling apart is the biggest and funniest reason to see the film. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy successor to "Mr. Blandings"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am normally a person who dislikes remakes or updated takes on classic film concepts, but since 38 had passed since "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dreamhouse"--and since that film is not as well known as several other Cary Grant comedies, this film seemed to have come along at the right time. I'm surprised it was not a box office hit.Before anyone quibbles with my high rating, take a look at the list of every other film Tom Hanks made before BIG. Other than Splash, this is the only one that I would watch again. The concept is funny, there are some classic slapstick moments, and Maureen Stapleton is terrific in her brief screen time--much better than the boring real estate agent in "Blandings". As for Shelley Long, I couldn't picture anyone but her in the lead.Hanks and Long have good chemistry as husband a married couple, so much so that it really hurts to see the house wreak havoc on their marriage--not to mention a well-cast Alexander Godonov tampering with it. I was surprised by the negative reviews this film received when it came out, since I saw it in a packed theatre that was laughing all the way through. And even though I'm no longer a high school freshman I still enjoyed it two decades later. To repeat, this is the best of the films Hanks made between Splash and Big--by far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were maybe three films that I could continually watch growing up, and though they may not be the best and brightest the 80s had to offer, there was genuine laughter there, which has followed me today. I've seen The Money Pit about two zillion times and some of those scenes still slay me. I always point the film out to people looking for a comedy and reaching for the likes of Scary Movie. I'm a fan of well executed sight gags and slapstick, and that can only happen when the actors involved are committed to the realism of the moment. Its true, that comedy, though silly and often insipid can still ring true. No one does this better than Tom Hanks.Though he may have forgotten his comedic roots at present, there is still something alarming about his charming ability to make you buy him as an oaf. His character in this movie is the ass, and he plays it up but not too over-the-top, with specific nuance that only an inspired and natural performer like Hanks can pull off. The laughter as the bath tub finally falls through the floor, his insane deep seeded laughter that shows you how far over the edge this house has made him. When he falls through the floor and Long's character searches the house. He tries to scream for her, but is constricted. He can only manage a feeble though specific, "I'm in the floor behind the couch." Of course the film falls completely apart at the end, letting a weak subplot spoil an otherwise unflawed romp. But, what 80s movie didn't have the ridiculous third act? We can only be thankful that there weren't any montages done to Tears for Fears songs.An 8 out of 10 for many years of laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mighty Good Laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie recently for the first time (2007). I laughed so much I thought I was at risk of having a heart attack. I had to watch it a second time to see the bits I missed because I was laughing so much. I laughed just as much the second time, so I am going to have to watch it a third time to see those bits I missed. Tom Hanks' comedy timing was spot on. Shelley Long was a good 'straight guy' for Tom. It is slap stick comedy at it's best. Sure, one can pick it to pieces, but keeping in mind when it was made, minor lapses of continuity were overlooked by audiences then. I was surprised to read in the credits that it was directed by Richard Benjamin and one of the executive producers was Steven Spielberg. It is the funniest movie I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot, including B&amp;W early movies. I haven't heard of the movie, which surprises me. It makes me wonder if it is just me who found it so funny!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a good film but an amusing one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When her ex-husband returns to New York, Anna Beissart finds herself and boyfriend Walter Fielding out of a flat. They are only looking for something simple but their estate agent points them towards a million dollar house going for a snip. It seems the seller is facing extradition and is in a rush, hence the heavily reduced price. They buy it in a hurry but on day one they find minor problems with the structure of the house and the plumbing. These "minor problems" quickly turn into massive problems and the dream house turns into an endless money pit.Although it is not particularly clever or sharp but this yuppie nightmare comedy is actually quite amusing. It is easy to dismiss it as dumb slapstick but in its defence that is all it really is. The plot has stuff about Anna and Walter's relationship and struggles woven into it but none of this is really convincing and it is clear that the writers themselves are only half interested in it. No, this is all about the regular pratfalls and worsen situation with the house. As such it is pretty good harmless fun. It is quite obvious but director Benjamin and writer Giler keep it slick and brisk and somehow manage to keep it from being silly to the point of being hard to enjoy. Instead the routines are solid and I found myself chuckling here and there even if it wasn't brilliant.It helps that pre-Oscar Hanks is good at such things (or was at least) because he is the one that draws the audience into the slapstick. He is good value and it is just a shame that Long is not as good. Perhaps it is me but I always find her a bit whiney and unnatural. Beyond them there is a role for Godunov who isn't that interesting in the thankless subplot and the only amusement he drew from me was his conducting Beethoven's 9th at the end (which is the running theme of Die Hard).. The rest of the cast has a few good turns from Mantegna, Stapleton, Bosco and others but mainly the film belongs to Hanks and he mugs along like a good 'un.Overall then, not a good film but an amusing one. The plot is weak but the slapstick is good if you can buy into the tone of the whole thing. Not a classic but a distracting comedy that will suit you if you like slapstick.</fullReview>

IT still brings tears of laughter to my eyes.

		<shortDescription>Forget Maltin! Delightfully zany, multi-rewatchable farce classic!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maltin pooh-poohs this film as a pale imitation of its inspiration, Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. But the gentle latter comedy depended on Cary Grant's charm. The Money Pit intends to be a farce, and succeeds in being one of the best of this genre. Tom Hanks and Shelly Long (and a marvelous cast from top to bottom) surely entertain and engage. Hanks especially delivers some first-rate facial and body-language laffs. But the topmost honors must go to those who created and executed the sight gags involving the house itself, and the characters' reactions to it. You'll laugh out loud and often. The best scene, involving a domino effect that starts with the fall of Hanks and ends with the near-destruction of the repair work, leaves me helpless with laughter every time I view it. You'll also enjoy Hanks' "bee dance" and "stuck in the rug" (borrowed from Alec Guiness' The Horse's Mouth) scenes, as well as the flying (roast) turkey, plummeting stairs and bathtub, and electrifying kitchen. But though these may cross the line into fantasy, you who have actually tried to obtain and deal with building subcontractors will no doubt recognize with wry horror those portrayed so well here. This is a film to own and view again and again with friends. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Tom Hanks movie is very unforgettable and perhaps one of the funniest he's been in. Way back before he did Forrest Gump and others, he starred in this one, where he and his wife have to get in this big house that is rundown! And they have to get it repaired, everything in it has fallen apart. They have to get the stairs and the water and the electricity back, and they hire some weird builders. There are many funny scenes in this one, I like especially the part with the bathtub, since there is no water yet in the house, they have to go all the way to the well just to bring water into the tub, and that's not the only problem they don't have any stairs yet. And they were finally able to fill it with water, and they are ready to bathe in it, only that the floor has cracked and the tub falls all the way down! That scene was the funniest I can remember. And the way Tom laughs at that part was unforgettable, I mean they went to all that trouble just to fill the tub with water and goes down the drain, I mean down the first floor. Recommended to all who love Tom Hanks, and his movies.</fullReview>

Hanks and Long are pretty good and the jokes are really funny, but it is just one of those comedies that has a few scenes that aren't that funny and drag the movie down a notch. For the most part the ending is not the strong point and most of the better jokes are in the beginning and the middle of this one. The funniest stuff coming as they enter their new home and the stairs seem to creak a bit, the electricity seems a tad off, and there are minor problems with the plumbing as well. Throw in also a road warrior type demolition crew, and a permit guy who is a tad on the insecure side.

		<fullReview>The Money Pit is an enjoyable comedy filled with great one-liners and hilarious slapstick. Tom Hanks and Shelly Long buy a run-down house and attempt to magically transform it into a million -dollar mansion. Hanks and Long play off each other very well and convincingly. It is great to see Hanks before he became an A-list celebrity and just as pleasing to see Long play someone other than Diane Chambers (Cheers). The sub-plot of their marriage falling apart is dismal at best. This film needed stronger story lines.Yet it is worth watching for the hilarious slapstick, such as the collapsing stairs, Hanks falling through the carpet and the chimney coming to rest in the fireplace.Interestingly enough this film keeps you hooked from beginning to end as you come to care for the characters, yet the audience may develop a closer bond with the house. This film makes for fun midday viewing, and would be enjoyed by die-hard fans of Hanks and Long. On that note look out for Die Hard's Alexander Godunov in a small yet humorous role.</fullReview>

Humorously, this movie taps into the desperation that comes with not only trying to hold together a relatively young relationship together, but also, a couple trying to fix a rapidly crumbling house that is literally falling down around them.Besides the obvious money troubles that arise while trying to fix this "dream home" the couple (Tom Hanks, Shelley Long) purchase, Shelley Long's character has to try to balance her home struggles, an ex who is wearing down her defenses to his advances and a demanding job as part of an orchestra.Tom Hanks' character has some truly highlight-worthy comedic moments in this movie; Some of his best moments in his entire acting career, in my opinion.Even though my friends and I were very young when this movie was playing on the cable movie channels, let alone when it came out in the theater, it still comes up in party conversations, followed by line-quoting and fits of laughter.The Money Pit is easy to overlook, but passing it by when you see it on a rental shelf would be a terrible shame.</fullReview>
