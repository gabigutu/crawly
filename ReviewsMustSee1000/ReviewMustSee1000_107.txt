		<shortDescription>The art of character acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the people who reviewed this film are a bit warped for thinking of it as anything less than a masterpiece. This film comes from the glorious days of Johnny Depp taking obscure roles in films and totally immersing himself in the character. Benecio Del Toro's performance was second to none, and I cannot for the life of me comprehend why someone would think this to be the "worst movie ever". God save us that we actually have to think a little when we sit in those awful theatre seats. Heaven forbid we're required to use our imagination a little bit and not have it handed to us in the form of Hollywood mindless pap. The film, del toro, Depp, and of course, Gilliam are all brilliant. I pity the fools who gave this movie a negative review and fail miserably in articulating their reasoning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pointlessness is the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those of you who decry this movie for being pointless and lacking soul, that was the point! This is an excellent movie, a true adaptation of the book, nothing more and nothing less. It is an unflinching look at the sickening excesses of a consumption based culture of America during the early 1970's, who's vacuous heart resides in Las Vegas, a symbol of greed and debauchery. The pointlessness of the movie is a metaphor for the pointless pursuit of personal gratification and greed, the true heart of the "American Dream".If you put aside the usual assumptions about a movie, i.e. that you are supposed to care about the characters, that their needs to conflict and resolution etc, then you will enjoy it much better. This movie is a magical ride and actually works on many levels, not only as testimony to the horrors of excessive drug use, and the tacky, ugly view of the worst parts of America, but also to the failed 60's generation, a generation that thought that "somebody somewhere is guarding the light at the end of the tunnel". Drug use is simply a way of escaping your present reality, and all the drugged out zeroes of the sixties were truly lost if they thought that enlightenment and peace could come from a hit of acid. This movie takes Timothy Leary's supposition of "freeing your mind" to it's ultimate conclusion and the conclusion is that you are not actually freeing your mind, but destroying it.Of course this movie is also fun to watch the incredible performances by Johnny Depp and Benitio Del Torro, both of whom I barely even recognized in their roles (Depp with a shaven head and the bloated Del Torro who gained 40 pounds for his portrayal of "Dr. Gonzo"). Del Torro has one scene in particular (the bathtub scene) which is both disgusting and very disturbing. Apparently his performance was so convincing that he had a hard time getting work after this film because everyone was convinced that he was wasted on the set. The truth is that he's just a damn fine actor who didn't hold back for one second, which is exactly what the film called for. Also the scene of Johnny Depp squealing like a banshee after imbibing some adrenocrome and Del Torro freaking out behind him is unforgettable.The directing itself is fast paced with offseting angles a lot of wide angle lenses. Gilliam has a style which is unmistakable, it's like walking around inside of a Dali painting, everything is distorted and stretched to create a strong sense of surrealism. Yet his approach is much less offensive than Oliver Stone, who desperately throws every single filming trick at you repeatedly until you are pummeled into submission. Wow, look he switch to 8 mm, then black and white, now it's slow mo all in 3 seconds!Anyway, I digress. This is a fine movie, don't watch it stoned, you'll get more out of it, repeated viewings are recommended. I also recommend getting the criterion DVD version, which has commentary by Gilliam, Depp, del Torro and Hunter S. Thompson himself!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' was originally an Article published in two parts in Rolling Stone Magazine. It was written by Hunter S. Thompson. It tells the story of a journalist reporting on the Mint 500 in Las Vegas.Terry Gilliam (the Director) is an accomplished film maker who began his career as one of the members of Monty Python. He did all of their animations.These two men on their own are incredibly clever and gifted artists in their chosen medium. What we get from this combination is one of the best films ever made. It is a more or less true story. It is a wonderful view on the warped nature of American 'Culture' from a completely askew angle. Drugs, drugs and more drugs, but instead of preaching their evils or telling you how fabulous life is when you're on acid, you get a very unbiased experienced approach to their use and abuse. Visually the film is amazing and both Johnny Depp and Benizio Del Toro are true to the book. I couldn't possibly recommend this film more highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is a twisted, outlandish venture into the mind of a warped junkie, a reporter who is traveling to Nevada in order to cover a Hells Angels motorcycle race, along with his Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro, who gained forty pounds for his role). "We were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold," is the line that opens the movie in an expeditious manner, as a red convertible roars from right to left, in the direction of Las Vegas. The vehicle's trunk is packed with an abundance of deadly drugs. "We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers. Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, two dozen amyls."The narrator of the story is Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp), a balding, stumbling shell of a man, constantly smoking or inhaling drugs, his body overloaded with deadly substances. He is in a permanent daze throughout the entire film, constantly consuming drugs every time the camera pans onto him. He is also the reporter, the main character of the film, and he is in such a daze that after the motorcycle race is over, he's not even sure who has won. So sitting cramped in his increasingly trashed hotel apartment, he begins clacking away mumbo-jumbo on his typewriter, desperately trying to make sense of the seemingly frenzied world surrounding him.The year is 1971, the beginning of the after-effects of the frivolous sixties. Raoul still seems to think that he is living in the past decade. He explains that his carefree ways were out of place for such an area as Las Vegas, and in one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie, he visits a conference detailing the dangers of substance abuse, and inhales cocaine throughout the seminar (led by the late Michael Jeter).The movie is based on the semi-autobiographical memoirs of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, who traveled to Las Vegas in 1971 with an overweight "Samoan lawyer" named Oscar Zeta Acosta. According to Thompson's novel, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," originally published at the end of the decade, they broke many laws and were essentially high on various dangerous substances the entire time. In his novel, Thompson used the character Raoul Duke as a relation to his own past, and the pair's psychedelic weekend as a metaphor for the Lost America. After the sixties, during the Vietnam War, Americans were deeply confused, and turned to many dangerous substances for answers. Some critics claim that "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" glamorizes drugs. If anything, it demonizes them (sometimes quite literally), and the constant drug use is merely present to account for the duo's wacky behavior.That's not to say that "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is a harmless film. Under the wrong circumstances, it could be misunderstood, which is why it was nearly slapped with an X-rating by the MPAA, and -- along with the book -- caused outrage when it was released in 1998, alongside the utter disaster "Godzilla."Depp is the reason the film's narration succeeds as well as it does -- a lesser actor might come across as annoying. Depp seems to be channeling the physical freedom of Steve Martin and the slurred speech patterns of Thompson himself -- although he was given ample time to pick up on Thompson's mannerisms, since they spent much time together prior to shooting and throughout the filming process.But what is essentially so fascinating about "Fear and Loathing" is its blazing style and blatant uniqueness. Brought to the screen by Terry Gilliam ("Monty Python and the Holy Grail," "Brazil"), one can only expect the movie to be strange, but it is severely distorted to the point of insanity. What is even more intriguing is Gilliam's use of his camera, cinematography and backgrounds -- the camera essentially takes on the role of a third person, as it is constantly moving, positioned at awkward angles against harsh, dizzying backdrops, wallpapers and carpets. The overall effect of the movie is the equivalent of getting high -- only this probably isn't as dangerous. Probably.In some ways, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is an utter mess of a movie -- pointless, sick, but yet it is also occasionally hilarious, and I found myself very entertained. I am not usually a fan of these sorts of movies, which only helps account for my extreme surprise in finding that I not only enjoyed "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," but found it to be an important art house movie -- bizarre, mystifying, strange, bewildering. It is as if Fellini directed a Cheech and Chong movie. It is an experience unlike any other, and although I can completely understand the negative reviews it received upon its release years ago, I find myself somewhere in between the haters and the die-hard cult fans. The film was released on a Criterion DVD last year; a sign that despite its infamous background it actually has a fairly strong legion of fans. In some ways the movie is as confused and wandering as its narrator. It's somewhat pointless, but incidentally, I think that is the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent literary adaptation - and sooo much more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie polarizes the audience like few before: while of course, there's people who like it and people who don't like it for any movie, 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' either excites or almost repulses it's critics, and I dare to say that most of the negative responses are based on ignorance, or even fear, of introducing psychedelic experiences into mainstream culture.Personally, i regard 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' as one of my absolute favorites, definitely in my top 10, and possibly even top 3. One of the many outstanding characteristics, besides a flawless performance from its main actors, excellent direction, and maybe the greatest achievement, one of the few literary adaptations that don't have you leave the cinema with disappointment, is the visual interpretation of the influence of LSD and other psychedelica. Though it has been tried many times, in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' it has been done in a way that in my opinion deserves an Academy Award like 'Best Visual Interpretation', were there one like that (btw, number 2 in my psychedelic charts is, interestingly, a scene from 'The Simpsons', episode 809, 'El Viaje de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)', where Homer eats super-spicy chili made from Guatemalan chili peppers grown by mental patients- that causing him an incredibly accuratel realized 'trip').Well, I guess up until now you, the reader, can guess that I am one of those that loved the movie, and think it to be a mile stone in cinematographic history, along with 'Apocalypse Now', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'The Matrix'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visual masterpiece with Thompson's message intact and strong as ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read countless reviews of this movie that have derided it for everything from glorifying drugs to being unchristian to being boring. Maybe my mind works very much like director Terry Gilliam's (I loved 'Brazil' and '12 Monkeys'), but the last thing I would do to this movie is deride it. It is a brilliant adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's generation-defining book of the same name - it stays very faithful to the events in the book.First of all, this movie literally glows with Gilliam's eye for detail that he has consistently displayed throughout his career. The sets are so elaborate, one could never take in all the scenery from any number of viewings without slowing it down and watching very closely. The bombardment of the bright, flashing lights of Las Vegas and the bizarre camera angles, as well as surreal sets make for an interesting and entertaining presentation regardless of a lack of coherency and taste. What we have here is a movie riddled with black humor and a horrifying satire of the American dream. I'll admit it takes a very `unchristian' viewpoint to laugh at the `straight economics' of allowing policemen to gang-f**k a girl for $30 a head. Therefore, people bound by a constricting sense of morality should never have watched this movie in the first place. It is for people like me who enjoy living a very un-stoic life (at least vicariously through movies) by having radical ideas and perspectives forced upon them. Fear and Loathing is the embodiment of such a perspective - it is a gruesomely accurate depiction of the bi-product of the often-glorified 60's drug culture. And one thing that countless critics seem to carelessly omit in their analyses is the constant references to the `American Dream.' Johnny Depp (Raoul Duke/Hunter Thompson), in his verbose verbal narrations, makes quite a few references to a desparate hunt for reason behind the madness of not only this `American Dream', but the drug culture as well - "He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man." - Dr. Johnson (displayed before the opening scene). The problem with the waning popularity of this movie is simply that its design was not meant to appeal to the buttoned-down mainstream. People that want to laugh and cry in a movie theater and then get the hell on aren't the type of people that would enjoy seeing an unjustified drug-induced frenzy on Las Vegas. This movie has everything a critic should be looking for in a masterpiece - magnificent cinematography, lovely acting, shock value, provocation of thought, and a meaning behind it all. To freaks like me it also has immense entertainment value as well. This work will be one of my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't do drugs, just see this movie- Gilliam's masterpiece, perhaps</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a psychedelic comedy, but also an astute piece of literature-cum-political science on a period in American history that was just really strange, thus reflected by its creator. It was the pioneer in 'Gonzo journalism' and sent Thompson's star even higher than it had with Hell's Angels. Although it's one of my personal favorite books, it could have been tricky to adapt it- Alex Cox tried and failed- but somehow Terry Gilliam digs into the Thompson psychology, dementia, and off-the-wall humor, while also putting his unmistakable mark on the material. Two sensibilities thus merge, alongside the tremendous performances (underrated, despite the praise from fans) from Depp and Del-Toro. It asks an essential question- how does society end up crossing paths with the outlaws? But there's more than that- much more in fact- but it takes more than one viewing. I remember writing the first time I saw it: "This film is so bizarre you might just want to put down the bong and get high from this movie (after all, the movie contains every single known drug known to man since 1544)."Granted, it's immediate appeal is that of a midnight movie, the ultimate midnight movie, as a work where the visual style is cranked up to a queue that goes even further than past Gilliam ventures. Distorted, sometimes tilted, widescreen angles, very bright, strange colors via Nicola Pecorini, and a beating soundtrack loaded with everything from Jefferson Airplane to Tom Jones to Bob Dylan to Debbie Reynolds (what kind of rat bastard psychotic would put that on right now, at this moment)! And aside from Depp and Del-Toro, who immerse themselves to the hilt (Depp especially is in a form here comparable to his Pirates movies- you can't see anyone else play the character, and at the same time you almost can't recognize him, a credit to Depp's 'method' style), there's hilarious supporting work from Craig Bierko, Tobey Maguire, Gary Busey, Harry Dean Stanton (Castration!), and Christina Ricci, and even an extremely moving and dangerous scene with Ellen Barkin. It's not an easy film, to be certain, and it will likely appeal to those who may think 'ah, drugs, I like drugs, must be my kind of movie'. But it's not that simple; it's actually fairly critical of drug use, in an overblown, Fellini-esquire satirical manner (eg Adrenochrome, which is a tiny landmark of gonzo film-making to complement the author), and there really is no point where Gilliam, Thompson or the characters say 'take drugs'. On the other hand, there is also a critical attitude, a refreshing and brilliant one, on authority, like at the DEA convention at the hotel- again, strange times in society. At the same time the film is superb as escapist fun, in the darkest and craziest ways that only a maverick like Gilliam and his people can pull off, it's also got some layers in the substance, of Duke and Gonzo almost as relics from a former era already in 1971. With consistently quotable dialog, excruciating moments of depravity, and some of the most outrageous production design in any film, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is an unlikely cult classic, and in its own delirious fashion a possible definitive work from the director alongside Brazil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to describe how good this movie is without sounding sycophantic but it really is that good. This film is based on the "true" story of when the notorious reporter Hunter S. Thompson and his then attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta went to Las Vegas to cover a bike race for rolling stone magazine but instead spent the entire trip going out of their minds on various illegal and legal chemicals. This may sound like a one trick pony for stoners and 60's throwbacks but I am neither and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Very few films based on books manage to tell the story or capture the spirit of the original but F&amp;L certainly manages both. The story sticks closely enough to the book without alienating the books fan base but also trims out the right areas so that the film doesn't become overly long and uninteresting. The film is still fairly long, compared with most popcorn fare, at around 2hrs and does sag a little in places but the pace quickly picks up again. The performances are absolutely spot on with Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro virtually becoming their characters. Both are heavily disguised under make-up but their acting ability shines through. On first viewing I wasn't that impressed, it was a good film but not a great film, but after a second viewing I fell in love with it. You notice things and pick up on gags the second time around that you missed the first time. You immerse yourself in their world so much that you feel like you were there with them on the "trip" in both senses of the word. I have shown this film to most of my friends and they also have become hooked after viewing the film twice, it's such a shame that this great film works like this as I'm sure there are many people who are unwilling to give it the second chance it deserves. If you haven't seen this film I suggest you do and if you don't like it see it again. If you have seen this film and didn't like it, see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love it so much it hurts. There are so many great lines, and moments. To many to count. Johnny Depp should have received an Oscar for it. His performance is nothing short of genius. I know there never will be, but a sequel would rock. Benicio Del Toro takes a great turn as the disturbed side-kick. I wonder if his character could even tell the difference between sobriety and being high. All of the cameos are a nice treat, especially the Flea one in the bathroom, " I s-p-i-l-l-e-d L-S-D o-n m-y s-h-i-r-t..." Tobey Maguire has a great scene as well, he actually looks quite believable as the sickly albino guy. I'd say it's nothing short of incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is far from your everyday movie, and only for those with a deep appreciation for the diversity of film-making, or fans of Hunter S. Thompson. This does not mean those mentioned will enjoy it, although definitely respect the attempt. I personally found it fascinating. To portray a permanently drug induced state to the big screen was done with creativity and subtle humour. You could expect nothing less from director Terry Gilliam who has played such a massive role in the brilliant and original Monty Python works. Having never read any of Hunter S. Thompson's work, I get the impression that justice is done for the adaptation to the big screen. An absolutely quality cast must be credited for this, ensuring a natural performance is achieved. Las Vegas which features strongly throughout the movie seems to be so appropriate when dealing with this subject matter, they just seem to go hand in hand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful. Just Awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" (1998) is one of those rare movies--oh, how rare indeed!--that I turned off without finishing. I'm amazed at how unfunny, unenergetic, and unimaginative this movie is, considering that it comes from the director of such bizarre fare as "Time Bandits" (1981), "The Fisher King" (1991), and "12 Monkeys" (1995). If there is anything that can be said about Gilliam, it is that he rarely lacks imagination. But the movie is simply boring. Boring! A movie about two men on a drug binge is boring! And lifeless too. I simply had no energy to care about Johnny Depp's character. Heck, I would have been glad to have even been annoyed! The film was literally a collection of images running in front of my eyes that I could not care less about. Abysmal. For those who love the film, I honestly do not know what you see therein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite wandering but very funny and very imaginative ? a perfect example of Terry Gilliam's work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The `unflimable' novel by Thompson is brought to the screen. Hunter S. Thompson gets a call to go to Las Vegas to cover a motorcross race. Using the advance money to purchase a load of drugs he sets out on a road trip with his crazed Samoan lawyer. However as their trip continues they encounter all manner of insanity and paranoia in their drug fuelled trip into the American dream?Never read the book, never been a big fan of this particular culture and ever felt inclined to read any of this sort of work ? however, really enjoyed the movie. The plot is, well, a trip rather than anything concrete or logical. There is a message tacked on somewhere near the end but really this is more of an experience than a story. To me the film mainly succeeded due to Terry Gilliam. His crazed sense of humour is fed through the whole piece, stopping it being indulgent or pretentious as it could easily have been.Instead it manages to be a drug movie but also be very OTT and very. Gilliam's imagination really made Thompson's trips come to life. It must be hard to actually put something like that on film and I thought he did very well. This vision is well supported by a brilliantly pitched performance by Depp. He is on the very edge of ham with this one but gets it just right ? making Thompson funny and exaggerated. De Toro is as good but is very much playing second fiddle on this one. An all star list of cameos including Maguire, Barkin, Busey, Ricci, Harmon, Penn (of &amp; Teller), Diaz and Lyle Lovett are all enjoyable and don't detract from the film in the way cameos sometimes can (`oh look it's etc').The film may be very loose and aimless but what did you expect? Those wanting tightness of plot and a set narrative may be let down (though there is a car chase for the teens!). However this is well worth a look as it is a funny, very imaginative film that proved a lot of people wrong when they said that it could never be filmed. Certainly anyone who likes the films of Terry Gilliam will find much of his madness here to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, Hunter Thompson was a journalist, not a novelist. But, it was fun to read Hunter Thompson as if he were a novelist. I think he actually did write a novel. Nobody will ever remember it. I'll bet William Shirer wrote a novel too. Mark Twain was a journalist.Of course Hunter Thompson was -- is -- no William Shirer. But like William Shirer, Hunter Thompson writes about his subjects with a spirit of adventure and moral imperative. But unlike William Shirer, Hunter Thompson includes his fun in his reports. And he likes to have fun.William Shirer brought us "Ghandi" and we get Martin Sheen. Hunter Thompson brought us "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" and we get Johnny Depp. So how well does Johnny Depp portray a bald, hard drinking, chain smoking, acid soaked, middle aged loony? Not too bad. This is a fun movie. Part of the fun is watching to see how well it captures the book and this it does very well. There are occasionally special effects, but mostly the drug clouded reality of our two heroes is handled by camera angles, lighting and acting (We hope that it is acting, perhaps they were coached.)The story does a lot to capture the happily crazy and irreverant spirit of those times. It also does not romanticize the consequences of excess, but neither does it play down its appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was not a particularly well-done movie. Johnny Depp saved it, but every other actor was not up-to-par. Terry Gilliam is a great director, but his flair for excess eventually swamped what might have been a very tight, very funny movie. On the other hand, there are only about five movies which I vividly remember, and this is one of them. It's (dare I say this?) like Kung Pow - Enter the Fist. While you're watching it, you're giggling, and thinking, "what the hell." Five days later, you start laughing hysterically ("REMEMBER THE BATS?!" "OH YEAH! HA HA HA!!!") (trust me). I hate trying to rank movies like this. "It's a seven, but wait a week and it'll be a nine!"</fullReview>

But Gilliam's Brutally Honest Storytelling along-with Depp &amp; del Toro's Mesmerizing Performances take this unusual film to dizzy heights.

I thoroughly enjoyed this ride, about these 2 imbeciles who f''k everything up &amp; yet have a blast! Gilliam's Brutally Honest Storytelling makes 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' so unforgettable. He delivers this "off-beat" story with so much energy &amp; enthusiasm. Gilliam's actual vision &amp; mastery is actually discovered in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. Gilliam, Tony Grisoni, Alex Cox &amp; Tod Davies's Screenplay is fearlessly mad.Performance-Wise: Depp &amp; del Toro are Mesmerizing! They embody Raoul Duke &amp; Dr. Gonzo, respectively &amp; perform stunningly. They manage to hold onto to their characters even in the weirdest of situations &amp; dialogue. Another memorable performance comes from Ellen Barkin, she's marvelous. On the whole, 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is an unforgettable, unusual film. Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a great movie about devil-may-care generation 70s!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to know what happening in a head of junkie under the influence of drugs but without using drugs on yourself, that this film will be very useful and interesting for you. In my opinion, it's the best film by the most not ordinary Hollywood director Terry Gilliam. I like an absolutely all his movies, they are different from each others of shapes, styles and genres, and I love them the same, but "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is definitely the top by Terry Gilliam's directing. In this film there is also Jonny Depp's best performance, in my opinion, who played his friend Hunter S. Thompson accurate and brilliantly. It's a great comedy, drama and something else about 70s and about that devil-may-care generation. It's the one of my favorite film and I will never tiring re-watch its.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was reviewing "Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas" on IMDb.com when the drugs began to take hold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you start watching this movie, you'll decide if you like it or not. But if you don't want to wait, I'll tell you. This movie is so trippy, so gross, so insane, so bizarre, and so friggin' crazy! Now with that said, it's also brilliant, funny, surreal, dark, entertaining etc. The story goes like this; a Dr. Journalism, Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), and his wolf man attorney, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), are sent to Las Vegas to cover a Mint 400 motorcycle race but end up abandoning that in search of the American Dream. The two characters are out of their minds on drugs the entire time which is where the surreal factor comes into play. The film is based the famous novel by Hunter S. Thompson, which was based on real life events he experienced. I'm not kidding when I say that five minutes into this movie and you'll feel that someone drugged your drink or something. This is more than just a movie, it's an experience, and an experience like no other. If you haven't read the book or don't know what your getting yourself into, then you're gonna have one hell of a ride. Johnny Depp (of course) nails the performance of the character that the book created. What director, Terry Gilliam, did is take the book and match the images that we thought of while reading it, perfectly. Throughout the film, watching the two characters wander witlessly around Las Vegas tripping on acid, I felt like I was part of the experience. Also, Depp's performance is so good, that I started to forget that he wasn't really Hunter S. Thompson. The characters are both psychotic but in different ways. Raoul Duke has one foot in reality and another foot in a pit of madness, Gonzo, however, is off his rocker. He's just a ticking atom bomb ready to go off, I'd be scared to stay in the same room as him. But what keeps this movie going strong is the narration by Depp. Some of it's recited from the book but other times it's whatever's on his mind. Without the narration, the movie would be just one wacky thing after another. Overall, watching this movie is like being hit by a car, sucked into a tornado, spat out into a trampoline factory, raped by a wild tiger, eaten by Godzilla, thrown off the face of the Earth, and plummeting right down on the TV. Any negative reviews you may have heard about this movie make no sense. They love the book while hate the film for being so crazy and shapeless (oh, you mean exactly like the book). This is a perfect adaptation of the book. So great performances, surreal scenery, flowing narration, and a clever cameo by Thompson himself. When I first saw this movie, I liked it just fine. I've seen a few more times and every time I see it, it gets better. Now it's gotten to the point where I think it's one of the best films ever made. So if you're a Johnny Depp fan, or a Terry Gilliam fan, or a Hunter S. Thompson fan, or just in the mood for something different and I mean REALLY different, definitely check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie,but you'll need to watch it twice to get it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Fear and Loathing, and at first, it had me paralyzed. I was expecting something totally different, so the first 20 minutes bored me. I became biased and didn't like the movie while I was watching it, but a couple of days to think about it, and I understood the whole concept. There was a meaning behind the seeming madness. I watched it again and understood the whole thing. Most of the good moments of the movie, you wouldn't catch when you watch it first. You'd think that the whole drug induced paranoia is a 'part' of a bigger story, but that's why you need to watch it twice. This is not one of those movies you'd watch to get laughs, and not a movie that you'll hope thrills you.The scenes where they're high, especially the ones where they go to the circus high on ether, and the other where Gonzo asks Duke to throw a radio in the bathtub, are exceptional. The whole concept can drive you into a different world if you let it, really. And then the scene where Gonzo just wants to 'Carve a Z on your forehead' sums everything up. It's a different movie, and it's aimed at a particular audience. It's not a feel-good movie, it's tragic. But then it isn't Requiem for a Dream either, so I don't know where to classify it. Watch it once and you'll probably not like it. It might be too 'slow' or you'd curse the 'lack of action'. Watch it twice and you'll probably understand the last lines of the movie, which is truly chilling, and I'd say it's one of the best lines ever said on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely Outrageous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film perfectly encapsulates the philosophy of extreme over-indulgence that has probably inspired every young mind at some stage, it allows the viewer to both share the utterly unadulterated experience of psychedelic excess in all it's wonderful glory, whilst ultimately reinforcing the likely unsustainability of such a philosophy in the real world.Freelance writer Raoul Duke and his Attorney come partner in mayhem Dr Gonzo embark on a mission to report on a Desert Rally in Las Vegas, naturally stocking up for the trip with wildly excessive quantities of just about every mind-altering substance known to man...:."We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi- colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon".Sheer brilliant mayhem ensues, the Depp/Del Torro duo deliver comedic excellence, whilst Depp in particular, having spent weeks learning Hunters impulsive mannerisms packs the film full of endlessly quotable Hunter-esquire commentary.A few days into the trip, with a growing list of offences in their debris-strewn wake, the two lead characters barely know who they are, let alone who won the race, but that's no reason to go home.An unrestrained portrayal of the semi-autobiographical book, with no content compromise for anyone the story is told as intended, with numerous canny nods toward Hunter S Thompson all adding to the quality of the final product (check out the IMDb Trivia page).PERFECT</fullReview>

In the book, Thompson's character enters his room at the Flamingo Hotel to find his Samoan Attorney checked in with a strange young girl wearing a blue painting smock in the throes of a psychotic episode. The hotel room was full of her portraits of Barbra Streisand. The girl Lucy is described in the book as 'having had the look of a beast that had been tossed into a sawdust pit to fight for its life.' Tom Dunn pays a debt to this scene in a "Kickstarter" project gone wild. I implore you, watch this film, and also go-ogle, Tom Dunn Kickstarter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a sense, this is kind of like the movie Terry Gilliam was born to do.Terry Gilliam is an awesome visual director in the same way that Tim Burton is an awesome visual director: every single frame bleeds its own distinct style of beauty, but sometimes the story just doesn't hold it up, or the stylistic elements get in the way. However, what could possibly be better to found Gilliam's surreal psychedelic imagery on than Hunter S. Thompson's story of his exploration into the American Dream? Still, it's a hard thing to pull off, translating Thompson to film, and while Gilliam does succeed, it's largely from the support of the incredible cast working under him to work out. Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro especially have to really work on exaggerating when needed, slowing down when necessary through what feels like hundreds of hallucinogenic scenes with just barely enough narrative structure to pull them together.Of course, the outcome is pretty fantastic, but it sets this movie squarely in the "love it or hate it" section of the world's video library, which is pretty much Gilliam's career simplified anyways.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

A bizzare look at a weekend in Vegas (gone wrong????) with two guys with too much booz, money and drugs. Based on Hunter Thompson's book (which is somewhat autobiographical) this crazy story unfolds like a bad acid trip. And most of it does take place under the influence of some narcotic. As is typical with Gilliam's directing, you almost have to be on acid to make sense of it.With crazy stunts, fantastic acting and some of the most disgusting scenes I have ever seen, this is a great watch. Keep an eye out for guest spots and quick one liners by some very notable actors and actresses.A must watch for Gilliam fans and a purely wacky watch for the rest.9/10 for insane brilliance</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly a great movie of the modern times. It is accurate to the book and very well acted. Johnny Deep and Benecio Del Toro make you feel like your actually watching the real people. It shows that they put a lot of time into preparing those roles. Johnny Deep lived in hst's basement for three months just to get down his mannerisms and speech patterns. Everything they did was real, no wigs or any of that. Benecio Del Toro put on 40 pounds for this role. Also if you look around his wrist u can see cigarette burns, and those are also real. People who say this is just a crazy and pointless pro drug movie obviously don't understand it. It's more so an anti-drug movie than pro. Some people also say that it has no plot, no point. Well it doesn't really, but that's what you have to appreciate about it. It moves smoothly and consistently. Although most of it was shot onsite the 2 sets, bazooka's circus and the flamingo, were beautifully set up and very accurate to the times. I love Terry Gilliam's style of shooting all the 1st person scenes. He did a very good of representing the trip. The narration is also a bonus. Johnny Deep does it with emotion and sounds like hunter thompson. I also like the soundtrack, it aids nicely in the movie as a whole. You have to really appreciate the accuracy of the movie in general. all the clothes worn were HST's. Even the "red shark" was his. The only downside someone may see is that there isn't a solid plot. But I don't think that detracts from the movie at all. Overall I think this is an awesome movie and near flawless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drug-fuelled romp through Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am actually not surprised that Terry Gilliam directed this movie, particularly since when I read the book the last thing that I thought could have been done was to turn it into a movie. Hunter S. Thompson generally does not write books that could easily be translated into movies, in particular this one, however if there is one person that can pull it off, it is Terry Gilliam.This movie is about two guys, one of them a journalist, the other, well, I have absolutely no idea who the other guy is, though he keeps on referring to himself at his Attorney, who go on a drug fuelled binge to Las Vegas. The subtitle of the book is 'an exploration into the dark side of the American Dream' however that is not their intention when they go there. It seems that Raoul is supposed to cover a sporting event, and then a DA's Conference on drugs, but instead they spend a bulk of their time travelling around Las Vegas in a drug induced haze.Much of the film is narrated by Raoul, namely the thoughts that are racing through his head as he wonders around the city. He scams a couple of hotels, runs up huge bills, and then disappears. By the end of the movie you get the impression that they simply trashed everything that they could conceivably trash in Las Vegas, and though it is suggested that they were rushed out of town, it does not seem that that actually happened.My favourite part of the film was when they get into the hotel and forced into the bar to wait for their room to be made up. Raoul then starts freaking out, as he sees the carpet begin to swirm, and the crowd in the bar turn into monstrous creatures, and has to be carried out by his attorney. Later it is his attorney's turn to freak out and have to be carried back into his room. This, as Hunter refers, is known as 'The Fear'. I guess people who have never done drugs would not understand what he means by the fear (and I certainly didn't when I first read this book), and it can be difficult to describe as it is a drug-fuelled emotion that rises up into your head and clouds your perception. The clearest explanation would be that you know that you are on drugs (and generally most drugs that I know of do not generally give an outward appearance, in the same way that alcohol does, like slurred speech and lack of balance) and then you begin to fear that everybody else does as well, and that they are all looking at you suspiciously. You begin to believe that you can read their minds, and that they are all looking at you in a disapproving manner, and all of the sudden you want to get out of there because they are going to do bad things to you and you cannot fight back.The Fear is not rational, in fact it is completely irrational. You may have not attracted anybody's attention, but once the fear strikes, you believe that you have. It is the paranoia that everybody speaks about when it comes to drugs. There is no fear when you drink alcohol, in fact alcohol tends to fuel your confidence, rather than force you into a corner to hide, that is what The Fear does. As I have said, The Fear is something that people who have not done drugs would not understand, however it tends to be the psychedelic drugs, such as Marijuana and LSD, that bring about The Fear, not stimulates (cocaine and ecstasy) or depressants (such as heroine).This is a really good movie, and it does indeed, as the author suggests, an exploration into the dark side of the American Dream. As the movie progresses, Raoul begins to contemplate the American Dream. Unfortunately he did not cover the race, and when he attended to DA's conference, he was so wacked out of drugs that The Fear caught him as well, particularly when the 'Drugs are bad' film clips were shown. This is an incredibly funny movie, though I suspect that it will not be everybody's taste.</fullReview>

The cinematography and direction tried to make this an artistically worthwhile endeavor, but fall WAY short. Not that either was a huge problem... there's just nothing to work with.

In effect Fear &amp; Loathing totally misses the dark heart of the novel and just becomes an incoherent, thundering mess. Next: Johnny Depp. With funny hats, cigarette-holder permanently affixed to lower lip, bandy legs and quick-fire gags (albeit drug related) is he simply playing Groucho Marx? Maybe Hunter S Thomson is like Groucho Marx, but I somehow doubt this conveys all of his character?And thereby hangs the central problem with what is, in all probability, and unfilmable book. Should it be a slapstick comedy, a social commentary, a satire, a road trip, a drugs movie.... Unfortunately this fails on all fronts.Even if the script does delineate a non-stop drugs orgy in the strange town of Las Vegas it cries out of some coherence of narrative (compare the acid scenes in this this to the one in Easy Rider to get my drift).Much more balance and pace was needed. What we are left with is a kaliedoscopic hell of pharmaceutical paranoia (the Fear and Loathing of the title) and an almighty hangover. Neither of which are either pleasant or profound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An oddball journalist and his psychopathic lawyer travel to Las Vegas, with a car full of drugs, alcohol and the pursuit of the American Dream. A psychedelic trip into the macabre, a chaotic spiral into madness. These terms perfectly describe Hunter S. Thompson's novel describing his drug fueled trip of the west. Depp does a perfect rendition of Thompson and truly is a marvel to watch in this film. In his rendition it is easy to see how Depp has become one of this generations finest actors. This film for the casual viewer may be difficult to follow and or watch, but to me personally is a fantastic film one in which does what it was intended to do, and that is to entertain and to darkly and at times humorously take the viewer on a chaotic ride. With a huge cult following and an eventual prequel that came out; Rum Diaries, this is a wonderful peek into the world of the not so normal and the drug fueled ride that is Hunter S. Thompson's life. The soundtrack is perfect for this film as it follows suit with the chaos that is viewed on the screen. I highly recommend this film to film buffs and lovers of dark comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and eloquent subversive weapon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the basic frames of plot, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" appears as a dystopian sci-fi horror comedy about two psychotic heroin addicts getting stalked by anthropomorphic reptiles in the jungle. Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson as Raoul Duke has warped his mindset into a freeform kung-fu stance, believing the people surrounding him to be lost descendants of dinosaurs come back for revenge. He uses psychedelic drugs as a way to prevent the reptiles from properly profiling his behavioral patterns. Hunter S. Thompson is not a hero but he is strong, clever and likable in his ostracization. The major revelation is in his means of flirting with disaster to escape from it, led like a blind samurai to the heart and soul of the infestation, whispering the magic words like he knew them all along. Does he even know what he's doing? No... that would take too long. If he stopped to think about what he was doing the reptiles would get him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unbelievable ... should have been impossible but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is based on the immortal Hunter S. Thompson novel "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" which would set the standard for the weird and wild literature many tried to write once inspired by it but failed wearily in most cases and only narrowly approached in a small few. This is one of the five best novels of last 30 years of the 20th century ... and one of the ten best of said century. This I know is subjective and many might object but for pure outright creativity, beautiful and hilarious and frightening prose, and many messages few are likely to ever forget, then it just doesn't get much better than this. And perhaps Thompson never got better than this ... there are several that are close but few that are the runaway stagecoach the novel is.But making this into a movie? I don't think anyone who ever read the book considered it the most remote of possibilities ... indeed, many, like myself, didn't want to see someone attempt a movie of it since how could you capture so much of the hallucinatory nature of the novel, the bad craziness, and the wonderful goings-on inside the head of the Good Doctor and Founder of Gonzo Journalism? It seemed impossible.But as the years went by and computer generated special effects became something most enterprising geeks could do rather well in the basement of their parent's home, it seemed as if it might actually happen.And when it was announced and the key players were listed, unlike most movie announcements of favorite novels becoming movies, I was quite heartened by the names.Terry Gilliam as director -- anyone who could make "Brazil", even in the studio castrated version, "Time Bandits" a hallucinatory journey if there ever was one, "Fisher King" and "Twelve Monkeys" as well (not to mention the oddly-hilarious little animations he made for the Monty Python series way back when) well I thought if anyone could, he could.Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson -- I was worried about his looks frankly ... I mean, seriously, this guy is just too good looking to play Thompson, someone who once wrote that a photo of the ten best writers in America could also double as a photo of the ten ugliest men in America, was not a matine idol to say the least ... but after living in Thompson's basement for six months, capturing every nuance of Thompson's persona and combining that with a bald 'toupee', well he had the character down, the funny odd duck walk brought on by a bit too much of everything at hand as well as the syrupy melodic voice ... outstanding in the end and one of his best roles among many great roles.Benicio Del Toro -- well can't say I knew much about this actor prior to this movie other than the ensemble piece, "Usual Suspects", a movie I was not nearly as impressed with as most others were ... but he put his heart into this role packing on 40 or 50 lbs it looks like considering the gut he readily shows as Thompson's Somonan attorney.And the many others who show up for brief but important parts: Ellen Barkin as the worn out waitress (yet somehow sexy); Gary Busey as the highway patrolman who has to make the extra effort to pull Hunter over as he explains the correct way to get out of a ticket (one of my favorite dialogs); Penn Jillette who is a barker at the Circus casino and he does it to perfection including once he ascertains that Hunter and his attorney are not interested is what he's pitching literally pushes them along and attacks the next rubes coming his way (having spent many years at the local county fair I can attest to his accurate portrayal); Harry Dean Stanton as the heartless judge, very small but he makes an impression; Cameron Diaz as the hapless documentarian in the elevator and her smile always brightens a scene I must say; Christopher Meloni taking a complete about face from my wife's favorite detective show cop to the gay desk clerk having to deal with an irate crew-cut, love-it-or-leave-it cop and Hunter's perfect assessment of the scene in beautifully delivered lines by Meloni; Christina Ricci as the whacked-out bible freak whose brain has been permanently pureed by various substances given her by Hunter's attorney; Debbie Reyolds actual voice singing when the two last only a very short time at her performance (Depp himself called Reynolds telling her she had to do the voice herself and apparently he was charming enough to get her to do the gig); and there are others but this is getting to be quite a list ... except for one last mention that the actual Red Shark, the fire-engine red Chevy Impala is the actual Red Shark they took to Vegas and Thompson owned til the end ... still in beautiful shape ... and for those of us who have owned an early '70s Impala, I'd wager that we'd all give quite a bit to have it back ... that was a great car ... of course, it had to have the big block 350 four barrel ... the old saying was true of that car: "If it had wings ..." So rambling as always, read the book, watch the movie ... take the ticket, ride the ride ... a perfect soundtrack also accompanies the wild ride through this two-hour wonderful romp of the good ol' days when drugs were handy and you could just look at someone and know they were one of us ...Just always remember: "You can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug, especially when its waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye." Words that have served me well through the years, believe me ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fun ride which feels like an acid trip as well. Despite the messy screenplay, which in its second act aimlessly stalks the protagonist without motive or time scope just doing drugs, Terry Gilliam made this an exercise in style, considering the very uncharming characters. With vivid colours and disorientating camera angles - there is never a clear distinction between reality and imaginary; which is a very effective technique since the main theme is the effect of drugs. Johnny Depp gives one of his finest and most flamboyant performances as Raoul Duke, taking every opportunity to add in a quick line expressing his attitudes and behaviour - often being hilarious. The narration generally helps the film run smoother as does the soundtrack, though it would be relentlessly entertaining anyway.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not one for watching movies repeatedly but this movie is an exception to the rule. Perhaps it is the fact that there is no discernible plot or major twist that makes numerous viewings possible. Or perhaps it is the sheer joy to be taken from the two main performances of Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro. This has to be del Toro's greatest achievement as an actor, he is positively terrifying as Depp's drug buddy and "attorney". And Depp's wacky mannerisms and rambling monologues are pitch perfect.Depp plays Hunter S. Thompson, who, for the purposes of the movie goes by the pseudonym of Raoul Duke, the father of so-called "Gonzo journalism". The official purpose of his trip to the titular city is to cover a desert motorcycle race. The actual purpose being a mind bending, all-you-can-eat drug buffet.Terry Gilliam brings his unique style to this movie. The psychedelic visuals that the viewer experiences through Duke's eyes are a real joy, and are straight out of the Gilliam school of bizarre animation first seen in his Monty Python days. It would be hard to imagine anyone else at the helm.Interestingly, on my most recent viewing of this movie I was watching it with a number of non-native English speakers. None of them had seen it before so I thought, given the leads' slurred speech throughout, it would be a good idea to opt for English subtitles. It was a revelation! I hadn't realised how much dialogue I hadn't grasped or even heard before. There were some truly hilarious lines newly discovered that night. And you know, that is another reason this movie is suitable for multiple screenings, as there is always something new to discover.The only reason this movie did not get the full 10 from me is that every time I watch it I am surprised by how long it is. It definitely starts to sag a little bit when Duke returns to Vegas for the second time but then quickly picks up again, only to sag again towards the end. 15-20 minutes shorter would have been perfect.And no, you don't have to be on drugs to enjoy this movie. In fact I think that would defeat the purpose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>man... mother of god, i thought... that was my reaction when i first saw the movie. just couldn't get enough of it. so i started again from the beginning. and then seen it 2 more times. there was not, nor will it ever be, a movie that i can watch 4 times in a row without making myself nervous. and the funny thing is, it just kept getting better and better. must've seen it close to 100 times by now, and almost every time i watch it i catch a new, easily missed part of some scene, completely unimportant for the movie itself, but contributing to this masterpiece as a whole. i pity and despise all the ignorant fools unable to comprehend the passion, energy and unbelievable attention to detail put into this movie. people, if you think of this movie in a way like that, sacrifice 30 minutes of your otherwise pointless day and do some background research. and if that doesn't help you, just hurry up and end that shameful excuse you call life. 'cause anyone damaged as severely as that does not deserve to live. and what the hell is wrong with such a large amount of people? i mean, the movie isn't even in top 250!!!! really, come on. i allude to anyone who is not registered on IMDb, reads this and likes the movie, please, do register and vote 10. we own hunter that much. depp's performance alone earns that vote. and if you don't like it, trust the judgment of some of us with a sense for style and quality and go criticize something else. for a guy of my lifestyle, this is by far the best movie ever made. also, from purely objective point of view, it should be in personal top 10 of anyone who thinks they know anything about movie culture altogether. as you've probably noticed by now i'm not writing anything about the movie itself, because it just doesn't deserve to be spoiled in any way. TRUST ME, WATCH THE MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! what made me write this is the primal rage and contempt i feel towards the masses that just don't get it, plus they have the balls to oh-so rudely spit on this exceptional work of art in public, thus slowly killing the last dying possibility for hope that we will EVER experience anything quite like it again. you sad pack of uneducated bastards. i respect other people's opinion, but everything has its boundaries. everything except human ignorance. how can you not appreciate the amount of work put into this film? how can you not recognize the unconditional and final decision to make a movie flawless, or not making it at all. "i mean, if the thing's worth doing, its worth doing right." when i saw that serb's comment on this masterpiece i had to punch in few more lines. i can understand how not everyone gets the meaning of this movie, since not everyone's intelligence is average or above... i can also understand how many ppl are having problems digesting the scenes from fear and loathing, since many find 'em vulgar and repulsive, which is also misinterpretation, but OK, their loss. however, what's bothering me is how all these "movie enthusiasts" don't recognize the sheer beauty of acting or camera work or any other purely technical point of this film. all u fools are so blinded by your prejeduce that even if u do have some knowledge about the art of making movies, it's all gone 'cause your vanity and stupidity is clouding your judgement. and i feel the same way about those who like this movie only for it's subject. wish i could vote one more time...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is breath-taking, comic, and altogether genius. You will meet many who will tell you otherwise- here is why. The majority of films you will see in your life have very little displacement from creator to audience- for instance, something like American Beauty. An American film, about American life, by an American director, made for Americans. You don't get lost in it, you can't. This is why your average joe won't be a fan of Bergman or Fellini- he has to, not just think, but know about the culture and mindset it was intended to be shown to. Fear and Loathing just might be the furthest displacement I have ever seen in film. It is a intended to a modern American audience, made by a Brit, about a book that was written towards Americans based upon loose 70s events that were intended to be taken metaphorically (no wonder they didn't like it at Cannes- now your showing it to French people). And just to make things more fun, it is borderline free form with development similar to Dante's Inferno (which is German). To be on the "correct" level of viewing for this film is nearly impossible. You have to "work" to comprehend this movie, something most people don't like to do. The movie doesn't "suck you in," it just tells a story that you must make the effort to understand, but trust me, the result is amazing.</fullReview>

In order to better understand the film, one has to have read the book. Even having not read the book, paying close enough attention, many things can be caught. Fear &amp; Loathing is a book that has &amp; will continue to span generations. The film, which closely follows the book, is full of insight into the state of western civilization. The things observed are very awe-inspiring. It is not blunt, things are subtle. This is, if anything, very satirical. It is amusing, a little over the edge at times, but raw enough to make people take notice. Raoul Duke is a genius.{END}***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this slick little movie. Sure, it wasn't high art, but I really don't think it deserved all those horrible reviews that critics worldwide had given it. The acting was good, the laughs were frequent, the cinematography and camerawork were suitably headache-inducing (but for this movie, it's a good thing!), and the wardrobe and sets were both fantastic. But my question is: why did it take so long for this novel to get made into a motion picture? I have never read the book (as a matter of fact, it was written and published long before I was born), but to my understanding, the political references and social commentary within are completely stale and outmoded by today's standards. I'm sure this movie would have had a great deal more impact if it had been produced in the 70s, and it probably would have gotten a better response from the critics too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it is obvious, especially in regards to the comment that IMDB decided to put as the headline, that most people cannot understand this movie. First, You have to understand the book to understand the movie. It is not about relating to the characters or a centered plot. What it is about is giving you a glimpse into the madness of probably the greatest drug addict to ever live. To watch someone be insane and love it is a wonderful experience.To sum up, if you wanted to see a popcorn movie then sure you were dissapointed. If you happen to have a open mind then you would have enjoyed this movie for much more than some of its slapstick comedy and may I suggest reading The Great Shark Hunt, a collection of Hunter S.

		<fullReview>On first glance, F&amp;L is not a book that is ideal for film. It is the surreal images of bats, giant lizards and cannibals that one would think would only work on the written page. I read the book before I saw the movie and was happily surprised that it does indeed pay homage to an extraordinarily original tale. The dialogue is very close to the written text and the images created are exactly as you'd imagine as you'd read the book. Looking at Duke's completely decimated hotel room near the end is testament to this fact. A couple of my mates have seen the film without reading the book and were unable to understand just what was going on, and I suspect most of the critics fell into the same boat. If you haven't read the book and been engrossed by HST's dialogue then there is no way on earth that you'll have any clue what the madness is about. So read the book, watch the film and sit back and understand just what Thompson was on about. Johnny Depp is great, Benicio is excellent. This is a movie that was always destined to be something of a cult classic. Even if you hate it, you'll understand its greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Madness. It makes no sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Madness. It makes no sense. This is for sure a hallucinating, surreal, Tripp trip to the Vegas I had ever been subjected to. Yet, I could not relate all the happenings in the film, substantiate them with a story and then take this is as one film. Terry Gilliam is a fantastic director who know how to play with written work and with the camera too. But here, something coherent in writing and camera work was missing. Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke and Benecio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo have played the roles with such conviction and freedom that they seem real, natural and the best part they feel like the characters and not the actors. They have given their everything into these characters like Johnny Depp going Bald and Del Toro growing a big fat tummy. It should have been a very daunting task for them physical and psychologically to hold this film tight in grip and give away their everything. Johnny Depp we know is one of the finest actors and turns into a chameleon. But Its Del Toro who rose above the script so high that even a look into the guys of a girl, made me shiver as much as the girl shivered. Terry Gilliam made something creepy, hallucinating and even monochromatic with those red scenes sprayed for some good amount of time in the film. Yet, he did not stitch them well is what I strongly felt. Well, I agree that when under the influence of narcotics, its all random and nothing coherent or organized but when I look at the other films like Trainspotting and put this in that league, it had a big flaw. That one flaw is lack of a story. 2 guys go to Las Vegas, have fun and get back. OK, but how and what is the purpose. This is what is essentially lacking is what I felt.Having said that, it is surely one of the Tripp films and I may dare say indeed the best hallucinating films that hits the psyche when one is high. But sad part is, I was always sober when I watched it and also let me confess, this is the second time I watched. First viewing was random and I could not contemplate much, though I missed something. But in the second viewing now, I found that there is nothing much to talk or write or contemplate about this film. Having said that it is not be a film to be written off either, some may find it completely Tripp, of the cuff, brilliant and even flamboyant. Thus making it great. The music is used well, The cinematography, art direction, the costumes and the make up are just pitch perfect with the tone of the film. Even other departments like editing, casting must be appreciated. But yes, I believe it lacked Direction. A film that begins with a terrific monologue and made me delve for the first half an hour into a trip, just lost steam later and it took me places where I was not so happy to be. Having said all that, it is very difficult for me to give a rating for this. Though it did not work for me, it may work for many who appreciate many elements of this and give this away for the lack of direction. So for myself I am going with an average rating of 2/5. But please check it out and judge it. Hopefully you may find something which you will like about this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing is a movie that you either get or you don't. It's one of those movies that I can watch with some friends and have them cracking up, or with other friends and they're looking at me like WTF? This movie is one of my favorite comedies because you can pretty much find something to laugh at in every scene. Whether it's the acting (Depp and del Toro, and even a cameo by Tobey Maguire provide some great laughs), the dialogue ("I've never been able to properly explain myself in this climate."), and the wacky visuals, this film has so much comedic genius in it. Depp really does a great job here, and for those that are sick of Depp in Tim Burton's films, or in Pirates, well here is a great example of Depp's ability to act outside of that. Granted, his character in this does share a lot of similarities with Jack Sparrow, but this came out five years before Pirates did. Benicio del Toro is great as Depp's attorney, and friend who accompanies him to Vegas on this LSD joyride. The scenes between them are priceless. This is probably my favorite Terry Gilliam film, not counting the Monty Python films. Most of the time movies about people partying (Hangover, Superbad, etc) are boring, and predictable to me. With Fear and Loathing, the drug scenes are filled with clever dialogue, and great visuals, not pointless sex references and party jokes. This is an intelligent comedy. Some of what comes out of Depp's mouth really is great stuff. Just the sheer nature of the film is enough...it's mental. So relax, sit down, and remember you can't stop in bat country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is one of those movies you just have to go along with, or else turn it off - I say turn it off because I just caught it on TV, its theater days over.Written by Hunter S. Thompson, this wild tale is actually based on a true story: Thompson was attempting to get inside information on the killing of a Mexican-American TV journalist, Ruben Salazar. Having difficulty speaking to his source, Oscar Zeta Acosta, an attorney, in the atmosphere of LA, amidst racial tensions, the two travel to Las Vegas. Thompson has assignments there from Sports Illustrated, one to write a short paragraph, really just a caption accompanying photos of a motorcycle race.This was an example of "Gonzo journalism" during which Thompson would put himself in the midst of the story. In the film, Johnny Depp plays the Thompson character, Raoul Duke, and Benicio del Toro, who gained 40 pounds for the role of "Dr. Gonzo," Raoul's "300 pound Samoan attorney." In the film, it is also arranged for Raoul to cover a narcotics officer conference.They're well stocked: with them, they have two bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, five sheets of blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of coke, and assorted uppers, downers, etc., along with enough booze to keep all of Vegas happy for weeks.With Depp as Raoul narrating the story, we are introduced to 1971 Las Vegas, not the Disneyland that it is today, but the sleazy, rundown, crowded, liquored up Las Vegas with its glaring lights.It is here that Dr. Gonzo and Raoul search for the American dream in their paranoid, drugged out state, seeing enemies everywhere, trashing hotel rooms, skipping out on bills, wrecking cars, attacking the maid, seeing bats and monsters -- and after all of it, Raoul coming to the conclusion that the drug state glamorized by Dr. Timothy Leary was a big flop, referring to those participating in the acid culture as "a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel." You have to be in the mood for this film, because nothing actually happens much -- it's just one psychedelic trip after another, often hilarious. Johnny Depp, sporting a bald head, is absolutely fantastic, as is del Toro.This film is not for everyone, but it sports a fun soundtrack, some of the old Vegas, and some excellent acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe it to be one of the largest travesties that Benicio Del Toro received such harsh criticism in this film. He is absolutely brilliant, IMO. Picture him from this movie, then picture him in Crash and then in Usual Suspects. If you didn't know, you would believe it to be three completely different actors, three different people.De Niro, Hollywood's darling that can do no wrong, received such high praise and many awards were bestowed upon him in for what he did to his body in order to star in, what I believe to be an average movie: Raging Bull. Raging Bull has it's good moments, but it is poorly edited (as are most of Scorsese films), poorly acted and melodramatic. I think Del Toro received poor marks on this film because most reviewers couldn't get past the drug use and simply pigeonholed the film as a "drug movie". I don't use drugs yet I find this movie wildly entertaining. While drugs play a role, it's to illustrate their uselessness and the uselessness of the hippie culture as a whole. Thompson even says as much when he criticizes Timothy Leary as being the sole destructive force to the ideals he tried to create.The most basic outline of the plot: "Journalist goes to cover a race, does nothing but abuse drugs and gets nothing accomplished" - reflects the opinion of drugs, the hippie movement and government that I think Thompson wanted to relate to people.Basically, I just wanted to give Del Toro - one of the most underrated actors around now - his proper due, and the respect he deserves for this movie. There isn't a moment he's on film that I'm unable to unlock my eyes from him. Reminds me of Steve McQueen from Magnificent Seven and how he did all these little things to stand out from Yul Brenner. Del Toro takes this to the Nth degree. Del Toro manages to do this with subtlety AND while being in your face.It is a brilliant performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many people say that the point of this movie is being pointless and that's why it is good. I don't get this. If a movie is pointless and boring on purpose it is still pointless and boring and that's what makes it a bad movie. I rate my viewing pleasure and not what a movie wants to be or why. This movie failed with entertaining me, making me think, touching me, making me laugh... to be honest, the only thing I felt was boredom mixed with some anger about the lack of almost everything that makes a good movie.I mean really, why should someone watch this? There is no story and no "characters", only some people who take drugs the whole movie. It's not even funny. (I'm not a huge fan of drug movies in general but if you wanna watch a good one than watch "Requiem for a Dream".) There are a lot of bad movies out there but only few make me angry. This happens if a movie is trying to be something it is not. "Fear Loathing in Las Vegas" wants to be a piece of modern art. It does not need a story or characters, no, it does not even need a point because it is "beyond" those things. It's like spitting on a piece of paper and calling it art.Rating: 2/10. (Depp and Del Torro make the two stars just by their presence)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp made it happen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas is a story with pointlessness as a point to the story and the film is packed with enough drugs to make even a monkey high. Someone like me who has knowledge of Hunter S. Thompson, his friends, and gonzo journalism, will definitely not get this movie or love it as much as the people who know a lot about it. Hunter S. Thompson seems like the man who has broken everything that every religion says about drugs along with his friend "Dr Gonzo". I haven't researched him up but if he sounds, looks, and talks like what Johnny Depp Portrayed in the film, then he surely is weird. Johnny Depp has probably made this character look presentable on screen at best. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor who has starred in a lot of masterpieces that, definitely, includes Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas. I love his mannerism, his speech in the film, and of course, I loved his performance to the point of extreme madness. Benicio Del Toro on the other hand was immaculate as well for portraying an overweight lawyer and friend Of Raoul Duke (Hunter S. Thompson) who looks disgusting on the screen. His part was one of the most disturbing character studies ever, "it" was a mix between the cannibals out of Wrong Turn and Hannibal Lecter. That is how disturbing it was. The film itself will make you high with pleasure as you see life through the two mismatched pairs as they are being taken over by hundred drugs of drugs. The film will go all fuzzy and twirly, and swirly forever when the the duo are on drugs and at times, they see imaginary creatures like bats over their heads. Scenes like those are very hard to digest and very annoying because you don't really know what is going on. I give two thumbs up for the brilliant narration, spoken by Johnny Depp, because sometimes, as I have said before that, the film will be hard to take in and the narration will elaborate more on what is happening. The narration was also great to hear because it had a great voice saying the narration and it also contains a lot of expression. Tobey Maguire plays the "Hitchhiker", a character without a background and who has long white hair that looks vile. Tobey Maguire was still in his rookiness and so I fail to give him a positive review about his performance. Aside from this small role, we also see Camera Diaz who is listed on IMDb as the "Blonde TV Woman" taking on somebody who has a "negative" encounter with one of the boys who has a gun. Cameron Diaz will happily get a positive review from me.An adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's novel of the same name. The film details a whacky search for the "American Dream", by Thompson and his crazed, Samoan lawyer. Fueled by the massive amount of drugs they purchased with an advance from a magazine to cover a sporting event in Vegas; they set out in the Red Shark. Encountering police, reporters, gamblers, racers, and hitchhikers; they search for some undefinable thing know only as the "American Dream" and find fear, loathing and hilarious adventures into the dementia of the modern American West.The music used in this motion picture has been greatly chosen. This film contains songs by Jefferson Airplane who have a song called "White Rabbit" that immediately caught my attention and another song by them called "Somebody To Love" which was glamorous as well. There are also songs by The Blues Brothers, The Young Bloods, Frank Sinatra, and many, many more. One other thing I want to talk about is Johnny Depp's hair in this film and how absurd it looks. It might have belonged to Hunter S. Thompson but it doesn't look good on Johnny, I don't know why I brought up the hair thing but isn't it weird? Terry Gilliam has some notable films on his list and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas has to be one of the notable film. This film came to be a surprise and I didn't expect much out of it but it is quite promising to those who understand it. I recommend this film to people who have "no Life"! That was a joke, right? I recommend this film to people who want to watch it. That's it! The End!"Over and Out." 27 May 2010.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you not into taking drugs then just get really drunk and watch this. It's even funnier when you're on something.The characters are so absurd and over the top but somehow totally believable. Knowing the story of Hunter S Thompson you can imagine a lot of this actually took place.If anyone has had a friend who always goes that one step too far and makes you really anxious then you can also relate to this movie. There's a brilliant edge to the film always worrying that the Lawyer is going to go too far.It's fun to watch it and fantasize about being that free. But for most of us it's just a fantasy and we tend to conform to the social norms. Great piece of escapism for anyone with a mild anarchistic streak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We were somewhere around Barstow. On the edge of the desert. When the drugs began to take hold.......100X</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning !! This review and movie refer to a huge amount of illicit material. If you are easily offended by that, stop reading and never, ever watch this movie unless you wish to become a red-shirt-bathroom wonderer.)"I feel a bit lightheaded. I think maybe you should drive." Thats how this movie was for me from the beginning. Prior to this movie, I had no clue who or what Hunter Thompson was. I actually remember the moment quite vividly. I was with my-then-girlfriend, and we had just seen Godzilla (the horrible Broderick version). I had seen the posters before and Johnny Depp. I then convinced her to theater skip in to see F&amp;L. To my surprise the theater was mostly empty. There was a maximum of 30 people in the room (in a 300 capacity theater). It was also at this time that I had my first taste of chiba. I was simply stunned. I routinely tell the "untrained" that this movie would give one an idea of what it would it be like, without actually being there. I even developed a taste for Singapore Slings with Mescal on the side. This is also special in that its my centennial review.Two men. The dessert. In a fire-apple red convertible. Attacking bats?? Case full of all the drugs know to civilized men since 1544 AD. They pick up Tobey Maguire hitchhiking in the desert (who never rode in a convertible before). Raoul Duke (a.k.a - Hunter Thompson - Johnny Depp) proceeds to explain to Tobey and to us, why he and Dr. Gonzo (a.k.a. - Oscar Acosta - Benicio Del Toro) are precisely where they are and what they are doing there (a.k.a. - the plot). This is done mostly in a flashback to the previous Friday afternoon in Los Angeles. Hunter gets a call for a press assignment. He's to go to Las Vegas, check into his hotel and write a story about the Mint 500 motorcycle race. Dr. Gonzo, as Hunter's lawyer and confidant, advises him to pick up Acopolco shirts, rent a very fast car with no top, tape recorder for special music and cocaine. We are returned into the present where Hunter and Gonzo proceed to completely freak out Tobey. Most newcomers to this movie assume, after this opening scene and the next 15 minutes, that this is some stoner movie like Cheech and Chong or Half Baked. It's more than that. Hunter's words with Terry Gilliam's vision turn this movie into something more. F&amp;L is part comedy, part satire, part homage to the 60's and the subculture movement (Gilliam's obvious tribute to Hunter, Jack Kerouac, Abbie Hoffman, William S. Burroughs, etc) and part introspective into the American psyche. The collaboration between Hunter, Johhny Depp, Benicio and Terry Gilliam help to infuse this movie with life. Hunter was a consultant to Terry and even makes a cameo in a flashback to the acid craze in San Francisco (funny scene as Hunter looks at himself, in the 3rd person). Johnny spent months with Hunter prior to shooting. Benicio gained dozens of pounds for the role. It's so good that it questions itself half way through the movie. Is it a mindless, mind-altering trip with no message or is it really a serious critique of the American lifestyle (a.k.a - American Dream) ?? There is also a nice peppering of cameos : Ellen Barkin, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci, Mark Harmon, Cameron Diaz and Flea. The rest of the movie could be described as a series of vignettes as Duke and Gonzo go from one assignment to another (the other covering the Nation District Attorney's Conference across town at the Flamingo Hotel). Its all full of the people, places and drugs they experience. Don't fight the experience. You'll get brain bubbles.F&amp;L is veritable cornucopia of quotes : "All right. You stay here and go to jail. I'm leaving. Come on you fiend. Nothing. I want nothing.""..Bazooka Circus is what we'd all be doing on a Saturday night if the Nazis won the war.""One of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug, especially when it's waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye.""...that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last minute pre-dawn chaos of a stale Las Vegas casino.""No. No. Calm down. Learn to enjoy losing.""Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop. Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side. This is wrong. It arouses contempt in the cop heart. Make the bastard chase you. He will follow.""You took too much man. You took too much. Too much.""Listen. Lets get down to brass tax here. How much for the ape?""It was all over now. We'd abused every that Vegas lived by. Burning the locals. Abusing the tourists. Terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possible believe it." Like all the other Terry Gilliam movies, multiple viewings is a requirement. Each new viewing opens another window. F&amp;L is a look at the myth of the "American Dream" from a subculture point of view. Most people know the path for the main stream, but few know of the others. In the end, even that view is not sufficient. Perhaps the "truth" is somewhere in between, or maybe its neither. Or maybe it never existed. Maybe the truth is something that we figure out on a individual basis after experiencing a few different paths. The end is a blank slate, and there is hope. Or maybe there isn't ?? Keep on truckin' !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely off the beaten path. But that being said, Depp's morphing into this character that Hunter Thompson created, was one of the better i've seen in a long time. Excellent supporting role by Bencicio Del Toro as well. I think that the average straightedge person who hasn't touched a sip of beer or hit of a joint will probably find this movie absurd. Lucky for me that doesn't apply :) You will be hard pressed to find a movie like this anywhere, it doesn't have to rely on sex or violence to captivate the audience.I also recommend reading the book by Hunter Thompson, before you see the movie. The book goes into much more detail about their escapades, but is an easy read.I give it two thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hunter S. Thompson's novel has been brought to life by the master of outrageous visuals, Terry Gilliam.My first viewing of this movie made me realize what a complete wacko Hunter S. Thompson was. I read the book after I saw the movie, and the book was even more insane than the movie.There are the typical Terry Gilliam visuals in the movie which make the film a memorable experience. Johnny Depp was absolutely stunning as Raoul Duke, the alter-ego of Hunter S. Thompson himself. Benicio Del Toro is absolutely at his disgustingly best as Doctor Gonzo, a repulsive character, which I believe represents the title of the film. He is fearful and loathsome in Las Vegas.All in all, a grand film of drugs, drugs, drugs, Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro and the visual master of the bizarre, Terry Gilliam. A film worth watching if you are brave to experience another world of cinema.R.I.P. Hunter S. Thompson You Will Always Be Remembered!!!10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I left the movie theater when I saw this opening weekend in Santa Fe, NM wondering to myself -- how is middle America going to react to this movie? I had to shake my head because it had been sold as a road trip comedy, which it is anything but (except maybe to a 17 year old). It stands up pretty well, probably Gilliam's best movie since the classic "Brazil". The biggest reason are Benicio Del Toro and Johnny Depp's excellent performances in the lead roles, but there is plenty of other eye and brain candy here to enjoy, as I'm sure this is a film that can and will be enjoyed in all the various states of intoxication. As someone who was myself stuck in Las Vegas for a week after a somewhat harried experience seeing the Grateful Dead at Sam Boyd Stadium (something of a trial in itself, despite their excellent performances), it definately struck home with me. Vegas is a town that's been beating on an artificial heart ever since it was invented. If anything was going to make this sick town actually likeable, strangely enough it might be this disturbing, sad, and funny movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only Terry Gilliam could have made this film based on the rather laconic book written by Hunter S. Thompson. This film was such a head trip, one had to wonder how much of the material was thought up. Johnny Depp further displays his range by taking on this role, being totally adrift in a world of drugs and alcohol. Kudos to Terry Gilliam's for having the audacity to make this film, which further exemplifies the fact he needs to keep making drug induced hysteria and make it palatable for the rest of the population to understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my all time favourite movie. All those with a sense of humour derived from "the brady bunch" will not enjoy this movie, so don't rent it in case you offend yourselves...Wow, Johnny Depp is incredible in this role. I couldn't believe how convincing he was. Del Toro was the consummate support, and gave a brilliant performance. Gilliam shows directorship well beyond his league.To sum in one sentence: It is a road movie that will grip you, put you through a washing machine, and make you shake with laughter.Some of the things that make this film special will be lost on the fans of industrial light and magic ( although there were some good effects in here... ) The film is really about a head trip. It doesn't necessarily place itself as a "drug" movie - even if that's a main prop in it. It is a masterpiece of literary transcription. It is far more interesting than the book.All in all - this film is, as usual a way - underrated classic. While millions of peons are shelling out their dough for utter crap like Titanic and the like, movies like this will receive far less credit than they deserve.10 out of 10 Mr. Gilliam, you're a genius - please make some more films for us fans to admire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe I'm just partial to excessive drug use, but anyone who has ever tried it or is curious about certain drugs and what the experience is like would enjoy this movie. It seems the writer of the original review does not fit into either of these categories. Depp, as well as *many* other big-name actors/actresses appeared in this film for a reason. It wasn't just an unexpected big bust. It does have a strong cult following. I know a multitude of people who wouldn't consider their video collection complete without Fear and Loathing. It's very accurate, as far as the trips/side effects go, and it's absolutely hilarious.If you still don't get it, try reading the novel from which the movie spawned. Given, the movie couldn't portray a work this deeply involved inside the human, drug-induced mind, but it is still an accurate portrayal of two guys doing what they want to do: rebel. Lots of people get into other movies about rebellion and anti-culture. If this were the 60's, it'd probably be well received. So it doesn't have a well defined plot. Try dropping acid and find a well defined plot that night. It was an intentional element to the movie, in my opinion. What else would you expect from such a talented director?! Give the man some MORE credit with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is a freak show - with or without the drugs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGASWhat they don't tell you when you when you front the counter to buy your tickets for this film is that the price includes a two hour hit of movie mescaline.So you never did drugs in the 60s? The 70s? Not even the 80s? Worry not. Now in the 90s this movie is as good as, or better than, the real thing. And you won't get busted.This however is not a film about drugs. It is a film about the excesses and freaks of society, with or without your head being blown away with substances. It does not glorify drugs - quite the opposite.This is a time warp film, designed to light up the remaining brain cells of baby boomers with memories of all that social anarchy and chaos that characterised the late 60s and early 70s. Gen Xers seeing this movie however will probably continue to be quite mystified about what exactly the olden days were like.This film is not a story. It is an experience. There is no plot. A few circumstances form a flimsy backbone for a few drug crazed days, mostly in Las Vegas. The film is utterly faithful to the book by Hunter S Thompson. Johnny Depp is utterly faithful to the spirit of the lead character, Raoul Duke. Benicio Del Toro taking the off lead as Duke's equally drug riddled attorney Dr Gonzo is also true to his part. Terry Gilliam as director brings in the best excesses from his days involved with the hallucinogenic Monthy Python team.But this film is something more than a drug riddled orgy of carnage and destruction. It is also a pithy social documentary, focussed on the late 60s but equally relevant to the late 90s. It is a sick view of a sick society. In both a literal and metaphorical sense Fear and Loathing is an acid commentary on the worst excesses, not only of drug taking, but of social existence.The two lead characters are quite obviously sick, depraved, drug crazed animals, by any reasonable construction. They are never seen in anything other than a totally wasted condition, and invariably behaving in the most outrageous anti-social manner imaginable. They have a briefcase loaded with every conceivable drug, all of which are swilled down with copious amounts of alcohol. The entire film is shot through their eyes and hallucinations abound as the special Fx team morphs the carnage that is their external reality into the bizarre visions that reflect their drug induced internal reality.However ? and here is where this film is so really outstanding ? every other character, every other scene, every other circumstance in the movie is also a circus side-show or a freak attraction. The essential difference is that all these other bizarre cameos all reflect an ordinary reality, uncoloured by the Hunter S Thompson orgy of drugs. As such they are, by and large, taken as unremarkable. It is only when this other kaleidoscope of human freaks and weird events is juxtaposed against the lush technicolour hallucinations of the two lead characters that the blurring between drug induced fantasy and everyday reality becomes so obvious. The distinction becomes impossible to detect.Without exception every secondary character in this movie is a freak of one kind or another. They are social misfits, they are physically abnormal, they are distorted personalities or, as in the case of the DA Convention Against Hard Drugs where every participant is seen with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, they are living contradictions of any notion of sense and normality. Even Hunter S Thompson plays a cameo role ? fortunately for cult followers as yet another social freak masquerading as Mr Ordinary.The setting for most of the movie is Las Vegas ? a classic freak show environment of its own. Utterly segregated by both physical location and its inherent raison d'etre from any ordinary reality, this isolated city in the desert offers the perfect surreal platform from where the two lead characters can wreak most of their own hallucinogenic carnage.This movie is rich in many ways. It is rich in its filming and its execution. It is rich in its pace and ? short of walking out - the viewer has no option but to go along for his own two hours of drug induced madness. It is rich in characterisation and totally over the top. It is rich in special Fx and it is rich in its ironic view of straight society. It is as enthusiastically politically incorrect as one would expect from all of its other excesses.As every bit as much as this is a film of its time, Fear And Loathing is also a film of this time. Little has changed about the freak show that constitutes much of the fringes of our society, and which we somehow have come to accept quite uncritically. It is only when the acerbic lens of this movie is trained upon the absurdities and paradoxes with which we all more or less peacefully co-exist that we realise how fine the line between madness and sanity really is. Importantly, as well, how impossible it is to actually know where that line is drawn. Not to mention on what side of it we each stand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something about the movie... I guess.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a wonderful movie. Some people find this movie meaningless, and I was one of these people. The first time I watched this movie I was bored, even being a person who love almost everything kind of drug-related. I watched the movie until the end, and thought "Uh... it wasn't that bad." ; I was just expecting something else, maybe something more serious, more sad, something more Requiem For a Dream-y. My point is : this movie isn't a drama "despicting different forms of addiction, leading to the characters' imprisonment in a dream world of delusion and reckless desperation that is subsequently overtaken and devastated by reality". This movie won't make you feel guilty, or feel bad after watching it, disgusted by the situation of the protagonists. If you're expecting some sad stories about drug use you can move to another movie (e.g. Trainspotting, or again, Requiem For a Dream). Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is fun. And I'd add something related to a personal experience : the movie in itself could seem a little boring, meaningless, maybe you will (at first, and like I did) be annoyed by the special FX (hallucinations, among other things). If you are in that case, watch the movie being high ; it's just so different! I hope you enjoyed reading my review (uh, I think you didn't), I'm not used to write review about things and whatever, my English isn't even good, but it's okay as long as I can share things with people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Salute to Gonzo - Quality viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problems with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are many. A one-line concept that looks good on paper (which also worked in an earlier English film - Where the Buffalo Roam) goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing. A well-intentioned idea gets crushed to smithereens under the weight of its own gargantuan ambition. A director so completely besotted by his own much applauded first films goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film (The Fish King) - try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick. The problem is - what worked fabulously in The Fish King were the emotional excesses of the Karan Johar school of film-making, but here, 'emotion' doesn't quite grace us with its appearance on the screen - no, not even cursorily. The writer/ director gives us 'relationships with one common problem - drugs', but where is the intensity, where is the depth, where is the 'emotion'? A 'tribute to drugs' sans emotion? And one that goes on and on and on...... Nah, it just cannot work!In my opinion, the basic requirement for a portmanteau film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be 'complete', it should - in some way or the other - follow the graph of the traditional three-act structure (screen writing guru, Tony Grisoni's Paradigm). That's the real reason why Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas didn't work for me. None of the stories had any depth or a roller-coaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream Hindi cinema. Also, the linkage between some of the stories seemed tenuous and very forced. It's not clear what Raoul Duke is doing at a Debbie Reynolds concert. If he was required to be present at the event for a neat wrap-up, why not conjure a few more coincidences and bring the others also to the affair? That would be neater.But yes, some of the stories did have a lot of promise. For one, the Dr Gonzo Chawla story tries to address a very real situation - mid-life crisis, but its journey is so linear that you're left wondering if it was really an issue. Similarly, the problem of commitment in the oddball journalist and his psychopathic lawyer story is also true to life. If only it was developed a little better. I felt that the more promising stories in this mish-mash were told from the male point of view, which is fine, but it brings down the emotional quotient of these stories because the female characters - Christina Ricci and Cameron Diaz in particular - have all the depth of a half-filled bath tub. Wasn't this film supposed to be about 'Hunter S. Thompson'? Now the actors. Johnny Depp still needs to learn acting, while Benicio Del Toro is dependable and endearing as ever. Gary Busey gets a role written just for him but sometimes overplay the boredom of his character. Since she didn't get a meaty character to portray, Christina Ricci uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it. Lyle Lovett is fine despite going a trifle over-the-top in a few scenes. Ayesha Takia has nothing much to do, but she does remind us that she's the same girl who surprised us with her bravura performance in Dor. Katherine Helmond tries to make up for that HUGE mistake called Bhagam Bhag, and succeeds to a large extent.That brings me the most irritating track of the film (which unpardonably ends up hogging the maximum screen time) - Johnny Depp and Dr Gonzo. The track is irritating mainly because of them. But I must credit them for their consistency. They're consistently BAD all through the film. Johnny Depp could well be the next queen of hamming - I don't buy the crap that his role (that of an 'Gonzo Journalist') required him to act over-the-top. Somebody should tell him the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright hamming. If you've seen Rakhi Sawant (who seems to be the inspiration behind this role) in her interviews and Bigg Boss you'll know what I mean. I strongly feel that if Nikhil Advani had taken Rakhi Sawant in this role rather than a bigger star like Johnny Depp, the story would have worked better. Johnny Depp's phony accent is.....well, Shannon Esra's Hindi is less accented than Johnny Depp's.To be fair to the director, he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film. I particularly liked the use of grey as the predominant color in the Dr Gonzo story as a metaphor for their boring existence, and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the drug usage. But will anyone choose to paint their house in varying, depressing shades of grey? That's acceptable cinematic license I would say. But when the film runs almost for 2 hours, it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his 'touch' in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequences.Despite all these plot and acting flaws the movie is watchable but it could have been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The man who makes an animal of himself takes away the pain of being a man." - Dr Johnson.Terry Gilliam's film begins with this quote by Dr Johnson. Its a quote which immediately put's "Fear and Loathing" in it's proper context. Our drug fuelled heroes, Duke and Gonzo, drive to LA in a car packed with hard drugs. They do not wish to assault LA with their excess, rather they wish to merge with it. Duke (Depp) is very upfront with the fact that he and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo (Del Toro), are not products of the sixties but rather products of the seventies. They're trying to tap into an age that is now gone (the 60s), in an attempt to understand or be part of it.As a political movie and a movie which hopes to "tap" into a past zeitgeist, the film is a failure, but I don't think that's Gilliam's intention. Duke and Gonzo are looking to experience a past state of mind. They're looking for the American dream. They're looking for the fire and the passion stirred up by the drug fuelled revolutionaries of the 60s. The film, however, aware that the American dream doesn't exist, is content to simply wallow in their drug induced visions and bizarre lifestyle. It knows there's nothing to find and so relishes the act of escaping.The idea of becoming an animal to take away the pain of being a man reminds us Gilliam's most famous film, "Brazil". In "Brazil", the protagonist escapes from his totalitarian government into fantasy and "forbidden" entertainments while others around him initiate actual revolutionary change.It's the same story here, only far more pessimistic. The Gonzo character is based on an activist who gained notoriety and great support in defending various revolutionaries and protest groups. He disappeared in the summer of 1974, the victim of either political opponents or drug dealers. But none of this is present in Gilliam's film. Here, Dr Gonzo is utterly without any socio-political consciousness. He's just a slob who's only connection to the 60's are his kinky love for their children.Both the film's characters identify the 1970s as a low point in American History, but Gilliam rightly recognises that this false perception is only due to how bloated and spoilt Americans had become after World War II. It's been so long since Americans were able to experience human misery firsthand that they could now only understand it in a pop context. Gilliam includes references to Nixon, war, soldiers and Vietnam throughout the film, but emphasises how hollow it all seems. It's all coded on television, in cartoon or puppet form, distant, commodified and meaningless.So what is being said is really just that the 1970s were a low point for American culture, not because of all the wars and strife, but because everyone was a slobbering, affluent moron. Man didn't know what real suffering was. To get away from this, the characters turn to drugs. Likewise, because the film sees current America (1990's) in the same way, it seeks to "get away" by applying frantic camera work, bombastic visual effects and a real sense of drug-like energy.It all works, but it still seems like a very superficial one note movie. Made in 1998, I guess "Fear and Loathing" suffers mostly because it was made before 9/11. The 90s were all about middle class resentment (Magnolia, Rushmore, Fight Club, John Malkovich, American Beauty, Very Bad Things etc). These films saw middle class life as being so easy that it all became just a suicidally dull bore, suburban man suffering for mundane reasons, not knowing what true horror was.But then 9/11 came and suddenly there were bigger things to worry about. Suddenly suburbia was a place for "War of the Worlds" and "Cloverfield". Even PIXAR got in on the post 9/11 unease with "The Incredibles". American towns were suddenly no longer safe. Of all the pre 9/11 angst movies, only "Eyes Wide Shut" and "Existenz" now feels genuine, with their focus on Bohemian Grove "George Bush" cults, shadowy political figures and the escape avenues afforded by technology. Intellectual directors, Kubrick and Cronenberg manage to sidestep the reactionary "we are under threat by foreign monsters" Hollywood phase (Cloverfield/War of the Worlds) and "the capitalist simulation isn't real" phase (Truman Show, Matrix etc) and home in on the real problem.So "Fear and Loathing" is more interesting as a film of its time, rather than some kind of timeless masterpieces. Yes it has no plot, but it's still a fun and energetic film. Johnny Depp's-noir like narration is funny and the film is filled with entertaining gimmicks and operatic camera work. 8/10 - Some kind of weird masterpiece. It all amounts to, essentially, a slap in the face to the white American middle class. It's also a celebration of film technique, Gilliam finally finding a story which justifies his excesses. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years down the road new generations will watch this film, and wonder what the critics were thinking. Being one of my personal favorites I find the majority of the reviews on this movie hard to stomach. On just about every level there's something good about this film. I guess if you only pay attention the plot of the movie, there's not much there to really think about. A reporter goes to Vegas to cover a bike race...But on this rare occasion it actually doesn't matter. The casting is amazing, there are characters everywhere you look. There is an atmosphere in this film that I've never seen anywhere else, and I have seen many films. Great music...This is a thoroughly entertaining picture. Not to mention it's hilarious. It's just too bad there aren't more like it.</fullReview>

For those who did, this film could be considered as a very faithful adaption to an already mad mindbending fiction/non-fiction autobiographical/non book. OK, so it didn't do well at the cinema, but doesn't that a cult movie make? Just sit back relax and enjoy the film as an experience, don't expect miracles, just be glad you saw something that is not mainstream, that does not need the Oscars.

		<shortDescription>A truly great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing movie, far too good for the mainstream barbaric US film audience. It has the courage to have absolutely no plot, no catharsis, no "emotional rollercoaster," basically none of the traditional cues that instruct you on what you should think and feel. Many people can't handle that, and I pity them. I found it totally liberating. You'll quickly realize you're unable to predict what happens next (I'm usually good at this) and you stop trying. I've never seen a movie succeed better at being a first-person narrative. The occasional "wisdoms" and observations spouted by the characters were just really great, without being presented as "oh, look at this, here is some clever and zany dialogue to show the screenplay writers are COOL and can, like, RELATE to, you know, other kinds of people." I really ended up liking these guys. They were over the top in the way that too few people are these days.If I were going to get more analytical, I'd say the movie is a statement about freedom. Looking at the lives portrayed and comparing them to yours will inevitably make you feel confined and ... domesticated. This theme runs through much of Gilliam's work: you have to transgress certain boundaries to achieve freedom. Well, the guys in the movie have no problem doing that, almost inevitably with hillarious consequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man." This quote from Dr. Samuel Johnson is found as a preface to both the movie, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson, from which it was adapted. Having previously read the novel no fewer than eight times, I think I finally understand the full scope of what Dr. Thompson meant to say, and I have this film and director Terry Gilliam to thank. There have been numerous historical eras that can be described as painful. Surely the time of the undeclared war in Viet Nam was one of these. On the advice of Timothy Leary, a lot of the young people in this country dropped out of the mainstream. Many became part of the drug culture. It was a combination of the horror of this war, driven by the military industrial complex and paid for with the blood of thousands of American youths, and the convenient, but dangerous escape route offered by drug gurus like Dr. Leary that gave birth to a warped concept of the American Dream. In Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Raoul Duke (the personification of Thompson himself) and his companion, known as Dr. Gonzo, set out to find the American Dream, or at least to determine what became of it. They are Hope and Crosby in the most bizarre "road" movie ever made. They take Dr. Johnson's warning as advice and make beasts of themselves. Two men from two of the more civilized professions, one a journalist and the other an attorney, ignore most of the known rules of polite society and leave a path littered with the assaulted sensibilities of those who have grown comfortable living in the shell of this once great country and strewn with the remains of whatever corporate property they consciously or unconsciously choose to destroy. The genius of Hunter S. Thompson is that he is able to project so dire an image in an amazingly entertaining format. The novel sweeps the reader along with the clownish antics of its two main characters but never lets go of its central message. The genius of Terry Gilliam lies in his ability to clarify that message while retaining every drop of humor. Once before, in Where the Buffalo Roam, the works of Hunter S. Thompson were assayed for the screen. That attempt was disappointing largely because of casting. Bill Murray is a very funny man but a mediocre actor. He was able to imitate Thompson but could not portray him. Johnny Depp, conversely, gives us the all externals and all the internals of a brilliant, complex and highly eccentric individual. Depp conveys to the audience Thompson's deep disappointment in the American Dream which he ultimately discovers in a all-night restaurant north of Las Vegas and leads us through the metamorphosis of a search into an escape. Johnny Depp is simply one of the finest actors, if not the best, working today. Peter Boyle is another terrific actor, yet as a Dr. Gonzo-like character in Where the Buffalo Roam was unable to play the part as written. I would instinctively blame the direction in that case. In Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Gilliam made the brilliant casting choice of Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo. Del Toro, with Gilliam's direction, brings out the menace in his character. Here is a person who could really hurt someone. In Depp's character we appreciate the disillusionment of many Americans with our government in 1971, but Del Toro shows us the anger that relents only with the recognition that he is among friends. This is a terrific movie, not only for its own merits, but also for the many celebrity cameos, including Thompson himself. I think that movie-goers will gain more enjoyment from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas if they read the book first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A savage journey to the heart of the American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 'A savage journey to the heart of the American Dream' is how Hunter S. Thompson describes his book. Not many have accomplished to do this in only a single sentence. This story of a journalist and his loyal attorney on a trip to Las Vegas has caused many people to try and find the message behind it all. This is all brought in perspective brilliantly in the filmed version of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas, thanks to Terry Gilliam. A very important feature in the story is the characters' states of mind. Thompson's initiate goal was to transfer the emotions felt by the characters to the reader, which is of course very difficult in books. His writing together with Ralph Steadman's illustrations indeed accomplished this, but Terry Gilliam topped it by far. Gilliam made perfect use of all the possibilities a movie brings, especially focusing on use of light and color. The movie sucks you into the screen and makes you part of the whole situation, causing you to experience the same state of mind as the characters. Most of the time this is confusion or at 'loss of basic motor skills', quoting the main character during a heavy ether trip. So how did Terry Gilliam make this effect on the viewers work? There are several techniques that are spotlessly used throughout the movie. The most important being the use of several colors, which are constantly used for explaining moods and emotions. You are able to distinguish three main colors: orange, white and blue. The color orange is constantly used when the characters are completely out of their minds. Blue is used to show a calm state of mind and white is used in the morning after a heavy night. I have to admit that I did not notice this the first time I watched the movie, but that might be the brilliant thing about it. Since you might have to watch this movie several times before you come to fully appreciate it and understand all aspects of it. I also like to explain Gilliam's choice of colors with Leonardo da Vinci's theory of light. In his theory he stated that every color has several international meanings. This is what he said about orange, blue and white. Orange stands for party, cosiness and joy. Blue shows truth, sanity and a clear mind. White stands for light, purity or emptiness. Another technique which was used to set the mood of the characters clearly was the way in which the light effects are used by Terry Gilliam. He uses the bright flashing lights of Las Vegas and the chaotic flashes of light occurring throughout this movie to set the mood of the characters in this movie very well. These effects create a setting in which the confused and chaotic states of mind, in which the characters are almost constantly, really stand out. The flawless acting from Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Torro in this movie expressed the states of minds of the two main characters Duke and Gonzo in this movie extraordinarily well. Their brilliant performance in this movie will really enhance the impression that this movie will leave on its viewers, as it makes the movie extremely convincing when the main characters and their drug-(ab)use are concerned. When seeing this movie from the beginning until the end, the humor and the psychedelic feeling stand out in a profound way. Looking back at the film, the uniqueness of the film will stand out even more than during the movie. There is a good reason why this film has many fan sites; it is a masterpiece in its kind. Throughout the internet famous quotes can be found ("We can't stop here, this is bat country!). These quotes are all written by Hunter S. Thompson, and selected from the book by Terry Gilliam. Most of the film critics have, over the years, come to agree that this movie is the father of all films about drugs. The scenes in which the main characters are completely out of their mind, are (with exceptions) a bit more difficult to fully remember because of the state of mind the viewer is in. It can be argued that the film has a relaxing effect, which makes it very easy and pleasant to watch and think about the movie. The scene which includes cruising through the desert in their car on a beautiful day is a perfect example of this. This would underline the themes and atmosphere in the story and would also mean that these associations can be made by a viewer when thinking back of the film. A film like this can be watched without the viewer thinking about the deeper motivations and theme's of this story and can then be enjoyed. But in order to "fully" enjoy the film, one must have a look at the entire movie as if it were any piece of art. In a poem for example, recurring sentences or structures create style figures. In this film, a similar thing is done using the lighting and color. This movie is a truly unique masterpiece, as there are very few movies like it and there probably won't be any in the (near) future either. So I can truly recommend Fear and loathing in Las Vegas to anyone who is in for an entertaining movie. It's a real must see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read any of S. Thompson's work, though I do know the basic nature of it. Thus, I can't for sure determine if this is more the result of his warped imagination, or that of Gilliam. Like few, if any, other films ever made, this puts you right inside the head of someone who is high. From start to finish, that is the look, feel, sound and mood of this(as far as I know). The paranoia, the 'logic', the fear, the bizarre sights, everything. Set design, costumes and effects are all excellent, and help build the freaky atmosphere. The editing is masterful, and the cinematography has a dynamic "loose" quality to it that really adds to the experience and the feel of it. This has brilliant and impeccably delivered, infinitely quotable dialog, as well as countless unforgettable moments. The acting is incredible, Del Toro and especially Depp are spot-on. All of the roles are perfectly cast; I even liked Penn Jillette. This is engaging, and immensely so, for how far out it is. There is a lot of disturbing content, constant strong language, explicit descriptions of sex, and brief nudity. I recommend this to any and all fans of Hunter and/or Terry. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always love when I turn a person onto this movie. Too many people think this movie is just about drugs and the logic of a half crazy narcissist. It has a deep underlying tone that taps into the core of American culture. The evolution of a culture has to be violent, crass &amp; revolutionary. This movie is that. This story takes place at the end of the civil rights movement where a blind and far too conservative America changes into something else. The narration where HS Thompson is talking about that "wave" sums it up. What was going on in America when this story happened? The end of Vietnam, The Civil Rights Movement, Watergate, etc. Those who went along for the ride at that time wanted to change America. Maybe it didn't turn out the way they really wanted but what do we have now that we didn't have before? It's not only socially acceptable to question authority, to not do so is Un-American. Thompson was the fulcrum in this. Before him journalism was too conservative. Thompson blew this away. He was everything that needed to push America into a new era. The best thing is that he makes no apologies for anything he did. He had to open that inner-eye. That is what this movie captures and it makes no apologies. Terry Gilliam, Johnny Depp were "Gonzo" enough to make this movie and they did this in the most excellent form. Johnny Depp portrayal of Thompson conveyed the message of this story perfectly. The best part about the story was the fact that it never set out to be one, it just happened. Thompson was the underlying kick in the ass that America needed to look inward and see itself for what it really was. A movie that can be a literal time capsule of the reality of a specific culture is a beautiful thing. It is even better when it isn't America trying to speak for another culture. This movie is the reality of America as dissected by an American. It looks at itself for what it is, like a naked person in a mirror. This movie will always be a favorite for me. Whenever I can expose someone else to this it's more precious than a bought education. Watch the movie without a joint and go beyond the chaos. Watch this movie for what it is. If you have never read the book, get off your butt and do now! Gonzo forever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was somewhere around East Estonia when I got hold of the book. It was the summer of 96... I never returned it to my friend. There was not much to return. Then in 1999 There was a movie in our cinemas they had translated into estonian as something like "To Las Vegas on Wheels". I had no effin idea it was a movie based on that very same book! You can imagine my surprise when I went to see it....no, actually, you can't. There is no way of expressing the surprise I felt. I had just gotten 18.... I had no guts to tell ANYONE I had even seen such a movie. My parents had seen the book lying around, but they don't speak English. I had plans to mention it, but I was delayed when a local newspaper published a review with a picture of Dr. Gonzo as SPOILER!a hairy - titted devil. Besides, I know what my parents would have said. "We are right in the middle of an economic crisis and someone is showing drug movies to our goddamn children!!!!" Yes, a very bad moment. Now it has been almost 8 years...It HAS been 8 years! What the F***? But, man, I tell you, you'd have to be crazy on electric bills to think this movie's advocating drugs to anyone. It is THE trip that no person can ever have again. So why bother trying? Besides, it is a scary trip, yes sir, morey eels, huge bats and polar bears and maniacs in the bathtub. How about some ether? You can handle your parent screaming at you for watching men slicing Z-s on each others forehead, but no one should be asked to handle your mom saying "Oh, great-grandmother sipped ether every night in her rocking chair, falling asleep with her legs spread and mouth wide open. And we the girls had a bottle along on cold winter days going to school in PRESCHOOL. " This makes me wonder....Duke and Gonzo only got their high by sniffing? Softies. The body language, both of them - brilliant! Maximum input....and out...put...It has caught every side of the story. The crazy, the absurd, the violent, the nostalgic, the outrageous. And after you have finished watching it, watch the last Pirate movie again, and find 5 similarities. You are now leaving Redfox's comment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be, by far, the weirdest movie I've seen in a long time. Also, its the funniest. Terry Gilliam proves once again he is a great director with this spaced-out psychedelic trip of a movie. There is little to no plot, LOTS of acid trips, marijuana highs, ether drunkenness and God knows what else they did in the movie, and other weird things of the 70's.Johnny Depp portrays YET another extremely interesting character, and he does it wonderfully. The mumbling,(he has a cigarette in his mouth ALL the time)stoned, former revolutionary Duke, who is also a reporter, is great in every scene he's in. Benicio Del Toro is a fat, equally stoned, aggressive lawyer, who hangs around with Depp for no good reason. Together, they draw a wide line of chaos wherever they go. The busted up hotel-room after a day-long trip is a marvelous sight.Various actors make small roles, such as Tobey McGuire as a inexperienced hitchhiker who get's picked up by the dysfunctional duo while they're high on at least three different drugs, and Cameron Diaz plays a reporter in a small part.As for the plot, it's pretty basic. Depp goes to Las Vegas to cover a Hells Angels desert race. He screws up, bad, and his misadventures in Vegas starts.This is not a serious movie. It's weird, silly, strange, twisted and trippy. In that way, it captures the feel of that time better than any other movie, even 'Hair'.A has-to-be-seen movie. Has to be seen to be believed, that is.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fear and Loathing in Las-Vegas" is a narcotic story- autobiography of the lost generation of the seventieth based on the Hunter Thompson's novel. This is the most controversial but not the best work by Terry Gilliam, the author of such staggering films as "Monthy Python and the Holy Grail", "Brazil", Fisher King", "12 Monkeys".I am very impressed by Gilliam's awesome power to get inside a "man under too many influences's" mind and show the distorted and grotesque hallucinating visions of that mind from inside. Johnny Depp was amazing - he is one of the greatest and fearless actors of our time. Depp and Gilliam's craft are the main reasons to see this film because there is not much else to see. Gilliam's films are usually very interesting because there is always a story behind the delirious shell. Often, it is an absurd story but it is always a strong one. The problem of Fear and Loathing... is - there is no story at all. For the first thirty minutes or so I was truly charmed: it was funny, crazy, and visually nothing like I've seen before but for how long can I be fascinated by the monsters that were generated by the constantly and shockingly abused brain?</fullReview>

At the end, we get only a few worthless voice overs about how Leary failed to acknowledge the real pressures and factors that would stand in the way of dropping out - not that the movie has been any help in illustrating this theme.

The narrative is hopelessly tangled, and every scene seems to be an attempt to outdo the previous one in over the top visuals and manic behaviour. Even the CGI seems predictable (though I admit it is well used). Benicio del Toro is almost entirely unintelligible, and you'll miss most of the other performances if you blink. Only Depp's performance was plausible enough to be enjoyable. But after two hours of sniffing, swearing, falling over, staring crazily into space, gibbering, spitting and passing out (and that was just the audience - joke), I'd had enough. I'm going back to the book; at least that's worth spending money on.3 out of 10, for Depp and for some of the CGI.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"He who makes a beast of himself," reads the opening line of Hunter S. Thompson's offbeat cult novel "gets rid of the pain of being a man." Words spoken from experience, perhaps, but what to make of this? Well- judged ideology? Homespun philosophy? Complete and utter boll**ks? Call it what you want. All that matters, here, is that it's a relevant and telling preamble to the outrageous and loyal film adaptation of one of modern literature's most controversial texts.Despite plans to translate Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas from print to screen some 40 years back (with the likes of Scorsese, Akroyd and Belushi supposedly keen to chip in), it wasn't until the unsung success of Bruce Robinson's Withnail and I (1987) that anything had come close to capturing the spirit, motifs and sheer mayhem of Thompson's semi-true tale: two blokes, a fcuk load of drink, drugs, a twisted journey and a bittersweet sense of cynicism as the swinging sixties dispersed into nothing more than memory.While Withnail and I didn't fare too well at the box-office, it grew an avid cult following and in the early 1990's, Hollywood producer Stephen Nemeth revived plans to bring Fear and Loathing to the big-screen.Directed, fittingly, by ex-Python Terry Gilliam, Fear and Loathing is a vicious, semi-surreal assault on not only everything in correspondence to tee-total nobility and the American way, but on all things currently bathing in the mainstream of contemporary cinema. Canted camera angles, out of sync dialogue, dreamlike imagery, senseless plot development, fast-cutting and slow-moing to the max'- the film, like the novel, is outrageously droll and wildly entertaining in its take on jangled reality and western capitalism.The acidic verve and eccentricity kicking in from the off: a monochrome montage of anti-Vietnam war protests followed by an abrupt wipe cut of a red convertible hurtling along a desert highway to the sound of Big Brother and the Holding Company's Combination of the Two. It's 1971 and Hunter S. Thompson aka Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) is driving to Las Vegas with his attorney, the Samoan (Benicio Del Toro), in a warped pursuit of the proverbial American Dream. Decked out in Acapulco shirts and Aviators while twisted on a variety of drugs with an arsenal of uppers, downers and every which wayers locked and loaded in the trunk, the two doctors of journalism dive head-first into the depths of a mind-blending drug binge. Sin city, though, is no place for psychedelic drugs and what started out as a business trip put up by headquarters, descends into in a perilous frenzy and delegation to shed light on the dark side of the acid culture and the crumbling American dream. Fear and Loathing is a jittery, unpredictable film that shifts between sublimely executed set-plays and bizarre imagery. Like Thompson's original tale, the film portrays the seventies as the failure of the sixties and achieves a balance between the two main adjectives all directors and authors care about: "unique" and "brilliant". Here, Gilliam has a freehold on both of them. As does the ever-impressing chameleon of modern performing - Johnny Depp - who vanishes into a character of great absurdity ("look, there's two women fcuking a polar bear") yet great insight ("you have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.") Depp, who spent considerable time with Thompson in preparation for the role, succeeds in bringing the raw charisma, peculiarities and estranged physical and vocal gestures of the renegade writer to life.Del Toro's performance as the odd Samoan counteracts that of Depp's well. The chemistry between the two makes for some compulsive, Withnail and I-esque viewing. Where Thompson gets lyrical in his trips, the Samoan gets paranoid and violent. On top of threatening a photographer with a razor-sharp hunting knife, the foreign attorney proceeds to terrorize random pedestrians, threatening castration on numerous occasions and demanding Duke electrocute him in the tub to the sound of his favourite tune. A request that goes side-splittingly wrong.Like Duke's concerns early-on regarding his and the Samoan's handling of the drug binge, the film struggles to "maintain" in the final third. It borders what could be defined as laziness; Duke gets another writing assignment, another car, another hotel room, another batch of pills and booze. The second half of the tale runs almost parallel to the first which could be viewed as a manifestation of the zany, drug-fuelled antics or, perhaps, as a figurative reload that's reminiscent of peoples' views at the time regarding current affairs; externally, things may change (as in the reshuffling of Nixon's cabinet), but on the inside, things remained the same (the Vietnam war raged on).In its entirety, though, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas shouldn't be written-off as a mindless drug-culture fable-cum-road movie. Much like the book itself, Terry Gilliam's adaptation is an atypical creation that won't, by any means, appeal to all. Or many. But it is a cult classic in it's own right; a riotously funny film on the surface and a deadly serious one at heart. Perhaps too weird to love but far too rare to hate. "Buy the ticket; take the ride."</fullReview>

I was also a fan of Johnny Depp (although not as much as my mother), and I would even grudgingly admit that Terry Gilliam has redeemed himself on the odd occasion with a flicker of genius.You can imagine, then, that I was looking forward to seeing the words made flesh, or at least celluloid (whatever that is...). And then Fear and.... splattered across the screens and I began my slow descent into utter boredom. Where the book was a non stop, rollercoaster ride (oh, cliche) the movie seemed to creak from one indistinguishable piece of dialogue to the next, flinging in some cool special effects to wake me up. The weird thing being, of course, it was exactly like the novel. And yet it was truly dreadful. How can this be? Depp simply was Thompson, the locations were perfect, the car was just right...so perhaps it was Gilliam, trying to toe the line between comedy, social commentary, trying to maintain the integrity of the work...but it fails completely.He has ruined my favourite book. I'll have to try watching it y'know...under the influence. Uh huh huh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't get it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Browsing through the reviews &amp; message board for this movie, you'll see that most of the audience falls into one of the following categories:A) Stoner wastoid drug user who thinks this is the coolest get-high movie ever.B) Nancy Reagan "just-say-no" type who thinks it's nothing but a glorification of drugs.BOTH of these people are dead wrong. This movie, for anyone paying attention, packs an anti-drug commentary which shows the losers who get high. It shows you the vulgar, disturbing, violent and vomitous things they do. And if I were a drug user, this would be enough to make me quit for fear of looking like such a wretch.In that respect, I thought this was a clever &amp; ironic adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's psychedelic ramblings. But I'm giving it only a 4/10 because obviously it missed the mark.Much like Norm Jewison's ROLLERBALL (1975) which was supposed to be an anti-violence statement but ended up glorifying violence (to all the dimwits who couldn't see the satire), this movie failed miserably. You may argue that it is the fault of the dimwits for not understanding the point, but no, I believe the fault lies in the lap of the artist for failing to convey the message confidently enough. It's as if someone decides to do a parody of Hitler but ends up glorifying him in the eyes of the crowd.So if you're in category A, light up, shoot up, pop some tabs and enjoy the flick. You certainly will. But if you're on a deeper level than that, I think you'll be disgusted at Terry Gilliam's colossal balk. I think he lacked the confidence to hammer home the true point of the movie. In his defence, I admit that there is one scene (in the diner) which, in a very sobering way, shows you how wretched these drug-addicts are. But aside from that, it's mostly a silly romp through the world of psychomorphia. Sort of like Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle, except with Johnny Depp. Let's face it, Terry Gilliam hasn't done a good satire since BRAZIL.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dehumanized chaos with little redeeming value</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What was I thinking?" might be the best way to sum up a recent viewing of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." "What was I thinking?" in considering this film has a shred of redeeming value or any social comment on the era it's (apparently) satirizing? "What was I thinking?" years ago when I watched this film with a goofy grin and enjoyed the trippy ride it offered (and I wasn't even on drugs!)? "What was I thinking?" when I thought Hunter S. Thompson had a shred of talent, a unique voice, and something to say about the crumbling of the American Dream? "What was I thinking?" finding entertainment in two well-financed, articulate slobs (yup, the high social standing of Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo lend them to consideration as important cultural icons...sure) on a drug binge that lasts damn near TWO monotonous hours? To avoid the repetition of my own aghast reaction to this rubbish, I'll add the following observations: in films like "Brazil," "The Fisher King," and "12 Monkeys," director Terry Gilliam's signature style--busy and chaotic--is anchored by characters who are slightly off-center, but possess a distinct humanity; in "Fear and Loathing," all are dehumanized to the point of caricature. Both Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro (as Duke and Gonzo, respectively) create distinctive characters that are so 'out there' it makes them impossible to relate to, and the sight of them acting incoherent grows old quickly; everyone fades too easily into the acid-trip imagery saturating the film. My rating of "2" is only out of sympathy to Gilliam's maddening plight in making this outdated nonsense seem relevant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, let me start by saying that I was rather unfamiliar with HST, I haven't read the book, and I've been only mildly amused by Gilliam's previous work. Oh, yes. I also want a movie to have a plot.Now that I've given the premise for this brief comment, I can reveal that FLLV completely boooored me. The camera technique, the bizarre sound and the quirky characters caught my attention for, say, five minutes. After that, it was all about getting at least SOME value for the money spent.But no. We were three guys watching FLLV. One fell asleep within 30 minutes, and my other friend and I just sat there quiet, trying to keep our eyes open. It wasn't worth it. There's nothing evolving in FLLV, and I can't praise it for artistic value either. It's just stupid and a waste of time. Still, some people seem to enjoy it, so if you're desperate for something different, try it out. Just don't expect anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boredom and Indifference in Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I haven't read Hunter S. Thompson's book, I can't judge Gonzo journalism or his writings, but I will point out my problems with this movie.For me, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" was nothing but 2 hours with two unlikable AND uninteresting characters doing all kinds of drugs. The occasional good moments and the reason why I don't give it an even lower rating happen thanks to the narration and an inspired, brief black-and-white footage from the 60's, the great soundtrack, plus Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's performances (even though I could never relate to their characters, they fitted them perfectly). I can be fascinated by an unlikable character that I can't personally relate to when it's well written into a gripping character-study (as, say, Isabelle Huppert's complex Erica Kohut in "The Piano Teacher"), but that won't happen if they are also completely uninteresting and lack any sort of substance. People who consider the so-called "druggie lifestyle" a shock to the system and a form of artistic expression will most likely enjoy this (and there are lots of them, hence the major cult surrounding this movie), but I was bored or indifferent most of the time. Films like Dennis Hopper's "Easy Rider" (which didn't age very well in my opinion, but still keeps a rugged charm of 60's anarchy) and Danny Boyle's "Trainspotting" portrayed those "trips" and a whole generation without ever being dull. That said, I can see why some people love this movie... but if you have to dig such an empty "lifestyle" (hedonism? I don't think doing drugs all day long should be called that, sounds more like apathy to me) to appreciate it, then this is definitely not my cup of tea. 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me this movie is quite unique in a special way. I bought it about a year ago as it seemed "interesting" and I had wanted to see it for some time. Twice have I tried to watch it without being able to finish it...and I hardly ever do this no matter how bad a movie gets. And this is the peculiar part because Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not the worst movie I've "seen". My experience has been this (twice): I start watching it and it's hilarious for about half an hour. Then it flattens out. It doesn't change after this half hour, it just gets old really fast and I get the feeling that it's not moving forward. After about an hour it's like "enough already - get on with it!" and "OK OK - I know now that you have a lot of different drugs with different effects, will anything actually happen soon?". The acting is good, and Depp is...well he's different than how you usually see him, and yet the same - he always gets a part in those mystical movies. I'm actually close to being a Depp fan, but I'm sorry to say that I still haven't been able to keep this movie rolling to the end, or at least I can't remember an end to it. My advice is to see for yourself. The movie is unique to say the least. Helge</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I'd like to set up my critique of the film. I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, it had be recommended to me by a friend once with him simply stating "its hilarious". So I wasn't quite sure what kind of hilarious experience I was in for. Usually when I see movies, I read up at least a little on the making of it, or someone involved. I knew that Depp and Del Toro were in, and I knew that Terry Gilliam directed it (I had seen Holy Grail and 12 Monkeys before this, so I really really didn't know what to expect at this point, those were two very different films). I also had never heard of the author of the book or any of the hype or popularity surrounding the movie when it was released (if any).OK so thats what I went into the movie with, coming out of it I was...well...dazed. I really did not know what to think about it, it definitely wasn't the drop dead, laugh out loud, funny experience I was expecting it to be, although I did laugh at a lot of the stuff in the film, it was a different kind of humor than I had ever witnessed on film. I definitely dug the psychedelic style of the picture, the drugged out effects were definitely cool, creepy, and funny to witness (I have never done drugs, so this was new to me). The acting by both leads was simply amazing, you can tell they really got into their roles and were having a blast playing these drugged out losers. The dialog was a little hard to follow so I turned on the subtitles to help me out. The cameo appearances were fun to see. All in all, I have to say that I don't know what to think about this movie, I enjoyed it quite a bit and I think with repeated viewings I might enjoy it that much more.</fullReview>

Well I've taken the ride more than a few times and it is true u either hate it or love it :) It still fascinates me how this film was created, it's just a piece of art for me due to the way its been filmed and how it gives a pretty accurate view of how it feels to be under the influence of psychedelics. This movie is one of the few that i can watch over and over and still notice that I've missed some details i haven't seen the other times i viewed it. Also this film was dedicated to the late hunter s. Thompson who invented a new type of journalism, its called gonzo journalism. This movie is based on true events and it has made me curious about alternate lifestyles and especially the style of the 60's hippie. I found this one so special that i actually bought the book and i can say they are both equally as good, people that love movies that aren't as predictable as the common blockbuster this really is a must have seen film. I hope u will enjoy it as much as i did cause it really is one of a kind, Johnny Depp has done a wonderful acting job as well as his fellow actors ;) peace and love fellow earthlings</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bizarre and cerebral psychedelic acid trip with little cohesion or narrative heft</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam takes on the daunting task of adapting Hunter S. Thompson's psychedelic novel into an on screen feature, a task few directors including Martin Scorcese and Oliver a Stone attempted, but failed to make it pass the green lighting stage. The results aren't necessarily unsatisfactory, but show that some literacy works don't translate on screen efficiently, even with the most talented filmmakers working behind the camera. This black comedy starring Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro drags viewers through a loopy, psychedelic odyssey of a morally depraved duo who finds themselves intoxicated in what feels like more like a two-hour celebration of nearly drug in the book than a film with a cohesive story to follow. And with Terry Gilliam's inventive, but intoxicating visual methodology, it places it's characters through a loopy journey that is destined to leave audience either laughing hysterically or horribly disturbed by the vile nature of excessive drug escapades that pervades most of the film. The movie follows two stoners: the idiotic journalist Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp) and psychopathic lawyer Dr. Gonzo (played by Benicio De Toro) as they cruise in their red convertible through the deserts of Nevada and into the shiny streets of Las Vegas where he pursue their way to the American Dream, only to find themselves warped in a series of chaotic circumstances contributed by their compulsive drug addiction.If this film feels like a cerebral acid trip to you upon watching it, don't worry! You are not alone. With the characters letting wild on just about every drug in the book including pot, acid, heroin, cocaine, LCD, and what not; there is very little you can expect other than the feeling being sozzled out after taking a mind-altering substance. Terry Gilliam accomplishes this through a unique, but mind-bending technique involving visual distortion in intent of providing viewers with a feel of the condition Roaul and Gonzo are experiencing when drowning out in their excessive drug feud. During the scenes when the characters are experiencing withdrawals from hallucinagens, viewers watch as the camera bobbles at low angles back and worth, and the lighting obtains a reddish tint place an odd and uncomfortable feeling of intoxication. This technique is highly creative and shows the beauty of Terry Gilliam's immersive visual heft. Although the nightmarish imagery of Raoul's hallucinations such as the hotel clerk's head morphing into a monstrous alien creature is rather cheesy and unrealistic, it certainly paints a reasonable picture of the character's mental perspective. These scenes occasionally offer some good , but tend to be executed in an unsettling manner that towers surrealism over humor. By the end, the only humor we can manage to swallow out of these characters in some occasional solid one-liners but nothing memorable.While Terry Gilliam may have the visual style to compel the wild Las Vegas adventure, the film falls quite flat in the narrative department, offering an unwholesome mess of a plot with characters that are not only incredible foolish and vile in nearly every sense, but offer almost no backstory other than Raoul being a long-time journalist and Gonzo being an absent-minded lawyer, though it doesn't entirely defeat the likability of the characters. Their strange philosophy on the American Dream does provide at least some decent humor, but nothing clever. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are both funny every once in awhile, even in scenes when they're indulging in hardcore drug hysteria, and their performances are not bad to say the least. Raoul is arguably the most unusual and light- hearted role Depp has endure in his career, compared to his more clever outings. The same can probably be said for Toro as he is rarely accustomed to oddball, comedic roles. Though there performances don't link into the Oscar calibur, they do little to make up for the clobbered mess the plot delivers. The plot transcends through such choppy pacing it borders on the line of being incomprehensible. Although it seems Gilliam is trying to match the pacing with the psychedelic condition of the lead characters, the overall effect doesn't work in the way it should. Even though Gilliam supplements some liberties from Hunter S. Thompson's novel, it's clearly evident he's struggling to enhance the life and soul of Thompson's narration into from novel to the screen. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is probably not the most comfortable vehicle to sit through, nor does it demonstrate the best of Terry Gilliam's directorial talent, it still benefits from a humorous standpoint and provides a compelling cerebral that some will come to enjoy, while others will likely experience a sense of disgust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a love/hate movie, such as the matrix and various others that the mainstream might have a hard time to wrap they're mind around. Either you get it or you don't. To enjoy this to the fullest, you probably have to: 1) Have an idea who Hunter S Thompson was (which the character is based on) 2) Be more than 30 years old, and at least have some concept of how "old" USA or Europe was like, like it used to be in the 1990s, 80s, 70s and 60s. In cocaine cowboys they tell how they in the early 80s could walk into an airport with a suitcase full of cash and buy an airplane (try that today). If what goes on here played out in 2016, these character would be in jail max 10 minutes into the movie.3) Have some knowledge of drugs and they're effects or be familiar with shady characters that has been heavily into this so you know whats going on. This movie would be a good one to watch for a young police officer.I rank it as one of the best I've seen, along with blow, requiem for a dream, wolf of wall street and other absolutely top notch movies, it belongs to the elite division and the best that has come out of Hollywood, along with series like "breaking bad", which all are either based on actual stories or portray things and settings in a very realistic way to what actually is going on out there in the underworld, though spiced up a little extra with more action and humor added to it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although widely considered a cult classic, this movie is almost unwatchable for the average viewer. The depiction of the LSD experience and general visual approach of Terry Gilliam is interesting as always, but that's hardly enough to support an entire movie. Even the slightest sign of a plot would have helped enormously, but the film is just a stitching of scenes comprising of... pretty much nothing at all. The movie's subsequent cult success is probably due to the fact that people with drug experiences can identify with certain events of the movie, but definitely, experiencing an acid trip yourself must be much more enjoyable than living it through the eyes of a bald Johnny Depp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas is a film you either love, loathe or are simply terrified by and confused as to which category to put it under. I happen to love it. It takes Hunter S. Thompson's seminal treatise on Gonzo journalism, a technique which involves getting about as messed up as humanly possible on every kind of drug and alcohol known to man and trying to do serious academic stuff (sounds like my college days). It's off putting for some, tantalizing for others, but no can deny that it's an absolutely one of a kind film experience. At the centre are two tyrannical performances from Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, as springy Raoul Duke and his crass, animalistic sidekick Dr. Gonzo. The two intrepid fools set out for Vegas to report on a famous motorbike derby race, bringing along with them bushels of drugs, including coke, weed, shrooms, raw either and a synthesized version of pure human adrenaline that makes an appearance in one terrifying extended sequence. All the film has to say is basically "let's get as messed up as possible and go do stuff". Pretty fitting for New Year's Eve. They are dimly aware of their surroundings as their nutty adventure plays out, but the film stays rooted to their corrupted consciousnesses, giving us the task of deciphering what's going on along with them, which is quite fun. There's a barbaric horse of celebrity cameos from Christina Ricci, Cameron Diaz, Ellen Barkin, Mark Harmon, Tim Thomerson, Craig Bierko, Tobey Maguire, Michael Jeter and Gary Busey as the world's creepiest highway patrolman. It's a walk on the wild side as only Gilliam and Thompson could bring us, Depp and Del Toror milking every inebriated minute of chaos and Calamity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange surreal trip into the mind of Hunter S Thompson.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunter S Thompson's 1971 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a pretty surreal experience anyways. With graphic descriptions of Thompson's hallucinations that show the brutish nature of Las Vegas, Nevada. However Terry Gilliam managed to bring Thompson's hallucinations to life with this movie. If you aren't familiar with the story I'll quickly sum it up. Journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) are sent on a writing assignment by Duke's magazine, to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. But while there with a colorful assortment of drugs, they decide to make it the ultimate business trip to search for the American dream. But they find brutal people that take the American dream and run it out of gas to search around for any money they can find. The acting from both Depp and Del Toro is good, and like in the book we feel as though we are on a trip with these guys. Also the strange images that Duke sees look frighteningly real. I really have to give Gilliam credit for bringing this nightmare to life. That said, it's certainly not a movie for everyone. If you didn't like something like the book, or a movie like Eraserhead, then the chances are you won't like this very much. And if that's you, that's completely understandable. But if you're into the strange and the deranged, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is some nice eye candy.</fullReview>

There is one part where he is the bar and he is tripping so the whole room is moving and he thinks the people are monsters. The whole movie is basically like this with them constantly taking drugs getting high and tripping and stuff. I don't know what else to say about this movie. It's not really a great movie and unless you like watching movies where the characters are constantly tripping taking drugs and acting very weird (oh and also cursing a heck of a lot) then I recommended that you don't watch this movie.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp does a great and carefully prepared role as a strange journalist who spends time on mostly anything but what he came to Vegas for. Using drugs and fooling around. First I thought he was overacting, then I understood that this is how it's supposed to go. Benicio del Toro also delivers a good performance of the main character Duke's lawyer and friend Dr. Gonzo who is at least as crazy and messed up throughout the whole flick as Duke. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas barely had a plot but with this idea, I wouldn't even expect it. It was really fun anyways, though with a dark twist. Drugs are bad, m'kay? But seriously, the main characters stupidest moments made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I still laughed... My friend showed me some kind of depicting of the day in the novel's writer Hunter S. Thompson's life, where he mostly uses drugs and smokes cigarettes all day before starting to write in the middle of the night. I don't know how much of it was true but after watching this movie, I sure can understand that there lies somewhat the truth.Seven out of ten, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas doesn't shine all the time but does entertain and makes you wonder what the hell is going on.

		<shortDescription>Well done and very trippy movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the story about journalist Raoul Duke and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo. Duke is on an assignment to report on a big motorcycle race held outside of Las Vegas. The two decide to make the trip a drug fueled journey to search for the American Dream.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the adaptation of the novel of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson. Thompson, if you aren't familiar, was the Rolling Stone journalist responsible for inventing "Gonzo Journalism" which focuses on the experience of an event rather than event itself as in the case of traditional journalism. The product of Gonzo journalism is something of a stream of consciousness: half fact, half fiction.This is a really rather grotesque movie and, quite honestly, I didn't really like it. At the same time, it was quite a good movie. That sounds contradictory. If it was a pretty good movie, why wouldn't I like it? Well, the guys in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are taking an obscene amount of drugs. It's a trip that might very well kill them. It isn't a happy experience and the movie illustrates that well particularly through the cinematography.The acting in this film is really good. I was initially turned off because I saw Johnny Depp acting like Captain Jack Sparrow or the Mad Hatter or Tonto and I for one am sick of drunken Keith Richards. But this is the first movie that he ever acted this way. With that in mind, I'll let it pass. And after watching some interviews with Hunter S. Thompson, I found Depp's impression spot on. Benecio Del Toro's performance as Dr. Gonzo is stellar. The pair jump between the effects of the drugs seamlessly as naturally as if one drug wears off to be replaced by another.Throughout Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas we never really know what is true and what is a drug induced hallucination. You can say this type of thing about lot's of movies but here it transcends the movie itself. When I said that Thompson's work is half fact and half fiction, I really meant that we can't really take very much of it as "fact". I always thought Fear and Loathing was about Hunter S. Thompson and his friend going to Vegas but, really, it is about the invented character, Duke, going to Vegas. I wasn't particularly familiar with Hunter S. Thompson so I watched a 1970's or '80's BBC documentary about him. The documentary maker, like so many of Thompson's fans, confused Thompson with Duke. The filmmaker even took Thompson the Vegas hoping to see the cult hero in action. Thompson then spoke about this tendency. When he is invited to speak at a university, are they hoping to hear Raoul Duke or Hunter S. Thompson? I originally thought that the premise, a motorcycle race, was the "fact". I made the mistake of reading fiction as "non- motorcycle race" instead of "everything." The identity of Raoul Duke, the film's narrator, adds another layer of fiction to the film; even though Depp looks and sounds like Thompson, he is Raoul Duke.To add another layer of uncertainty, consider the marketing campaign for this film. According to an interview I heard, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas focused heavily on TV spots and the majority of them featured Cameron Diaz even though she's in the movie for about a minute. It feels like the truth of this movie is muddled into fiction on every level; from the story to the marketing, nothing is reliable.Would I recommend Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas? You might want to pass, for the time being, if you are looking for something light and fun, but other sure; it is a weird and disconcerting movie but enthralling.</fullReview>

It has a sense of controversy disliking the whole world but for me driving a " script " that makes it interesting. For Finally, just to mention about Depp and Del Toro . I stayed amazed with his work. States of euphoria , laughter , complications, problems , love ( friendship ) , hatred , madness ... All this occurred in the film without realizing that they themselves know . Difficult or incomplete latter reference I ? Well imagine act , This impeccably simulate the effect of different types of narcotics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting to a point but fairly inconsequential in the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's adaptation of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is not a film to be approached lightly. This is not for casual fans of Johnny Depp who simply liked him in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. This is a defiantly unconventional film about a defiantly unconventional man.Johnny Depp stars as Thompson's alter-ego Raoul Duke, a journalist who accepts an assignment to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race in Las Vegas. This forms what little of a plot there is to be found in the film. Instead, the story mainly focuses on the drug-fueled exploits of Duke and his partner in crime, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio del Toro).Both Depp &amp; del Toro give committed performances and it's probably safe to say that Depp's work in particular is the highlight of the film. Gilliam's unique visual sense is also consistently in evidence. However, over a fairly repetitive and anarchic 118 minutes, the movie's charms wear pretty thin.While there is a rudimentary point to the story (ie. the failure of the 60's counterculture movement) it is likely better expressed in Thompson's book than it is here. Still, Gilliam's film does contain some (admittedly disjointed) memorable scenes, good performances and well-chosen period music. Mercifully cut, with something at least resembling a plot, this might have been deserving of the cult status that it has attained over the years. As it is, for those who consider the book essentially unfilmable, this is unlikely to convince them otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, I'm not a fan of the drug culture and I'm not a fan of Johnny Depp either, so I predisposed to hate this movie. Guess what? I did. Despite the presence of former Python Terry Gilliam, who's directed some films I love like BRAZIL, FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS is a real mess of a movie. It's a plot less comedy that sees Depp and his companion Benicio del Toro travelling around the Nevada desert in their car which is filled to the brim with drugs and alcohol. Eventually they make the trip to Las Vegas, where things really kick off.The entire running time consists of Depp hallucinating and generally acting spaced out as ordinary, everyday situations become hectic fights for survival. There are rooms full of lizards and an overwhelming number of cameos from the likes of Gary Busey, Tim Thomerson, and Harry Dean Stanton, all of them playing generally offbeat, unusual, or just plain odd characters. Tobey Maguire looks weird as a sweaty hitchhiker. Depp tries hard, but this is merely another spin on his usual Jack Sparrow shtick which grew old for me many years ago. I hated him in it and I hated the film too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have never heard of Hunter S. Thompson- the author of the novel on which this film is based- then you are undoubtedly going to be shocked and confused, and perhaps a little repulsed. The film is essentially the crazed alcohol and mescaline- induced ramblings and travels of two so-called drug fiends, during a trip to Las Vegas. This movie may be described as incoherent, outrageous, and weird to a previously undiscovered degree. I mean, it is weird.If you are the type of person who likes a strong plot-line, or well-developed characters, or any pretence of normalcy at all in a movie, then by all means watch this movie to expand your narrow perspective. If you are the type of person who prefers chaos, or weirdness, or being shocked, or maybe a good strong hit of any type of drug, then by all means watch this film because it is right up your alley. My recommendations to you, the review-reader, is to not make any important life- decisions in the first few days after viewing this film.IN SHORT: perfectly envelopes the style and feeling of the Hunter S. Thompson novel, it's fun, it's funny, it's weird, Johnny Depp is amazing, if you haven't seen it yet you must watch it now!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998): Dir: Terry Gilliam / Cast: Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro, Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz: Based on the Hunter S. Thompson novel about paranoia and destination as Raoul Duke attempts to leave a hotel and believes that all eyes are upon him due to narcotics in his brief case. He sees bats descend from above and hotel guests become raving drunken reptiles. He is joined by his attorney and awakens to a flooded room with sudden memories vaguely placed. Basically a series of encounters while under the influence of drugs but Terry Gilliam visualizes their bizarre intoxication that highlights many of his films including Brazil and 12 Monkeys. Johnny Depp is amusing as Duke with muffled speech and cigarette clenched between his teeth. Benicio Del Toro plays his aggressive lawyer whose business tactics include LSD. Christina Ricci plays a Barbara Streisand obsessed teenager who Del Toro picks up and whom they must rid of. Tobey Maguire plays a nervous hitchhiker who abandons ship in the dessert when intoxication is at its highest. Both Maguire and Ricci surface later in a reference to their failed existence. Cameron Diaz makes an appearance in an elevator as a journalist. Illustrated world of an addict until you wake up with a blood crusted blade and attempt to put the pieces together.

		<shortDescription>Spiritual drug-haze madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A journalist and his lawyer drive into Las Vegas. With them they have an idea for a story, trunk full of narcotics, a yearning for release and a fear of bats. Along the way hallucinations are had, drugs ingested, snorted, shot and dripped, women are met, dinosaur tails are worn, sand drunk and something gets written. And I never thought I would type a sentence like that in my life. It's that kind of movie. And it is amazing.Johnny Depp is known for his involved preparations for his roles. And this just might be the crowning achievement of that. Not only did he shave the top of his head to achieve the desired haircut, and wore clothes owned by Thompson but he actually hunted down the man himself - pun intended - and befriended him to get his mannerisms down. He actually lived with the man to truly absorb his essence. And boy did he succeed. Hunter S. Thompson is transferred to the silver screen beautifully in all his gonzo glory. Raving mad, yet strangely lucid and charismatic when the mood happens upon him. The script practically writes itself, which happens oddly often with Depp, now that I think about it.And yes, the story itself makes little to no sense. It's practically the acknowledged best way to experience drugs without actually taking any. Though being drunk while watching the film certainly helps, not gonna lie. But that's the whole point. It's an experience, a philosophical-spiritual-maddening journey into a man's psyche and an exploration of the underbelly of the American Dream.Do yourself a favour, watch the first ten minutes. If you're going to like the film, you won't even notice the time has passed. And if not, at least you can say you tried.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird but fairly unique and enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This seems to be a bit of a confused and wandering movie, not knowing where it's going or what its point is. But I guess that accurately reflects the experience of its characters. However, that's never really a good thing in art, the situation where you have no idea what the work is even aiming for. There needs to be a strong vision or style or tone. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas certainly has a unique feel to it, plenty of style over substance and it's quite enjoyable even if it feels a bit pointless.It reminded me a lot of The Big Lebowski which is also about a couple of friends ending up in messed up situations just sort of breezing along. The main character has an inner monologue, constantly musing about America and drugs and politics. He is halfway between thinking he's smart and knowing he's dumb, there must be some truth to what he is thinking even if he's incredibly ignorant.I think this movie mainly works on a very casual viewing level, there is nothing much to be found on any deeper level. It's pretty off- beat and you never know where it's going, although it doesn't really go anywhere - no build-up of suspense or plot or emotions. The acting is fine. I didn't recognise Benicio Del Toro for quite a while, he's pretty overweight in this movie. Some of the lines and ideas are pretty funny in an awkward or absurd way. Most of the movie is paranoid and little uncomfortable to watch - it's hard to see so much mess and irresponsibility and not feel frustrated.Terry Gilliam created lots of interesting ambiguity of genre and tone with 12 Monkeys. It had many elements of comedy, drama, thriller, sci-fi and yet never seemed to clearly fit into any one. This movie is a bit similar in that it's kind of funny but otherwise doesn't follow any formula, which is refreshing. But still, it's a meaningless, random trip that makes no statements. It is nice to sort of experience some drug effects without all the risk and destruction of actually doing it though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there ever was an entire film that served as a PSA for the dangers of hallucinogens, this is it. But, if there ever was a film that made apparent of the confusing, dangerous and heavily sedated time of the 1960's, this is also it. Fear and Loathing is an avant-garde gem. One of the most overlooked comedies of all-time. Based on the book by Hunter S. Thompson, you will be completely taken within the first few seconds of the film. It's beautifully demented. It's a hell of an experience.. don't go into this looking for any sort of cohesive narrative. Johnny Depp plays the most accurate depiction of Thompson ever put to film. Depp and Del Toro, together, give an incredible turn as method actors here. They effectively capture the ugliest side of drug addictions. They are completely off the rails. Out of bounds. Watching them lose their minds is fascinating. This is unlike anything else out there. I urge you to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's 1971. Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his 'attorney' Dr. Gonzo (Benicio del Toro) are on a drug-fueled road trip in the American west. They pick up a hitchhiker (Tobey Maguire) but he runs away screaming. They're on their way to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race in Las Vegas. They are joined by photographer Lacerda (Craig Bierko). Later, they attend a District Attorney's convention on narcotics.The surreal imagery is both ugly and tiring. I hoped the reptile vision is the start of some good visual attempts. I don't think Terry Gilliam is wild enough in this movie. Also the scenes are too long which stretches out the hazy feel of the movie. It feels repetitive. Johnny Depp is exploding with craziness but the early fascination fades. I'm not sure if Gilliam achieved anything other than tedium. It's not until the end that Gilliam comes up with something compelling. Gonzo pulling the knife on the waitress is the only truly compelling scene leading an interesting idea to conclude on. If only the rest of the movie had something to say too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is one of those films that completely divides audiences. If you check out most of the reviews, they either describe it as a 'masterpiece' or 'absolute rubbish.' I can see both points of view, as both as technically correct, depending on what area of the film you focus on.There's a lot right with this filmic interpretation of Hunter S Thompson's novel of the same name. And there's also a lot wrong with it. But, staying with the positive, it's worth noting that the film's directed by one of the most visually stunning directors ever (Terry Gilliam) and if anyone can get a great performance out of a cast, it's him. And he does just that. There are a host of famous faces who pop up here and there as we join to drug-taking journalists on their road-trip through Las Vegas. However, despite all playing their parts perfectly, they're all eclipsed by (Hunter S Thompson's real life friend) Johnny Depp, who is almost unrecognisable (courtesy of a bald head) and steals every scene as the out-of-his-head loopy journalist.Therefore the film is stylish and well-acted - almost enough to make it a classic in its own right. And some people will only see this and love it. However, those who hate it normally point out that there isn't much in the way of a story. Perhaps this is down to having to complete junkies as central characters. Their exploits are never going to make much sense, let alone be particularly linier. What 'story' there is bounces from one mad scene to the next, therefore making it a pretty lame story.So, if you're happy to overlook what it lacks in the story department and simply enjoy the wild and psychedelic ride that it is (and Depp's brilliant performance) then you will probably see this as a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So when I started watching this movie, for the fist half hour I checked my watch every five minutes out of boredom.As time passed and the plot progressed to more and more cruel and sick levels,the feeling that you have to read on the thin line of the true meaning behind the gruesome metaphor awakened. Where should I start from? Spotless acting from both Depp (that feels like he's made for these sick roles) and Del Toro (at the pick of his career while this was filmed,he gave his soul in this psychedelic maniac with a knife). The Acid culture takes a solid hit throughout the movie that strips naked the downfall of the sixties and the ruins that it left behind both in the hearts and souls of people that fell victim to it unwillingly or willingly. At the last monologue of Duke, I was left speechless for a awhile trying to understand the meaning of never understanding an essential fallacy that is fundamentally a desperate assumption.."that is the Acid Culture".Only blind spot: Casting Maguire as a Hitchhiker?What's up with the wannabe Spiderman on such a serious movie?

		<fullReview>Some people will look at this as pure garbage. It's because they don't know how to take this movie. Because it's a delusion, from someone who's been on an drug induced orgy, naming it's author, the late great Hunter S. Thompson, who's book, this film is based on. Here it's seen through two guys, in great performances, especially from a flabby Del Toro, a couple years short of his Oscar win. A writer journalist (Depp) really on an overhaul of drugs, fear struck, and his burnt out attorney, a crazed Del Toro, head to Monte Carlo to cover a race. It's hard to believe they're these people, when drugs give way. Del Toro truly makes the film funny, even in it's starting, where they pick up unfortunate hitchhiker (Tobey Macquire) who ends up scrambling out of the car, and running for his life. Del Toro picks up as struggling teen artist (Christina Ricci) later on, which I admit was funny but a little bit sick too. Too, really near the end, the madness of this delusional film was taking it's toll on me, as though the film was losing it's potency or these scenes were garbage, like scraping the bottom of the barrel, but as I said, you have to take the movie through the eyes of the characters. I'm really glad for one, that this very funny film had Del Toro in it, as it's hard to imagine this film without him. Johnny Depp just shows us again why he is such a great actor. And would you believe Terry Gilliam of all people made this. The film has a lot of good cameo's and it's end, closing credit sequence to the tune of Jumping Jack Flash, was cool, which Del Toro definitely isn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's crazed adaptation of Hunter S Thompson's classic, is a mess of a film - but this is one mess I love dearly. There's little structure, absolutely no discipline on behalf of Gilliam and the film viciously plows through the narrative one drug fueled binge after another. Rarely does the film ever calm down and it's so aggressively psychotic that it transcends any of its problems by becoming so unhinged, you'll just go along for the wild ride. Everyone here is so committed to this material - from the insane and wonderful performances from Depp and a big bellied Del Toro, to the bonkers direction by Gilliam and the warped cinematography by the blind in one eye Nicola Pecorini. Years after its disastrous box office run, critical drubbing and a Cannes premier that was booed off the screen, Fear and Loathing has not just collected a larger audience through the years, but has been shedding its toxic reputation. It's endlessly quotable, endlessly re-watchable and I dare say 'a masterpiece.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a very strange movie, but it's often wild, colorful, vulgar, and fun to watch. This means it must be a Terry Gilliam movie and if you think so, you are indeed correct. This is a psychedelic romp that didn't fare well with critics, but pretty much with everyone else. My only complaint is how this film is repetitive. The entire film is consisted of these two men taking drugs, then wreaking havoc, then returning to their hotel suite.Gilliam's film is about two men named Rauol Duke and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo who both travel to Las Vegas in search for the American Dream. But they use these psychedelic drugs to help them get through this trip and offer them a fun time.I love Johnny Depp's style of acting which is method acting and it makes him unrecognizable, like in this film. This is a unique role and he did it well. Benicio Del Toro likewise did a great job as Depp's partner in crime.Overall, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a unique, colorful movie essentially about what happens when you take these drugs. The set design is great and there are some cool visual effects. Terry Gilliam, who is an off-beat director, does a great job in constructing these two men's vision of the American Dream. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas for the first time ever last night... And I wasn't sure exactly how I would take this film. I typically dislike films of this nature but every once in a while I find an exception. There was a point in Fear and Loathing where I realized I loved it; and that was when Raoul Duke was loaded up on a suitcase full of drugs and he was nervously waiting in line to check into a hotel. His inner monologue was running a mile a minute and his face was covered in sweat. He needed to check in, but he obviously was not in the proper state of mind to talk to another human being. Patterns on the floor were coming alive and creeping up the wall. Everything had come down to this. He couldn't blow it. The hotel clerk could've called the police if she wanted to. And he was next in line. Gulp.It's simple yet nervous little moments like these that make Fear and Loathinga great subliminal experience. It's a non stop assault of the senses and contains some of the most realistic and hauntingly vivid hallucinogenic sequences I've ever seen. Anyone who lives an "experimental" lifestyle is sure to relate to some of the situations and scenes in this film very well. It's like a massive abstract portrait that comes as is. A pure form of artwork that divides and confuses. I think some people hate this film for the right reasons and praise it for the wrong ones. All criticisms for this film I believe are valid and I agree with almost all of them. It's fan base is one of the reasons a lot of people aren't too fond of it, and like any great movie, its misunderstood and highly overrated. But its hard to deny its craft and masterfully directed atmosphere. In addition to the psychedelic visuals and crazy off the wall hallucination scenes, it creates a skewed altered reality via its cockeyed oblique shots, wide angle lenses, organic, fluid camera movements and wild shot angles that range from hundreds of feet in the air, to the camera floating across the floor like a little boat. Terry Gilliam was fantastic behind the camera and his cinematography is perfectly blended with the art style to create a vision of 1970's Las Vegas that is alive as it is dead. Its dazzling and disgusting all at the same time. Duke and his lawyer Gonzo's escapades from casinos, hotels and deserts is a highly unique trip that I think everyone should experience once, no matter how they may like it.Where Fear and Loathing goes over most people's heads is how people interpret the drug use and what the Hell it all means. You wanna know what I think it all meant? Nothing. Nothing but pain and disgust. The drug use is creative and the film is setup almost like 3 distinct acid trips. Each with their own stages of the drug sinking in. You got the initial buzz, the ascent, the plateau, and the come down. With this the film moves from one nonsensical scene to the next and the duo becomes an almost tornado like force with no signs of slowing down. Its humorous and very visually satisfying but I think the point of the film here was to show the desensitization and reckless use of drugs in a negative light. Its almost a word of caution that a lifestyle like this could result in a meaningless void of existence with a perpetual soulless detachment. The film also has some light criticisms of American politics and the direction the country was headed. It was a good accentuating theme that really brought the film together as a mass of pop culture, drugs and dazzling lights. A film for the times that challenged everything about burgeoning youth, as told by people seasoned with experience.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a cult classic that is just as polarizing today as it was back then. It can be poked and prodded any way and can conform to anyone's opinions. Its like an ever evolving organism that will appear as something else to everybody. And what better form of art is there?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the start of the film we immediately know what kind of film this is going to be. A film that not everyone will enjoy. A film which will have reviews rating from very negative to very positive. Never in the middle. A film about 2 retards that can't control their drug problem. In this film we follow a journalist named Duke and his lawyer who we hear is called Dr Gonzo. They go to Las Vegas to write a report about this desert race, but everything is more difficult doing when you are under the influence of psychedelic drugs, riding trucks in a desert during a heavy sandstorm which ruins your beer being no exception. The rest of the film features drugs, passing out at casino's, drugs, room fights, drugs, buying orang-utangs, alcohol and more drugs. 'not a very sophisticated plot' you're thinking. Well, that is what the majority of the people thought watching the film at first. But that is, until you understand the story. The scenes in which you saw the Vietnam War and people protesting against it and the hippie festival were there for a reason; they showed a new type of ethics people had in this time. For people who didn't follow history class; it takes place in the 60's, when hedonism became an important word. Pleasure was increasing in importance and that is why people are protesting against the war and having festivals which last for days where pleasure is the one thing that matters. For a lot of people this idea held and still holds true. Hunter S. Thompson is not one of those people. He believes hedonism is weird sick and twisted. The exact words we could use to describe Duke and Gonzo. Especially Gonzo. His sickness is brought out very well in the scene where he brings this girl he met on the plane to the hotel room. In the plane he put some drugs in her drink and then took her with him. Pretty sick and desperate. Of course Thomson does not only want to show how sick Gonzo is, we already knew that, but he intends to put the viewer against hedonism. No sane person would still want to be as hedonistic as Gonzo after watching this scene. His portrayal of hedonists is of people that generally fail in society Another scene portraying this idea of Thompson is the one in which we see Duke and a random hippie licking some LSD from Duke's hand in the bathroom. Whilst they're doing this a casual man in a suit walks in, obviously someone who has a good job and a lot of us want to be like. Watching these two hedonists he immediately flees the bathroom. Duke does not feel ashamed though, he convinces himself that this man is jealous of him because he will never know the joy of being 'free' as hedonists see themselves. The best scene probably is the one where Gonzo lays half-dead in the bathtub, intoxicated with every drug known to man-kind after a wild night out. Next to him lays a broken radio, a broken mirror, there is foam everywhere in the bathroom and the room looks like the Vietnam War changed its setting. Obviously this is want Thompson is trying to tell us; enjoy life too much without thinking about the causes and this happens to you. The actors were chosen with care for this movie, and they succeeded well indeed. Johnny Depp is always wearing his dirty flower shirt and his hat on his bald head, and never goes anywhere without the cigarette holder in his mouth, making him hard to understand. The effect of this all is that Depp, who plays Duke clearly comes off as the mad freak he is. Del Toro playing Gonzo did his role great too, portraying the beer- bellied, lumpy loser he is. The use of light and color in this movie is important. It sets the mood and gives you a good impression of what is must feel like to be under influence of drugs. The light is focused on the most important character in that particular shot. This has the effect that you get into the movie quite easily, at least, it is what they're trying to do. There's also a lot of darkness. Rooms which are made darker than they are in real life. This is to express the fact that they are imprisoned by their own thoughts and feelings and they can't get out of the mood that drugs brings them in. The way the drug effects were portrayed in the film were really convincing to make the audience experience the situations as if they were involved themselves. This is most probably the main factor what made us like the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ONE LINE REVIEW:The movie is a good example of Johnny Depp's own defined genre ? bizarre, strange, full of mystery and might seem pointless at times but in the end it is all entertainment and about wild side of life &amp; more or less about those rare beings that do exist around us."Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is a twisted, outlandish venture into the mind of a warped junkie, a reporter who is traveling to Nevada in order to cover a Hells Angels motorcycle race, along with his Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro, who gained forty pounds for his role). "We were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold," is the line that opens the movie in an expeditious manner, as a red convertible roars from right to left, in the direction of the movie. The vehicle's trunk is packed with an abundance of deadly drugs. "We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers. Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, two dozen amyls." The narrator of the story is Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), a balding, stumbling shell of a man, constantly smoking or inhaling drugs, his body overloaded with deadly substances. He is in a permanent daze throughout the entire film, constantly consuming drugs every time the camera pans onto him. He is also the reporter, the main character of the film, and he is in such a daze that after the motorcycle race is over, he's not even sure who has won. The movie is based on the semi-autobiographical memoirs of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, who traveled to Las Vegas in 1971 with an overweight "Samoan lawyer" named Oscar Zeta Acosta. Many claim that "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" glamorizes drugs. If anything, it demonizes them (sometimes quite literally), and the constant drug use is merely present to account for the duo's wacky behavior. I personally feel "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is a harmless film. Under the wrong circumstances, it could be misunderstood, which is why it was nearly slapped with an X-rating by MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America). Depp is the reason the film's narration succeeds as well as it does -- a lesser actor might come across as annoying. Depp seems to be channeling the physical freedom of Steve Martin and the slurred speech patterns of Thompson himself -- although he was given ample time to pick up on Thompson's mannerisms, since they spent much time together prior to shooting and throughout the filming process.MY RATING- 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another case of the outsider looking in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm all for cinematic wackiness, especially when it's portrayed in a subversive style, which Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas certainly is, but there are times when it becomes overcompensating, overly loose, and without a clear method behind its overbearing madness. I'm at a loss when it comes to films based on Hunter S. Thompson's iconic works. I adore his writing style; after reading his novel Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs I felt I was transported to another world and was reading a newspaper story of an event covered by the event itself. Thompson wrote in a way that almost personified the story into feeling like you were given a firsthand account what was happening if the story wanted you to know itself. He labeled it as "gonzo journalism," and one of the rules of gonzo journalism was before you could write the story, I assume, you had to get stoned to the point of being almost incomprehensible.But even if our writer at hand was incomprehensible through much of his publications, he found a way to make it all work to the level of professionalism and earned a heavy cult following that admired his writings, articles, and several film adaptations such as the 1980's film, Where the Buffalo Roam (unseen by me) and the most recent, The Rum Diary. However, no matter how hard I try, I can not seem to connect on a solid level with any film made off the works of Thompson and this is consistently isolating me from the cultists I so dreadfully want to connect with. I can admire Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas way more than I can recommend or even like it. There's a lot it does on the level of uniqueness and rebellion, yet there's little it does to give us clear insight as to what this whole trip represents.Our heroes are journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his alleged attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), who we first see speeding through the deserts of Nevada in a bright red convertible under the influence of mescaline, cocaine, marijuana, and several other drugs kept in their large suitcase that's stashed away in the trunk. They are heading down to the Nevada city to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race, so Duke can beat the deadline for his article.One of the first scenes we are brought with is Duke in a mescaline-induced haze, swatting at a swarm of bats only visible to him. From there on out, it's complete and total madness. Duke and Gonzo blaze through the hallucinated backdrops of Las Vegas, under the influence of drugs a man of an unhealthy, unstoppable addiction probably wouldn't touch, lumbering from setup to setup, causing havoc, threatening violence, or simply envisioning things that are not there.The rest of the film I'm torn. On one hand, I see it as a possible commentary on God knows what. On the other, I see it as an exercise in insanity. I've read up on multiple interpretations and can't seem to agree or come to a solid understanding on any of them. Some have said it represents the death of the American Dream (as hinted in the book's title, Duke and Gonzo are searching for the American Dream), yet I am unable to look past the idea that two archetypes hopping from a ridiculous drug-fueled cacophony to another isn't representing the philosophy and idea of success in America. At least not in any way I can identify. I've read that Las Vegas, Nevada represents the decline of decency in America as a whole and it's just blatantly shallow consumerism that has plagued us from ever reaching our goals. This sounds logical, but we never focus on many other characters aside from Duke and Gonzo, and never do we officially get a grasp on others vacationing in Vegas. And nor do are we ever presented with other peoples' point of views on this fit of drug haze that Duke and Gonzo are residing in throughout their stay there. Then there's the debate that this is a reiteration on the idea of social psychology, yet I'm not the one to try and elaborate on that. I read about two pages of it and how it is expressed in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and still don't feel that accurately describes it.This may be another film that I just can not fully grasp, but I'm sort of not content with that. I admire the film for its original use of quirky camera angles, visually potent style, two incredible character actors that work wonders together, and its transgressive attempt to take drug use into account, but I always felt disconnected from this film, cold, and unable to warm to its many vignettes detailing drug use. I can't extract a meaning for all of it, no matter how hard I try, and there's only so much of repetitive scenes that seemingly lack meaning I can take before I become bored and drained.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a film I won't soon forget, but will not soon watch again. Its madness and excessive amount of content seem truly relevant only one time around, and the following times I view it I might need the assistance of chemicals and maybe this modest review will magically become a glowing one. There's some truly wonderful cinema being articulated here, mainly in the fields of cinematography, direction, and shot formation. Yet the only thing I can equate the experience to is the idea of hearing your buddy tell stories and reminisce about days gone by that are funny to him, but lengthy and tedious to those hearing them. I wish I was reiterating the groundbreaking philosophy presented in this film rather than reflecting on repetitive madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An extravagantly subjective, linguistically rich, and outrageously bad-behaved, Fear and Loathing is a slapstick comedy that is both funny and poignant as it is worldly. Director Terry Gillian gleefully portrays Thompson's panicky experiences through quick flips in and out of his drastically expanded consciousness. Short Shorts, a receding hairline, a sporty bonnie hat, orange aviators, and a jaunty cigarette holder, Depp accurately impersonates Hunter with both his appearance and attitude. Depp proves himself a master of movements as though someone had just pulled out his power source (much like his role in Pirates of the Caribbean), but the movie's edge is provided by Del Toro, who gained 40 pounds for the role, and honed a paranoid glare sharper than the hunting knife that he regularly brandishes. This film brings vulgarity and comedy together to produce a radically honest portrayal of a truly tough period in American history (Vietnam).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who hasn't seen this movie cannot say that they have seen it all. You will literally fall into confusion, dizziness, and mental retardation within 5 minutes of watching this. Johnny Depp is insane as can be, and proves it brilliantly within this film.Based on the novel by Hunter S. Thompson, The story follows Raoul Duke, (Johnny Depp) a photographer for a magazine, and attorney Dr. Gonzo (Bernicio Del Toro)to a trip to Las Vegas to shoot pictures for a bike race. From the whole trip to their time in Vegas, they are stoned with several doses of mescaline. Their trip turns for the worst when they experience several bizarre envisions due to their doses. Through several different situations and conflicts, they continue to struggle between the boundaries of reality and illusion.You will find nothing in this movie anywhere else. It's literally like nothing you've ever seen. Every scene is a crazy mad house full of random bizarre pictures. Each scene is more random than the other.From comparison to the novel, the best part is the detailed narration of Johnny's character, describing his experiences while they're being shown. It's so interesting to listen to. The movie would not be as good without the narration. I haven't read the book yet. A lot of people say it's better because it has more descriptive narration. Some criticize the film for having not much story arc, and focusing on the results of the doses. But that's the point! Thompson appreciated the film so much that when he watched it for the first time, he literally relived the trip for each scene, jumping up and down on seats. The things that the character's see make the film work, and the narration makes it work even better. Johnny does an amazing job capturing the actions of a dosed up hot head. Bernicio del Toro is completely insane! Everything he does get them deeper and deeper into the psychological despair they experience. He is completely random at all times. You never know what he'll do next, almost scary. But he pulls off a solid performance.Director Terry Giliam's purpose was to create a mood just like the novel, which he successfully does. This film is very underrated, and doesn't have the praise it deserves. This film entertained me from beginning to end, and will always stay fresh and crazy. If you want to watch something crazy and let your mind slip away from reality, then check this out. You won't be let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Might be pointless but still weirdly engaging and entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sort of reminded me of "Dazed and Confused" where it doesn't really have a plot. But it's still engaging because of the well crafted visual style that makes it really worth a watch. The weirdness of this movie is what really drives this movie like your watching the mind of someone that is really high on drugs. Well someone that is high on drugs and hitting up Las Vegas which can be a crazy experience. Which sort of sums up this movie, it's a crazy experience. I can't really say this is the most visually crazy movie I seen but it's still visually crazy. This is a movie for escape but for those looking for a actual story might be disappointed. What this movie is, is two guys experiencing drugs and through there eyes somewhat. Johnny Depp is great in this and you can tell he got really into his character in this. He is good at playing quirky, crazy and paranoid characters and this is no exception. This is a movie that lacks in the script department but it still has substance. This movie is hectic and all over the place in a good way you won't know what is going on the first time through but know it was one heck of a movie. If there is a plot though it would be two guys going on a trip while taking bunch of different drugs and their reactions to it, what they see from the effects and the actions that lead from it. Some may say this is a pointless movie and it might be true. But it's still weirdly engaging and entertaining.7.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las VegasAstonishingly enough, fear and loathing are only two of the emotions you experience in Las Vegas - the other three being shame, bankruptcy and itchy groin.Thankfully, the chemically altered correspondent in this comedy is so high the only emotion he feels is paranoia.En route to cover an off-road race through the Nevada desert, magazine writer Duke (Johnny Depp) and his fanatical lawyer, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio del Toro), begin consuming psychotropic drugs.Once in Sin City, Duke and the doctor carry on self-medicating, resulting in a hallucinogenic journey through the arid jungle wherein they encounter the eccentric creatures that temporarily inhabit it.A psychedelic nightmare shifting in and out of reality, Fear and Loathing's comical leads keep the film's kaleidoscopic camera-work and incoherent story from imploding.Besides, the only drug you need to have fun in Vegas is the oxygen laced air casino's pump in to keep you awake.

		<shortDescription>What a long, strange trip it's been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would have been great to see what talented British director Alex Cox would have done with this film; he was originally going to direct before being replaced by Terry Gilliam. To his credit, Gilliam does a very good job, serving up a completely off-the-wall affair which compliments the spaced-out goings-on of Hunter S. Thompson's source novel very well indeed. Gilliam takes a novel widely considered unfilmable and translates it very cleverly to the screen. I would love to know what the late Hunter S. thought of this movie.America's favourite actor, the wonderful Johnny Depp, is splendidly wacky as dope fiend extraordinaire Raoul Duke. His partner-in-crime is the loathsome Dr Gonzo, portrayed by Benicio Del Toro. These two actors bounce off each other extremely well and spend the whole film pushing each other towards more and more manic mischief.A writer for Rolling Stone magazine, Duke is assigned to cover the Mint 500 motorcycle race in Las Vegas, Nevada. So he teams up with his attorney, the aforementioned Dr Gonzo, they pile into the 'Red Shark' - a gorgeous cherry red 1971 Chevy Impala convertible - and head for the bright lights of Vegas. In the trunk they have stashed a suitcase which contains a veritable cornucopia of mind-altering substances, which they partake of with wild abandon. Pretty soon they are hallucinating and spiralling wildly out of control. Vegas - with its bright lights and non-stop party atmosphere - is the perfect place for this drug-addled pair, and they stagger through its many attractions with crazed abandon.The motorcycle race soon takes a back seat to the non-stop, drug-fuelled partying. The two run up an outrageously large room service bill which, of course, they have absolutely no intention of paying! How long can they maintain this insane pace before reality must inevitably descend? 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is a wild ride and definitely not for all tastes. The scene in which Dr Gonzo humiliates a waitress at the North Star Cafe in North Las Vegas (the waitress is played by the sultry Ellen Barkin) is genuinely unpleasant to watch and shows just what a repellent character this Dr Gonzo really is. Thankfully, Duke is nowhere near as nasty as his sociopath friend. If you like Johnny Depp then you should check this out but be warned - it is pretty shocking at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good but doesn't quite match the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate to be one those annoying snobs who rains on the parade of a great film by talking out of my arse and saying "ooo weelll the book is better" but that's exactly what I'm going to do. Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas tells the story of Raoul Duke and his attorney, Dr Gonzo, on a mission to find the American Dream. The tale comes from two separate trips Hunter S Thompson made with his real - life attorney, Oscar Acosta in 1971. Raoul Duke is a pseudonym used frequently by Thompson in his books, and a character supposed to represent Thompson himself.The film has a very loose narrative structure and is effectively a two hour binge of drunken, drug fuelled madness that is very funny and both very well directed and acted out. Johnny Depp, who was a great friend of Thompson, plays Duke outstandingly well and the same is true of Benicio Del Toro for his portrayal of the psychopathic attorney, Dr Gonzo. The chemistry between these two is brilliant and I must say that in this way the film does live up to the nature of the book.Terry Gilliam did an excellent job directing the film, particularly given the chaotic nature of the film. It would have been very easy for the film to lose its coherence entirely given the constant drug taking and need to perceive its effects, however, he does extremely well to both demonstrate the psychoactive madness of the novel whilst more or less keeping to the story. I think that Gilliam could perhaps have done better though in regard to the ending. Whilst in the film we end with Depp driving off into the sunset, in the book a great deal of the meaning and message of the novel occurs after this point.This is my main problem with the film, there is a massive emphasis on the humour, madness and chaos of the novel but barely anything on its purpose. I concede that this probably would have been very hard to do but I think Gilliam could have made more of an effort on this front. I watched the film first and whilst you do understand why they are doing what they are doing and its purpose, it is very vague; in fact the only scene in which it is made even a bit clear is the famous "wave" speech. This means that whilst the film is very good, I would imagine a great number of people would come away thinking that it was cool how many drugs they took and laughing rather than getting the point of it all. I would point out though that this really is my opinion and that you should read the book and watch the film in order to come to your own judgement because there's a great deal of interpretation to be made. Take nothing away from the acting in this film though, it is absolutely top class and whilst I have criticised Gilliam he still did a very good job of a novel that would have been very hard to perfect cinematically, kudos all round.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Possible Adaptation of the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film from director Terry Gilliam and based on the 1971 book by Hunter S. Thompson, follows journalist Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp) and his crazed attorney Doctor Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) as they travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to cover a prestigious motorcycle race equipped with an astonishing variety of alcohol and drugs. The duo soon turn a simple sportswriting assignment into an insane, prolonged drug binge.Long thought to be unfilmable, Terry Gilliam manages to create a striking screen version of Thompson's distinctive prose. The film utilises a variety of visual and audio techniques to recreate the experiences of the druggy duo. The film features superb performances featuring a variety of well-known actors in small roles. Johnny Depp spent a lot of time with Hunter Thompson researching for his role and the two became close friends until Thompson's death in 2005.In keeping with the book, the film doesn't have much of a storyline and veers wildly between wild comedy and some genuinely disturbing sequences. The film deals with the disillusionment that many in America felt as the sixties gave way to the seventies, and Gilliam, who directs with a strong attention to detail, puts in many references to the Vietnam war, protests and politics of the period.The book is a modern classic and this is a powerful adaptation. Thompson fans may be interested in "The Rum Diary" (2011) , which also stars Johnny Depp in the lead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very strange but strangely compelling? Beware of 'Bat Country'?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that came across my radar several years ago but I never paid it much mind. However, when I discovered it was directed by Terry Gilliam I decided to put it on 'The List'. These things take time, but eventually it bubbled up to the top and I finally got the opportunity for a viewing today. I must say it's very strange, but at the same time it's quite compelling. I will tell you more after this extremely brief summary.This film charts the adventures of sports journalist, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr Gonzo. They take a drug-fuelled trip (in more ways than one) to Las Vegas, initially, to cover a motorcycle race in the desert. Moving on to a conference on drug abuse, things descend into one crazy trip. I really can't say much more about it, I guess the Spoiler Police will be pleased, but I must say it just one of those you have to see for yourself.Full of great dialogue and also some great tunes of the day; I believe it is supposed to be set in 1971. The two central parts were played by Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke and Benicio Del Toro as Dr Gonzo; both did an excellent job. Some other well known actors made appearances; Tobey Maguire as the Hitchhiker, Ellen Barkin as the Waitress at North Star Caf, Gary Busey as the Highway Patrolman, Christina Ricci as Lucy and Cameron Diaz as the Blonde TV Repoter.I guess it is the narration that holds this film together; it draws you in with great descriptions of events, feelings, thoughts and the whole drug culture and the 'American Dream' thing. I thought it was brilliantly scripted. A very difficult piece to put on the screen but I thought Terry Gilliam was the perfect man for the job. It may not be as flamboyant as many of his works, but it most definitely has his stamp on it; particularly the 'lizard' scene. I usually don't approve of films that depict drug use, but I will give this one a pass, mainly because it doesn't go on to 'glorify' it. Over all, if a little long, I did enjoy this one very much? Recommended.My score: 7.8/10.IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (based on 103,670 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 48/100 (based on 50 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 90/100 (based on 246,898 user ratings counted at the time of going to press). I guess that illustrates how wrong 'critics' can be sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the Best Film of Thompson's Book We're Bound to Get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend turned me on to the work of Hunter S. Thompson a few years ago. He's a major fan and offered to lend me a few of his books. I found myself enjoying his self-proclaimed gonzo journalism but only managed to finish "Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas" (and about half of "Hell's Angels"). I absolutely loved it and sought out the 1998 Terry Gilliam adaptation, primarily to see how exactly he managed to create a film based on Thompson's drug-fueled Las Vegas mind-trip. I'd read that Thompson had the possibility of a film adaptation in mind when he wrote the book, but I agreed with the majority of opposing viewpoints I'd read that the book was "unfilmable". The story was originally published as in Rolling Stone magazine when Hunter Thompson was sent on assignment to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. The book/film, using the pseudonyms of Raoul Duke (Thompson) and Dr. Gonzo (Thompson's associate Oscar Zeta Acosta), follows the duo as they load a convertible with every kind of drug available (from alcohol to ether, marijuana to mescaline) and head to Las Vegas. What starts as an assignment to cover the race and, eventually, a district attorneys conference ends with Thompson/Duke contemplating the state of the American Dream and the end of the 60s as an era.To anyone who hasn't read the book, this movie probably made no sense at all. Without the context and the knowledge of what's going through Duke's head over the course of these events, this movie must be unbearable. I understand how this movie has become a "love it/hate it" sort of film. To those who aren't familiar with the book, this movie is just a random string of drug adventures in the bright neon light jungle of Las Vegas. The movie doesn't do a fantastic job of tying it all together and, even though I'd read the book prior to watching, still had a hard time seeing this movie as anything more than a series of drug skits. There are a lot of criticisms that the film comes off as pro-drug, which is a load. There are a lot of drugs in the film (a LOT) but their use is rarely if ever glamorized. In fact, in nearly all scenes where the characters are on drugs (which is about 99% of the movie) they're portrayed as total buffoons or terrified of the experience. I wish the movie had managed to maintain some of the deeper aspects of the book, but there really wasn't any good means of doing so. We get some explanation in the form of voice-over's from Duke but a lot of it is lost in translation from one medium to another. The movie's great for some laughs at Duke and Gonzo's expense, but people actually interested in Thompson's work should just go ahead and actually read the book.What really makes the movie work (aside from Gilliam's fantastic visuals?the man's brought us some of the best, most hilarious cinematic drug trips in this movie) are Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro as Duke and Gonzo. The two are freakin' hilarious in this movie and Depp gives a spot-on impersonation of Thompson from what I've seen in footage of the real-life writer. If you find yourself having a hard time believing someone as strange as Depp's Duke can exist, listen to the DVD commentary with Hunter Thompson on the Criterion Collection version. The movie also features a boatload of cameos including Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Gary Busey, and TV's Christopher Meloni. It's a fun movie and a total mind-trip to watch, but it feels empty without any real narrative behind it. If Gilliam had managed to establish a better story flow, this movie would rank higher but it feels like it stumbles from one drug experience to the next and limits itself to become one of my cult favorites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Darkly funny look at post 60s drug culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, in terms of hotel room trashing prowess Fear and Loathing is what The Hangover would like to be when it grows up.This cinematic rendering of Hunter S Thompson's semi-autobiographical 1971 classic follows self-styled "doctor of journalism" Raoul Duke (Depp) and his "attorney", Doctor Gonzo (Del Toro) as they undertake an epic journey to Las Vegas fuelled by a startling cocktail of psychedelic drugs. Narrated by Depp, their encounters with a variety of stellar cameo parts (including a young Tobey Maguire) provide a great deal of entertainment. Not that anyone comes close to upstaging Depp or Del Toro, both of whom command the screen masterfully as they portray the world through the eyes of people going to ever more extreme lengths to chase that elusive next high. It's intoxicatingly funny stuff, but not as funny as seeing those people from the outside. Caricaturing the lack of motor skills typically associated with heavy drug use is an art in itself, but both Depp and Del Toro throw themselves into it, bringing different facets of each character forward as the particular chemical they are riding changes. Del Toro's weapon- toting, psychopathic aggression sits in sharp contrast to Depp's comparatively lucid, staccato delivery and his perpetual cigarette holder.Quite rightly, Gilliam doesn't shy away from the dark, empty and depressing aspects of the drug culture of the early Seventies. Woven around the pair's madcap antics, we find genuine attempts to show us the disappointment felt by a generation who were waking up to the fact that after all the hippy idealism of the Sixties, many of the fundamental problems in their society remained the same. Ultimately, our wasted protagonists make the point that Las Vegas and what it stands for as the embodiment of the American Dream, leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. But they do so with smiles on their faces and in a highly entertaining manner</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very weird movie filled with drugs and hallucinations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunter S. Thompson has been known for making weird and great novel's including one of my favorite book's, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.In 1998, Terry Gilliam, the director of, Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Brazil, released a film adaptation.The story is about a journalist named, Raoul Duke, and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, going to Las Vegas to do some crazy things there, while Duke writes an article about a motorcycle race happening there.What I love about this film are the visuals. They were able to stay true to the one's in the book and they can be pretty cool at time's. I also enjoyed Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's acting in the movie. It also stayed true to most part's of the book.The only problem I have with this movie is that sometime's the movie dosen't stay true to some part's of the book and it just show's the guy's doing weird thing's throughout the film.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is a great adaptation and movie. If you're looking for a funny movie to watch, this movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is an amazing movie. It is probably one of Johnny Depp's best films that he acted in.Johnny Depp looks exactly like Hunter S. Thompson . This movie is a very psychedelic movie about Hunter. S Thompson and his crazy adventures with his attorney, Dr .Gonzo, played by Benicio Del Toro , while doing a lot of different drugs . It has some of the best cinematography that I've seen in a while due to all the good camera angels . It follows Hunter s. Thompson's book very well. It is a funny movie that has a lot of drugs in it. I would give this movie 8 out of ten.I would go see this movie . But it is a movie for mature audiences .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the movies that I've seen, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is honestly the most tripy movie I've seen. The way the movie is told goes well with the main character's (Raoul Duke played by Johnny Depp) thought process throughout the 3 days where he and his lawyer are supposed to go and cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race. The movie is set up to make the audience feel like they're experiencing an acid trip as well. The viewers can see what Duke sees when he's on acid. Duke and his lawyer (Benicio del Toro) take a trip down to Las Vegas and have what I can only call a drug spree. They go to hotels in Vegas and destroy the hotel rooms, terrorize the help and total the rented cars all while consuming various types of drugs which include: acid, adernochrome (a drug derived from the adrenal gland), marijuana, ether, cocaine, and mescaline. The viewer can see how the character's react to the drugs and with each other while intoxicated making this film a chaotic mess."Near the ending, it's set up as a parts of a flashback which is an interesting technique to use because it ties into how Duke's memory recalls events occurring while on drugs. This was a good movie for the average drug addict, or the wannabe drug addict; for the average person it's just a tripy movie. I'd compare this movie to something between Dude, Where's My Car meets any other movie that has drugs and protagonists reeking chaos all across the town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(SPOILERS THROUGHOUT) Fear and Loathing is a truly psychedelic story of a man and his lawyer who go to go to Las Vegas with a brief case full of literally every drug one could imagine. The two men indulge in their mind altering drugs and have quite the experience roaming through the city of sin. Dr. Gonzo played by Raoul Duke and Benicio del Toro played by Johnny Depp are assigned by a magazine with no name to cover a motorcycle race out in the desert. The story of this drugged up duo have become a cult classic with its insane drug use, and remains a favorite of many. Personally Fear and Loathing is one of my favorite movies of all time. The Depp's character is extremely entertaining, and I still to this day find myself quoting "Jesus, God!". While I do enjoy it, many of the people that I have viewed the film with complained that they had no idea what was happening and couldn't follow it. But that is the basis of the movie, for I feel that the characters in the film don't really know what is happening either. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is by far a stand alone movie. In all of the films that I have viewed I have never seen another one like it. This unique experience is one that everyone should have, and I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the vantage point of film 2010, Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas plays as a darker, more intelligent, and significantly funnier version of hit comedy The Hangover; the difference, besides quality, being that Fear and Loathing recognizes its protagonists' exploits as ultimately somewhat pathetic. The film is saturated with canted angles and American flags, in service of a point that the Hangover only touched on through meta-accident: if Vegas is the American dream, what we value as a people is strangely skewed. Johnny Depp gives a superbly bizarre performance, and the material lends itself well to the most surreal elements of Terry Gilliam's style. Fear and Loathing entertainingly indulges excess after excess, but it crucially maintains awareness of itself--it makes a statement without ever compromising its hilarity. -TK 11/16/10</fullReview>

So ill just fill them in...So just keep walking straight ahead towards the noise. I'm not to sure what I can make of it but it sounds a little like pee wee and the gang. but then I thought I saw Hank Hill slapping Joe Dirt with a tube of tooth paste. I then realized I should have just went with the package deal instead and bought everything in bulk. but hey who cares idiots what I get for not thinking before I strike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing is a movie that requires you to think sometimes. And a lot of people don't and therefore, they dislike the film. It's a pretty good movie and a great representation of the 70s.The acting is superb. Depp and Del Toro are flawless. You might think that they act stupid when trying to portray a person who's under the influence, but I'll guarantee you, that's how those people act in real life.There's a lot of funny moments. Some people found this movie to be boring because only the first half-hour is funny, and that the rest is just them on weed. I disagree. There are a bunch of humorous moments, you just have to think about it sometimes. And the reason why they're on drugs is because this is the 1970s. There were a lot of potheads back then. Also, the stuff that happened in the movie, happened in real life. So blame real life events if you don't find the humor humorous. Some people even go the extra mile and watch this movie high. Well, don't do that. Trust me, you will understand WAY more if you're sober.The plot(like everything else in this movie) requires massive amounts of thinking and don't expect yourself to get it on your first time watching. It's not just about two guys and their intoxicating adventures. Noooo. It's MUCH more than that. The plot is about a journalist and his attorney who, during the early 70s, try to find the American Dream.All in all, the movie is great. Now, it's not a cinematic masterpiece or anything, but its still a good movie that's fun to watch. You may need to watch it a second time in order to completely understand it, though. I myself, recommend it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parniod Drug Induced Dark Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Drugs have often been a popular theme in cinema, with excellent entries like Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream and A Scanner Darker. Here is Terry Gilliam's take on this issue with this good dark comedy.Duke (Johnny Deep), a journalist, and his lawyer Gonzo (Benicio del Toro) are sent by their magazine to report on a desert car race in the city. They rent a car and have a hell of a lot of drugs sorted in the boot. On their travels they pick up a hitchhiker and scare the living hell out of him. Once in Las Vegas the pair take more drugs and are unable to report on the race. It was lucky that their editor send them to report on a anti-drugs conference.The film is based a novel by Hunter S. Thompson, which I haven't read. However the film seems to lack a proper plot and narrative. It may work in novels like Catch 22, The Catcher of the Rye, The Lovely Bones and the Man in the High Castle, but not so well in film. The film lacked focused. But what would normally be a fatal fault in an other film, it was saved by the quality of it director and actor. Terry Gilliam is a master of the surreal and his flair for direction is unmatched. Here the material is perfect for him. Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro are both actors I like and both perfectly casted, especially Depp. He also doesn't look as attractive as usual so they is hope for us all. The film is played as a dark comedy and is very funny because of the jokes, the nature of the performances and direction.They themes within this film, such as the American Dream, the protest culture, counter-culture, the decline of the sixties, the corrupting force of Las Vegas and wealth. But to me the biggest theme of the film is simply drug really mess with your mind and enjoyable to watch.Perfectly good film, especially if you are a Gilliam or Depp fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like reading the book in two hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In hindsight, the timeliness of this movie being done is uncanny. Hunter was still alive, Vegas still had parts of it that hadn't changed since the seventies. It's like the producers and Gilliam knew it was "now or never". I remember reading the book and thinking how would they ever make this into a movie? But Gilliam did it! And I don't think anyone else could have. He's the only guy out there with the correct acid hazed vision.Every time I watch it, it takes me right back to where I was while reading the book...High School 1976.The set designers had way too much fun... and that's why it all looks perfect.The casting is, of course, perfect. It's like they read a page about a character, called the actor they wanted and presto! I'm not just talking about Depp and Del Toro... everyone! Busey as the Cop, Katherine Helmond as the Desk Clerk, etc, etc. The acting on everybody's part is spot on. Depp was superb, but he hung out with Hunter prior to shooting. Benecio del Toro really, really got Oscar Zeta Acosta! He was brilliant and possibly a bit overlooked. Depp was perfect, but so was del Toro.I realize the movie is not really that close to the book, if it was, it would be an eight hour ride. There is no way to do it, and with that in mind, this is by far the best movie adaptation of a book ever done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but noble attempt to adapt a seemingly unfilmmable work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book on which this film is based is one of the essential texts of the latter half of the twentieth century. Hunter S. Thompson's drug-fueled tome perfectly captures the era of excess and puts it into one easily digestible microcosm. Its more than the college stoner bible as its detractors would want you to believe. Its a wildly inventive book which stands as a document of the time yet has aged quite well. However, it's one of those books which wouldn't really lend itself to a cinematic rendering. Terry Gilliam's adaptation though gives it a noble shot.On one hand, there are some aspects the film does very well. The performances are very entertaining and get the mania right, even if Depp tones down Thompson's speaking voice to make it more accessible. Also, the dynamics and schisms between the two central characters is fully explored. They seem ready to kill each other at any moment, yet need each other to survive nonetheless. Plus, the film manages to depict the various drugs as accurately as one can.However, the film is a bit too comedic at moments. There's never any real sense of danger to the characters like there was in the novel. Plus, one overlooked aspect of the novel is the way the conclusion states that the constant drug use never really made the generation get anywhere, which the film mostly sidesteps. For the most part, the tone of the adaptation is right, yet some of the most important messages are ignored. Still, this is an entertaining film and a good attempt to adapt the book.

		<fullReview>"Fear and Loathing" has got to be one of the most bizarre and weirdest film I have seen. Terry Gilliam's psychedelic masterpiece is a movie experience you wouldn't wanna miss. Its like taking all the drugs they took in the film and you're experiencing the same surreal, whacked up, distorted scenarios Raoul and Dr. Gonzo went through in said film. Actually, the film itself is a drug, a very addictive one. Gilliam's imaginative vision add to that Hunter S. Thompson's true to life psychedelic book from which this movie was based on and as the creme de la creme, you got two of the finest actors in Hollywood, Benicio Del Toro and Johnny Depp getting high and loopy in a weekend in Vegas. That's it right there, the perfect formula why this film worked.Johnny and Benicio by the way, gave pretty amazing performances, although a bit over-the-top at times in my taste but that's a mighty fine performance nonetheless. Its hard to look like you're stoned like hell although you're really not, that's a tought act to achieve although with this film you can't really be sure, maybe the guys where really loopy all along that's why their performances were so spot-on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When watching this movie, one should try to forget all about "traditional movie-viewing". For maximum enjoyment just lean back and let the two biggest druggies in motion picture history entertain, amaze, disgust and surprise you! This is, in my opinion, Depp's best role. He does play eccentric characters very well and Raoul Duke is about as eccentric as they come. Del Toro plays Duke's "legal adviser" (more like partner in crime, really) with great skill and the two have a rare sort of love/hate friendship rarely seen in film.Some people I've spoken are critical about how the movie portraits drugs. I am not of this opinion at all. Sure, some of the trips we are shown look pretty awesome, but all in all the usage of drugs in the film just depicts a couple of real losers, bums. Their existence is nothing short of pathetic and this point is proved, not by dramatic sequences such as in f.e "Requiem for a dream" but with humor. As a viewer, one is not so much horrified by all the narcotics and their effects as disgusted in a funny way.For me, the movie was just on the edge of being vulgar and "too much" but it managed the balancing of that very important edge in a skillful manner. 8 / 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I bought the ticket, I took the ride... it was worth every penny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas has one of the most fast-pace beginning scenes I have ever seen in a film to this day. We follow the half fictional character Raoul Duke (created by and roughly based on Hunter S Thompson)on his insane and fearful trip to Las Vegas, with the companionship of his outrageously behaved attorney and a suitcase full of hallucinogenic drugs. For me, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a "feel good" film, I always end up watching it on a rainy day for some reason. Proberbly because it has comedy, alterations to reality and a fantastic performance by Johnny Depp as the mumbling, animated, permanently tripping Raoul Duke! I am a big fan of the book of Fear and loathing in Las Vegas and the movie was just as enjoyable as the book, for me anyway. The only other film I have seen in which the film was just as good as the book was Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.I think Terry Gilliam really did have the artistic license from behind the camera to really make this film an excellent, somewhat warped experience to the viewer. The uses of red in the film are just one of the many fantastic mechanisms that Gilliam used to make the viewer feel the same way as the disorientated and comedic characters. As I said before the film has a very fast-pace but I did not drift off it due to the frequent narration and jilted camera work. Some of the scenes in fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are simply just some of the most memorable and entertaining I have seen in a long time, for example the brilliantly set scene in Which Duke attempts to avoid a confrontation of any kind with one of the local police officers or the scene where Duke comes in to the hotel room discovering his attorney(Benicio Del Toro)lying in a bathtub, half clothed simply out of his mind on illegal drugs.. comedy and madness combined to make something too complex for words themselves. Fear and Loathing; excellent, entertaining and insane. I bought the ticket, I took the ride.. and it was worth every penny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drug epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing is one of those rare films that manages to be both a wildly entertaining, highly quotable comedy that plays well at parties, and an intelligent, introspective character study to be watched alone with the lights off and the mind open.The character being studied is not Raoul, but you, or anyone from any generation that identifies with the post-60s American drug culture.If you have no understanding of (or harbor disdain towards) said drug culture, you will probably not "get" Fear and Loathing. That's okay. It was not made for you.Amidst the seemingly non-sequiter madness that makes this movie such a comedy classic the attentive viewer will find a sobering self-appraisal of the social revolution that was the 60s, and the sad state in which its children were left. Raoul (Thompson), here a larger-than-life lunatic Johnny Depp, is also an everyman with whom any past or present drug user can identify.The outwardly hilarious weekend in Vegas is, in fact, dark and miserable, overwhelmed with debauch, depression, fear and loathing. Raoul's "friend" Oscar sinks to depths that even our anti-hero finds despicable, generates one terrible experience after another, and violates every law of God or Man. Yet no ties are broken. No promise to change is made. It's all accepted as part of the trip and left behind on the highway.Needless to say: This movie contains a strong anti-drug message.But this is no phony, government-subsidized "Dope is Whack" campaign told by FBI-shoed business men you'd never listen to anyway. It's the truth as told from the front lines of the movement. A burn-out king who knows it's all evil, and will tell you as much even as he taps another needle. Someone worth believing.Fear and Loathing is a powerful movie. It's also a funny movie. It gets my highest recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one crazy film. It follows two guys as they are driving to Las Vegas and the fun they have whilst on drugs in Vegas. Depp is perfect for this role and narrates it very well. What makes this film stand out from other films is the humour and the fact that we get to see what they are seeing and hearing whilst high. One memorable scene is when Depp sees everyone as Reptiles in the hotel bar. It is hilarious and later on in the film we see Depp with a Lizard tail attached to him.At times the movie is sick and twisted like when Depp is talking about Police doing an under age girl and also the mess these two characters leave behind is quite disgusting.The director made good use of the camera and lighting and has crafted a film so strange and so bizarre that you have to see it to understand how brilliant it is. Some say its a pointless movie but maybe thats the point that there is no point.Overall a 7.8/10</fullReview>

Uppers,downers, screamers, poppers and more, all packed in a suitcase in the back of the car -prepare yourself for a thrilling journey with all the better mind altering drugs you wish you could have. Its great how absorbed you become into the film and share in all the good and bad trip experiences. The paranoia abounds and overflows. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Hunter is outstanding.

		<shortDescription>The Strangest Journalist Who Ever Penned the American Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was once said that the Austrian composer Wolfgang Mozart was "not a man of this world." If that was true of Mozart, then Hunter S. Thompson, the original Gonzo journalist, was not a man of this Universe, or any other for that matter. Or maybe, when Thompson came into this universe, he accidentally brought the other one with him. Thompson, the writer of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, was a man whose perspective on life oozed from a pen filled with ink from other dimensions.Thompson made a following in the 1960's and 1970's with a two-fold avant-garde approach to journalism. Well, "avant-garde " is almost too tame a word. His style was the journalistic equivalent to Salvadore Dali or Thomas Pynchon where reality and surrealism become very reluctant bedfellows in a world that seems to have gone mad--or maybe it never really was sane to begin with. The other aspect in addition to Thompson's warped view of the world is his habit of engaging in the lovingly coined term "Gonzo Journalism". For those unfamiliar with it, Gonzo Journalism refers to an approach to reporting in which the reporter and/or journalist becomes as important to (or more important than) the story itself, in a kind of self-aggrandizement in which the story and reporter literally become one. And Thompson was, for almost five decades, the quintessential Gonzo journalist. He is sometimes referred to as Dr Gonzo.As Gonzo journalism is definitely not for all readers, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is definitely not for all movie-goers. If you're shopping for a film to re-affirm certain steadfast precepts of logic, love, ethics, and morality, then your movie-buying dollar needs to be invested elsewhere. But if you're willing to forgo any predetermined expectations about how and what a movie should be, you're in for one hell of a ride. Fear and Loathing is a roller coaster from which you never seem to be able to get off.The story surrounds a semi-fictional character, Raoul Duke, played brilliantly by Johnny Depp in a role that even the most daring of actors would avoid at all costs. The only other actor brave or foolish enough to step into the twisted world of Thompson was Bill Murray in "Where the Buffalo Roam". The difference between Raoul Duke and Hunter Thompson is mainly the spelling. The character is still replete with Thompson's trademark long cigarette, California drawl, and a personality that is at once maddeningly low-key and as deranged as Dracula on speed. The Raoul Duke aka Hunter Thompson character is the type of person you might want to at first avoid by running into the nearest coat closet before peeking your head out to see what this space alien masquerading as a human being will do next. And Raoul Duke goes on this adventure with a side-kick known sometimes as his attorney and also as Dr Gonzo.The setting for the misadventures of these two interplanetary refugees couldn't be more perfect. Space Alien and his side-kick Godzilla go on a drug-infested trip to the loony-bin surreal capital of the US of A: Las Vegas. Duke is supposed to be covering a motorcycle race for the incomparable Sports Illustrated and gets sidetracked by the amusement park that is the Disneyland for adults. The road trip begins on the infamous two-lane highway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas in a 1960's convertible that has seen better days--and better owners. Even before they arrive in neon-ville, Depp sees bats all over the sky, but becomes concerned when his partner fails to see them also. He wonders that his partner may be "losing it" when he doesn't see the bats that Depp does. During the trip (and the "trip") these two maniacs enter Vegas and see strange creatures in and out of hotels, casinos, bars, and even on the race track. And people in particular sometimes show up as reptilian creatures looking to devour Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo.The result is a kind of endless romp through an amusement park from Hell that never lets up. At one point the drugs have so twisted all of their perceptions of reality that the world has become somewhat akin to the hideout of the Joker in the old Batman TV series from the 1960's, you know where the floor is always slanted to the side. This is the Hunter Thompson world to a tee faithfully executed by probably the only other entity on the planet twisted enough himself to bring this mayhem to the screen: Terry Guilliam of Monty Python fame. (He was the originator of the mad cartoons that combined European Renaissance art with the Python surrealist sensibility between sketches.) The story is a mosaic of drug-inducements that nearly drive the characters insane. I mean, is Las Vegas only the most inane choice of a location to engage in an intense drug-fest? Some have criticized this movie as advocating and glorifying psychedelic drugs, but I disagree. By movie's end I felt there was a reason I don't personally engage in these kinds of "trips". Maybe the world is mad enough as it is without using artificial means to make it seem even more insane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an absolute blast from start to finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how many times I've watched Fear &amp; Loathing In Las Vegas, but it's well over 30 times. This film is a masterpiece on so many levels. I'd rank it with the best of modern American film-making, along with Coppola, Kubrick and Scorsese's finest work. Firstly, the way this film is executed despite the tiny budget is nothing short of unbelievable. It made me respect Terry Gilliam in a whole new way. Despite the potential for fancy CG given the subject matter, almost all the scenes of delusions and hallucinations are done using 'analogue' techniques (to brilliant effect) and the few touches of CG are tasteful and blend in well with the immaculately realised early 70s setting. I've heard that the lack of CG was due to funds running out, but I'm very glad this happened.I'm not a big fanboy of the book or its worldview. There are things I deeply admire about Hunter, and things that I detest too. This still doesn't detract from his story or the film based on it. Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas makes me laugh harder than anything else I've ever encountered, even after the number of times I've watched it. Yet it also has some very poignant and atmospheric moments.The film makes you feel, intensely, the dripping sleaze, pouring sweat and hot, dry desert air of Vegas. The psychedelic soundtrack conjures the era at the crumbling end of the revolutionary 60s. You feel the lurching highs and crushing lows of the two main characters' drug binges as vividly as they do. You live their darkly introspective nightmares and spiralling paranoia. And you revel in their lunatic adventures in the vortex of the American dream, urinating in the face of the supposedly wholesome and decent society in which these strange mutants exist.Depp and Del Toro are ridiculously good in this movie - I'd be gobsmacked if they ever produced better performances. Del Toro in particular is a powerhouse, at times he's mercilessly cruel, invincible and terrifying, and at others a hilarious train-wreck. He always remains immensely likable and charismatic - a perfect portrayal of the Dr. Gonzo character. Depp is also great as Hunter, manic and helplessly cowering from his hallucinations while still trying to maintain his composure and eloquence as a journalist. They pull off every scene incredibly well, especially when taking turns to be the 'responsible' minder for his drug-wrecked counterpart, when just as ripped. The supporting cast is also spectacular - the actors playing even small parts like Sven the clerk at the Tropicana, Lacerda the photographer, bellboys, traffic cops, car rental salesmen and countless high profile cameos all display great comic timing and clearly have a good understanding of the material.It is so easy to totally fail to hit the mark with this kind of subject matter, but this is one of the most perfect feature films I've come across. There are never any dull moments and it's a trip in itself. Every scene is a masterful set piece full of energy and brutal humour, and the structure is fluid and compelling. Even though it obviously helps to have great material like Thompson's book to work with (and it is virtually an exact translation of it), it's no mean feat to pull it off in a motion picture format.One of the greatest achievements of this film is the accuracy of its portrayal of drug subculture. Gilliam denies ever having touched a chemical substance in his life, but I find this frankly impossible to believe... the detail and authenticity of his direction is just too good. At no point is the film judgmental, preachy or unrealistic in how it depicts events which most normal people would find horrifying. It shows the highs, excitement and enhanced perspective and perception offered by chemical substances, while showing how they can also reduce you to a shambolic mess. Anyone who thinks this is a pro-drug movie has simply not understood it at all.I highly recommend this movie to all intelligent viewers, especially the Criterion edition which features a lot of extras, including a very good BBC-produced documentary/interview of Mr. Thompson himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to write something about this movie when I saw that someone said that this movie is not good.I am very surprised that 1000 people gave this one grade 1.But I think that everyone who didn't watch the movie should believe that 10000 people who gave grade 10.I'm one of them and I hope that you'll become one of us when you watch the movie.This movie isn't only about drugs.This movie is also about the whole period in American history.We've got two people:Raul Duke and Dr.Gonzo who are on their way to Las Vegas.On that way they are trying to try every possible drug that is known to men.And they are very successful in it.These two people are played by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro.Both of them are great actors in my opinion.Actually Depp is my favorite actor and one of my top three actors(with Marlon Brando and Al Pacino).I liked every movie that he filmed but this one knocked me off.Depp and Del Toro are brilliant in their roles and every scene is so well made that I just don't understand why someone hates this movie.This is Terry Gilliam film and you can see that.He is amazing as a director and he's the only one who can direct this movie.I liked every scene in this movie and no one can't say that he is bad director(remember "Brazil","Twelve monkeys" or "The fisherman king"...)You may think of him as some crazy man but I think he is man with vision,very talented one.Tipicall Monty Payton scene is when Depp and Del Toro are in the circus.Also watch Depp's moves when he sees clowns.He is actually afraid of them.I have to say something about other actors.In this movie there are lots of well known actors.Like Cameron Diaz,Ellen Barkin,Christina Ricci,Gary Busey,Tobey Maguire,Mark Harmon,Christopher Meloni and lots more.They are all given very small roles because Depp and Del Toro are stealing the show.Good things about this movie:outstanding acting(if this is not for Oscar then what is)-either Depp or Del Toro where really using dopes or they are excellent actors.I believe it's the second thing.After acting there is Terry Gilliam's directing,then music,then the whole set of the film and lots more.Bad things about this movie:nonePure 10/10See it and then try to say that this isn't a masterpiece of acting,of directing,of film.You won't regret it.Trust me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just started watching this movie recently after a recommendation from a friend, I didn't know what to expect out of the movie since he constantly quotes it and it made no sense.I'll admit, first time I watched this movie, I actually got bored mid-way, trying to figure out the constantly changing plot and somewhat trying to make some meaning out of what the narrator was saying.So the movie finished and I thought to myself "oh, its finished? When did it even start?" But unlike other movies that I don't like, I couldn't get this one out of my mind. I knew the movie was trying to tell the viewer something, but what..? Then, while I was making myself dinner, it hit me, and it hit me hard. The more I thought about the movie, the more sense it made, it wasn't the storyline you were suppose to follow, it's not even the narrator you were suppose to make sense of, you need good understanding of the movie to view it like it should be viewed, and after you understand the concept of the movie, it'll be like watching a completely new movie; imagine you and your friend watching the same motion picture, but you're watching different movies...I'm serious.I don't know whether I should be proud of this or not, but out of the past 7 days of owning this movie, I've actually watched it 4 times, and I'm not even close to being bored of it :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Insanity of the 60's + Terry Guillam = Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the finer movies about the strange era of the 60's. It's based on the book of the same name by Hunter S. Thompson, a profound, and pretty much the only, Gonzo journalist. While the book shines in its own weird ways, Terry Gilliam's adaptation to the screen really brought out some of the sharpest points of the book and made them very funny. Additionaly, the actors are some of the best, and the weirdest seem to feel right at home playing their strung-out roles as doped up newsmen and Las Vegas locals. If you're looking for one of the greatest dark comedies about one of the most drug-induced periods in America's history, this is your film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agree with author: merijn128 (Heemstede, Netherlands) in that this film is often misunderstood by most people.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is as much 'logical' as it is comprehensible: when i watched it I was (in true clich style) absolutely wasted at a party in winter 2000. Even then i found it a simple enough story to grasp - a writing assignment on a motorcycle marathon race that leads to journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and Dr Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) in Las Vegas, but the discourse ultimately is the voice of attack upon the oppressive manifestation of greed and materialism embedded in society's take on The American Dream. This was less eminent at the time, but nevertheless prominent.Part of its complexity derives from the fact that Hunter S Thompson's book is an archetypal example of gonzo-journalism, a style of writing through which fiction takes artistic precedence over fact and actuality of content. The journalist and lawyer (fueled by drugs) find themselves exposed, and with a desire to uncover the American Dream, an extremity the film comes to criticize within the analogous microcosm of Las Vegas.. Consequently, the political and even apolitical issues are, in context quite ingeniously put across (Terry Gilliam's representation of drugs and alcohol in the film are also a spoof on the enlightenment of the 60s and the resulting excesses of the 70s). Reminding us occasionally of events outside of Las Vegas, the echoes of contemporary political unrest are given visual voice, such as the images of the atrocities in Vietnam and the random violence for change that occurred in the cities. The opening titles convey historical eeriness as footage from the Vietnam war is followed by blood spattered titles in Ralph Steadmanesque font, furthermore made all the more sinister by the 'raindrops and roses' background music.Threads of story are unwoven through narration, monologue and dialogue, visual deployment and flashbacks, even by the soundtrack itself. Gilliam masterfully deploys rampant drug use exposed in the film as a vehicle through which the viewer can see how equally bizarre and intoxicated the sober world is. In the scene where Duke and Dr Gonzo are booking into their first Las Vegas hotel, they come to find that the entire hotel bar reception becomes (where once their were people) a cataclysm of reptiles. Indicating that affluent society is as shameful and as immoral as the behaviour of Duke and Gonzo in their ingestion of booze and alcohol.We can see that Duke has Duke has a firm conception of the American Dream, but what the audience are left to ponder is why he exasperates so much apprehension, love and fear of it.Dukes awareness of the discrepancy between American ideals and the actuality of America's brutal manifest destiny, is the national fate of delusion and greed exemplified in the Circus-Circus casino. Our narrators mad visions make him now one with the frantic "believers" of Las Vegas, what sets him apart is his uncompromising drive to locate an authentic understanding of just what has gone wrong, both within himself and with his country.Whether Duke and Dr Gonzo find the American Dream is left for the viewer to dictate, since the Dream itself is subject to the whims and visions of the individual. It can be clear at any rate though that it is not an hallucination, and it is not unlikely ever to be realized. With this in mind, Fear and Loathing is a landmark film brought about by a maverick director.</fullReview>

However, after watching it a few times, I still have one question about the film and I was wondering if someone could answer it for me. While in the back of their convertible with Toby McGuire, just after Benicio del Toro takes his heart medication, Johnny Depp breaks open a small plastic container filled with some white powder. He says, "Now for the upper," but I don't think hes snorting cocaine because they were keeping that in a salt shaker. Is it some amphetamine, speed, or a different, specific stimulant?

		<fullReview>I think Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas probably outlines why some people have it in for Mr Gilliam. A big, messy, hard to follow film which is light on plot but high in style. Whilst some of thosecriticisms may be valid of this film, I don't think they transcend all of his work. He's a genius in my opinion, and this shows glimmers of that. The problem for me is - just how interesting is this story - and did it really need to be told? Johnny Depp is just pure class. You have to admire the man for taking this role. For someone who is such a pin-up for so many people, he really knows how to strip himself of any ounce of glamour in order to depict a man of such debauchery as Raoul Duke - Hunter S. Thompson's alter ego. In my opinion he is one of two things that keep the film going. Benicio Del Toro rather mumbles his way through the stunning visual which - although understandable for a psychotic drug addled slob - is not the most pertinent screen presence.What saved the film for me was Gilliam's awesome vision. No one encapsulates you more on this side of the world like the former python. He is an artist first, filmmaker second. To understand the drug addled madness of Hunter S. Thompson's plight you must take a voyage through his world. It is one full of hallucinatory paranoia, hyperbolized by the overwhelming glitz of Las Vegas. It is both a dream and nightmare for our protagonists, and for the audience itself. You might walk out with a headache, but at least you won't take drugs again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You scurvy shyster bastard, I'm a doctor of journalism, man !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a strange beast and kinda difficult to describe - sorta based on true events, sorta fabricated, I doubt the story's original author would know himself what was real and what wasn't ...Director Terry Gilliam (former Monty Python animator, director of such films as Brazil and 12 Monkeys) adapted a great screenplay from the writings of famed 60's San Francisco 'gonzo' journalist Hunter S. Thompson (who goes by the pseudonym Raoul Duke in the film, for reasons I'm only partially sure of), a quirky, cynical drug-fiend who's character is brilliantly interpreted by Johnny Depp (whose balding appearance, muttered speech and trippy hand movements are a hoot).Set in 1971, with the hippy age of enlightenment nearly dead, we pick up the action on a highway in the middle of the Nevada desert - Depp/Thompson/Duke's narration eventually reveals in it's convoluted way that he and his ever-present attorney, Dr. Gonzo (more on him in a moment) are on their way to Las Vegas to cover a car race for Rolling Stone magazine ...However, secondary to that concern is the copious amounts of drugs the two have brought with them and intend on consuming ...A minute into the film, Duke's LSD-induced hallucinations of large Bats are brought to life in Gilliams distinctive style (indeed he handles all the drug/hallucination scenes brilliantly) - dark, threatening creatures swoop and gather in the sky as Duke warns Dr. Gonzo "We can't stop here, this is bat country !!" The trip quickly dissolves into a frenzy of drug-taking and misadventure, Benecio Del Toro (who gained 40 pounds for the role of the 'fat Samoan' Dr. Gonzo) steals half the movie with some downright scary portrayals of bad acid trips, aided by Gilliams incredible visual touches ...having recently read a little bit about 'Dr. Gonzo', he sounds like an even more larger-than-life figure than Hunter S. Thompson himself - Dr. Gonzo's real name was Oscar Zeta Acosta, and he was known as 'the Brown Buffalo' - apparently he defended the rights of countless Mexicans and latino's during the 60's, and his work is still required reading in Mexican schools - *however*, he also had a legendary appetite for mind-altering drugs, and eventually disappeared "off the coast of Mazatlan sometimes in 1974" never to be seen again ...Thompson somehow manages to avoids overdosing, being stabbed by his paranoid attorney and paying his ridiculously high hotel bill, and eventually produces the paper that would go on to form the basis for this film ...man, one helluva film, incredibly funny and scarily surreal.Obviously not for everybody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a magnificent movie that is based on a truly magnificent book. Johnny Depp plays Raoul Duke/Hunter S. Thompson. Duke is a brilliant man, despite consuming as many drugs as he does in this film, his brain still appears to be in tact. He is sent to Las Vegas with his belligerent "Samoan" Attorney Dr. Gonzo to cover the Mint 400 race: "It's the richest off-the-road race for motorcycles and dune-buggies in the history of organized sport." So they loaded up their "Materials" and drove the Great Shark to Las Vegas. Through the movie they do many outrageously unbelievable things. They pick up a hapless hitchhiker and inadvertently scare the young man half to death; they disrupt a Debbie Reynolds concert and at one hilarious point in the movie, Duke's attorney eats a massive amount of LSD and attempts to commit suicide while listening to "Jefferson Airplane." Fear and Loathing is Hunter S. Thompson's masterwork. A movie that absolutely has no bounds or limits. It's not necessarily a comedy nor a drama; it does have one beautiful park, that just about I person I have encountered loved--this scene was of course The wave speech. Words cannot accurately describe how moving this scene is. Fans of the book are already accustomed to it from the book, but Johnny Depp really brings the passage to life.The movie also has some great cameos by Gary Busey, Toby Maguire, Cameron Diaz, And Lyle Lovett--to name a few.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often a movie can make you feel so many different emotions for tow characters and their situation. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, however is one movie. Before long I found myself being scared, angered, saddened, laughing with, and even empathising with Raoul Drake and his 'attorney'.The first thing that should be stressed here is that this is not a movie with a plot, more it's a movie with a theme ( or a couple of themes to be exact ). As Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro tear up the landscape in their drug addled haze there's no point in looking for a twist in the story or a 'rooftop scene'. Instead, this movie looks at a side of America that festers under all the happy goodwill of the American dream and Las Vegas, with its casinos and pokies, stand for everything that is wrong with it.Del Toro is great as the sidekick Dr Gonzo, giving a dark brooding menace and sliding from one extreme to the other while Depp is simply perfect as the paranoid and cynical Duke.This isn't a pro-drugs movie, rather it's a movie about a group of people who were once full of hope and energy at the height of the 60s only to find now that the energy has been sapped from them. I actually found myself being reminded a little bit of Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' as it seemed to sum it up- all they had left of the LSD protest culture now was...the LSD.This is a movie that without a true plot and without a true sense of story still manages to hit you like nothing else. As Raoul himself says "you can turn your back on a man; but you can't turn your back on a drug."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Travelling to the heart of the American dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the recently deceased Hunter s. Thompson's book of the same name, Johnny Depp plays Raul Duke, a hedonistic, slightly deranged journalist heading to Vegas with his attorney, played by Benicio del Toro. The film essentially depicts the two characters searching for the American dream and lamenting it's loss on a drug fuelled journey of mayhem. Having been written in the afterglow of the swinging 60s, Raoul Duke and his attorney choose to follow acid guru Tim Leary's advice and 'turn on, tune in, drop out', seeking a chemical enlightenment, which ultimately seems to be a false promise. Depp is superb as Duke, displaying Hunter S Thompson's quirky characteristics to a tee. Del Toro's performance is equally as impressive, and Terry Gilliam's direction gives the film a wild, anarchic feel that was very much at the heart of the book. Watch out for a brief cameo from Christina Ricci as a young, tripping artist. Overall, an interesting, compelling examination of the realities and myths surrounding the American Dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful example of what cinema is capable of. I saw this with the intention of reading Hunter S. Thompson's novel (of the same name) and it drove me to the brink of my own madness. The film does that to you, but it also gives you enough fodder to keep you thinking. Through all the insane drug hallucinations, psychotic and savagely brutal themes strewn within the vast outer layer of this story, lies an engrossing view of the North American culture and our own stumbling collapse. Although I did not live in the 60's or the 70's, this film gives the viewer a very extreme but believable account of one man's life as it, willfully, spirals out of control. For showing the American culture at it's most vile and primal nature, this film is worth a 10 in my mind and is a must see for any movie buff looking for a wild ride and/or a thoughtful journey in the Red Shark. With enough twists and turns to keep you enthralled, you will not let go until the end.</fullReview>

One of the best movies ever made!Some people are plain offended with this movie, I've even heard it be called drug romanticizing, but it's far from it.Like the title says, it is really about the fear and loathing in their trip to Las Vegas.Still it is hilarious even though the whole film is about two men's drug abuse, hallucinations, fears, and even child molesting, try to do a funny film about that, still I promise that it will have you laughing through the whole movie.Gilliam is a master of detail, and you will notice new things in it every time you watch it(at least the first 6-7 times or so).</fullReview>

But I can't help but love every second of this film.On the surface, it's two dudes getting wasted and trashing Las Vegas.

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is an exciting roller-coaster of fun and brilliant directing. Gilliam proves he is the master of absurd movies and the acting is fantastic, both Depp and especially Del Toro are totally insane in this movie. There is also a funny cameo of Tobey 'Spider-man' Maguire. The special effects are really good to (the scene with the dinosaurs in the restaurant is hilarious and looks great) The movie has a great script and is very quotable, the voice-over which is delivered excellently by Johnny Depp is highly entertaining and very well-written. This movie gets slayed by critics, but that is probably because it is a very 'different'' and absurd movie and there is almost no storyline but that is no problem at all because Fear and Loathing doesn't NEED a storyline. And let me say it again: Benicio del Toro acts his a$$ off, he is extremely good.9/10 Must see</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must see movie if u like adventurous humor and commentary. My buddy told me about this movie and said "this movie is an excellent movie showing the ways of how to people could become intentionally funny yet crazy with all the drugs they have done." Some people may not or may like this movie but i totally give it a 10 out of 10. Another movie that was brought up to me was Requeim for a dream, this movie was a little strange to me but i really would like to watch it again. These types of movies i would really like to see so if anyone could give me some titles of these types and send them to me would be really nice. Thanks ! By the way you might want to watch the movie twice to understand it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Twisted, Sick, wacky, Wild, Totally Effed Up Road film based on the Excellent Novel by Hunter S. Thompson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***1/2 out of ****Wacky Wacky Wacky weirdness. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro play as Hunter S. Thompson and his lawyer. The result is truly a mixed bag, to say the least, of a film that is definitely too late to be considered good, but still worthwhile in viewing.When Duke(HST) and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo go to the City of Sins with every drug known to man at the time in their trunk, incomprehensible results ensue. They get stoned, drunk, high, and probably kill more braincells then they can even count.Even though the film is directed by the great Terry Gilliam, I can honestly say that this is far from a brilliant film. But that is obviously the point. This wasn't to be CITIZEN KANE. That's good. I am about 98.5 percent positive that if Terry tried to make it an epic masterpiece of comedy and drugs, it would have been a flop just like any other attempt to do that. Instead, the film is laid back, sloppy, gross, and very very warped and twisted.From the opening sequence(After "My Favorite Things") when they are let loose in "Bat Country" to the long warped sequence with the credits flying down the road, there is not a single frame in this film that is actually filmed well. Instead, we get spinning cameras, close ups of throw up, upside down rituals and right side swaying up during the graphic, I THINK I WILL TAKE MORE THAN I SHOULD, part. I am surprised that Duke wasn't left permanently disfigured by those drugs. Or maybe he was? I lost track of what and where each sequence was in which and what part of the film. I lost track of the characters, the sets, the flat as pancake characters, and pretty much the entire film as a whole. Yes. this film will most likely make you feel like you are on drugs. I have never been on drugs or have taken any. After watching this great film, I am pretty sure I would like to ignore those for the rest of my long life. I will walk the straight path.Rated R For Pervasive Extreme Drug Use And Related Bizarre Behavior, Strong Language, And Brief Nudity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was somewhere in the forest , just out of Balingup that the mushrooms began to take hold.Vast hordes of retired travellers in the latest vinyl foam insulated mobile homes were clogging the once verdant landscape. Hell they are all around me with their repulsive white shoes and obese guts, their existential anxiety sounding out of their shrunken Dog pets with every lonesome bark.Quickly I accelerated down the only open track leading off the newly widened highway, that was not closed because of forest hygiene rules.Alone under the canopy of god in sanctuary from the deranged and the superannuated I took refuge.I liked the film I have recently watched so much that I have thought of taking up tripping again. What joy! What baudelerian excess!What a great way to journey through the pervasive concensus mindsetawarewhile most are just peeping out of their shells like terrapin at the murky depths of a pond in a deep dank forest with lumbering shadows from galleon like clouds rolling over thicket and glade where i sit in refuge connecting while all around me are highways like conveyor belts of traffic. One of the things the swarming masses aredoing is making roadkill of ceratin terrapin,who listening to some distant inner voice had crawled out to see what was on the other side of the road.Only to meet death beneath the Firestone All Terrains of juggernaut Land Cruisers. Yet in meeting death they have begun another journey in another space / time. "...what does it all mean..." L.Wildblood.</fullReview>

How versatile can a person be?? Surprisingly amazing, it seems to have been brought to film by some sort of genius mind. It can not be easy to present the viewers with such insights to a drugged brain. Also, very funny. Totally loved it, totally recommend it! By the way, getting Flea in it was also cool. Sure, lots of know actors appear in it playing 'lesser' roles, but I did not see him coming ;-) I am no film expert, but I rate this as one of the best I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favorites. I have never seen a movie that made me want to become a drug addict before!!! I have seen many movies that have strong drug content and have always wondered why one who turn to drugs. This movie explains it all. Depp and Del Toro are at their best in this wild movie. I've watched it 100's of times and every time, I see something I didn't notice before. The effects are incredible. The life this man led would make most lives seem dull in comparison. It is truly a work of art. Of all the scenes, the bat scene was without a doubt the funniest thing I have seen in years. This is somewhat of an oldie, but in my mind it is an instant classic. While it may not be for everyone, it is certainly liked by those who enjoy flicks like Gummo or Kids. Enjoy it, I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever tried drugs, although I'm not condoning drug use.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Me and my best friend (we're both nearly 30) went through phases of endlessly quoting lines from this to each other, as in, "The decision to flee came suddenly", "One more toke you fool", "Back door beauty", and so on.Johnny Depp and Del Toro really put in career-topping performances here. I wouldn't recommend it, though, for the more conservative among us. As a person who has an idea of what went on in the '60s, I could appreciate it. Couple of too-old dudes go around off their proverbials on drugs.Dialogue is excellent, Terry Gilliam's direction is fantastic, and the acting is beyond reproach. Also, Cameron Diaz is in here, in her usual annual bid for credibility. No-one cares, Cameron.Have to give it 10/10. It's up there with GF2 and Once Upon...America in my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Savage Journey.. Yet Again..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rate this movie 10 for two reasons... The original, flamboyant, gonzo writing style of Hunter S. Thompson combined with the twisted, enigmatic, "magnifying glass" film-making of Terry Gilliam. All of this resulting in an incredible combination for a classic masterpiece.Some people automatically reject or dislike this movie because it's about drugs. You can look at it anyway you want, but drugs have become a part of the human culture, poisoning it and at the same time evolving it. If you watch this movie without paying attention only to the heavy consumption of dangerous illegal drugs (and the effects they create), you might see what this movie is really about, at least what I think that it is about... A freak kingdom called THE U.S. of A.Merica and the very heart of it's dream... Las Vegas.Anyway, the acting is magnificent. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are perfect. Not to mention the brief performances of some other famous and talented actors... If you watched Brazil, then you're gonna love this, and if you haven't, then watch it anyway. A savage journey through the eyes of Terry Gilliam and the words of Hunter S. Thompson.Recommended for defiantly, goofy, comic, ambiguous and twisted movie watchers!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Years back I found myself hanging in the dark and dreary basement of my best friend's house. His family looked like they had came out of a time capsule from the mid 60s to early 70s. He was always my source for interesting movies and on one fateful day he said, "Wanna watch 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'?" I interrogated him for several minutes about the plot. All he could say was "Its a good movie. You'll like it." I trusted him with everything, and this was no exception. It opened with that song everyone knows and loves and then "We were somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of the dessert when the drugs began to take hold." Now, me being 12 at the time of seeing this I thought "Drugs?! My friend is showing me a movie about drugs?" but it had been too late to stop him. It had been playing for too long and I had been exposed to this warped twisted vision of Hunter S. Thompson that could only be portrayed by the vision of Terry Gilliam.Flash forward to a month ago. I find myself in the local blockbuster and I saw it. The visions came pouring back into my head. I snatched it off the shelf and darted to the cashier with my blockbuster card in hand. Minutes later I found myself in my grandmother's car and she was asking me what I had rented. "Just a movie," was my only reply. I took it home and that instant I popped it into my PS2 and my childhood had begun again. I watched it over and over, again and again. Then I called up some other friends and decided to show it to them. We were hooked.A week later I found myself in the local Borders. 8 am in the morning. I had just finished my coffee and found myself walking to the back of the store, towards the 'Journalism' section. It was staring at me. The big warped shades of Johnny Depp were staring at me! I picked it up but this time I casually walked to the cashier. I bought the book. I was hooked once again to that twisted world of HST but this time being portrayed by Ralph Steadman (sp?).I suggest EVERYONE to watch this movie. Its a great story of the dead American Dream that Gilliam brought to life and Johnny Depp did a GREAT performance of HST, not to mention Benecio Del Toro. He cracked me up. "I think I have the fear." R.I.P. HST.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not fear this movie. If you are reading this, then you are in a good place. Rest assured. Hunter S. Thompson has written some very disagreeable "things". And, as we all know, the nature of being within the "thingy-ness" of all things is evocative of the nature of the film itself and the writings of Thompson.He was a madman. He was sick. But, first and foremost he was human. And if you are reading this, so are you. You may wish you were not. You may have want for half-human, or not-at-all status. Deal with it. And go deeper into the real meaning latent within Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. If you're really ambitious and you're even starting to get used to this being-human try doing some research on the life and work of Hunter S. Thompson.Try it.

		<shortDescription>Requiem For Hunter S Thomson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"in the most godless of years, nineteen hundred and seventy one," hunter S Thomson, a sports journalist, took a trip to Las Vegas, armed with a pistol, a Cadillac, and a cornucopia of hard drugs.the memoirs of this strange journey became a best selling book, and now, a feature film.Thomson is portrayed in perfect fashion by Johnny Depp. and his lawyer, doctor Gonzo, by the great Belicio DelToro.The film, while plagued by problems, such as a third act that drags on like a dead body attached to a tricycle, is great in its own right. there are many classic moments in the film, that amalgamate into a deliciously confusing romp on 70's drug culture. the fast-paced, clever, and utterly none-sencical dialogue can only be understood to its fullest around the third viewing, so if your going to rent it, rent it when you've got the time to give it a couple viewings.READ THE BOOK! when you've read the book, especially after you watch the movie, the film takes on a whole new light. one of the hilarious points about the film is Thomsons insane, drug-fueled hallucinations, humping lizards, giant bats and fish-headed secretaries seek to give the film a strange, tripped out experience.so give it a try, if you don't like it, you probably don't get it, and if you get it but don't like it, then you where probably made fun of in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well... this is maybe the ultimate movie in which you could apply the saying; you either love it, or hate it. And I, for one, really love it! You may ask yourself, just how good can a 2 hour movie be without any plot what so ever? Well, it can be astonishing as this example clearly states.It's completely sick humor and twisted style reaches a long, long way, but then Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro adds thrust with their even sicker performances (all the little characters on the side does it's part to). Terry Gilliams fires everything in his arsenal contributing even more girth to an already pretty fat comedy... it seems this film never stops surprising me no matter how many times I see it, and I laugh till I cry every time.One last thing: I do however respect those few who totally hates it. It is fully understandable that no plot, ground-breaking-performances (disgousting might fit better) and insane direction might make you spew... but you won't forget it, no matter how hard you try...</fullReview>

Thompson. I was never a fan of Depp until I saw this movie. After getting a phone call from headquarters at the Polo Lounge, to cover a story in Las Vegas on the "Mint 400" Duke and Gonzo prepare for their trip to Las Vegas. Gathering up all the drugs and booze the can for this "ominous assignment" You could view the movie as a comedy or a drama. I myself view it as both. Even for Dope-fiends Duke and his attorney go too far. Most of their problems and fun are because they created them. The best way to describe this movie I think would be by calling it a wonderful-nightmare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anti-flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is really an anti-movie, in that it has virtually no plot, no beginning, middle, or end ... and it is mostly anarchy on the screen. Not to say it is an experimental film, because it certainly isn't that. It is essentially an inside view of an acid trip, using LOTS of acid (and coke, and weed, and lord knows what else).This movie contains my favorite performance by Gary Busey. Although it is a brief appearance, it is exquisite. Benicio Del Toro is barely recognizable but utterly amazing and of course Johhny Depp is at his off-the-hook and over-the-top peak. His Hunter Thomson character makes his Pirates of the Caribean performance look muted. Somehow, however, Depp manages to keep an element of believability in even his most flamboyant performances.From the opening lines ("No point in mentioning these bats, I thought. Poor bastard will see them soon enough.") to the final frame, this movie is purely character-driven, and with Del Toro and Depp, it works. I can certainly see that one who has not experienced the Psychedelic Sixties might hate this movie. You need a rather subversive and twisted sense of humor and an appreciation of utter anarchy along with that understanding of 60's drug culture, as well. I agree with the previous review -- this is a love it or hate it experience. I'm glad I'm in the former category, because I have had a blast each of the four times I've watched this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite simply one of the most compulsively watchable films ever made. You'll watch it time and again, and your experience will be the richer for it. Comedy moments, Philosophical insights, Manic tension, and existential crises all contribute to one of the best films of our generation.Visually and musically rich, it contains more compulsorily quotable lines than any other comedy I have seen. Depp's performance must go down as one of the best efforts at successfully emulating a real life subject on screen. Del Toro, perhaps because he had more freedom with his character, is more consistently funny. From the opening line to the finishing comments, this film is a joy to the ears and an escape for the mind. What a privilege it is to be given a film that allows you to partake in some of the funniest and craziest aspects of drug taking without risking all the downers...The DVD is extremely hard to get in the UK and is now a collector's item. I guess anyone who has this film in their DVD collection has no urge to part with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film starring Johnny Depp and Directed by Terry Gilliam is a faithful adaption of the book of the same name by the late Hunter S Thompson and a brilliant film in it's own right. The plot follows Journalist Roaul Duke (based on Thompson himself) as he covers a bike race. On his journey(to the heart of the American dream) to the race he Picks up a Samoan Attorney named Dr Gonzo (played by Benicio Del Toro and supposedly based on one of Thompsond friends). Watch out for Thompson himself in a cameo role in a dream sequence in a disco. This film dips in and out of reality, see the bats in the beginning of the film and the smoke behind the phone box that Duke (Depp) uses. If you like Depp, Thompson or Gilliam see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas This is by far the strangest film I have ever seen. And yes, I have sat through my David Lynch, my Bunuel, my Spike Jonze, and everything else. The only film that came anywhere close to being as strange as this was Mullholland Drive, and even that wasn't weirder. This film was everything to me: hilarious, disturbing, unsettling, tragic, beautiful, ugly, dumb, clever, awful, brilliant, and everything in between. I had an incredibly hard time sitting through it without getting up, and I ended up taking several breaks throughout. The film made me laugh, made me feel sick, and made me happy and sad. Never have I ever been put through such a wild trip. And I love film so much more because of it. Basically, this film has no plot, no story, no purpose and no point. It starts and ends and is filled to brim with wild drugs. Never is a character completely sober that I can remember. Or at least a main character. A strange writer and his misfit lawyer are on their way to Las Vegas from Los Angeles, the writer planning on writing a story on a motorcycle race. However, this is not the center of the picture. In fact, the race has started and ended after about twenty minutes. Everything after that is just spontaneous and plot less fun. The two characters are spun out on every single drug there is it seems (except heroin), and feel almost all of their emotions throughout. Essentially this is just a character study of two losers, and we experience what is like to be them. If that is all this is, then what is so great about it? why is it worth watching? I'm here to answer that question... this is film-making at some of it's best. The dialouge is hilarious, the direction is brilliant. Gilliam has made a colorful but difficult acid trip of a film, that glorifies and harshly depicts drug use within moments of each other. It is surreal, absolutely. Disturbing? Occasionally. Hard-tow-watch? Yes. But incredibly worth it? Definitely. Not only that, but the acting is some of the greatest acting I have ever seen. Johnny Depp gives easily his best performance, and one of my all-time favorite performances ever. Benicio Del Toro also turns in a hilarious and classic performance. He gained forty pounds for the role, and it shows. Depp never failed to amaze me throughout the whole film. He did it perfectly. The accent, the rubber-legged walking, the hilarious faces, everything, Never did I believe more that Depp was his character. Depp has possibly the most talent in the film, but Gilliam is also an absolutely outstanding director. Rarely do I ever see a better directed film than this. Kudos to you, Gilliam. Plus, there are the cameos. If somehow you get bored with the story (or lack-there-of) and characters, you can look out for tons of famous people. Look closely, you will find Spiderman, Cameron Diaz, a guy from Penn and Teller, Flea from The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Christina Ricci,Gary Busey, and a hilarious moment with Hunter S. Thompson himself (There I was...Mother of God, there I am!)And I'm sure I missed some too. Not only that, but if you watch and listen closely, there are small jokes scattered throughout, including repeated sceneries, scenes gone backward, and self-referential jokes. And considering I only saw it once, I may have missed a ton of stuff. Overall, this film is superbly made. I find this to be one of the greatest directed films I have ever said, even if the story is missing. I loved it, however, there were times when it was very hard to enjoy. I found scenes queasy and hard to stomach, not because the material was very disgusting and disturbing (though occasionally it was) but more just the way it is made. This is, of course, intentional, but every so often I had to take a break. However, I think it would be incredibly unfair to give this remarkable film a ***1/2 out of ****. So I settled with that rating, and will be giving it another viewing soon. Overall, I highly recommend it to all film buffs, and I think more than one viewing would even be great to catch everything. I shall be watching it again soon. Please, do yourself a favor, and let Gilliam and Depp amaze you with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp meeting his character, Hunter visiting the set and even having a cameo. I was blown away of how this was a real portrayal of two guys in the early 70's going to Vegas to cover a story on the dirt bike race, one being a journalist and an attorney. Then it just becomes a drug binge right from the road to sin city. I like how Depp and Del Toro got so in touch in their roles, gaining weight, character development, they look and act just like the real thing. It just shows like a quarter of the effect drugs have on you, so see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings back hot pink memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' must have something of value in it because it brought back vividly "the fear", the paranoia, the horror, the absurdity and the hideousness of American commercialism as seen through the eyes of someone who has taken himself far outside the envelope of "normal" life after ingesting some nefarious substance in a black-lit, acid green and pink motel room in some desert in the back of beyond. This movie is a one-trick pony. The incessant, jangling nightmare of life in soul-less holes like Las Vegas. Perhaps there are deeper, hidden meanings behind this story (I haven't read Thompson's book upon which this movie is based) and in time these secrets may be revealed to me. Like David Lynch movies this one is not to be "figured out" it just is what it is. Terry Gilliam has gone very far out on a limb with this one, farther than he's ever gone out before I think. He is a director that I never want to underestimate and I will have to see this movie again sometime, after I come down.I didn't laugh once. I wondered if I was supposed to laugh from time to time and was having an off day and my humor mechanism was out of order. I chuckled darkly at the fantasy scene when Thompson and Gonzo are in stripes before the judge and little Christina Ricci, done up like one of those awful Hollywood child actors (think the kid Homer Simpson (Donald Sutherland) stomps to death in 'Day of the Locust') accusing the pair of doing things to her... she didn't know what they were doing "but it was awful". Ricci, a dark elfin thing, dressed up with bows in her hair, is hilarious without even trying. The rest of the movie is a bit... dare I say... boring. Not something that I have ever experienced in a Gilliam movie.The music is reminiscent of those nervy, confused days of the late '60s when society had finally had enough of war and profiteering and Phyllis Schlafly hairdos. Gilliam captures that ineffably garish and tacky time period, the early '70s, perfectly, and in the most nightmarish place on earth... 'Vegas.The great entertaiment value of this movie is the amazing, wide-ranging antic performance of Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo. He is all Three Stooges wrapped up in one body, a very funny, even brilliant performance. For once Johnny Depp is over- shadowed, as good as he is as Hunter Thompson. The movie is full of cameos by some wonderful character actors who often have only one or two mundane lines. Katherine Helmond, Harry Dean Stanton and Lyle Lovett flash by. I was very happy to see wonderful Ellen Barkin on the screen again. She has a rather moving scene in a down-at-heel diner in North Las Vegas, making me want to go back and watch her movies from the '80s. Why isn't she working all the time in films?!!Top honors go to the set designers and cinematographer. Not a very clever film and hardly a comedy, more like a slapstick farce with heavy drugs, but I expect I will have recurring flashbacks from it for a long to time come. But all in all, kind of a bad trip. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't the kind of movie I usually like. I was flipping through the channels one night and just happened on it. I was hooked quite quickly. It's bizare, twisted and gritty. And completely wonderful.Johnny Depp was great as Duke. He can do quirky characters better than almost any actor out there.Benicio Del Toro is a close second and does an excellent job as Dr. Gonzo.I hardly recognized either of them, and I know that was more to do with the acting than the make-up! (Johnny Depp bald---shudder!!!)I thought all the extras were good.This is a movie to make you think, laugh (in a twisted sort of way!), and cry.Great movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of the best films that i have seen. it was well written, well directed, and it is just a crazy movie. the only thing that got me a little mad was the fact that they left out scenes that were in the book. they weren't necessary, but they would have helped bring the movie together more, in my opinion. Jhonny Depp did a great job portraying Raul Duke, he was just as i pictured him when i read the book. Benicio Del Torro played a great role as Dr. Gonzo, although i thought that Gonzo would be a little bit shadier. i would recommend this film to anyone who isn't close minded, and anyone who likes to have a good time. The Criotien collection is the best version. it has many commentaries, and it also has great interviews with Hunter Thompson himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Depp &amp; Del Toro...does it get any better than that these days honestly? This film is an exact rendition of the book written by Hunter S. Thompson so Terry Gilliam deserves a lot of credit here.The first few times I saw this movie a couple years back, I got some good laughs out of it and knew it was a good movie, but I didn't put much thought into it. Once I really started watching, then I began to pick up on a lot of the twists and the complexity of the storyline. I think this movie really shows the audience the funny side of drugs and in the end the comedic part of the 60's &amp; 70's. It may take the viewer a few times watching it to really understand and appreciate the story. However, it is well worth the time in front of the television screen.Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas is definitely in my top 10 favorite movies. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, considering Bill Murray in Where the Buffalo Roam was a flop I thought this movie actually brought more. Johnny Depp by far is the best actor for this role and the fact that he actually studied Hunter S. Thompson to the full extent is even more applauding, I mean he actually went and lived with him. Del Toro also does a great job in his role, the movie is actually hilarious, I have seen it over 10 times and could still watch it at any moment. Every time I watch it I understand it more, it's definitely a movie you can't watch just once. But that's a good quality in a movie, especially if you like movies of this nature.Don't knock it if you don't fully understand it, watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An astounding feat to capture the essence of Hunter S. Thompson on film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two books that I've felt were so groundbreaking that I've purchased numerous copies to give away to friends and acquaintances who for some reason or another have never been exposed - 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is one of them. ('Neuromancer' is the other) Over the past twenty years I've probably given away six or eight copies of 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas', always asking the recipient to pass it along to someone else when finished. It's a watershed book that invents new rules after breaking all the old ones. HST is a unique individual and nobody else writes like he does.As far as I'm concerned, Terry Gilliam and Johnny Depp were not only the logical choices for this movie but they may have been the -only- people that could have pulled it off. Depp's uncanny ear perfectly captures Thompson's sound and yet he manages to inhabit the character, not just perform a cheap imitation. Gilliam's dreamlike visual style is perfectly suited for the (well drugged) first person perspective of Raoul Duke. While Terry's loose storytelling may feel like he's lost the reins of the narrative, instead he manages to perfectly capture the out-of-control joyride that is Thompson's trademark writing style.That said - go buy and read the book. While the movie is a wonderful translation, going back to the original source is well worth the trip!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...trying to make the average film viewer see a diamond in the rough.For the record, it nearly killed me to sit through this movie the first time, and I haven't even had the stomach, or the correct amount of alcohol, to be driven to watch it again, but by no means does that mean that a movie is crap.Fear And Loathing isn't just another Cheech and Chong for those into more hard core poisons. If you look at it closely, without passing judgements so hastily, a number of bright spots will surface.For one, this a cinematographic masterpiece. The swirling patterns in the carpet, the plague of bats, and the scenes in the carousel bar all add to feelings of nausea, extreme paranoia, and lack of control, forcing the viewer to jump into the story and experience the drug-induced dazes of Raoul and the good doctor. To take a two-dimensional medium and make it seem 3-d is no easy feat, and it only serves to further prove my point that this isn't as horrific as people make it out to be.The humor in this film isn't the norm for a "stoner flick", but is of an intelligent nature. It's biting and it's sarcastic. It doesn't just jump out and bite you; you have to look hard for it. Seeing as the current zeitgeist thinks that crap like Scary Movie is hilarious just goes to show that the film itself doesn't lack substance, only the viewer.Finally, you have to look carefully at some of Raoul Duke's voice over commentary. Johnny Depp is notorious for picking off beat roles, but he has yet to pick a bad one, and his character here is no exception. Instead of simply reading lines and stage directions, he really sees through to the truth locked in the subtext of this part. Why don't you move your mouses over to the "memorable quotes" part of this site and paruse the lines in reference to San Francisco in the 60s. The profound beauty in these slurred words is such a surprise in this film; after wanting to yank out your hairs one by one, you are forced to stop and say..."Wow, that was really good".So please, take another look at this piece and see it for what it was intened,not for what the critical masses dictate it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, play two of Hunter S. Thompson's best characters in a movie about two men who leave California to wreak havoc on Las Vegas. Every turn of this movie brings constant hysteria. The drugs, the music, the cameos. It is one of the most unbelievable stories ever written. The massive amounts of drugs consumed, the heaps of rubbish that were once hotel rooms and the underlying severity of it all is just too insane to be real. But with Johnny and Benicio's A+++ performances, you don't see the movie as fiction, you see it as grade A truth. Johnny Depp is as you have never seen him before. With his shaved head, short shorts and acapulco shirts, he is somewhat desirable in a charming drug addict sort of way. Benicio with his 40lb gut and 70's wave hair is the antithesis of any attorney. However, the two together make this movie an unforgettable thrill ride, that should be rode by all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely not a movie for everyone. If you like to go to the cinema and enjoy your experience this does that. But if you don't want to look at the underlying themes of what you are watching, this is defintely a movie that is not for you.Set against the backdrop of the early seventies this movie might come off as a drug-romp of a movie where the characters are whacked and not intelligent in the least. In fact this is probably one of the most intelligent films I have ever seen. It comments on why peaceful demonstations in the late '60s eventually erupted into violence and why the "hippie" movement didn't work. It is actually more of an anti-drug movie than it is a pro-drug movie.The main characters at that were respected and admired men (Hunter S. Thompson and Oscar Zeta Acosta)though you might not think that when you first watch the film. Their "alter-egos" Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo are searching for the American Dream only to realize that in the midst of war and a president that had lied to the American people that it is in fact dead. But it also points the finger back at the hippies who thought they were right in trying to find peace and understanding"for only 3 bucks a hit."But not only do I recommend you watch it but after that go out and read the book and study up on Mr. Thompson and Mr. Acosta. They are truly geniune and fascinating people who's shadow looms over this movie.This isn't a normal "drug" movie. Take away what you can from it.Defintely 9 out of 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What do you get when you put a schizophrenic lawyer and an instable journalist in a hired car on the road to Las Vegas with a truckload full of all sorts of drugs known to the human kind since 1544?Exactly, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas! Duke, played by the always glorious Johnny Depp, and Gonzo, played by Benicio Del Toro, steal the show with this delirium of a film. Two guys with a head full of drugs searching for the American Dream, as how they put it, and breaking almost every law known in Las Vegas. Not exactly a nice movie for the whole family on a lost Thursday night. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of those movies you like, or hate.Maybe that's the power of this kind of movies. Eventually, you'll find more people who appreciate it than hate it. The humor is recognizable and therefore hilarious. People can't simply neglect the simplistic brilliance of this movie. It's genius is hidden beneath the rough and chaotic story, that on his own way is trying to mislead the viewer with two clowns of characters who seem to be simply tripping their way through two hours of film. I say, look closer and be amazed by the subtileties and recognizable situations that carry this movie.Director Terry Gilliam has really done a brilliant job with this movie. All the time you feel like you are there to, also with a head packed with drugs. It is filmed on that way that you can't watch this movie like the normal film fan, but rather as one of those guys, totally under influence, standing on the sideline and watching it all happen. This takes quality, to summon a feeling by the viewer so that he actually thinks he is part of this film. Watch Fear and Loathing a couple of times and it will become drugs to you. It will stay with you like it is one of your own memories.Fear and Loathing is definitely one of my favorites! A film representing finally something different. Another side of society hilarious brought to the screen, with a wink! But it is indeed a delirium, and not everybody will be impressed by it like I was. Just see it, though. Take the trip and enjoy the ride!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The adventure of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" starts some where around Barstow, Californian before the drugs kick in. Then quickly moves to the wild, high energy moments in the adult playground of Las Vegas in the early 70s. The scene is very inviting for the likes of drug induced rebels Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp's Hunter S. Thompson-inspired persona) and Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro's). The free-spirited drug fiend professionals, Duke a reporter and Gonzo his attorney, head to Vegas via Los Angeles in the red convertible (the red shark) to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race, and their very ironic side assignment on the prevention against drug abuse. But the movie sidetracks itself as these two go off in search of the American dream. This whole scenario is the start of Duke's and Gonzo's seaming aimless existence as they wander around stoned, ripped, and twisted. The drug laden effects begin take their toll upon our substance abusers. Imaginary and metaphorical images start to parade around them in horrific fashion.The film's notion for a conceptual freak show of psychedelic drug seeking and absolute lawless freedom played rather well, given the idea style of Thompson's anti hero insubordinance. But the playful spirit of Hunter S. Thompson with his drug induced, happy-hellish state of mind or his material is too challenging for director Terry Gilliam, a former Monty Python comic to capture. Best known for his bizarre film "12 Monkeys", Gilliam's main key points in past directorial efforts was his tendency to waver from one extreme visual cue to another. The film is shot with extreme wide-angle lenses that greatly distort the reality on screen. Thompson, however, didn't just want emphasize the distortion of reality. He also wanted us to see the world through his eyes. All we really get in this film is the distortion. It well take more than Depp's guise of a bald head, over sized sunglasses, bright flowered shirts, and his cigarette holder sticking out of his mouth, to help convey the compulsive and extreme amorality of Thompson's tainted tendency.Despite all that is lost in translation from book to film "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is a great movie, albeit not for the faint at heart. It is a great way to start off in the mind blowing, bizarre, insane madness literary works of Hunter S. Thompson. So grab a suitcase full of mind bending pharmaceuticals and a galaxy of multi color uppers and downers, and find that American dream. "Buy the ticket. Take the ride!"</fullReview>

It's all based on the book, and Thompson himself. Overall, the movie's plot changes as you get further in.This is an acurate portrayal of the story as it happened. From his voice to the yellow cigarette holder, Johnny Depp IS Hunter S. Thompson.Aside from the great storytelling, this movie takes you on a ride, and is unique from the same weird-crazy you find in David Lynch films.Also, the leads aren't SUPPOSED to be pretty, so it's natural that they have hair styles that are to your distaste.

		<fullReview>First off, I'm not a druggie, and I haven't touched alcohol for about 6 months now. So I'm about as clean as you can get. I still liked the movie (mostly).If you're looking for a normal comedy movie, don't watch this. Terry Gilliam is the Producer, yes, but think "12 Monkeys", not "Monty Python". Just look at the title, it's "fear and loathing", not "silly walks".There are different ideas about what this movie is about. Some say a drug experience, some say the "American Dream", some say the failure of the ideals of the sixties. I think it's all of this. Terry Gilliam isn't one to stick with just one interpretation. Some say you have to read the book to "get it", and maybe you do, I haven't. But the movie stands on it's own.Let's rewind to the Monty Python days. Terry made all these incredibly funny animations, including the famous foot. But why were they funny? What did they mean? I can imagine how the other Pythons must have looked, when Terry told them about his ideas. "Yeah, then I'll draw a typical normal man, nice haircut. Then he smiles broadly, and he has white teeth, like a toothpaste commercial. But then, get this, his teeth starts moving up and down, like a piano, with a nice little tune in the background!". In Monty Python, the aim was comedy, but it was not simple straightforward comedy, and that's what made it great. "Fear and loathing" is not straight comedy either, if it is comedy at all. But I think it works anyway. I felt entertained all the way through, I don't know why. Sometimes it would make me think about different ideas. Sometimes I was just curious to see what the pair would do next, and if they would actually get away with it. And that's enough for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's another point that needs to be made about this movie that may clear up some of it's meaning. Fear and Loathing is as much about HST's disgust with the end of the 60's movement, and his impression that the same people who professed to want freedom and peace above all had begun to "sell out" their ideals for safe jobs, secure futures, and material possessions. Sure it's about a drug filled weekend in Las Vegas, but the subtext for a lot of what they do in the movie is one last attempt to enjoy unrestrained behavior, before the entire world became too restrictive and too willing to trade in their freedoms in exchange for a perceived increase in security and a desire for material goods.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare to find a movie that really IS a full-throttle ride from beginning to end, even among those genres ('action', for instance) who constantly claim to be just that. On the surface, this would look like a low-key road trip, just another piece of Cheech &amp; Chong harmless drug comedy. What you get is a surreal, sublime, even scary rocket sled ride through naked Americana.The complaints in the reviews section castigating this film for being short on plot are missing the point. This isn't a carefully-crafted, linear story. This is the addled recollection of a 72-hour drug feast, which the author himself admits he's not sure how much of it actually happened. You shouldn't go into this film looking for a PLOT. Go into it looking for an experience you can't get with any other film.Another group of point-missers are those reviewers who complain about the lack of comedy. You want drug comedy, go see Cheech and Chong. This isn't a comedy. The funny parts in this film are there by accident, set into motion by the brain-fried protagonists' attempts to function in their condition. They journey to the apogee of American excess, Las Vegas, and demonstrate just how crazed we all are - so crazed that two dangerous, insanely-high sociopaths can blend right into the crowd. This is ugly reality, based on a real event. There are no good guys and no bad guys.The movie never apologizes for the main characters' behavior. As viewers, we're not there to try to understand them, just to see the world through their dilated pupils. Maybe the mirror they hold up IS a little warped, but not so much that we can't recognize what we're seeing in it.I read the book before I saw the movie, and I was convinced that there was no way short of Ralph Bakshi animation that it could ever be made into a passable movie - the imagery was just too bizarre. Gilliam, Depp and Del Toro knocked me off my chair with this incredible interpretation. I don't often rate anything a perfect 10, but I really don't know how they could have done this one any better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, i must say that this indeed is one of those movies that only gets better and better each time i see it! And all those details, worth watching already just to see the face of Johnny Depp when he gets high on some weird human organ... Truly with alot of drug-knowledge and black humour made, and one of my favourite films! Extremely funny and entertaining. Warning though for all those that despite drugs, since you really have to have quite an objective view for that to find this movie fun...Enjoy watching it, i recommend from all of my heart!8/10 stars, definitely if not 9!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've both seen the movie and read the book. Far and away, the book is superior. It has much more detail; more plot to the story; the constant narration of Hunter S. Thompson (NOTHING beats that); the actual thoughts and feelings of Thompson, rather than simply portraying him as an all-powerful, super-cool drug guru. Still, the movie is entertaining, if for not much more than the pleasure of watching Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro act high out of their minds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good try, but no dice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sticks close to the book in terms of screenplay and script, probably in part because author Hunter S. Thompson demanded it. But whereas the book is brilliant and laugh-out-loud hilarious, the movie falls far short. Part of the reason is that although we get almost-verbatim dialogue lifted from the book, we don't get much of the introspection and narration that made it a coherent whole. This makes the storyline of the movie come across as a hard-to-follow mess. The actors mis-emphasize their lines and often speak too quickly, mumbling and/or screaming much of the time, making it even more difficult to follow unless you know the book inside-out. And if you know the book well, there really isn't much new here that makes this half-cocked film version worthwhile.Some of the visual aspects of the film are clever and well crafted, but in the absence of a sensible plot or purpose, it all seems rather hollow. Also, Johnny Depp (an actor I usually enjoy) plays the main character almost as a bumbling, perplexed moron, rather than as the witty, sharp-tongued dynamo that makes the book so enjoyable. The final verdict: a noble effort to translate an excellent story to for the screen, but ultimately a failed one. Read the book instead.</fullReview>

The true beauty of this film, though, is that rather than being a film that is a failure after reading the amazing book, it lives up to and exceeds any expectation that a fan of Thompson's writing could ever have had. Both the lead and supporting actors go above and beyond the call of duty in this one. I will eagerly be anticipating the next adaptation of Thompson's work, "The Rum Diary." Fear and Loathing was by far my favorite movie of all time, and despite conventional wisdom, I didn't even have to do drugs to appreciate the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and loathing as a novel was loved and despised in seemingly equal measures by all who read it and how fitting that the film follows it's source material so faithfully. The movie, directed by the genius who is Terry Gilliam (Time Bandits, Baron Munchausen), is a truly bizarre piece of cinema. Based on the novel by Hunter S. Thompson and loosely describing the events 'enjoyed' in his colourful life the film documents Raoul Duke (Depp), as a drug crazed lunatic of a journalist, and his 'lawyer' Dr. Gonzo (Del Toro) as they spend a fateful few days in Las Vegas. Inevitably their journey soon becomes a massive drugs binge and reality is lost.Both the direction and the acting (Depp is awesome in the lead role and Del Toro is bizarre beyond description) are superb and the script is genuinely hilarious. Unusual camera angles, a brilliant soundtrack (Jefferson Airplane, Three Dog Night, Dead Kennedys) and truly weird events, each more strange than the last, convey the madness of mass drug intake superbly creating a very funny if confusing film. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bizarre and hilarious, a great adaptation of a classic novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is the Terry Gilliam film adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's classic autobiography of sorts. The novel is written in hallucinatory first person form that is still literate but at times plain weird and often hilarious. The challenge for screenwriters Terry Gilliam and Tony Grisoni, as well as Terry Gilliam as a director was to take this unusual narrative form and turn it into a film that makes sense. And they did it with flying colors.Taking center stage of the story is Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp), a journalist in the 1970's who gets the assignment to cover a motorcycle race in Las Vegas. Along for the ride is his warped out and sometimes psychotic attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro). They rent an apple red convertible in LA in order to make the road trip, and in the trunk pack a LOT of drugs. The plot of the film is rather complicated to objectively explain, sufficient to say the film follows these two oddball characters stoned through out Vegas, trying to make sense of what is going on while on drugs and trying to get to the heart of the American Dream.One of the most important things for a film that deals with drugs in the manner 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' does is the visual look. Since the audience is often placed in the shoes of Duke, either through what is happening to him or his narration, they too have to see the effects of the drugs. Director of photography Nicola Pecorini, editor Lesley Walker, and production designer Alex McDowell do a fantastic job capturing the feeling of 70s Vegas through the stoned eyes of the main character. Memorable visuals are layered through out, such as a classic scene in a hotel lobby involving a bunch of large reptiles. There are also many scenes in the Duke's suite that are filled with crazy vibes as the two slowly lose control of what is going on. Another film about drugs that uses its visual technique extremely well is 'Requiem for a Dream', although 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is comparatively much lighter.Terry Gilliam has the pleasure of assembling two top notch actors and both deliver fine performances. Johnny Depp, as usual, goes into his chameleon mode and never fails to amuse as wise cracking Duke. Del Toro adds a scary, sometimes masochistic atmosphere as attorney Dr. Gonoz, and the film is filled with great cameos from the likes of Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz, and Christina Ricci. The screenplay allows for their dialogue to flow beautifully, adding a lot of hilarity and at the same time maintaining the crazy atmosphere of Thompson's hippie novel. As a director, Gilliam has an inspired visual flair that helps add to the quirky story. His great team of visual stylists are used perfectly, and the film has a constant rhythm and momentum to it that stays together the whole way through. Despite the fact that the second half is darker than the first, Gilliam still manages to hold everything together.The one flaw of 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is that while the novel, despite its large comedic overtones, strives for something a little deeper. It attempted to really find the meaning of the American Dream, and to dissect the significance of the trip. The film seems to pass this over for more entertaining purposes, and while this doesn't significantly diminish the film's quality, it is still noticeable.Through its subliminal performances, skilled film-making, and great visual technique 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' becomes a very memorable experience. It is a showcase of some top notch talent and while it could have failed in many places, Gilliam and co. are able to hold it together. A very good adaptation of a very good novel.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a testament to the adaptation of a book to film. The mood in Thompson's book is strange and foreign to most, and very difficult to visualize, this film however, made it utterly believable. The film and characters are spot on, and nearly all of the important elements of the book made it in, even some of the most depraved and twisted parts. Johnny Depp is wonderful as Thompson, andthis is more apparent when you see film of Thompson himself. Depp got thesmallest mannerism down pat. The only shortcoming of this film may be that the grand realizations that were present in the book weren't adequately represented in the film. The only instance of this is the part in the first hotel room after Dr. Gonzo's acid freak-out when the montage of the 60's is shown. Other than that, nothing really summed up the scenes and one could view this film as a bunch of incidents of one long drug binge depicted sequentially, with no real plot. The film does have a plot and an important one, but it is a little more buried than it should be.</fullReview>

At first glance his words appear to be the product of a man teetering on the edge of madness. We follow a trail that gets weirder and weirder, expecting a journey straight into the nuthouse. At every turn we're shocked to discover ourselves inside a prism of crystaline sanity and "common sense." The drugs are Thomspson's clever ruse, the Fool's charter.

		<fullReview>When I had first gotten the Criterion Collection DVD of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas I was a bit skeptical a first, but once I popped it in all that changed. This movie is definately a keeper. It is one of the best drug movies I have seen in a long time (why do the best drug films have Johnny Depp and/or Benicio Del Toro? ie. Traffic, Blow, and now... Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas). Based on the original book by Hunter S. Thompson it truly lives up to it. This movie screams cult classic. The movie's plot (Which is ridiculously hard to follow at times) revolves around the glammorish yet trashy streets of Las Vegas in 1971. Writer Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo(Benicio Del Toro)have to travel to Las Vegas to cover a story about a motorcycle race. Thats when they decide to take advantage of the situation and live out their own version of the "American Dream". Armed with a convertible and a briefcase full of every drug imaginable they go on a binge on the rollercoaster that is Las Vegas. The drug scenes is this movie are increadible, it almost makes you feel as if you yourself are tripping out with them. They throw a barrage of wierd noises, hallucinations, and camera effects and it creates a teeth gritting expirience. If this movie has any weakness is that sometimes it seems too unbelievable when it looks like they have almost no consequences for their actions. The movie is also one of those where you either love it or hate it. But besides that its a grim look into America's drug culture that seems to have a dark sense of humor. This movie is a must see... It stands proudly in my collection.</fullReview>

The film, to save space and time, tries to cut through all the b.s. and superficial 'dung-heap' other intellectuals try to cram down an audience's throat.The key, the answer to all this weirdness we see in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is that there is no truth; everybody tries to be like everybody else, everybody seemingly decent that is, and nobody is really being themselves.The 'tripping on drugs' scenes only 'enhance' our perceptions of how we mistakenly perceive human life.Cameos include Lyle Lovett, Ellen Barkin, Gary Busey, Katherine Hellmond, Lorraine Newman and Cameron Diaz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I'm a big fan, for the most part, of Terry's movies and Hunter's books. So without question, I absolutely loved this film adaptation.Terry managed to make a (reasonably) sensible recreation of a classic 70's hallucinogenic stream-of-consciousness social commentary. If you liked the film version of "Naked Lunch," then you'll like this movie.Johnny Depp does a remarkable job of transforming himself into Hunter S. Thompson, and Benicio Del Toro is equally as deft in his role as the "possibly Samoan" attorney. Great cameos add to the surreal feel of this film.The crew was not allowed to film anywhere near the original hotels because of the havoc that Hunter wrecked almost 40 years ago, so Gilliom had to recreate these sites in his way. The result is even better than using the original sites.Not a movie for everyone, but if you came out of "Trainspotting" needing a beer and a cigarette, you'll enjoy this flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an easy masterpiece in the making. Directed by Terry Gilliam who made other remarkable films like 12 Monkeys, Brazil, and the Monty Python series, comes my favorite of his, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. One of my favorite things about this film is the comedy of it. The fact that they are high off of almost every drug I can think of, makes it more merrier than I could have imagined.The film starts out with Raoul Duke (Depp), and Benicio Del Toro (Gonzo), already high. When they make their way to Las Vegas to take notes on the Mint 400, a race.The fact that they don't have any clue what they're doing half of the time, is the reason why its so crazy. Its all out fun when they trash various hotel rooms, visit landmarks and places, like a circus. And get pulled over by a lonely highway cop.Based in the 70s, this film has older style of rock, which fits the mood perfectly. If you want a hilarious, yet good movie to watch, I highly suggest Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sheesh, This movie could only have been reviewed by hoards of Homeward Bound loving maniacs flaunting senior citizens cards. For younger crowds, Gen Xers, and the baby boomers of the eighties this movie rocks. Aside from the harsh drug induced reality that the characters sweep through this movie has a lot of underlying thoughts and motives. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro aren't mindless drug fiends from the 70's, as someone put it on the message board they're men from another time. Just two guys out of millions that never left the 60's behind. The story does start and end rather curiously but the plot is as solid as oak and for the life of me i can not see why my parents and half the reviewers on here couldn't figure any of it out. Great special effects, awesome acting and a solid screenplay allow the innerworkings of two men to be unwound in front of you and a touch of humour help to ease you in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was never really understand by many people. Most didn't saw that the movie wasn't about some guys using ALOT of drugs and doing weird things. It's about a man who would have wanted to stay in the 60's for ever. This didn't happen and he wounded up in the 70's. A time he couldn't identify himself with. He travel's to Las Vegas with his lawyer and a huge amount of drugs to cover a motor race. The movie is based on the non fictional book from Hunter S Thompson. Thompson was Raoul Duke. Most things really happened. Thompson was a gonzo journalist.I even saw this movie on the Christian Church list of forbidden movie's. Why ?? Because it could provoke people to use drugs ?? Then just look at the movie again. Thompson himself said: You can get much higher without drugs than with them. I didn't understand it either for that matter".Drugs was his way to run from it. Run from what you might ask. Run from the American Dream. A subject not totally covered within the movie but is central in the book. The American Dream represented in Las Vegas was going there with a few hundred dollars and leave rich. The dream that everyone could get to the top. The top of what? This world turns on one word: Respect. Everyone wants it but only some deserve it. The American Dream was to get Respect without giving respect to others. The way of winning in a stale Las Vegas casino and going home rich and respected. After the 60's this world went to hell. You can see it everywhere. Socialists are almost extinct. Thompson understood that and he couldn't cope with it. He used drugs to deal with it but at the same time he got into the main nerve. A merry go around in the Bazooka Circus, what he earlier described as the Sixt Reich. He wanted the worst first making it easier to cope with the rest.I myself as a 1985 born never knew what the 60's really was about. I saw the Woodstock '69 movie, I listen to Jefferson Airplain, Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd, but this book and movie made me realize what it was about.People fighting for believes they had, not in a military way. Their energy would prevail. They had set up a new religion. A one of peace, inspired by musicians and drugs. Though the new religion wave didn't made it and rolled back, resulting in this movie.K, enough for the philosophic talk, I could go on with that for hours. Let's talk about the movie. The movie is a very good adaptation from the book. Every word said in the movie is taken literally from the book. However not in the same order. This makes the movie a different story, les philosophical but still with some great points in it. It's the way Thompson would have wanted to do the trip. That would be his ideal book instead of the book he wrote which was the way it actually happened.Johny Depp puts on the strongest role in his career. The way he walks, talks, smokes, acts. It just makes you believe this is a real drug frenzy. Along next to him is Benicio del Toro the fat lawyer, coming in a good second place for best actor. Both where connected with each other. Together they where one. The drug related images where perfectly done. No one had ever before made such a real representation of a drug trip.Together along this movie is something different. A film which I can see every week just to enjoy the acting of Depp and the beautiful quote's from Hunter S Thompson.Check it out, but remember to look past it's outer shape and into the real meaning of the movie. You'll be surprised...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The drug-infested trip to Las Vegas by Raoul Duke and his pseudo-Samoan attorney Dr Gonzo just cracks me up so much. Armed with acapulco-shirts, a convertible and a bag filled with every imaginable psychadelic drug known to man, they head for Los Angeles to find the American dream. And to do drugs, lots of drugs.I guess this film appeals to people with a certain kind of humour. The complete madness and irresponsibility of these two bastards is portrayed in a hilarious and brilliant way. Acting by Del Toro and Johnny Depp could not been better, and the small parts played by people like Penn &amp; Teller, Cameron Diaz, Lyle Lovett, Gary Busey and Tobey Maguire are great. The sets and authenticity are brilliant and the details are made for watching the film again. Also the musical-score for the film is really nice, ranging from Tom Jones to Rolling Stones and Buffalo Springfield. It provides the perfect background for the whole mood of the film.Actually I wasnt thrilled the first time I saw this film, but after another watching I realized this is pure brilliance. Anyone who appreciates the humour of this film is a friend of mine..I guess the only bad thing about it is that it kinda makes me interested in exploring the contents of that brown bag of the Duke...Well anyway, go watch now !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this movie was a number of things. It was funny, creepy, sometimes pretty gross, and entertaining. I really liked this movie. Over the last few movies of Johnny Depp's that I have watched, I can see that he has a very good acting talent. He has been in several movies that I have enjoyed (mainly this, Sleepy Hollow, and Edward Scissorhands). This one is probably my favorite of his, though. For a comedy, there is very high quality acting. Besides Depp, there is Benicio Del Toro, who has been in a few movies I have enjoyed. I thought that he was very good. Both Depp and Del Toro were hysterical. They were very believable when they were stoned, or tripping, or high, or drunk, usually it was a combination of all four, though. Some of the computer graphics were funny, like when Depp is talking to the desk clerk at the hotel and she turns into an electric eel.This is absolutely not for everyone. In fact, it took me a couple of movies times to warm up to this movie. It is extraordinarily weird, because there is not one minute in this movie where Hunter Thompson and his attorney are not on drugs, and they see and do some pretty strange and unusual stuff. There are a lot of big names doing cameos in this movie, as well. I also liked how they played 'Jumpin' Jack Flash' at the end of the movie; which is kind of funny because all of the drugs that were taken throughout the time frame in this movie were taken in one recording session by the Rolling Stones while making this cool song. Weird, funny, not for everyone, actually, not for most. Enjoy! 10/10</fullReview>

If there ever was an anti-drug, it could quite possibly be this movie. The nonstop use and the mood swings of these two make you want to never even touch it.

		<shortDescription>Frustrating but entertaining and interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" has a lot of brilliant ideas, but they are usually developed poorly to the extent that they are easy to misinterpret and muddle.  This doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. In fact, I found it, at times, fascinating. Terry Gilliam crafts the story as one long acid trip with no story. This may sound annoying, but it really isn't. There is an unpredictable wonder about "Fear and Loathing" that makes it so winning. Johnny Depp gives an often hilarious performance as Raul Duke, an author who goes to Las Vegas only to be absorbed in every drug imaginable. His "attourney", Dr. Gonzo (an interesting character who I have theories about), acts as a conscience of Duke. A conscience whose morals are cast aside due to drug usage. Based on the novel, "Fear and Loathing" gives an insight on culture in the 1960's, mostly commentary on an its odd society. Displayed are the Americans who abuse substance (Raul uses the American flag to absorb Ether for inhaling in one scene), the opposite-the ambicious who will always "win the race", the dehumanization in form of one taking advantage of another that took place in this era. After viewing this film, there is a lot to digest and plenty to discuss. This is one of the strongest things about the film, although it does cross my line of "too bizarre" in some scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining, but only for those whom have read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without the political and social comments, which drove Hunter S. Thompson's book, the movie lacks any real structure and eventual resolution. Although the movie does portray the drug culture in a surreal and often characterised style, it is entertaining to watch and is perfectly tailored to Thompson's insane interpretations of Las Vegas and the 1970s counterculture and post Anti Vietnam War era. However, although director Terry Gilliam did attempt to incorporate the theme of the American Dream into the plot and narratives (primarily by constantly displaying the American flag all over the camera) it is obvious that the drug dazed Johnny Depp and Psychotic Benicio Del Toro, are far more entertaining for the average popcorn eating bubble head who's p***ed off about paying $14.50 for a ticket. Yes, there is no plot. Yes, the entire movie centres around acid crazes, over flowing bathtubs and grapefruits. Yes, for once Johnny Depp was not particularly attractive, sporting pink sunglasses, a Hawaiian shirt and a hairless head. Yes, I enjoy watching this movie until my eyeballs popped out of their sockets at six thirty on a Wednesday morning, just because I can't get enough of the neon lights and circus freaks. Yes, this movie is only understandable if you have read the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange trip to Vega$ through the mind of Hunter S. Thompson</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't know it already, this is a weird movie. There is not so much of a plot as there is a crazy adventure to follow. Adapted from Hunter S. Thompson's book, we follow Hunter and his buddy, Dr. Gonzo as they cruise into Vega$ to cover a dirt bike race only to disregard the race and end up doing as many drugs as they can sink their hooks into. If you just sit back and watch this without worrying about conventions of plot, acting, common sense, etc, you should have some fun. Highlights are the various tripped out scenes that alledgedly capture an acid trip. Now you folks will have to figure that out if that's the case for yourself as the strongest thing I've put into my body has been a cold Pabst Blue Ribbon at the Port Beverage House in Kenosha. The lowlights are the very disgusting scenes of what doing too many drugs will do to you. And I must tip my hat to Del Torro for his beer gut. It's the best beer belly since DeNiro porked up in Raging Bull. This movie is not a classic work of art, just a goofy flick that you'll get some chuckles out of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Impossible Film Made Possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" when I was 16, just barely old enough to not be completely corrupted by the book. The book is a simutaneously hilarious and horrifying read. Now, almost 20 years and one heart attack later, I 've lost some of my sense of immortality and find the book slightly more horrifying than hilarious. Nonetheless, a fascinating read providing a journey to a time and a place and a culture long gone.Terry Gilliam's film is very faithful to the book and nicely captures not only the hellbent-for-self-destruction antics of Thompson and his frightening attorney, but it also captures the very essence of early-1970s Las Vegas. Typical of Gilliam's films, the production design is astounding. Actor Johnny Depp's portrayal of Thompson is as accurate as it is funny - a considerable feat considering the fact that Thompson himself was on the set, coaching and observing the actor's portrayal. If you've read the book, you know that Thompson is a man you don't want to upset.The problem I had with the movie is that...well, it's almost too faithful to the book. When you read the book, the print is clear and clean, and you miss not a single horrifying/hilarious detail. However, the movie is hyper-realistic in that the drug-addled main characters speak in slurred mumbles and grunts...much the way you would expect someone to do after consuming an entire pharmacy's worth of drugs. One of my favorite scenes from the book is when Thompson finds his attorney in the hotel room's bathtub, listening to Jefferson Airplane....the dialog between the two is darkly hysterical. When watching the movie, it helps to have certain passages of the book memorized (as many people do) so that you can understand the dialog. I'm not sure if the sound is poorly recorded, poorly mixed, or just deliberately muddy, but the main characters are often difficult to understand. I'm sure the movie is almost exactly as the events described happened, but the genius of Thompson's writing is his ability to recount the events in clear detail. Ironically, the book is a sharp photograph while the movie is a fuzzy memory.This is another "2% of the population movie" (see my review for "1941"). It's definitely not for everyone. Fans of the book will enjoy seeing the fear and loathing brought to vivid life, and despite some technical problems, some parts of the film are very amusing. If you've never read the book or seen the movie, you could take two approaches. You could read the book so that you can better understand what is happening in the movie, or you could watch the movie and then read the book to find out what was going on. In either case, the film needs the book more than the book needs the film.</fullReview>

This movie has some many layers, symbolism, meaning, and genius that it is hard to believe that this is only a movie. This movie is pure art and Gilliam new that not many would understand it but the people that did would be most appreciative of his achievement.God bless Depp, Benicio, Gilliam, and of course Thompson for making this movie possible because it shows that hollywood still has some balls.1000/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant trip through the eyes of a stoned journalist and his lawyer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this film I have to admit that I thought it was mediocre and ill-thought it. However, I now wish I'd never said those embarrassing words because I've come to realise that Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas is a truly fantastic film and is one of my undoubted favorites - everything in it is marvelous and visibly well thought out.To begin with, the slapstick attitude and incredibly whacky and wiiiiide camera angles show that this film is a comedy - a great comedy at that. However, what people often fail to realise is that underneath all the clich's and well thought out jokes there is actually a serious message that drugs can and will mess you up. I don't want to sound like an anti-drugs activist because I'm writing to offer an objective opinion, but this is genuinely the message that the film evokes. Also, let us not forget that this film is modeled on a true story on the accounts of writer Hunter S Thompson himself and a few directing differences aside this film is exactly like the book; whity, informative, watchable hundreds of times, enjoyable and thought provoking.In my opinion Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro put in two absolutely faultless lead displays showing imaginative and well thought out acting considering the drug induced circumstances of their roles. I cannot fault them for their displays of quite literally crazyness when they're stoned and how they go about in a drug users world whilst trying to get their work done at the same time. To be honest, the acting as a whole is faultless save a few minor poor displays by mediocre characters who, thankfully, only have bit parts.Despite it's relatively slapstick front, the script is extremely mature with vocabulary well beyond the expectancy of two stoners conducting a savage burn on Las Vegas and as such, people who can appreciate an excellent script can literally fall in love with this script - it's that good despite the obvious profanity, which let's face it, is almost expected these days.Fear and Loathing shows maturity beyond its years with excellent acting and comes complete with a masterful script, brilliant screenplay with super wide angles and dimensions which leave you begging for more. I can watch this film countless times and still notice something in the background that I hadn't noticed before often relating to political issues of the time and or just basically a sly joke at something; a move which is hard to pull off in the industry. I truly believe that Fear and Loathing is a hugely under-rated film and i highly recommend it to anybody with an open mind. To sum up - a great trip =)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a vague distant memory of reading a description of Terry Gilliam, where he was compared to the great Coen brothers in his inability to restrain himself from directing to the big screen whatever insanity he imagines. Insanity not simply in original dialogues bordering insanity, original camerawork bordering insanity, original plot twists bordering insanity, but the whole damn film being unclassifiably insane in some weird, random way. In films like Big Lebowski, that choice of magical randomness could be tagged as a personal choice, but in case of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it's not only a personal choice, but a mandatory one, as the story of those two drug users couldn?t have been told in any other way. It would be a bit unjust calling those two bastards simply 'drug users'. The greatness of their curiosity equals that of a scientist, experimenting with every psychedelic drug known to mankind. Those guys are not students man. They are at the frontier of psychedelic experimentation, all the way from basic research on using ether to frontiers like eating pineal glands. Fucken aye. Nice to see things have progressed since Easy Rider. Those bikers were students, kind of amateurish, as they had no predecessor to take example from, making their first big hit, then journeying to New Orleans, seeking, something. Whereas our 'new' f***ers/heroes, they don?t have time to introduce drugs to newcomers the way Hopper and Fonda did to Nicholson, instead, they f*** with them: the hitchhiker, the religious freak. Our heroes are artists, looking down on a whole generation of hippies, as they have associated their sociopolitical ideals with drugs, using them as aids in their quest for an empty idealism, where for Dr. Duke and his lawyer, it?s simply using drugs for the sake of using drugs, an isolated appreciation of consuming and nothing else. Watch the damn thing, as I don't know a work more impressionistic in its portrait of a drugged perception than this very film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp brilliantly portrays Dr.Gonzo, or Raoul Duke, or Hunter S. Thompson whichever name he goes under, in Terry Gilliam's excellent adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson semi-biographical Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Gonzo and his faithful attorney/drug buddy played by Benicio Del Toro set off to the artificial world of Las Vegas in search of the American Dream. These twisted and absurd individuals represent what is left of the 60's drug culture washed up and left hanging by the passing fad they were promised was a revolution. They bring with them their hope in the spirit of the sixties and their complete lack of self-control on the funniest drug binge imaginable. This movie is enjoyable to watch many times over if not for the comedy then for the brilliance of the star actors, watching them change into their roles is a real treat. I've seen this movie half a dozen times so far and I'm still picking up on elements of it I missed on earlier viewings, that is a sign of a great movie. The plot at times is buried between boughts of drug enduced madness, not only for us but for the characters as well but at its heart this is a movie about two drug abusers (that word doesn't come close to describing what they are) whose dreams of the sixties have vanished much like the so called American Dream did in the late fifties so they set out for the booming and confusing realm of Las Vegas in search of signs of either. This book is required reading in many colleges now for the same reason it makes a great movie, in the end everything from the actuality of the characters and events to the question of the existence of the American Dream is debatable. All in all I believe this is a movie everyone should see at least twice, who knows what meaning you might draw from the confused storyteller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What else can I say other than wow. I enjoyed this movie to the fullest. Johnny Depp an Benicio are mezmorising. The context in between lines of dialog are great. Its like acting out loud your inner most thought that you didnt even know you were thinking. I find every trip just as good as the last if not better. This move is the same feeling. Coming up on a new high just as the other one sets down from a mission to mars. So sit back and enjoy your stay on the Las Vegas strip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a movie for psychedelic drugs...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just for the people who do part take in psychedelic drugs take my advice. Now with that out of the way i must say this movie was far better then i expected. Hilarious,strange, and yet somewhat sad. Its hard to describe this movie, the best i can do is say its like a 2 hour acid trip, and yes you will feel like your on an acid trip afterwards. However if you oppose drugs and all other forms of extreme strangeness then this is not your movie. And its not one of those cheap pot smoking movies with lame jokes, it'll make you laugh guaranteed (not a guarantee). This movie delivers on all gounds ,whatever those grounds were, and is perhaps one of the strangest movies ive ever seen. Well now that i am done Wasting my time ill leave the decision up to you to watch this movie"we cant stop here it's bat country"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rat b*****d psychotics!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I've read almost all the comments here and I'm not impressed. The people who do like the movie are going on like it's gods gift to drugs. The people who don't like the movie are saying it didn't have a point and everything was bad. May I please enlighten you. First of all, Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro went out and did their homework, they read the book a million times and went out and got drunk together many times, they talked to Hunter S. Thompson and Oscar Zeta Acostas family. Terry Gilliam was, and always will be, the only director in the world who could've do this movie. It's also important to realize that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas(FLLV) is non-fiction, and there is no way in hell Hunter S. Thompson didn't bend the truth a little bit, so if the movies differs from the book it's no crime. The point of FLLV is not simple. The movie is not a comedy, it's more like a drama. It's not about a race in the desert, it's not about doing drugs, it's not about Cheech and Chong. It's an incredible representation of what was going on in the world. Proof of the chaos that can come and go on right under our noses. Did you notice that no one really tried to stop them, the state trooper let him off with a warning. It's funny that the narration says, "This is what the whole world would be doing in the Nazi's had won the war." That WAS what the whole world was doing when the Nazi's hadn't won the war. Two men stomped through Las Vegas leaving a trail of bills and other destruction behind them. No one stopped them, no one asked who they were and what they were doing there. No one seemed to notice them. The movie is actually quite horrific, the part where they do the ether, and stumble to the door of Circus Circus, and instead of kicking them out for public drunkeness, the door men grabbed them and threw them in! I love this movie, I love the book, I think that everyone should see it. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that you either love or hate. Of those who saw it, they either deemed it non-stop uncontrollable hilarity or just an utter mess of confusion that was a waste of time or money. I tend to side with the former. The screenplay was original and kept to the spirit of the book and the characters had a unique quirkiness about them. This is a movie with a true anti-hero and goes against the grain of many Hollywood movies. If you're willing to suspend reality and are into something totally zany and unpredictable, then this is the movie to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Close, and yet so far....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie when it came out in theatres, I was very impressed with the visual aspects and overall feeling of this film. When I first read the book, then watched the movie again, I thought it was an amazing adaptation. A few years later, after becoming more familiar with Hunter S. Thompson (whose real-life adventures this film is based on), and reading and watching the movie again, I realized just how flawed an adaptation this really is.The film does do an outstanding job of visually representing everything in the book. There's a scene in the hotel, where Thompson's character (who is also his alias, Raoul Duke, and played by Johnny Depp), in a drug-induced haze, begins to see giant lizards swimming in blood in the hotel lobby, and the scene looks right out of a Ralph Steadman drawing.However, the film presents Thompson and "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" as a kind of drug-induced escapade, sort of a less coherent Cheech and Chong type of film, with Thompson running around, drugged up in a frenzy with his "lawyer" Dr. Gonzo (based on real-life Chicano activist Oscar Zeta Acosta, and aptly played by Benicio Del Toro), getting into to trouble and acting like idiots. This is wrong. This is not what "Fear and Loathing" in about.Rather, the book itself is among the most profound epitaphs for the hippie-counterculture movement that formed in the sixties, something that only lip service is given to in the film, in the form of a short Thompson monologue. The book is also an in-depth (though rank outsider) look at the establishment of the early 70s. The second part of the story, which takes place at a National District Attorney's Convention on Drugs, is in large part a running commentary on the failure of the old-school centrist political/economic world (Thompson's white whale) to grasp the youth movement that had budded in the sixties, and now had nowhere to go. This serious, meaningful commentary does not come across at ALL in the film - very little of the myriad of social commentary apparent in any part of the book is in the film.Every technical aspect of the film is solidly done - the main actors, Depp and del Toro, are quite good. Depp, in fact, is more or less a dead ringer for Thompson, almost exactly how you might imagine the author in the early 70s. But the film doesn't take itself seriously enough to be anything more than a fun visual experience. Which is a shame, because director Terry Gilliam does, at times, seem to have a real feel for the presentation of feel of the book. But he makes too many changes (Lacerda's weird personality, for instance), cuts the wrong parts away (much of Thompson's introspection and commentary), and adds the wrong things (*and this isn't really a spoiler, but I'll put a small warning anyhow* such as the final scene, where we hear Depp's Thompson doing a voice-over from an epitaph he wrote for Acosta two years after this, which does not by any means appear in the book, nor particularly apply to anything else that happens in the story - which is as good a summation for the film as I can give - this is a group of wierd experiences missing the overriding feeling and commentary that brings it together so brilliantly in print.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a pound of a movie with an occasional leak of greatness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok. Here's the deal. Basically you have these two guys. One, a writer, the other, a lawyer. They go to Las Vegas to "write" a report for a magazine on some bike races, but end up getting smashed, stoned, twisted, and becoming utterly beautiful human beings. The movie is an alluring piece from the guy who brought us Brazil and 12 Monkeys (yes, this is also the guy who did all those little drawings for a small BBC show on a short time ago). The movie is, in itself, a hazy narcotic dream which sheds its elegant glare upon you within the first minute. It is a completely insane look into the drug world of the 1970's, except, not. Here's the thing. THIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE MOVIE. It was originally a novel, Terry Gilliam made a movie out of it. Take it from there, formulate your own ideas about what the movie will or won't be like, but whatever you think up will be shattered by a dreamy world unlike you have ever experienced before. You will finish watching the movie, after trying to keep up with its COMPLEX plot line etc. and you will be utterly worn out. I guarantee that you will begin having stuff pop into your head that you will have no idea where it came from. This is normal, unless of course, you are currently fluent in the language currently in the spotlight. You will have fun with the movie, but, maybe you won't. Judge for yourself. This is a pound of a movie, and yes, it tries to shed some occasional light on something of actual importance, but not that hard. My take on it is that one of the members of Monty Python's flying circus accidently bumped into the film and poked a hole in it somewhere. This lead to the eventual leak of occasional greatness here and there. Do whatever you want with this movie. Anyway, who are you to be trusting someone like me to tell you whether or not you'll like a film (I DON'T KNOW YOU!), or if it is a "good" piece of work. See the movie, if only for the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember: This is bat country!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one great movie, but don't expect any linear story telling or plot development. Basically an allegory about the Vietnam War, it's a psychedelic trip from the director who made Brazil with much of the zaney weirdness of that film transported to two hack journalists' multi-drug experience in Las Vegas. Johnny Depp is great as the self proclaimed "Gonzo Journalist", but Benicio del Toro really stands out and is unrecognizable as the fat lawyer (not easy for a guy who's 6'2 to go from skinny to overweight). The part where the two hapless protagonists finally work their way through their pills and powders to their bottle of ether and try to walk up into a lobby, swerving and shaking like the zombies in Night Of The Living Dead (itself another Vietnam War analogy), ready to to devour some pig meat at a police conference they are supposed to cover, is hilarious. High as a kite and inveterate dope fiends, they're literally dropped behind enemy lines. They even end up critiqueing the drug lecturer's claims of the effects of marijuana. Then, during the scene where a rival reporter is hipping them to the latest news, shadows of falling bombs cross the carpet and the reporter is decked out in an army uniform with painted face, you can almost hear the lines "there's a man with a gun over there; what he says ain't exactly clear". Great allegories for the brain and lots of eye candy to keep you amused. This is one very good film that stands up to repeated viewings and unlike "Brazil", it's not a downer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Symbolistic Terry Gilliam trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To understand this movie, you must understand the style of Terry Gilliam. He doesnt say right out what he wants you to think and feel but suggests with a highly symbolistic approach. You can see it in different ways.If you look for simply entertainment its great: a funny, witty LSD trip visualised on the big screen. If you want to go deeper you can see that this is a serious anti-war movie picking up on the Vietnam war story and the parallels of a similar war within society. It also gives an interesting, perhaps nostalgic portrait of that time.The cinematography is truly amazing. Wide angles, witty cuts, great subtle sfx. As for the actors: equally amazing. Jonny Depp is quite convincing and fun to watch as a permanently stoned reporter. Benicio del Toro showed among other things his method-acting skills in the best de Niro (Raging Bull) manners.I highly recommend this movie. A direct 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Vietnam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I'll get the review part over with. This film deserves an extremely high rating, and is one of my personal all-time favourites. It is funny, witty, and an insightful social/political commentary. It is definitely my favourite film about the Vietnam War.And therein lies a key to understanding and appreciating the film. My hope here is to briefly identify some of the imagery used, and thereby help some viewers better enjoy the film. For those viewers to whom these observations are obvious, I guess you shouldn't spend too long reading them. I don't, however, see many references to this rather important side of the film in other reviews on this page.The film is an allegory which works on three levels. On one level, it is about a journalist and his companion on an assignment in Nevada to cover a race. On a second level, it is about two G.I.'s fighting in Vietnam. On a third level, it is about two men fighting a war in their own lives at a time when a nation was at war with itself.The journalists, or soldiers, are sent on an assignment which isn't completely clear to them. They are "armed to the teeth" with drugs, which are their weapons to fight the enemy, namely, the divided society around them which tries to carry on as the Vietnam War overseas takes place.The beginning of the motorbike race is obvious. Everyone can see that. But it turns into an endurance test, and the chances of covering it properly or interpreting it soon become impossible . This, we see plainly, is an allusion to Vietnam. But so too is the whole work. There is hardly a line in the film that is not a reference to Vietnam, hardly a setting that does not have an exact parallel. From a passing comment about the chemical smell around the palm trees in a hotel lobby, to the heat in Nevada being too oppressive to stand, to the gookiness of the hotel bar, it is a brilliantly executed script.Most scenes in which the protagonists are surrounded by the general population (in a casino, a bar, or an elevator), they are essentially on the front lines, until they retreat from time to time to their encampment - hotel room. At the beginning of the film in which they are flying, sorry, driving to their assignment, they are already questioning the purpose of the trip, becoming fearful and needing escape. But they have little time ever to think about what is actually going on around them. Those moments of introspection and clarity happen primarily when Duke is seen in his capacity of writer, as in the poignant scene in which he reflects on an earlier time of peace and prosperity (and he can "still see the highwater mark" ).Note the number of scenes in which the American flag appears with the two protagonists, much as it would identify U.S. infantrymen abroad. The array of chemical weapons resembles that used in Vietnam, of course, bolstering that metaphor, as does the use of ether, which was an anaesthetic used for quick behind the front lines medical procedures - killing the pain.But I shan't say more. This should be enough about the imagery to get you started.This rich tapestry of images, combined with the direction and acting, to say nothing of the fact it's one of the funniest films around, make this effort equal to the task set by a classic book.

Well if I remember correctly she did NOT fall asleep during THE BEAST MUST DIE (aka BLACK WEREWOLF). I have no idea what that means : think what you will. I myself enjoyed it tremendously, though I have to recognize it's as loaded with screams and shouts as any French film from the seventies. Otherwise it's great in all respects, and Gilliam no less than changed my life with his various films ever since the Monty Python era.

		<shortDescription>Drug-addled terrors in tiny town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple, three years ago, I decided to take in a film at the new 12 screen cineplex here in town. I more or less decided on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas for a lack of anything else. So, I went to the theatre, got my overpriced ticket along with my overpriced popcorn, softdrinks and whatnot, then settled into my seat to take the crazed rollercoaster ride thru the drug-addled mind of one Dr. Raoul Duke, circa 1971.Director Terry Gilliam, star Johnny Depp and everyone connected with the film brilliantly captured all the visceral energy and hallucinogenic vibrancy of Hunter S. Thompson's classic take on America's roll at the craps tables of history in an era when everything was on the line.From just about everything I'd heard or read, Gilliam always had a penchant for making movies that cost the studios a lot of bucks that they never recouped at the box office. Yet, Hollywood keeps going back to him, hoping he'll turn out that one hit that'll make it all worthwhile. But no matter how vividly he brought the primal essence of Thompson's words to the screen, I seriously doubt that Fear was the film the beancounters were banking on. Fact is, it was just too weird for Joe Sixpack. It just wasn't the more mainstream shtick the summer crowd usually expects. But no matter, I felt then and I feel now that the film will eventually have its own legion of fans.Every actor in Fear turned in unforgettable performances. But the man of the hour was definitely Johnny Depp. He played Thompson with perfect pitch. He had every maniacal nuance down in a amazingly accurate characterisation of the famed writer. He tweaked every tic and mannerism from the man and recreated him for the larger than life unreality of the movie screen.And the film was incredibly honest in its depiction of the time and place. Gilliam and company could've taken the phony "higher ground" and offered a finger wagging revisionist 90s-style version of this tale of decadent excess, but chose instead to tell it unapologetically, merely chronicling the journey into debauched lunacy, letting you make up your own mind about it in the end.And it fairly captured the essence of the hyperbolic, hyperventilated prose of Thompson's source book.Of course, it couldn't fit in everything that appeared on the pages of the original missive. For instance, of his first hegira out of Las Vegas - when he was on the lam from hotel officials - Thompson related, "Rum will be absolutely necessary to get through this night - to polish these notes, this shameful diary ... keep the tape machine screaming all night long at top volume: 'Allow me to introduce myself ... I'm a man of wealth and taste.'"Sympathy?"Not for me. No mercy for a criminal freak in Las Vegas. This place is like the Army: the shark ethic prevails - eat the wounded. In a closed society where everybody's guilty, the only crime is getting caught. In a world of thieves, the only final sin is stupidity."But the real point of the film - and the book - was made during the flashback sequence of a scene at the old Fillmore Ballroom where these lines were extracted from the book and read verbatim into the movie's narrative: "Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era - the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run ... but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant ..."So now ... five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark - that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back."Even tho I hadn't laughed so hard at a film in years, in the final analysis, it wasn't really a ha-ha funny movie. It was actually a very sad one. It wasn't about the debacle of the 60s/early 70s so much as it was about what's happened to us since. Some of us became casualties of the madness, to be sure. But somehow, most of us made it thru to the other side. The boomers of the 60s are now the people who are calling all the shots. Who knows what kind of long-term effects all those drugs had on the psyche of the nation?We've put on a few pounds to make up for all the brain cells we lost, and we've drifted uneasily into middle-age with many goals still unwon.But the point is still this: for all the lunacy of our younger days, we came thru on the other side. We donned the uniforms of convention and went back to work, seeking the affects of bourgeois gentility. And Las Vegas still sits out there in the desert in all its neon and formica fake opulence with its tacky space-age accoutrements of ostentatious luxury, untouched by the passage of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever there was a movie that could induce acid flash-backs,this is it.The use of the fish-eye lens and the moving floors and walls is the next best thing to being there.Although it could have been a little shorter,most acid trips could.At least with this movie on video,you can hit the pause button for a couple of minutes,and come down for a bit if things get too intense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie, though overall I'm not sure its one of my favourite movies. I've read the book, however, and I think it translated really rather well. Taken as a series of events, its incredibly funny and twisted, but taken as a whole its like a bad trip.I think Depp captured HST quite well... though seeing Del Toro was sort of.... disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Depp &amp; Del Toro Shines on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the end of the 60's, and journalist Raoul Duke (Depp), is accompanied by his lawyer (Del Toro) on a drug-riddled trip to Vegas to cover a race.First of all; it's impossible not to be awed by the enormous talent that Benicio Del Toro and Johnny Depp are in possession of. When I say that this is Depp's best role, I'm well aware that that is not a statement that should be taken lightly. But his efforts to reveal Raoul Duke's twisted, drug-abusing persona, must surely be considered one of the finest performances in the history of film. Del Toro's efforts are only eclipsed by his work in "The Usual Suspects" and possibly "Traffic". This movie didn't go down well with a lot of people that deemed it to be a useless and unnecessary display of moral vulgarity. That is one way to look at it. I choose another. Sure, drug taking is what this movie is about, that, and the effects it had on people in a time that was confusing and change was right around the corner. A serious issue becomes comedy, simply because of the fact that the characters are so utterly over-the-top in their indulgence of illegal substances, that you, as a "fly on wall" viewer, cannot resist laughing at the chaos that these distorted minds are creating. So in short terms: If you're a kind of person that will have a moral objection against this kind of a movie, just don't watch it. If you on the other hand, have the ability to enjoy two of the greatest actors of our time, directed by an immensely talented director, and take it for what it is, run out and get yourself a copy right now. Just because you like the film, and this is what certain moral watch-dogs will argue against, doesn't mean you condone drug-taking. I for one won't be touching Mescaline any time soon....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"What a long crazy trip it's been......"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow.....this film was an absolute mind-shattering experience, a visual journey of epic proportions, a literal trip for the viewer. I was in absolute awe during most of this film, watching the bizarre distortions of a drug induced stupor through the eyes of Raoul.  "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" was an absolute contrast of extremes. While it was hilarious to watch the 2 men stumbling through clubs, donning towels as if Lawrence of Arabia or hacking fruit, this was at the same time horribly tragic. It made one wonder what they could have been doing with their lives if they had not relied upon their mescaline, cocaine, ether and other substances. The line between fiction and reality was blurred as Dr. Gonzo plotted to (spoiler) kill the young reporter who he believed had taken "his" girl, when in fact she was just a random woman in an elevator. When Raoul later located the blood-tipped knife in the hotel room and pondered the occurrence of a crime slipping by in Las Vegas, you truly wondered what had transpired. Yet at the same time, all of the reflections on life, how one could get higher without the drugs, how these men, despite their tragic situations, could talk sense into each other and prevent worse events from occurring.....it was amazing. And when the film was all over, did it truly seem that bad?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny, hugely entertaining, and well worth seeing but not to everyone's taste...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing is a peculiar film, for many reasons. As a Terry Gilliam film, you'd expect as much, but expecting it doesn't make it any more predictable - in style or theme as much as plot. The fact that Gilliam is reputable as definitely-maybe-sortof-unconventional at least brings on the challenge that he might quickly become tiring in his relentless pursuit of the idea, but he always seems to carry it off fairly convincingly. Regarding the theme, make no mistake that Fear and Loathing probably won't radically change people for better or worse. But it's not supposed to, and isn't really about that, and the fact that people might stigmatise it as a 'drugs film' can only pursuade them that they _can't_ enjoy it.It's funny, very funny, and really entertaining if you can accept it with an open mind. Jonny Depp plays his part exceptionally, and it really makes the film. It's not about what happens as much as how some random guy on the ultimate road trip percieves things over the course of a few days. It's one of those films that you can have a quiet respect for, and is always enjoyable to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing had the misfortune of being hot-potatoed around different writers before production. Alex Cox was supposed to write it and direct it but he met Hunter Thompson one night, Thompson doesnt' want him, so Gilliam is hired to do the project.I read the book about a year before production, and was eagerly anticipating the release, but I heard about all the behind-the-scenes stuff and got worried. I was very disappointed that Cox didn't get to direct it because I just love A-C. Anyhow I watch the film, and noticed that a lot of the themes discussed in the book are not present.. The only real reflection of I could notice was shown in a commercial from the first hotel they stay at! Therefore I thought the movie is lacking and obviously a big mess of a plot.Cut to about two years later.. I'm stuck in this clinic and have no choice but to watch the movie with a group of other guys. All of a sudden, it clicks, the drug induced binges of depp and del toro take effect on my conciousness, I find myself deeply immersed in the out-takes of the duos.. I laugh histerically at the race and drug convention scenes, i cringe at the apartment flood and diner scenes. I am astonished, appalled, and thrilled throughout. Without going into details.. everything about this movie is just remarkable I think. I believe though that there were probably other ways of presenting the film... i Still love it for what it is.. a rollercoaster of a week for these two men, and a rollercoaster of a movie for us that watch it with wide eyes. Also they used DK's rip of 'viva los vegas'.. AWESOME! One of my top ten films since 1990. watch it, but take your time between screenings so you won't ruin the experience. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>True Fear and Loathing may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but having my own past experiences with the world of psychedelic drugs undoubtedly influences my enjoyment of this film. Sure, a lot of the imagery is exaggerated (though I have never, in fact, ingested human adrenaline), but true acid humor is there, in a big way, and I can't help but laugh - At myself perhaps, but laugh nonetheless. A fun, at times disturbing romp through the land of trip. Plus, Johhny Depp is rarely disappointing in anything he does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest to it's age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fear and Loathing" should be commended for being honest with it's time period. In this day and age, most subject matter made concerning the 1960s-1970s is seen through five tons of nostagia and sixteen pounds of longing. However, Terry Gilliam's direction through Hunter Thompson's novel shows all facets of this unique film: for every hit of acid and wild night in Vegas are toiletfuls of vomit, five suicide attempts, and destroyed hotel rooms as well as regret.To describe this movie is absurd: it doesn't have a real plot, it just happens. It builds and builds until finally it explodes, then dies down. Most critics blast this because they don't understand it. It's how reality usually works: no big payoff, just subtle moments of understanding and another guess at the big mystery of life. Just usually none of us do it while sitting in a flooded hotel room or trying to blow a man out of bed with a fire hose.All and all, this is a must see movie. Forget all the criticism, go see a honest view of the "Me" decade.</fullReview>

It was funny and depressing at times but overall you see the depths that can be traveled through heavy drug intoxication. Benicio and Johnny are great in this movie especially Benicio who seems to bring a whole new dimension to his character. He performs like no other actor and it was mesmerizing for me to watch him make me laugh(he should have been nominated for an Oscar) and disgusted at the same time yet still find him cuddly and like a grandfather figure in a drug crazed way. He shows the thin line walked between lawyer and drug crazed addict out to scare the world with his amazon like stature. I remember saying several times while watching the movie that "Dr. Gonzo, is a man that is too big to deal with" let him be. Johnny Depp sounds like Elvis at times and a weird caricature full of every drug you can imagine. He wheels and whirls through this movie never stopping to experience the world of sobriety. They say their looking for some piece of the American dream, if they would get off the drugs maybe they could realize the they are the ones to be feared and loathed for freaking everyone out(including themselves) on their drug binge. The ether walk truly takes you into another dimension of insane drama. Inside the freakshow of a casino/bar, Dr. Gonzo makes you trip out on how scared he is to jump off of the revolving bar. Who creates a revolving bar? Why don't they just hang barf bags from the counter? I'm telling you all who haven't seen Fear and Loathing, you should watch just to see the ridiculously funny "Ether Walk" not to mention "Dr. Gonzo's Acid/Suicide Trip."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas was critically panned upon release and died a quick death at the box office which is a shame. Terry Gilliam has perfectly translated Hunter S. Thompson's most endearing novel to the screen. The film is very stream of consciousness and nonlinear in structure, shifting to various moments in time which may confuse the viewer. But this is a Gilliam film adapted from a Hunter S. Thompson novel so it isn't for all tastes. Johnny Depp perfectly captures the caricature of Raoul Duke, will all of his mannerisms and facial expressions done brilliantly. Fear and Loathing also has Gilliam's trademark visuals and has vividly captured the period with a terrific soundtrack. A must for Gilliam and Thompson enthusiasts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>let me tell you- i have seen all kinds of movies and this is the best one i've seen in my whole damn life!! its so funny, i wish i had time to watch it everyday or at least once a week. after you see it, you can still hear his voice (which is VERY different and very funny) every day of your life, not psychotically,just to laugh about... the crazy stuff going on out there(and I live in Cali). benicio del toro is a VERY funny guy too, always mumbling in his movies (like in unusual suspects..) i've read the hunter s.thompson books (which are too funny to even explain) and fear and loathing is almost taken directly out of the book. the book has more, but the movie keeps it pretty real- even almost all the lines the actors say are straight out of the book. The music is great(if you like classic rock)and i wish i could download every sound of that movie onto my computer.This is the best movie EVER made- if you understand it. If not, you probably like Britney Spears, Backstreet boys, and trendy C**P like that(if so, i actually hope you DON'T like the movie, Hunter S.Thompson would not approve of your liking it... and i REALLY don't!!!).Also if you have never smoked ANYTHING, never touched a beer or anything of the sort, you may not understand it, and your mommy probably wouldn't want you watching it anyway.</fullReview>

So, coming from the netherlands, I invited some friends over and got really waisted. We watched the movie and during the little-too-long ride that it is I found myself falling on the ground, laughing, to find out I fell on top of another person that was already lying there. I thought it was funny and that was it. The next day I watched in a sober condition and then I began to appreciate the other great aspects of the film; The cinematography, the directing and in particular, in one of the best parts I have ever seen someone act, Forgotten hero Johnny Depp.WATCH IT! If it wasn't only for the great one-liners. It's a rollercoaster about Drugs and Alcohol. That's all you gotta know.Note especially how Johnny Depp gives a waiter a tip By smashing some quarters on the ground. I'm gonna do that in the bar on Friday. I hope the bartender gets the joke otherwise I'm probably history.</fullReview>

After finding out that it was directed by Terry Gilliam (Brazil, Twelve Monkeys) and starred in my opinion oneof the most underated actors of our time Johnny Depp (Ed Wood, Donnie Brasco, Sleepy Hollow) I could hardly wait to rent a copy. I did and throughout the entire film I was beaming. Only Depp and Gilliam could produce sucvh a good adaptation of THE greatwest book of all time. The acting is brilliant - Depp sometimes acts like Chaplin which produyces a lot of the laughs. Its visually stunning and leaves you breathless after every hilarious scene. Their are so many great scenes like the DA's Drug Convention and the scene at the race being just a few of the great bits. Okay so Its just like the book but so what. *****</fullReview>

If you have read the book you know it is much more than that. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is one of the best adaptions of a book I've ever seen. And to not even know it was a book, then you shouldn't be watching this movie. Here's the thing: if you don't get the scene when Raoul is in The Matrix club when he says "There I am", and it shows a man wearing a visor in the backround, then you should probably turn the movie off right then and there; you won't enjoy the rest of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly, in my opinion, the greatest transition from book to film in all of movie history. Watch it and you become lost in a world of pshychidelia, loud music, bad vibes, schizofrenia,fear and loathing. This film captures you and imprisons you in a realm of Thompson's design and Gilliam's construction. You wander blindly with Dr. Gonzo and Raoul Duke as your only guides throug this tumult of madness, and often even they are lost themselves. At the same time though this is a fable of the oldest kind, these poor fools, human caricatures and wasted husks are all run-off as children of a failed revolution. What was left over when all the enthusiasm of an entire generation ran out leaving them empty, confused and lonely. A savage journey to the heart of the American dream in the most primal sense. Many didn't like this movie and disparage it both openly and to themselves; proclaiming it trash, redundant and pointless. Most likely though they are just frightened by what confronts them in this film making them uncomfortable and feeling vulnerable. And quite frankly I can't blame them, a movie like this can be tough to swallow but be sure that if you watch it with with a heart empty of prejudice (or a head full of pshycotropic substances) and you shall experience a tumble through a looking glass most twisted and frightening, and by god you'll love every minute of it.</fullReview>

'un-sobre' and it's more like 43150 out of 10!After watching it around 6-7 times I read the book, I wish I'd done it the other way round ( I made the same mistake with the Godfather)I've read that John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd were to make this film, and Martin Scorsese was going to direct Jack Nicholson in another attempt. As talented as these lot are, even they could not make it as good as this was!The soundtrack is very cool (Gonzo's accompaniment of 'One Toke over The Line' in the Red Shark at the start of the film.) Mama Told Me Not to Come when Depp wakes with a Zorro Z branded on his forehead! And in The Matrix club in 60s San Francisco (Don't you need somebody to Love?)The visuals are very pleasing, especially with such perfectly timed backround scores. The dialogue is immense, in The Matrix club: The hippy comes into the restroom and asks Depp, who's spilt LSD on his sleeve: (In slow mo) 'Whutt's thu Trubble?'The scene in the lift featuring Cameron Diaz is highly amusing, as is the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Convention! I think the peak, however, is the Andrenochrome scene: 'Your Head'll swell up like a watermelon, you'll put on about 100lb in 2 hours and then you'll notice six, huge hairy t*ts on your back!'One of the best films ever, with The Godfather and GoodFellas, a complete departure however (not to mention Del Toro's enormous weight gain)All I would like to know is 'How accurate is the depiction, and the book?'Anybody tell me?

Then this movie comes along and is to my collection of Gilliam movies as a roadkill is to an otherwise pleasant drive.I couldn't see any point to this movie, and I am used to Gilliam's movies making points. I will watch Gilliam's future movies, but if this had been the only movie I had ever seen of his, I would have decided to avoid his works for good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a really underrated movie, perhaps not Gilliam's best but certainly not worthy of the mauling the critics gave it when it came out, and faithful to the book. It's quite dark in places, notably during the scene in the diner with Ellen Barkin. I particularly like the description given by Raoul Duke of Dr Gonzo as "one of God's own prototypes.. too weird to live, too rare to die"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>depp and benicio are stellar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>johnny depp continues to stake his claim as one of the most versatile actors of our time. he plays his hunter s. thompson character to drug-induced perfection, aided by his side-kick in the picture, benicio del toro. the humor reaches out and smacks you in the face, yet turns subtle at points, obvious only to 'those in the know.' Don't watch this flick with the stodgy, right wingers, bent on censorship and ridding the world of controversial and influential art sources, because you won't be able to hear word one of the film with all the judgmental finger-pointing you'll have to deal with.Notable cameos by gary busey, christina ricci, ellen barkin and harry dean stanton, but keep your eye on the film, because only ricci stands out as recognizable. terry gilliam has established himself as a credible director and the 'reptile zoo' scene was simply hilarious. A wonder it took me so long to see this film, but things happen that way sometimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a surrealistic landscape of mind-numbing narcotic consumption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ex Monty Python legend Terry Gilliam, transports the viewer into a surrealistic landscape of mind-numbing narcotic consumption in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. A film that relies heavily on the visual, Fear and Loathing is fairly closely translated from Hunter S Thompson's brilliant novel of the same name. Johnny Depp is at his finest as Raoul Duke, as is Benicio Del Toro who masters Dr Gonzo's character. It seems Las Vegas is the perfect backdrop for the highly illegal activities of the pair, who specialize in trashing hotel rooms with all the zeal of even the most accomplished rock star.A highlight of the film is the scene in which Duke 'sees' bats. The scene is reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'The Birds,' albeit it in a different context, but nonetheless just as scary.The beauty of the film lies in its ability to make a mockery of such life threatening and generally felonious behaviour that Duke and the Doc find themselves in. Overall, I enjoyed the film immensely, especially due to it's questioning of the American Dream and its anti-authority stance. This is most obvious when the duo move across town to cover the National DA's convention on Narcotics. It is a massive contradiction and one which will leave a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well....a book is one thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a concept just isn't meant for a multimedia experience. Fear and Loathing was a masterfully created film and for all you connoisseurs of film for filming sake, this will definitely be satisfying. But the actual experience of the movie as a whole just didn't do it for me.The book experience in and of itself can be very difficult to recreate on screen and with this novel, it just is impossible. If you disagree, you probably have the book and are seeing the visions you already created in your mind while reading. Gilliam may be a master with the more obscure movie-going experience, but as one reviewer suggests (falsely) this is an excellent ATTEMPT at reproducing a drug-induced mindset for those who never want to experience this type of mood alteration. It just doesn't work and therefore leaves the viewer without the enjoyment that comes from a terrifically crafted work of film.I find that the revulsion of violence and the eroticism of sex can be very powerfully conveyed in film, but a psychedelic frame of mind is so dependant on the entire world around you changing that it just doesn't translate well. No matter how much suspension of disbelief you can garner, that bucket of popcorn in your lap isn't going to turn into a pail of maggots sending you careening for the un-findable exit so you can toss your cookies; the remote control in your hand, by its very nature, will never slither and wrap itself around your wrist...you can just walk away and that leaves the viewer on the outside.Much like Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, if you want to experience this piece of work, READ. Leave the film industry to what it can do well and let yourself experience the joy that can only be found when you picture for yourself just what the AUTHOR has put in written form for you to interpret.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best Terry Gilliam movie. I have fun, because it reminds me a lot of thing from the early seventies. Not that I did all those things! But the idea of the Era is absolutely great, without being nostalgic. I also love the way Gilliam presents Las Vegas : ugliness at his peak (yeah! right!). The comments are amazing (never read the book. But I will) and, of course, this is a visual effort with great creativity. But most of all, Gilliam should be applauze to make such film in 1998, in a nasty world of PC, where smoking a cigarette can get you to jail. By the way, did I have a hallucination or did I see Peter Fonda in this film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on such a fantastic book, directed by perhaps the most visually arresting director of all time, and starring probably the most gifted actor of his generation, you would think FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS couldn't possibly miss. And it doesn't. With every scene comes a startling image or an unforgettable line of dialogue. I can't conceive of how abandoning life to utter excess could be better presented on film, and there are even moments of true profundity - yes profundity - mixed in with all the psychedelic visuals. Depp is amazing, as you would expect, but so is his co-star Del Toro. In a way it reminds me of WITHNAIL AND I, in that you can watch it over and over again and still find something deep or funny that you'd been missing before. A classic example of the critics just not "getting" a movie and therefore slamming it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you care to find what truly goes on in the mind of a drug crazed madman, check out Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro), the faithful attorney (sort of) to Raoul Duke (Jonny Depp). This is the story of a reporter in the 70's sent to do a story in Las Vegas about the biggest Bike race of all time. His attorney goes along and recommends he gets all the drugs known to mankind. Watching this movie makes you feel like you're on a trip with these 2. Terry Gilliam (12 Monkeys, Brazil), who was also a member of the British comedy group Monty Python, is the brilliant mastermind to this film and he happens to make it by far the most incredible film of all time. I strongly recommend this film for it's incredible poetic quotes and artistic settings and camera views. But beware this movie will cause some STRANGE VIBRATIONS AND EXTREME PARANOIA!</fullReview>

Maybe that gave me a different perspective for what I was going to see, maybe not. What I do know is that knowing what I knew, this movie was very true to the events as they were reported and frankly the imagery painted by the book (to my minds eye) vs. what was shown on the screen were frighteningly similar. If you think this is about two guys trashing a couple hotel rooms read the book, read about Hunter S. Thompson (aka Dr. Gonzo). This ain't Cheech and Chong folks.</fullReview>

The film is more of an acid trip than it was a comedy. The narration by Johnny Depp was hilarious and stands out as the best part of the film. The cinematography was so freaked out! Benico Del Toro was the films biggest down side. He was just a fat drunken slob who screamed and threw up a lot (from which we are spared little detail). The film wasn't terrible. Just not a classic or anything. I loved the cameos. Can never get enough of that Christina Ricci. When I turned the movie off I felt weird. Like I was fresh off an acid trip.

Though some of the book's high points are missing in the film, and though the film doesn't quite depict the 1970s as it was at the time, the film is still a potential cult classic. Great performances from Johnny Depp as Duke and Benicio Deltoro as his lawyer, Dr. Gonzo, though Christina Ricci is wasted (though still effective) as a reserved artist. The screenplay, performances, and soundtrack alone make it a quality film.</fullReview>

Like Koyanisquatsi (I'm sure I misspelled that) or Baraka, this film is about images and impressions, not story. If you can't appreciate it, that is your loss.

		<shortDescription>completely underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie closely follows Hunter S. Thompson unforgettable classic. It is a Terry Gilliam masterpiece, second only to 12 Monkeys. This is NOT your typical movie. It shows the hedonistic drug habits of a famous writer "Duke" (see Doonsebury comic) played by Johnny Depp and his half-samoan lawyer Dr. Gonzo, played by a ferociously talented Benicio Del Toro.The two set off on a journey to find "The American Dream", whatever it may be. Much to their chagrin, they find it in Las Vegas. Most of the movie consists of the two abusing various hard drugs, including human adrenalin from a bottle. There are some very deep commentaries and reflections of the 60's and the failure of the hippie generation. The movie spirals down from funny to scary to depressing, as the two get further and further strung out on drugs. It also takes a vicious stab at the authority "zero-tolerance" attitude. Thompson and Gilliam do a remarkable job of making the policemen and narcos look as unappealing and as hedonistic as the two protaganists. The movie is dotted with Gilliam's trademark weirdness and symbolism. It is beautifully filmed, and much attention to detail. It is true art, and not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a lengthy, bizarre, drug-induced trip around the vibrant city of Las Vegas (based on the memoir of Hunter S Thompson, who makes a brief appearance) experienced by journalist Raoul Duke (played brilliantly by Johnny Depp) and his sidekick, a slightly deranged Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo. They take every mind-bending drug imaginable to man and try to report and photo the Mint 400 off-road race, but end up visiting the various strange bars of Vegas and having the most dreamlike hallucinations, as they seem to be constantly stoned. It is perfectly set in the early drug-crazed 70's. It has some good cameos from Christina Ricci, Cameron Diaz, Ellen Barkin, and some oddball bit-actors like Lyle Lovett, Flea and Penn Jillette make an appearance. The music is great, too, from the early 70's musical artists in a good musical era. It has some funny comments from the two leads as they verbally spar with each other and other folks, and is endlessly watchable for countless viewings. One hell of a spaced-out trip.</fullReview>

There are however, a few reasons to watch it-Three smart cameos from Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci and one of the best actors in the world, Gary Busey make this film receive better reviews than it should have got. Depp and Del Torra are two druggies who go on the mission of finding 'The American Dream'. With a trunk load of Acid and various other narcotics, they spend the entire film getting stoned and drunk out of their mind. The characters are shallow, and the story is stupid. Depp's fake deep voice is so annoying, I felt like hitting the TV screen. Fear And Loathing is a silly film that will please those who are desperate for entertainment. If it were not for the cameos mentioned and Tobey Maguire's hitch hiker(who provides all of the laughs) then this trash would be completely unwatchable. Rating=2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest, most satisfyingly outlandish movies I've seen in a while. I love it for the same reason most critics and audiences hated it-it's rambling, incoherent, and overblown. Johnny Depp is simply brilliant in his performance, cartoonizing the character but in a way that enlivens the whole film and keeps you mesmerized and laughing out loud at this most eccentric creature Raoul Duke. Benicio Del Toro's excessive mumbling got in the way of an otherwise good, intense performance(Between this movie and the Usual Suspects, he has about two sentences worth of intelligible dialogue). I love his performances but I never know why. The situations and set pieces were all inventive, especially the scene when they first check in to the hotel and spaz out at the bar(perfect recreation of being inebriated in a crowd, where the people around you seem to be bizarre caricatures, talking their own language). Same with the hilarious Drug Convention scenes.It's understandable that fans of the book(which I have yet to read) are disappointed (I read L.A. Confidential almost ten years ago and I found last year's critically hyped movie an overly sanitized, pale shadow of the brutal book) but I'm glad I came to this movie without the prejudice and expectations. This is my favorite Terry Gilliam movie, in fact-funnier than Brazil, more fantastical than even Baron Munchausen- although bingeing on psychedelics on the Vegas Strip is not quite as fun as it looks in this movie. The movie(by way of the book) even manages to sneak in some pointed criticisms against the kind of aimless and/or idealized hedonism that the characters engage in.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A weekend of trashing motel rooms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS ( rating, * * ? out of 5 )This eccentric piece of cinema is based on the book of the same name penned by Hunter S. Thompson. Thompson is a strange and somewhat scary individual who was prominent during the beat years of American literary history - famous more for his broadminded views on high-powered firearms in the hands of Johnny Punch-Clock than his bookish achievements.Johnny Depp plays Raoul Duke, a thinly disguised Hunter S. Thompson duplicate who along with Dr Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) tear up Death Valley in a red convertible while wasting away on a cocktail of drugs that would have supplied Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison with a lifetime inventory.These two madmen stuff every conceivable concoction of narcotic down their throats - their bloodstreams being invaded with more stimulants than the Chinese Olympic swimming team. Raoul and Dr Gonzo's adventures straddle the very funny and the very grotesque - a reckless humor more uncomfortable than satisfying.There is no true linear story here, just a long weekend of trashing Vegas hotel rooms while trying to define America's pop culture - a last ditch attempt at freedom as compliance closes in.This is not what you call a pleasant or viewer-friendly movie, and definitely not one for the wholesome family to watch together while chomping on microwave popcorn. The fast jump-cutting and psychedelic production-design could easily produce an epileptic fit. There were moments through this cinema experience when I wasn't sure if I was watching a movie starring Johnny Depp, or if I had a front row seat at a Doors' concert.This film is all about shades of grey, because seeing is not always believing, just ask the blind man, the one who really sees all. Behind the pot-pourri of opiates and chemical bias, there's a lot of self-examination in this movie, self-examination that isn't always flattering.Through the use of extended voice-over, director Terry Gilliam is almost able to convey true empathy via the weirdness and to add an introspective layer that ties the whole piece together - success rate about 50/50. This is not a great movie, but it should be given marks for daring to tread where only the very brave have ventured before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Search for the American Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About 20 years ago a movie came out by the name of "Where the Buffalo Roam", starring Bill Murray. It was based off the weird legend of Hunter S. Thompson. As a 20th Anniversary, Universal Studios (the company that made "Buffalo"), and Terry Gilliam ("Brazil", "Time Bandits", "12 Monkeys", "Jabberwacky") teamed up with some of the cast in the first movie and made the second take on a movie based off of Thompson. Only this one is based off of his own book, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", one of our finest books in the history of America. Although we can't say the same about the film, that doesn't mean it isn't good. This film, which stars one of our greatest actors, Johnny Depp, is actually quite good. Although it was dogged by critics everywhere, and most people hate it becuase they don't quite get what it's about, in my opinion it is one of the best films to come around in a long time. Set in Las Vegas in 1972 (Where "Buffalo" left off), this film will give you a headache because it's so real. It takes you on the journey that Roul Duke and Dr. Gonzo took, and it does a splendid job of doing so. While the story isn't great, it doesn't have to be. The directing and cinematagrophy is excellent, and the acting is good, Depp giving a great performance of the drug addict Duke. I thought the film was good, but most people beg to differ, this film is not for everyone. You either hate it or you love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much as I sat down to watch it. A friend had told me that it was OK, but not brilliant. But it had been his suggestion to see it again. There must be more to it, I thought.I laughed and laughed.That is it, quite simply. An incredibly funny drug-taking and vegas-trashing film. You feel as if you are actually there on the road with Duke and Gonzo. Of course, I've never actually been out on a bender with them, but if I did then I would probably be pretty well prepared for what to expect. Captures the feeling of a session gone wrong very well.About those of you who say the most predictable and boring thing that anyone can ever say about a film of a book "It's not as good as the book", well forget about it. Let's get this straight. THE FILM IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE BOOK. OK so there are a couple of scenes that are different, and there is a bit more inner dialogue in the book, but hey, forget about it. If there will ever be a book-film conversion this good again then I simply wouldn't believe it. This is a carbon-copy if ever there was one. Depp is perfect, Del Toro is more than perfect and the whole thing is tied together perfectly with some of the most crisp directing I've seen for a while.A thoroughly enjoyable film? You bet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>.. what happened?! I was looking forward to enjoy myself with a good film, snacks and some beer. Sitting in my favourite position in my comfortable sofa. Scenes of people equiped with rolls revealing their thought's and feelings' about the 'nam war.Then it hit me. Struck by lightning from the clear sky. The 118 minutes went by, and I was still sitting in that same position as I was before the film started! I felt ran over by a truck, and I asked myself... what happened...So I rewound the tape to see it again. And after that I followed the same procedure once again. What I had imagined was not near what I had been subjected to!I had known that Johhny Depp was an great actor, and not the least Gillam is quite a director. But this!? It's a masterpiece! Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are totally convincing as the two drug-addicts, aiming to be as close to death as you can be, by using drugs! Mr. Depp is.. is... is he stoned for real!? Cause he almost had me going there fore a while.. Through his incredible acting, he makes you go tripping!! I had to watch the movie three times, too see things clearer, and just focus on his acting.. When I did, I did it only to find out that he probably is inreplacable.I know I seem like a fool, making Depp seem like the only one represented in this movie. I know he isn't. But without mr Depp, the "Fear and Loating in Las Vegas" would only be a bad plaige of "Trainspotting".I'm looking forward to see more of his acting further on... ...do NOT use drugs, folk's! Use "Fear and Loating in Las Vegas" instead... if you feel like... GOING TRIPPING!! WOAAAAaa!!!</fullReview>

Thompson was somehow able to make all this madness coherent, give it all meaning and summarize the growing pains of an entire nation through memorable off-camera voiceovers. Gilliam's view of Thompson's novel confirms his place as one of today's most insightful and innovative directors.The Polyester Kingdom and the pink flamingos, the spooky eerieness about the hitchiking teenager, the terror in the elevator... these insane, acutely staged elements make "Fear and Loathing" what it is: a masterfully crafted film and an enormous commentary on the drug generation and its lost dreams, 30 years after the summer of love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of 98. True to the Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" was released theatrically in 1998. It didn't receive the recognition that it deserved. Johnny Depp gives an amazing performance as the infamous Raoule Duke (Hunter S. Thompson). He gives a stunning performance mimicking Hunter's movements perfectly and stays true to the clothing and style used in the book. Gilliam should be commended for his use of direction. The constantly moving camera makes you feel as though you are living the novel. Benetio Del Toro gives a performance of Dr. Gonzo that is down to the last detail. The movie is a rare accomplishment it stays loyal to the novel and is told in a narrative style that goes beyond anything that could have been anticipated. Depp's performance is his best to date and far surpasses Bill Murray's portrayal of Hunter from "Where the Buffalo Roam". Also the cameos where amazing using people that can easily be recognized from previous Gilliam efforts and using Christina Ricci as Lucy was brilliant. Word of advice read the book first. You will thank me.</fullReview>

Thompson's book is basically incomprehensible on film but Gilliam vision is the closest you'll ever get to the lyrical drug trip. Depp never fails to amaze with his choices of roles and he is so superb as Raoul Duke (Thompson's alter-ego) you hardly realise that he is Johnny. del Toro also ignites every scene he's in with such ease and is an excellent counterpart to Depp's Duke. Chaos is definitely at the center of the visual theme and yet some people complain that they don't understand what's going on, which is exactly THE point. This one has 'cult classic' written all over it and it is definitely way ahead of it's time. Despite being set in the early '70s, you can actually feel it's current validity. A good movie leaves you with questions. See it for the 12th time and you'll get the picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not an easy film to watch. There's no doubt that Depp and Del Toro give performances that any other actor would die to deliver and that Gilliams brilliant visions of weirdness complement the story. The script is also peppered with wonderful lines and there are some scenes which may cause you to break a rib from laughing. But it's still hard to watch and your enjoyment of the film may suffer as a result.I can see why some users have given such negative reviews. For some people there is simply no fun in watching two men stumbling around Las Vegas getting stoned out of their minds and having to suffer the consequences the next day. That we have to go through this ritual three or four times throughout the film would be okay if there was a central plot to anchor the nights before and the mornings after. There isn't. It starts off with the premise that Depp and Del Toro are in Las Vegas to cover an off road race. This is thrown out of the window in half-an-hour and replaced with drugs, booze, cigarettes and convertibles in varying proportions. All we are left with is a trip into these two guys frazzled, acid-clogged minds and the experiences that go with them.But this is what the film is all about. This film is an experience. It's an idea. A view of life in the drug lane. It's about taking us with them for the ride while they get high and drop down again. The opening 15 minutes sum this up perfectly. As Depp is dodging drug-induced bats (the hallucination scenes are uniformally brilliant) and Del Toro is mumbling away to himself they pick up a hitch-hiker. Imagine yourself in the hikers position before he finally runs for cover. That's us in this film. We get to do this for the next two hours. Hang out with the guys and feel what they feel. And all the time Hunter S. Thompson's (who wrote the book the film is based on) prose is sneered at us by Depp. The film is really all about Thompson in the end and the effects of the drug-riddled 70's on the world today.It's a brave film these days that tries to hang its whole running time on one mans ideas but this film does it and, in my opinion, succeeds. I didn't like Trainspotting, which did basically the same thing, because of the depressing tone that went with it. Fear and Loathing has a jauntier, more flamboyant style (courtesy of Gilliam) that I can stomach much easier. I enjoyed it and I think the entire audience I saw it with loved it too. If you want to watch the bumblings of two junkies then check it out. If you don't want to then don't watch it. It's up to you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Terry Gilliam film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>with this movie we can see that there is still creativity in movies today, if enough time is given to them. What did Hunter Thompson's book look like ? I looked like that. Terry Gilliam gave to this story his creativity and his "former Monty Python"'s spirit. How is bat-country like ? Just like in johnny Depp's glasses. That's the first time I'm not disappointed by a Terry Gilliam film (in Monty Pythons movies he was not alone). I liked "Brazil" but I didn't love it (I thought it was too cold). There the madness of the movie can't let you still, you learn new words of vocabulary (mescaline overall), and you're amazed by the actors. Johnny Depp is more than perfect. He shows that taking risks in american movies can make improve a way of acting and allow an actor to be put into the "top 5 of american actors" (with Harvey Keitel, John Travolta -think about "She's so lovely-, Robert DeNiro, Sean Penn and William H macy). He proves he's no longer an idol for young girls (think about it, Will Smith). Benicio Del Toro can't be recognized in the street after this movie, he took the risk to break his repution of "latino actor" with a nice face as "The Usual suspects" or "the funeral" may have "done" (I don't have enough vocabulary to say how this movie is great). "Fear and loathing in Las Vegas" is a movie that can't let you still, with more-than-perfect actors, and an inspired director who forgot some bad usual he had with "Brazil" or "Munchausen".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Terry Gilliam really outdid himself this time. The cast, the effects, the whole movie is incredible. Straight down to the trademark "search for idealism" theme running through all of Gilliam's films, we also get a look into one of the greatest novels written for the Beat Generation. This is a must see for everyone. "We can't stop here! This is bat country!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ego vs alter-ego. 2 personas, 1 person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you consider the two main characters as just one person, the film is fairly interesting. Is it a coincidence whenever Duke starts to come down, his lawyer suddenly disappears? Whenever he is completely toasted, Gonzo is right there committing all the sickest and most heinous acts imaginable while Duke stands by and observes. I wonder if Thompson's view of lawyers as scum of the earth has anything to do with always casting his depraved alter ego as a lawyer. If you watched it thinking this was a pointless romp through a world of hallucination brought on by the excessive consumption of drugs and alcohol, well...okay, maybe you're right. However, watch it again and consider the possibility Duke and Gonzo are the same person. Terry Gilliam is a brilliant director with a unique vision of the world. This was not his best effort, but consider the material with which he had to work. The repetitive constraints of the theme enables Gilliam to do little more than inject some of himself into a rather boring story without getting too silly. It would have been much too easy for Gilliam to turn it into an all out comedy. After a while of watching it and getting it the first time, we get the same thing bashed over our heads during the second half of the movie. Is there a point in telling the same story twice in one movie? The two parts of the story pretty much parallel each other, except the second half is on a much larger scale with a far greater amount of depravity. Good concept, highly repetitive, decent directing, and competent acting. This was not Gilliam at his best (Brazil and 12 Monkeys are far more representative of his brilliance). This was a bold departure in many ways for Gilliam, but will probably become one of his more forgettable offerings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Either you read Thompson and were on the "inside" or you read Tom Wolfe and were standing on the outside pooh-poohing. "Ahhh...it's a dumb movie about two guys getting stoned." - Well, sort of. Maybe Gilliam didn't really capture what the book was about enough to "fill in" the people who had no idea as to what Thompson was after. A couple of things could have made it better. (eg. When Dr.Gonzo is vomiting in his shoes as the waitress comes in to clean up - he and Duke should have been stark naked as they were in the book, and I was hoping for huge CGI bats.) I'd have to say that this is the only movie I've ever seen that you had read the book before hand to "get" what was happening in the film version. It has to be tough to adapt people like H.S.T. or Burroughs to the screen. Maybe Cronenberg should've directed it...(and I KNOW he should've done 'Frankenstein' instead of Branaugh...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regrettably, I missed it on the big screen. I'm a big fan of both the book and of Terry Gilliam, but somehow I didn't get around to Fear and Loathing until it was on video. No matter. In a lot of ways, Gilliam *nails* this. Depp's performance is absolutely amazing, and del Toro is pretty good. Gilliam's manic direction and artistic style is both apparent and totally appropriate to the story. Also, Gilliam's work is just getting technically cleaner as he goes on, which is impressive. Visually, the film is a marvel. The only problem is that even in comparison to the book, the film seems a bit nihilistic. Sure, Fear and Loathing is about staggering around Vegas souped up on enough "heinous chemicals" to kill several oxen, but there was also always a sense that Thompson was saying something more: the story was really about a reaction to his horror, the "fear and loathing" that american culture had inspired in him. Here, that spirit seems to be slightly lost -- reduced to two points when Depp taps at his typewriter and philosophizes about the 60s. It's not *bad*, but it seems weak, and it makes the rest of the film look that much more like gratuitous hedonism (which perhaps it is, but in theory there's a point to it all). In particular, Gilliam slightly mishandles a scene at a convention of district attorneys, where Duke and Gonzo sit and watch a presentation from a stuffed shirt detective describing marijuana users. The scene comes out a bit flat, which is surprising since from everything else Gilliam's ever done, I thought he'd jump all over the scene. I've gone on long enough. You love it or hate it. All energy flows from the great magnet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, in fact it was the first one I chose when I got my DVD player!! I am personally against many things, and many groups, and that gives it a very sickly humorous twist. Either you love this movie or you hate it. I know a couple, one of which was on drugs, a girl, who loved the movie, and thought it was so funny, but her boyfriend, who has never had drugs, hated it. Me I never had drugs, did not read the book, but loved the movie anyways. It is for the rebellious types who want to change culture on their own in drastic ways. It is for druggies who reminisce on their drugs. It is not for too many people who do not fit into these groups. The movie is outstanding and to find out which side of the fence you are on, I would say rent it. You will be disturbed, and you may laugh, especially if you know how druggies act and talk. You also must listen very closely because much is mumbled, or spoken through a cigarette holder, and is hard to understand for many. Great movie, check it out!</fullReview>

Though Terry Gilliam is hardly conventional this was a project that could not be succeeded. The result is a movie lacking a clear point and message with a direction that is often unclear.Though let's not ignore it's qualities such as the impressive performance of both Johnny Depp and benicio del toro, and some of the visuals and camera work are highly impressive. if these can keep you going though for 2 hours which in most cases does not, then I recommend that you go elsewhere for Friday night entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this Film was: The best cinematic representation of an acid trip...Ever! But, after the hilarious beginning I found it to drag in some parts; as with the extended drug use. The lack of plot was part of the fun though. The way the film wove through the dialogue and the narration was perfect, and so was the cinematography. I was sucked into this movie and into the absurdness of the actions related to drug use. Johnny Depp's performance was believable yet strangely not, similar to one's state of mind when exposed to massive amounts of psychedelic drugs, and yet still perfect. After watching "Fear and Loathing in Los Vegas" the best word I can find to describe it is: Trippy. If you don't understand what that word really means you might not understand or enjoy this film. The humor was not lost on me, nor was its tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderfully demented cinematic masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After more than 20 years of failed attempts and missed opportunities, Terry Gilliam has done what many thought impossible -- transformed Hunter S. Thompson's classic novel, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, into the cinematic equivalent of having a sledgehammer whacked across your frontal lobes. Thompson's book has been fully-realized and brought to the big screen in all of its demented glory.It is 1971 and journalist Raoul Duke (Depp) and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo (Del Toro), drive to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle race for Sports Illustrated magazine. The assignment is merely an excuse for the duo to abuse their expense account and indulge in a galaxy of drugs. What was initially a simple trip to cover a sports event mutates into a search for the American Dream.Fear and Loathing contains many funny moments, bits of dialogue, and visual zingers as Duke and Dr. Gonzo make their way through the surreal landscape that is Las Vegas. The humour in this film is simultaneously disturbing and hilarious -- a pitch black satire of American culture and excess. Around the 3/4 way mark, Fear and Loathing veers off into really dark territory as the horror that accompanies chemical dependency rears its ugly head. I was worried that this element would be lost in the transfer from book to film in favour of a more straightforward comedy. Thankfully, the darker edge of the novel has been retained and reinforced. After all, their odyssey is supposed to be a savage journey into the heart of the American Dream.I think that Fear and Loathing is indeed some kind of genius film, but in a really demented way that I would have a hard time explaining to someone who didn't tap into what Gilliam and Co. were trying to do. Visually, it is a masterpiece with a whacked out kaleidoscope of colours and insanely inventive camera angles and perspectives that make you feel like you're actually on drugs.I can see why Fear and Loathing has received a critical shellacking from all the usual pundits (Ebert et al). It's a very odd film -- a 128 minute acid trip from beginning to end with no respite, no rest stops, no objective distance from which to view the whole insane picture safely. You are plunged headlong into this weird, wild world along with the characters.This is the kind of film that people will either really love or hate -- there is no middle ground. Gilliam's film is going to be one of those movies that's destined to become an instant cult item. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a monster movie, complete with the grotesque Dr. Gonzo, a malevolent creature who gobbles up drugs and then goes on a chemical-induced rampage. It's pure gonzo filmmaking for people who like weird, challenging films. Otherwise, stay clear of this cinematic oddity for it is a truly bizarre and bleak film that chronicles the destructive effects of substance abuse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine cinematic version of a truly seminal book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It almost doesn't need to be said but the book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a true counter-culture classic. Its prose is dynamic, fearless and hilarious. It's probably writer Hunter S. Thompson's very best. It details the fallout of the 60's along with the inherent insanity that is Las Vegas. Like most of Thompson's other work it's an example of gonzo journalism, where the writer takes an active part in the story. But unlike a lot of his other work Fear and Loathing is curious in that it more blatantly blends fact and fiction together meaning that it would be a stretch to describe it as journalism per se. Thompson's alter-ego Raoul Duke is the main protagonist and he is accompanied by his side-kick Dr. Gonzo as they go on an escapade in Vegas to cover the Mint 400 motorcycle desert race; needless to say, the race is soon forgotten about and the madness of Vegas takes centre stage as seen through the eyes of these drug-fuelled lunatics.Director Terry Gilliam's penchant for phantasmagorical imagery turns out to be a good fit for the drug addled, insane world of HST. He wasn't the most obvious choice to helm this really seeing as the source material is so brilliant on account of the great writing. Could a visual stylist capture this well? The answer has to be yes really. It's unsurprisingly a highly stylized adaption with a fantastically colourful rendering of early 70's Vegas and some wild psychedelic sequences. But the beautiful text is never crucially forgotten. There is great voice-over inserts throughout that quote extensively from Thompson's book. It's this combination of cinematic style, with the meat of the text that makes this work so well. It actually feels quite faithful to the book ultimately and consequently is very episodic and plot less. Helping set the scene further is a soundtrack that nails things perfectly. It is half psychedelic rock, half Vegas lounge music; the former identifies us with the protagonists, the latter with the location. The final piece in the puzzle is the acting. Both Johnny Depp and Benico Del Toro put in borderline unintelligible performances as respectively Duke and Gonzo. Both are extremely convincing and disappear into their characters. On top of this there is an array of cameo appearances from a gaggle of well-known actors and actresses.When I first saw this film I wasn't convinced that it was a very good adaption of the book. But now I have come to believe that this is a very good adaption of a work that was considered unfilmable. If I was to be critical at all it would be to say that it maybe has one drug-fuelled psych-out too many. But overall this has to surely be considered a triumph.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favourite movies of all time, by far. Every time I watch it I understand it more and more, and I'm saddened by the fact that the people who dislike or misrepresent the film are missing out on the truths permeating the subtext of this film. There is subtly underlying the drug induced madness that captures the essential essence of a long drawn out acid trip. It manages to portray the drug culture for what it is, nothing less nothing more. Exposing some fundamental truths that many seekers seem to miss or just ignore. "The desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending the light at the end of the tunnel. " is what Johnny Depp's character says, and it ties together the madness quite well. There is no truth to be found, there is no great secret, there is no force tending the light at the end of the tunnel, there is no point. Self proclaimed psychonauts will disagree with me. They fundamentally believe that there is something to be learnt from these drugs. As a drug "hobbyist" myself I firmly believe that there is nothing to be gained from these narcotics apart from heavy stimulation and hedonistic madness. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas takes this point and exposes it in an amusing surrealist way that can really only truly be appreciated if you yourself have cowered in sheer horror and wonder at the world around you while your mind is whispering quadruple entendre and exposing you to things through a very confusing lysergide shaded lens. It conveys the lost and failed ideals of the 60s and ties it to the failure to the drug culture. Depp and Del Torro stumble around Las Vegas in a drug induced haze ruining everything they come into contact with, it's humorous to watch. It doesn't hammer you over the head with the point that drugs destroy. Other films like Requiem for a Dream or Spun beat you senseless with the negatives. Fear and Loathing does this in a way that's fun to watch, but still gets to the point or lack thereof. Peace and love in shape of a blot of acid is a lie and a fallacy. But in this same light the film also manages to show the other side. The capitalistic insanity of the modern world and how convoluted things have gotten in our current world. It asks the viewer if reality is so much better than the alternative in the same breath that it chastises drug users and their antics. Is our society any better than the chaos propelled by drug use and it's users? It paints both sides with black humour and it's fantastic to watch and take in. Simply put, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a story about the drug culture and it's failings, but it's also social commentary on our actual culture and it's failings. I don't pretend to have a solution to the problems posed by both sides and neither does the film. And that's what makes it so good, it points things out but doesn't tell you the answer (much like the LSD).Regardless it's a fantastic watch and I think anyone who is delving into psychological drug use should watch it as well as anyone interested in cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Former Monty Python trooper Terry Gilliam is a wonderful director ? 'Brazil (1985)' and 'Twelve Monkeys (1995)' are both close to masterpieces ? but this one went straight over my head. An adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's "unfilmable" semi-autobiographical account of early 1970s drug culture, the film is basically a two-hour narcotics trip, ducking in and out of reality and surreal drug-addled fantasy without warning or explanation. Gilliam's direction is actually quite magnificent, every frame bursting with distorted colours and emotions, but his efforts are wasted on a story than meanders with perplexing aimlessness. The main character, Raoul Duke ? a doppelganger for the novel's author ? often launches into bizarre, pseudo-philosophical monologues on the crumbling state of American counter-culture, but these ultimately come across as little more than smoke and mirrors, the ramblings of a man so hopelessly addled by God-knows-how-many drugs that, to him, everything sounds profound. The best way to look at this film, I suppose, is as a very black comedy, and, indeed, the antics of Duke (Johnny Depp) and his possibly-Samoan attorney (Benicio Del Toro) are occasionally quite amusing.After being assigned to cover a motorcycle race in Nevada, journalist Raoul Duke and his lawyer Dr Gonzo strike off for the bright lights of Las Vegas. In a suitcase, they carry every illicit narcotic known to Mankind since the 16th century, and they aren't content to simple look at them. Is there a point to this film? No ? or, at least, none that I could spy. Then again, the life of a drug addict is itself rather pointless. Gilliam strings together an assortment of vibrant, extravagant, and sometimes nightmarish, set-pieces. The camera distorts reality, tilting from side to side as though wielded by a drunken Robert Krasker; in this way, even the viewers' perception is tainted by the characters' drug use. However, while I did have an occasional chuckle thanks to Johnny Depp, whose performance is superbly eccentric, I didn't feel as though I was enjoying myself. I felt filthy, violated, and it's not a experience I'd care to repeat. Maybe, in order to appreciate this film, one must have used drugs or lived through the 1960s. I haven't done either, and I consider myself all the better for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take a frenzied/drugged-out ride through an EXCELLENT comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this review fresh off seeing the film. I can't risk writing it in a couple of hours or, God forbid, tomorrow lest the insanely intense emotion it has effected upon me should fade away. Terry Gilliam has mastered a profoundly affecting film which slowly starts gathering your senses from the beginning and has, by the end, exploded them in a hilariously shocking array of images and feelings unlike any modern film will expound on you.The film begins with a reporter (Johnny Depp) and his sidekick attorney (Benicio Del Toro) who are heading out to Vegas for a sports news coverage, and have decided to make this trip the ultimate drug-addled adventure. Armed with a suitcase filled with every kind of dangerous and illegal narcotic known to mankind and a crazy drug-induced scheme, we follow their misadventures through Vegas and their chance encounters with a cast of outrageous characters that will make you laugh your head off. J. Hoberman from the Village Voice calls this film "excruciatingly funny", and I couldn't agree more. It so funny it hurts.It is based on Hunter S. Thompson's famous novel, and even though I haven't read the book, I have to admit that the film portrays a drugged-out experience unlike any other drug-based film I've ever seen. Every thing in the movie, from the surreal and twisted photography, to the wildly insane production design, to the crazy wardrobe, to the inciting music to the spot-on performances from the two principal actors will transport you into the outrageous plot and will make you feel as if you are just as drugged-out as the main characters even if you haven't tried a single narcotic in your entire life! Unlike other crazy comedies which are as fictitious and improbable that can't be believed, this film's funny twists and turns are astoundingly believable, and unlike other drug-based comedies which simply seek to make you laugh and have you learn nothing out of the experience, this one aims to share some life knowledge with the viewer and lingers with you as you ponder each and every of the situations it presents. It doesn't take itself too seriously or too slightly, resulting in a literally perfect balance between entertainment value and artistic expression.Have I mentioned it's extremely funny? It's got that rare gift few films have nowadays: you'll want to watch it again.It may not be the best film of the year, nor the funniest, nor the most artistic, nor the most transcendental one...but I can assure you, it's definitely one you won't want to miss.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, challenging, and ridiculous movie with great acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard of this movie I did not know what to expect. Having been unfamiliar with Hunter S. Thompson or his work, and having no experience with any of the drugs in the movie except alcohol and pot, I thought it looked over-the-top, but I had heard great things about it. I knew it was directed by Terry Gilliam, (of Monty Python) and starred Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, so I was inclined to give it a shot. What an experience I was in for! This movie is 2 hours of drug-induced craziness. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, or you are offended by any amount (and I do mean ANY amount) of drug use, then don't watch this movie. It's not for you. The rest of us, however, are in for a treat. The movie takes place in 1972, and follows journalist Raoul Duke and his lawyer Dr. Gonzo as they head to Vegas to cover the Mint 400. They soon forget about the story, however, and focus on the drugs in their suitcase. (acid, mescaline, cocaine, hard liquor, beer, pot, ether, and many, many pills.) Johnny Depp captures Raoul Duke's craziness perfectly, and within the first 25 minutes you already know he is going to be an iconic character. A cigarette always hangs from his mouth, (literally, there is not one scene he is without it) and he has a very distinct voice you won't soon forget. Johnny Depp spent 4 months with the real Hunter S. Thompson, learning his mannerisms, and it shows. As he partakes of every drug in his suitcase, you see the good, the bad, and the hilarious. Johnny Depp truly looks intoxicated throughout most of the movie. I don't know how he did it. Benicio Del Toro is also great, playing Raoul Duke's lawyer Dr. Gonzo perfectly. He is a slightly darker and more violent character, and Benicio Del Toro captures this very well. He is at times funny, and at other times truly scary. He is even more irresponsible than Duke, and does things you truly won't believe. He also captures the madness of being extremely intoxicated on a variety of drugs, just as well as Depp. The two actors also have great chemistry, and they really come across as two long-time buddies who really, really like to get messed up. Director Terry Gilliam also proves to be more than up to the task, and he provides the final piece of the puzzle in creating a movie about two guys drugged out of their minds. The script, which he helped write, is great, as is the camera-work that changes and distorts as the duo take different drugs. He takes the great acting and turns it into a great film. This was a very difficult book to commit to film, as it is so over-the-top that it seems cartoonish at times. Gilliam both grounds the movie enough that it feels real, while still embracing the aspects that make it seem unreal. I do not believe there were many, if any, directors who could have matched his final result. The movie does have a few downsides, however. It probably could have been 10 minutes shorter, and the ending feels abrupt. If they spent more time on it, and a little less on other parts of the movie, it probably would have made this movie a true classic. The movie is also simply too crazy, drug-induced, and challenging for a mainstream audience. While that is good at times, it also means the great acting and directing won't be appreciated by as wide of an audience as it should be. The cameos, while good, distract more that they add to the movie. This is Depp, Del Toro, and Gilliam's movie, and it shows.Overall, I would recommend this movie to those who can handle it. It is truly unique, and one of the few films about which you can say that there are no other movies like it. It took me two viewings to fully appreciate. While there are parts where you feel like the sober guy at a party with a bunch of drunk people, the movie overall conveys the drug use very well. If your on the fence about watching it, or have seen it once and didn't quite get it, I recommend watching it. As the tagline implies, you are truly in for a trip.</fullReview>

When was the last time you ingested, even for a moment, the significance of the one truth that defines what it means to be human -- namely, that you (like all of us) will die? When was the last time that you said to yourself: "God Dagnammit! We're all in the same soup together!"? When was the last time you decided to trash the conventions that were meant to hamstring you and the rest of us into perpetual wimpdom and hypocrisy, and just said: What the #@$%? I don't care. "Fear and Loathing" is a true and entirely realistic account of what it means to be human, conscious, and self-directed in this world. Who, after all, is tending the light at the end of this journey? Hunter Thompson was just another one of us, only he went ahead and balled the jack on experience. His fight, if there was a fight, was with bigger jackasses than the human race could muster. And don't' give me any grief about being dimensionally ripped on jimsonweed and talking to my great grandfather's goat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunter S. Thompson (RIP) was one of the greatest journalists in the United States. He worked for the Rolling Stone and is highly revered. His most famous work was written in 1971 called "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey Into the Heart of the American Dream" (originally published in the magazine), which told the story of journalist Raoul Duke (fictionalized version of Hunter Thompson) and his Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo (really the Chicano attorney, Oscar Zeta Acosta) who cover the Mint 400 while experimenting with a large amount of psychedelic drugs.After suffering a large amount of failures trying to adapt this great novel into a feature film by such great filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese. The duo was played once by Peter Boyle and Bill Murray in the 1980 film "Where the Buffalo Roam", which was heavily panned by critics. Academy Award winners Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson were also once considered to play Gonzo and Duke, but we got two very good actors with very good chemistry in this final and successful attempt to bring the wild world of Hunter S. Thompson to life.Johnny Depp (who is the spitting image of Thompson when bald and wearing the sunglasses) is Raoul Duke. Benicio del Toro is the psychopathic lawyer, Dr. Gonzo. The two begin to plan for a 3-day trip to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400 race. The two bring almost every drug you can name with some booze, all in a suitcase in the trunk of the infamous Great Red Shark convertible. While in Las Vegas, the two friends take a hilarious journey into Hell while on their trip, from torturing the help to terrorizing the citizens.This movie, is a masterpiece which totally captures the vision of Hunter S. Thompson. The novel, is probably also one of the best and funniest books written to date. The film is very faithful in the portrayals of the characters and the recreations of the scenes. All in all, Johnny Depp, Benecio del Toro and Terry Gilliam made one heck of a movie which will leave you laughing for a long time. Classic film.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Similar to Fight Club, Fear and Loathing was unfairly treated by critics. It was labeled "Worst Movie of 1998" by lots of critics. It even got the "Pointless" label. It's really sad that a masterpiece like this got so much panning, because really, Fear and Loathing was INTENTIONALLY pointless. And anyone who has read the book would know this. In fact, with how many rave reviews the book got and how many negative reviews leads me to think that only idiots become critics.Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas is not a drug movie. Sure it has lots of trippy parts and the two characters are stoned almost the whole movie. But this movie is about the American dream and how we look at it.Raoul Duke is a young man with his sidekick Dr. Gonzo on a business trip. Along them is a hot convertible, lots of beer, Raoul's typewriter, and an entire suitcase of hard drugs. With the latter in mind, the word trip becomes a key word, as that's what they do. With time to kill in Vegas, Dr. Gonzo and Raoul go on a disastrous journey that involves misadventure after misadventure, bad trip after bad trip, which leads their lives into a downward spiral.Fear and Loathing is disturbing, but just so funny all at once. Despite the Canadian "PG" rating on the back, this is NOT for the faint-hearted. But if you really look at it, we may never get a movie like this ever again. And the "White rabbit" scene is worth it alone... I was in tears by the end of that scene.So if you can take a good film that's very unconventional you will enjoy this for sure. And remember, "We can't stop here! This is Bat Country!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Throws down an enormous cartoon gauntlet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read (and thoroughly enjoyed) this hilarious book. I have driven on that road many times to Vegas over the decades (most of them giant-bat/cocaine/ether free). I was expecting much from this film. However, I had never had an image of the lead (Raoul Duke) as some kind of psychedelic Groucho Marx. I think that it may be correct to say that this story cannot translate to the cinema and might have been left well-alone. I do not know how any reviewer could give this 10 stars. There are only three or four films in my 50 year old lifetime that I would award 10 stars. Thus, my rating above is higher than it would be, simply for effort if nothing else. Besides, I could not finish watching this putrid offering in one sitting. So if any director thinks that he/she can get studio money to make a better version, they might want to think twice before picking up this gauntlet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilliam's most personal film since The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a film about drugs, although they do feature heavily. In fact, you could perhaps argue that director Terry Gilliam's approach to the film makes such interpretations far too obvious; as the stylistic devises used to convey the feeling of prolonged intoxication becomes so overwhelming that we lose sight of Thompson's original message, if only for a brief period. Obviously, familiarity with Thompson's work and the two short sequences in which Gilliam punctuates the screaming, cartoon-like excesses with a pointed yearning and social critique brings the whole thing together; underlining the original spirit and intentions of the book and leaving us with that sense of overwhelming hope in the face of cultural and spiritual defeat. These were truly dark days, with everyone too busy getting high or getting lost to notice what was happening - not only in America, but all around the world - as the generation that had attempted to bring about a social change for the better got fat and rich and turned into their fathers. There's an inherent sadness in this idea that is captured perfectly by Thompson and expressed by his colourful alter-ego Raoul Duke, as he huddles over his typewriter in a Vegas hotel room reflecting on the great wave that promised so much, but delivered so little.Once we get past the drugs, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) is clearly about the pursuit of the American dream; from liberty, freedom and creative expression in the most hollow and affected place in the universe - where the former spirit and defiance of the 60's generation has given way to apathy and self-loathing - to the blurring of fact and fiction, fantasy and reality; as a continual bombardment of creative excess and satirical abstraction captures that overwhelming sense of confusion, escape and pursuit that gives way to something that is part acid flashback, part Disney fantasia. We assume that Gilliam developed this tone as a way of appropriating the bizarre and iconic sketches of artist Ralph Steadman, whose illustrations in Thompson's work really define the world and the characters of the text. However, the way that Gilliam envisions the film not only attunes our mind to the perspective of these bloated, drug-fuelled characters, but creates an exaggerated sense of America at this point in time; reducing characters to caricatures, scenes to sketches and the overall feeling from period-piece polemic, to a mocking cartoon satire.It makes sense in the context of Gilliam's career and seems to capture very personal feelings for the director; an expatriate American who left his own country as the war in Vietnam began to escalate, and after almost twenty-years of documenting a cinema of dreams, found himself moving back to America with varied films like The Fisher King (1991) and 12 Monkeys (1995). If the latter gave us a depiction of America as a microcosm of insanity against a backdrop of post-apocalyptic despair, then Fear and Loathing gives us the prelude. Here, we find an introduction of peace and love hippie-revellers and earnest protesters washed away on an opening credit that drips, blood-like across the screen, as an eerie version of My Favourite Things from The Sound of Music (1965) plays on the soundtrack. It suggests the idea of American innocence on the road to inevitable destruction, as the next cut introduces two stoned criminals speeding down the desolate highway into the heart of the American dream. Again, the idea that the characters go searching for the American dream and find it in Las Vegas is satire at its most cruel and perverse; as the rutting lounge lizards and distorted faces of jaded hotel employees becomes a depiction, not of what the world would look like on drugs, but as a mere hint of what it might look like without them!With this in mind, Vegas becomes the ultimate setting; a great big pile of money in the middle of the desert dressed up with a plastic fantastic veneer that cries in the reverberated soulless soul of Elvis impersonators and Tom Jones. It is the one place in the world in which the magic and the landmarks of every great country is reduced to the level of a cheap icon to be bought and sold; that vision of America creating a culture from cannibalising the rest of the world and wallowing in phony glitz and glamour, where the only mark of success is how much money you arrive with, and how much you take home. In Gilliam's world the heat and hypocrisy of Vegas is overwhelming, but it never strays from farce. There's a humour here, more in keeping with The Simpsons than Fellini or Bu?uel, as the character fumble and tumble about this exaggerated landscape amidst Gilliam's continually brilliant directorial touches and the revolving-door sideshow of supporting players and celebrity cameos. It also helps that the lead roles are filled by actors as talented and daring as Depp and Del Toro; who both thrown themselves into the spirit of the film and the shared vision of Thompson and Gilliam completely, to produce this random, rambling and at times completely ugly film that brims with character, imagination, vigour and intent.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a bold work; one that takes on the ideas of Thompson's book and the satirical exaggerations of Steadman's sketches and creates a film that on the surface seems bright, colourful, screaming and surreal, but ultimately reveals a more thoughtful side that goes back to Thompson's comment on the changing American landscape of the early 1970's and that spirit and energy that burned so brightly only to extinguish itself at the first sign of defeat. Again, it's not a film about drugs, although they do feature heavily. Instead, Gilliam creates a portrait of America where the complete void of existence is filled by vices of over-indulgence (could be drugs, could be sex, could be television); and perhaps the last truly inspiring American film of the twentieth century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What the hell did I just watch? These were the first, the only, thoughts that came to mind as the perpetually bizarre 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' faded to black. Classifying Terry Gilliam's film a unique experience doesn't do the project justice, it stands alone in a league of its own. And while it makes very little sense and gets lost somewhere in the smoldering deserts of Arizona, the always fascinating Johnny Depp makes this a trip worth taking, even for a one-time deal.'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' finds Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro en route to Las Vegas, they're trunk packed full with drugs. Drugs, drugs, and more drugs. Depp, whose journalism character is on his way to cover a motorcycle race, narrates 'Fear and Loathing' through a constant daze of mind-altering psychedelics. It is perhaps the only coherent construct of an otherwise hypnotic wreck. A swarm of (invisible) attacking bats on a desolate highway and a reptile zoo in the middle of a hotel lounge are only two of the many oddities that helps jump start 'Fear and Loathing' to a hilariously trippy start.All good things must come to an end, and somewhere along the line 'Fear and Loathing' hits a bad trip. What little substance was there to begin with dries up in the Vegas deserts, and the film veers off-track and never fully recovers. And though the humor begins to wear out its welcome and what exists of a plot stalls with no forward momentum, the film remains watchable in an oddly transfixing sort of way. It's the dedicated performance from Johnny Depp that's the glue that holds the whole the together as he fully immerses himself in this indescribably strange role. Unsurprisingly, it fits him very well. With a mindlessly babbling del Toro by his side, 'Fear and Loathing' does at least one thing by the books: it boasts impressive performances.'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' is a slice of American culture, a twisted and outlandish ride that takes us back to a country fresh out of the 60s. The Vietnam war still going strong, but the wave of optimistic free-love now just a memory. It's a nation-wide hangover, and Terry Gilliam is here to show us every sleazy, dirty, uncensored detail of a nation running low on hope. 'Fear and Loathing' doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and it probably isn't supposed to. But this is one incoherent mess that also doubles as a fascinating look at an American era, and I found it an intriguing study every step of the way.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&amp;view=public</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that looks great but is lacking in most other ways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can never call Terry Gilliam's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" a terrible movie but it really isn't very good either. Maybe this is a perfect example of me simply being unable to look past all the disagreements I have with the author of the novel this film was based on, even if Gilliam attempts to put his own spin on Scott's ideas and experiences. It's hard to get past the fact that this is a film based on the semi-fictionalized experiences of an alcoholic, drug-addicted NRA member who publicly supported the use of such substances and the 'right to bear arms' (that didn't end too well for him, did it?).Even past my personal disagreement with Thompson (and no, I'm not 'misunderstanding' this film. I see how this is in several ways not a film that glamorizes drug use) I can't find much to enjoy in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" aside from its technical elements. The arguments in the film's favor don't convince me and though I do appreciate in several ways what it's trying to do there's nothing here to convince me that this is a quality film. Sure, the cinematography is excellent and the film has a unique and captivating look, but beyond that it's a mess. I didn't like Depp or Del Toro in this at all, and the script, much like its source is a complete mess. This film is pointless, ugly, silly, and far too pointed and obvious to make much of an impact.The film has a built-in cult audience and even a Criterion release. Perhaps under the 'great or important' banner Criterion uses this fits; I can see how this may be considered 'important' and it certainly is a very unique and unusual movie. Of course, only half of this audience likes the movie for the right reasons, the rest being mostly either teenagers or young twenty-somethings with a silly affection for drugs and alcohol. "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" can be fun in spots, and the humor is especially potent when compared to the rest of the film, but overall this is, and I know I'm repeating myself, a complete mess. It's sort of sad, really, as this could've made a fine film. Terry Gilliam will be remembered as a great director, I'm sure of that, but I will never consider this even remotely close to his best. 4/10</fullReview>

Though not a straight out comedy by any sense, I haven't laughed this hard watching a movie in years. Countless crazy scenes, from that lizard bar shot, to the bathtub scene with Del Toro nearly frying himself.

		<fullReview>This film is at turns brilliant, excruciatingly funny, grotesquely disturbing, and in one spot even touching and beautiful. What gets me again and again is, how on earth is Gilliam able to take Hunter Thompson's book, and make it into this vivid, experiential piece that hits you like a freight train. Some kind of creative force of nature, this man is. If it seems to get dragging and messy in some spots...well...creation is messy. I love this piece as a whole, including the imperfections.Fear and Loathing is about a lot of things, much more than just two men on a demented, depraved, prolonged drug binge. And it is more than just an adaptation of Hunter Thompson's famous novel. It has a life of its own, makes political, social, personal statements, and the way Gilliam's wit and imagination synergizes with that of Thompson's makes this a compelling and unique experience. I would give it two or three viewings initially, to let it sink in. The Perl of the whole thing is when the narrator reminisces about the mid-60s...a glimpse of peace and beauty amidst the chaos that surrounds it...the centre of the vortex.</fullReview>

Once again, Johnny Depp is at an oddball role, playing Hunter Thompson (the journalist, who was a real person and actually wrote the book the movie is based upon as a form of memoir).Humorous, at times, and twisted, the movie features such memorable lines as "We can't stop now, this is bat country!" and "Tell me about the... golf shoes!" among a myriad of others.Certainly entertaining, and definitely a suitable time waster.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To dismiss this film, as a film of obscene drug use and crude behaviour is simply ignorant. What are films after all? They explore art and this film certainly achieves this with promise.let's start off with the characters, Johnny Depp plays Raoul Duke ( Hunter's fictional character) and Del toro as the attorney (oscar costa). The combination of these two actors, both method,as i should point out, is the stand out of this movie to the point where you are so immersed in their mannerisms and behaviours, that you seldom forget to watch out for so many interesting backdrops that Gilliam(Director) intended to show. Its simply a movie you have to watch over and over again, and just keeps getting better. I've been a fan of Johnny Depp for a while and have always admired him as the greatest actor in our generation, not only for his acting but also his attitude toward Hollywood. Which is why he has done such a brilliant job in this classic, having the ability to let go and show his real acting capabilities in true anti-Hollywood manner. Del Toro also gets a standing ovation, and I have certainly gained new found respect for the man.You can watch this movie without drugs, but what for? You'd be missing out on the true hunter S. Thompson experience, for which this movie was made for. Gonzo Journalism. The act of story-telling on the move. Terry Gilliam, together with the collaboration of a dedicated cast and crew, have created a true artistic masterpiece. Hats off to Laila Nabulsi (producer), who i want to make a special mention because I think if it where not for her, this film would never have been created.For the true enthusiasts, read the book and get the critereon collection DVD edition, there are heaps of extras that Hollywood wouldn't advocate.</fullReview>

I have been to Las Vegas 6 times in all of these states of mind and have never seen a performance by any 2 actors more worthy of international recognition than Benicio Del Toro and of course the infinitely dynamic Johnny Depp.I remember when a friend I worked with at an Animal Care clinic told me to go see "A Clockwork Orange". I respected him and thought he was a maniacally brilliant observer of human behaviour. So I watched Stanley Kubrick's greatest masterpiece with awe and complete reverence and ecstasy! The same feelings were experienced when I watched F.A.L.I.L.V. for the first time. I had some how managed to miss F.A.L.I.L.V. due to living in Newfoundland Canada at the time. Of all the movies of my generation from Star Wars to The Matrix no other movie or book has impacted my conscious the same.No matter how messed up things can get you can always maintain your mind with focused ego. I have remembered Johnny's portrayal of H.S.Thompson (aka Raoul Duke) and that alone makes me howl in fits of laughter.It saddens me today here in the Summer of 2006 that when I ask co-workers or certain people about those movies that they have no idea wtf I am talking about. But I do my best to spread the word so that just like myself back in 1992 when I first saw "A Clockwork Orange" and changed my life, that I may pass on the same experience to someone else is worth it.Go see this movie as my highest of high inspirers Hunter S. Thompson once said: "Buy the ticket, enjoy the ride!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, it did. Hands down my favourite movie of all time. And it ain't just about drugs, kids. "Fear and Loathing," like the book, is as much if not more about politics and reaction against the boringly insane culture we live in. It's as relevant today as it was when Thompson wrote it. Both actors turn in brilliant performances, the direction is appropriately breathless and manic, and even the special effects still hold up well. In these times of new age conservatism and general stupidity on both sides of the political divide, we need more writers like Thompson, freaking out in front of everybody just to spark a reaction. We certainly need more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing film about drugs and much more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's quirky Fear &amp; loathing in las vegas is my favorite film yet fromt his director. Gilliam impresses me hear much more than in Brazil and The Brothers Grimm, and even more than the memorable Twelve Monkeys. Fear &amp; loathing is a dark look at a crazy trip by a journalist and his supposed lawyer to las vegas. The two experiment with virtually every drug possible and have halucinations that are brought to screen quite realistically. Gilliam style fits perfect here, as weirdness is exactly what people on these types of drugs feel. I thought Johnny Depp's performance was absolutely great.... this guy is pretty versatile. I liked Benicio Del Toro as well, one of his best performances. All in all this is a great film and if your viewing tolerance of some crazy *beep* is high than you will love this film as much as me. 10/10</fullReview>

We are currently in 2006, and this movie is 8 years old?"!!! Some of the drugs those guys were on looked to have done the job rightly, if ya know what I mean! Johny Depp is a legend and the scene in the bar in the hotel when he was trippin' on the acid was funny bananas. Golf shoes have never been the same for me since. Ah well - what do you think the chances are of another Depp drug induced film coming out in the near future? Slim to none I guess, but we can always hope. Over and out Roger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you never smoked pot, this is the closest you'll get to knowing what it's like out there.There's a completely different world, not better and no worse, just different. A different perception, where material things somehow vanish, and what remains is pure feeling and vision. This would be the closest way to describe Gilliam's visionary and plastic work. Wheather your visit to this world is productive or not is the difference between visionary and voyeur.Terry Gilliam has certainly visited that world, as have many other artistic great minds, and brought back the closest thing to a virtual tour. Lavishly displayed colors, blurry contours, psychedelic sounds with style, and one of the greatest insights into the mind under the influence of "substances" portrayed with the assistance of fellow long time visitors of the "world of altered perception", and brilliant actors Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reprisal of the American dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a thinking man's story. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (FLLV) is based on a short novel by Hunter S. Thompson. If you're reading this, I hope you've probably already watched the movie, and/or read the book, and are at least vaguely familiar with the story.But what is the story? What is all this madness about? Did these events actually occur? That's the questions I hope you find yourself asking at this point. I've considered this story to be many things for the past year, since my first viewing of the movie to reading the book and more. I finally understand why this story was ever made.Hunter Thompson is well known to his fans and is vaguely popular in general as a journalist. His focus primarily political, even up to his final years.FLLV is about the search for the American dream. But how do excessive abuse of drugs fit into this picture? How does destroying two hotel rooms and two cars add up in this story? Why is excessively loud music in such demand? In what way does pack ratting excessive amounts of food and supplies from the hotel account in this crazy story? It seems to be Hunter's opinion of the American dream is only one thing: wretched excess. We are flooded with this in the story. Even the verbiage is excessive! Hunter Thompson is a true genius, if for no other reason that he could consider a story on so many excessive levels! Drug abuse isn't the theme of this movie. No, instead it seems to be that excessive drug use is the only way Thompson could ever imagine himself truly embracing the wretched excess that is the American dream. It would take a lot to twist someone sensible into accepting that Las Vegas represents everything that American's, or human beings for that matter, want in life.Las Vegas could easily be considered the epicenter of this excess. It's the perfect place for excess. People can excessively gamble and enjoy it, and the casino operators can smile excessively while their collecting all those lost bets! The question is, who own's the American dream? Gambling represents something very special in this story. It's a metaphor for those who live in futility trying to "win big". Does it really matter if you're considering odds at the craps table, lottery, stock market, or illegal drug trade? It's still a huge gamble any way it goes. Blowing your paychecks or life savings gambling, is that the American dream? "No no, calm down, learn to enjoy losing." But just as in real life corporate America is running everything. Or are they? Perhaps they're only enablers of our wretched excess, simply their to help themselves as they watch us live piggish? This is why Thompson wrote "the wave speech" in regards to Las Vegas. If there's any place in the world that represents corporate control and propaganda, it's Las Vegas. I hope that what I've written here is somewhat accurate. One thing's for sure, this edited review is much more meaningful than the tripe I had posted before. I hope it's worthy of this great story."Don't worry it doesn't add up, that's our problem." 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilliam's imagination ensures an acid trip for anyone watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is possibly one of Terry Gilliam's best films, yet also one of his most underrated. The main reason for this is the over excessive nature of the film and the fact that it is highly unpalatable for average cinema audiences. What a lot of people don't understand, is that this film is not glorifying drugs in anyway and audiences appeared to ignore the main characters' unpleasant and embarrassing experiences throughout the film.The offbeat character of Raoul Duke could only be played by Johnny Depp. Depp's perfection at playing peculiar, awkward characters is what gives Fear and Loathing its heart and its incredibly funny sense of dark humour. The movements with his body are fantastic to watch and greatly compliment the surreal imagery of the film. The way he delivers his lines with such paranoid, sometimes schizophrenic, tones makes his character totally believable. This can not be said, however, of Benicio Del Torro as he acts more like a caricature but this does illustrate the effects of particular drugs suitably. Overweight, ugly and riotous, his character is utterly repulsive and demonstrates the dark side of drugs very powerfully.It is not Depp's great performance that makes this film so great, it is Terry Gilliam's surreal vision and speciality for the bizarre that gives Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas the edge. Gilliam does an awesome job at making the audience see the world through the eyes of drug abusers. The camera motions, the colouring and the hallucination effects enable the audience to be on the same trip without touching a single drug. Terry Gilliam was a perfect choice to direct this film as he is such an experimental, artistic director.The 60s/70s soundtrack is a terrific accompaniment to Fear and Loathing as it encapsulates the mood of the period perfectly. The psychedelic sounds match what is seen on picture to further enhance attack on the audience's senses. Depp's conclusive narrative at the end of the film is very introspective and does really well to bring the film to a more serious front and show that drugs isn't all fun and games and voiced the opinions of many people from the same generation.With great imagination and Depp on top form, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a wonderfully different, enjoyable film that puts the audience on a trip they'll never forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best political films of the late 90s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While many people pass over this as being either a drug movie, or a film too confusing to pay attention to... I think the real point of the film (and the book) is about the politics of the era and how Thompson felt affected by people like Nixon, who Thompson blamed for the death of the American Dream.That said, my one disappointment is that they didn't have a scene of Duke and Gonzo at the Tacoburger restaurant. That particular portion of the search for the American Dream is integral to the main focus of the book, so it seems strange that it didn't make it into the film.Still, great performances from Depp and Del Toro, as well as the many cameos in the film, a great script, and some excellent directing from Terry Gilliam all come together to make this a full 10 snowflake movie.Buy the ticket, take the ride... And above all, READ THE BOOK!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this in 1998 at a Hermosa Beach theater. I kind of liked it. Mostly I thought it was a mess.But I bought the DVD years later. And I was absorbed by it. I started quoting lines from it constantly. And became fascinated by the legend that was Hunter S. Thompson.And when Hunter killed himself shortly after that. Strangely the movie suddenly had more meaning to me in a twisted way.The film is a savage take on the American dream. It's a patriotic film believe it or not. Hunter S. Thompson was a gun rights enthusiast and a big believer in libertarian capitalism.The movie is a (highly) flawed masterpiece.

When you watch it, please pay attention to every little detail on the screen....i promise you it will mess with your mind. Depps performance of Thompson (Duke) is incredible, I must say that i would love to see more of him and Del Torro together in another movie.

		<shortDescription>Hard to classify</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film seems a bit hard to classify. Personally I enjoy provocative, uncommon or controversial if you will kind of films. This is definitely one of them. The film is based on a novel (wich I have not read) written by Hunter S. Thompson. OK that fact isn't really important to me but I've read in other comments that it's a very actual depiction of the book and that it's better to read the book first before seeing the film.I thought the performances especially by Depp were good. Raoul Duke/Hunter S. Thompson seemed like a very odd character. The same or worse could be said about Dr. Gonzo/Oscar Z. Acosta played by Del Toro. The funny thing about these characters is that about 90% of the film we see them behave in extremely thoughtless, irresponsible and immoral ways. But on the other hand we get an assumption that there is this careful, conscious or even responsible side of the characters (well at least for Depp).At the end we don't know why the characters behave the way they do. Maybe it's to show the double morality of the modern world. On one hand Raoul Duke is a doctor of journalism on the other hand he is absolutely thoughtless and irresponsible some would even say a criminal.The thing that bothered me about this film that there isn't a red line or an obvious message and not even a plot. It seems hard to classify because on one hand we have good acting, interesting monologues by Depp, good direction but on the other hand the film seems like a bit of a mess because of all the various events that are taking place and that don't seem to make a lot of sense........ +3/5 (I guess)</fullReview>

This movie truly captures what the novel originally did, the realization of the real American dream, if there in fact is one. Do not be mislead by those who watch this movie as an acid bible, because that is not the purpose of the film nor the novel, although some understanding of the culture is required. This movie shows the American dream of greed and degradation through the example of several days in las vegas. This movie is brilliant and almost as brilliant as the novel. Hunter S. Thompson will truly be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hunter Thompson probably liked this movie, and it is likely that Depp's characterization was greatly influenced by his consultation with Thompson.The rambling narrative is full of psychotic energy, and the more bizarre it gets, the harder it gets to avert your eyes from the screen. It is like watching a series of train wrecks hanging upside down from a helicopter over the tracks.I discovered reefer, mescaline and acid more or less at the same time in my 27th year (1969), and must admit that the roller-coaster ride of the "psychedelic experience" was always as frightening and enjoyable for me as it seemed to be for Raoul and Dr. Gonzo. I can't say that these marvelous drugs made me a better person, but they let me look at the world in a different way. Thank you, Hunter S.

I can't mention the excellent play of Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro they seems to be just "alive". No matter do you like junkies or not this film is "must see" for anyone, just don't get to it with full seriousness, merry peace of mind is the best mood for it, and most probably you will not get it from the first time.

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam fell down on this one I think. I am a BIG fan of his films, especially 'Brazil' but 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' strikes me as a bit of a cheap shot on his part. His trademark, and usually hilarious, distortions are present, notably in the LSD induced camera tricks and Katherine Helmond is there as she was in 'Brazil' with her face being pulled around like taffy, but that isn't enough to evoke many laughs. The attempt to capture the true nightmare world that is Las Vegas is overdone. I got more satisfaction watching Tim Burton simply destroy it with his creatures in 'Mars Attacks!'.Benicio del Torres and Johnny Depp are a good comedy team but they haven't got much to work with. I like del Torres' manic Dr Gonzo. He carries the movie when it flags in energy. I also enjoy Christina Ricci whenever she appears in any film. Her dark, pouty face is funny without her speaking a word. Her appearance as a little girl in the court room with a big ribbon in her hair is memorable. And it's wonderful to see Ellen Barkin on top form as the tragic waitress near the end of this hodge-podge movie. Gilliam managed to evoke a "burned-out" headache in me about 1/3 of the way through and I was glad when the whole thing came to an end.Hunter S. Thompson is very "in" because he's a senior citizen who has survived heroin abuse and just-about-everything-else abuse as well as being an ersatz political/societal commentator but his "subject" in life always strikes me as being a bit empty and "pop".The technical side of 'Fear and Loathing..." is up to Gilliam's usual high standards, the actors are very good; it's the subject matter that bores.Worth seeing but I'm sorry I bought the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a perfect adaptation of the book by Hunter Stockton Thompson. It has all, and more that the books offers, it is an amazing art of film.First, the cast is awesome. The lead roles casted perfectly with Depp and Del Toro, these two guys just transform into Thompson and Gonzo on screen... Depp totally got Thompson's weird moves, while Del Toro often looks scary as Dr. Gonzo. The bathroom scene looked quite scary the first time I saw it... The other roles are also well cast, with the likes of Flea, Gary Busey and Tobey Maguire making a brief, but comic appearance.The music is great 70's all the way, and it sets the right mood for you. The likes of Jefferson Airplane's White Rabbit (in the bathroom scene) and the Rolling Stones' Jumping Jack Flash (at the ending) are to stay with you for your entire life...The direction is well done, Terry Gilliam is the perfect choice for a film like this, after doing a couple of surreal masterpieces, he had no problem of the visual portraying of the usage of different drugs. From the strong visuals of the LSD to the slow confusion of mescaline, Gilliam always finds the way for the perfect visualization of hallucinations.Overall, it is a great movie, and I think it will stand as a timeless classic. And to reflect to some people's thoughts: you can enjoy this movie without any kind of drugs. 10/10.</fullReview>

Best performance = Johnny Depp. Gary Busey is memorable in a tiny role as a highway patrolman. You really need to read the book first.

		<fullReview>Faithful adaptation of one of the shortest works of literary genius of modern times. Period setting (1971) in a truly hellish Las Vegas is very evocative of the mentality of the times - the counterculture is represented here by the protagonist. Raoul Duke played superbly by Johnny Depp - a great mimick of the real HST, although nearly a foot shorter. Duke's sidekick Dr.Gonzo is here played by Benicio Del Toro, who makes him into a monster, rightly or wrongly. Mixed audience reation due to troubling material and heavy stylization (dutching,etc.) but importantly the humour of the book is retained. Stands up to repeated viewing due to the great detail and general visual interest in Las Vegas. Strong hell metaphors pervade throughout. Unfortunately two great scenes from the book are missing - bullying the DA at the convention and the final chapter are lost but who's complaining? Well, lots of people are, but NOT ME.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie succeeds on several accounts. Firstly, it is the best adaptation of a novel I have ever seen produced. There is very little material that is missing. Most of the dialogue has remained more or less intact. Secondly, Gilliam has a great eye for set design. The visuals are stunning and truly capture Las Vegas as seen through the eyes of HST. Thirdly, the acting is simply sublime. Dep has the Thompson manerisms down to such a high degree, you have to keep reminding yourself that it's not actually HST up there on the screen. Dep and Thompson formed a friendship during the production of this movie and if you look at Dep's more recent films, you can see the influence that Thompson imparted in his friend. This was never a movie that would have wide appeal; it's too far past the edge for a wide audience to appreciate. That's fine with me. I can't wait for The Rum Diaries!</fullReview>

It is hysterically funny and the acting of Depp and Del Toro is the best I've ever seen from both of them. The universe Gilliam creates with the art direction and cinematography is flawless. It's poetic, tragic, and seamless pure magic. It's hard to say if there was a script or if much of the film was ad-libbed because it's so spontaneously acted. You have to watch it again and again to catch all the dialogue. In the spirit of Sling Blade it has this incredible taut tension throughout as if something terrible is going to happen, but ironically that is what eventually provides the biggest laughs; the "seriousness" of the trip.....</fullReview>

I've never tried ether or devil ether but I can only assume it's just as bad(if not worse)..Great cinematography. Some of the best and most beautiful shots I've ever seen..A really amazing adaptation of a non-fiction book. Terry Gilliam made the film look totally surreal and psychotic and captured the book's art's insane acid-trip design..A more effective anti-drug campaign than that rubbish Requiem for a Dream. I saw Dr.Gonzo and Raoul Duke acting like morons and I don't think I'm going to do drugs ever.Cons:.Like the book, there is a minimal look at the supporting cast, but to the book's credit, it's mainly a memoir of Thompson's experience covering the motorcycle race.9.5/10Go see this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Arguably the finest character actor of his generation, Jonny Depp brings Hunter S Thompsons bizarre alter ego Raoul Duke to life in one of the most mentally unhinged movies i have ever seen. Fear and Loathing takes the viewer along for the ride as Depp and Benicio Del Torro travel to Las Vegas in search of the American dream. To aid them in their quest they have a collection of multicoloured narcotics, a fast car with no top, some acapulco shirts and a level of mental depravity seldom seen. The plot is almost identical to that of Thompsons novel, clearing up his drug induced ramblings and almost managing to construct a linear storyline from the carnage. Depp plays Duke perfectly, his dialogue superbly delivered in a clipped, serious voice which works well with his overly dramatic facial expressions and caricature like walk. Del Torro mumbles his way through the majority of the film, only clearing up occasionally to offer Duke some "legal advice". The imagery on display here is hugely over the top and humourous, this is not a movie to be taken seriously, it wants you to laugh at it. It would be rude to refuse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie about a great book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing is the kind of movie that you need to watch a few times to get the full impact of it and catch everything that's happening. Johnny Depp becomes Hunter S. Thompson and gives the performance of his career in this adaptation. The film lifts a lot of it's dialogue directly from the book and that really helps bring the impact that Thompson was trying to have with his book. The film is not a normal cinematic story but instead a tale of the times, a diary of the excesses of the 1970's. Told by Depp and featuring the supremely talented Benicio Del Toro, this beautifully shot story takes us in and around Las Vegas on a whirlwind, drug soaked ride. The cinematography is wonderful as is Terry Gilliam's direction. He's a very visual director and was the best possible choice to direct this very visual movie. Bottom Line: Fear and Loathing is a great flick that not everyone gets. If you get it and you like it then you're in with the rest of us. If you don't then you are doomed to remain on the outskirts of cool forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Johnny Depp Makes the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without Depp where would movies be. This movie is a funny and sometimes surprising look at one story told of a sports writer who was very deep into the life of drugs. The movie was very strange at times and if you did not pay close attention you probably would get lost.It does glorify drugs a little but shows the bad things about them as well. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who does not understand that drugs are not fun but can kill you. The actors were great. Del Torro does an excellent job as the lawyer and like I said before Johnny Depp makes the film. I can't wait to see the The Rum Diary which I here is going to start filming soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's the foul year of our Lord, 1971. The paranoid journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and intensely interesting Dr. Gonzo (Benicio del Toro) head out to Las Vegas to cover the Mint 400. But they are not alone, along with them they probably bring over 20 types of drugs, and a head full of bats! This is an excellent adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's book, Terry Gilliam's dizzying directing style really fits well in this post-hippie era, and Johnny Depp's performance is THE best I've seen in a while. The only weak point of this movie, is most likely the third act, but the unforgettable ending sequence takes care of that. And this is pretty well made, considering they were trying to adapt the book on a budget of $18,500,000. A must see for all potheads, fans of the book, and fans of Terry and Johnny, and other people who can't get over how the charismatic style of the 60's changed so dramatically.***1/2 / ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, the film did not seem to be made for the purpose of entertainment, so if that's what you're expecting, don't bother. Rather, the film was the telling of a story, and also the most accurate and loyal conversion of book to movie I've ever witnessed.Overall, "Fear and Loathing" was offensive, crude, vulgar, grotesque, and provocative... ...and I positively loved it. In a world of popcorn cinema, "Fear and Loathing" is that kernel that wedges itself between your teeth and doesn't let go. A film that gutsy and well executed is a rare and bracing treat.My compliments to Thompson, Gilliam, Del Toro, Depp, and everyone involved. Thank you so very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so, it's not really clean, but whatever, it's still worth watching. I rented it the other day for the first time, and I have watched it 3 times already, and will probably watch it a few more times before I have to return it. I love this movie. Already entered into my Top 20.Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro star as a journalist and his attourney on a trip through Las Vegas to, original, do a reporting job on a motorcycle race. Instead, they take an exorbitant amount of drugs and alcohol and from there everything goes straight to hell.Save for the very basic plot set up to get the two main characters to Las Vegas, there really is no point to the story. It just meanders through the experiences of the two main characters as they take drugs, trash hotels, and act like total idiots.The parts of the main characters are played extremely well by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. Johnny Depp is almost unrecognizable as Raoul Duke, using body language to get across the character, and Benicio Del Toro plays the paranoid addict to the T.Terry Gilliam was perfect for this movie, using a large number of camera tricks to give the film a very surreal feel to it. The cinematography wasalso done brilliantly for this movie.So, in the end, if you have a twisted sense of humor, and find watching the psychedelic antics of two drugged out guys sound like a good way to spend a Friday night, then you should definitely see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daring drug comedy is a non-stop laughing classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam, the man behind Brazil and 12 Monkeys, brings us a drug comedy unlike any other. If you thought Half-baked was good, you ain't seen nothing until you see Fear and Loathing. The lead characters are Raoul Duke(Johhny Depp) and his lawyer/companion Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro). Duke gets an assignment to cover the Mint 400 bike race in Las Vegas and the two figure that this was the perfect way to live out their American Dream. That dream being drugs, and lots of them. The plot is pretty useless as the two wonder Vegas while tripping, rolling, smack,crack, and ether to just name a few. The camera work is also as erratic as ever (Gilliam's style) but it fits well with the under-the-influence characters. Del Toro gained quite a bit of weight for the role, and I think it made his accent slur even more because alot of what he says sounds like he is talking in his sleep. Depp steals the victory with Duke. Always with a cigarette holder in his mouth, Depp shows much depth and craziness in the wild mind of Duke you'd think they gave him the drugs to get the feel for them. Watch his expressions and reactions especially. Silly, daring, and just plain strange but so was Clockwork Orange.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to make it heard loud and clear that Fear and Loathing never recieves the credit it deserves. Del Toro and Depp are simply phenomenal in their portrayals of two wonderfully twisted characters. I don't think it is possible to underestimate the difficulty of acting under the influence of certain substances that the two (hopefully) have never consumed in real life. Furthermore, for those of viewers who are prone to discredit the movie based on its heavy drug influences/referrences, I advise you to pay close attention to moments like Depp's monologue from the hotel room regarding the flower generation. There is MUCH more going on in this film than simplistic drug humor. I feel sorry that some people seem incapable of realizing the wonderful social commentary contained within. I would also add that this movie has achieved cult classic status in many social spheres and should not be breezed past. I highly recommend this film for anyone, excepting small children and the elderly, of course.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is by far one of, if not the best, drug humor movies I have seen. However, you will have to enjoy drug humor in order to fully enjoy this movie. So don't get angry at the movie if YOU don't know what mescaline is, or why they are acting this or that way. If you don't understand drugs, don't bother seeing this movie. It will make no sense to you and be only mildly humorous. HOWEVER, if you have some familiarity with psychedelic drugs, this movie will be much better. You will understand considerably more than someone who has no clue as to what, for example, acid is like. I think that's what I like about this movie the most. It's really a massive inside joke played upon all the straight, drug free, conservative drones who came to see this movie, didn't understand the humor, and thought it made no sense. Maybe that's why I absolutely love it.Ah, if only more Hunter S. Thompson books were made into movies (preferably with the same great cast)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pitch-perfect depiction of drug culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a perfect movie, but it is not a film for everyone. If great art presents an insightful and accurate reflection of reality, then Gilliam's film is certainly great art. Every note in the film (minus one: the actual Hunter S. Thompson's cameo) is carefully choreographed to represent precisely the human mind on drugs. Of course, not everyone has the same reaction to drugs, and not everyone would have specifically this reaction to the mountain of drugs that Depp and Del Toro's characters consume (many people would probably die). However, the film perfectly embodies the overall sensations, emotions, and behaviors of drug use (albeit often exaggerated, due to the exaggerated drug intake of the characters). Not much happens in this film plot-wise: the characters drive to Las Vegas, Depp attends a bike race, they do drugs, they go around town at night, the start heading back to L.A., they go back to Vegas, they do drugs, etc. etc. etc. But that doesn't matter, because this is not a film about its content nearly as much as its style: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is Terry Gilliam's supreme stylistic achievement, a virtuoso piece of filmmaking sensationally depicting the consciousness of drug use. It is sort of the comedic cousin to Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. I would also like to say that there are certainly deep and profound understandings of drug use in this film, often specific to America in the 1960s: Del Toro's angry disgust with all things Vietnam is perhaps the best example. But the film does not dwell on these facets. It focuses on the reality of drugs, while maintaining a quiet intelligence about the place and role of drugs in society. Depp and Del Toro's characters are men who no longer feel they can cooperate with a culture that kills and excludes and injures so casually. They have no easy answers, and all they can think to do is live by their own rules, offering a tacit condemnation of the accepted American lifestyle. However, Gilliam never preaches or grandstands, and these elements are present but never dominant. For people who have never done drugs or have no interest in them, this film may seem a facile joke. However, it is not; it is very deliberately considered portrayal of drug use and drug culture, a film that reflects a reality in our world with wonderful comedic exactitude. The cast is outstanding: Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are at their absolute best, plus the film features wonderful cameos from Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Gary Busey, Cameron Diaz, Ellen Barkin, and others. Special praise must also go to Jenette Goldstein for her absolutely fabulous scene as Alice the Maid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wild, wacky, drug induced ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In typical fashion, certain brilliantly conceived films are machine-gunned by many critics only to have them emerge as cult classics over time. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas has certainly achieved cult status in record time.This wild, wacky, drug induced ride along the phantasmagoric highway known as America's Cultural Revolution was Hunter S. Thompson's most famous contribution to our modern day literary annals trying to encapsulate the absurdity of our society at that time.Kudos to director Terry Gilliam for tackling a difficult book and keeping the spirit of gonzo journalism alive. It took nearly 30 years for Thompson's ravaging prose to leap off the page and onto the screen, and at times it's difficult to absorb. However, the performances of Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro force the viewer to pay attention throughout.I can appreciate how hordes of viewers and critics had problems with this film during its theatrical release. It was severely misunderstood by many folks who were not even aware of life in the 60's and 70's or Thompson's acerbic wit. It's disjointed, insane, But, now with the advent of home video and especially special features packed DVDs, viewers can have a second chance along with some fabulous background material to refocus on this cultural masterpiece. Criterion has just released a new 2-disk special edition of this film which speaks volumes about how highly they regard this production and its ultimate place in cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hell of A Trip...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hunter Thompson's original novel was certainly a sight to behold. For the time period, and even now, it stands as one of the most unique first-hand non-fiction tales told. The idea of the novel itself sounds incredibly simple and almost too boring: A journalist and his lawyer take a weekend trip to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race. Although when you begin to mention the entire car trunk full of mind-altering pharmacuticals, it becomes more interesting. Even still you discover that they are not merely out to cover a race, but to seek out the heart of the American Dream and experience it for all that it's worth. And that's all within the first 30 pages of the book.Once actually arrived in Las Vegas, that's when this modern epic of psycadelic proportions begins to take place. Totally lit on almost every drug imaginable over roughly a one-week period, journalist Raoul Duke and his attourney Dr. Gonzo partake in some amazing sights and adventures. The irony lies where this story is only so unique because of their mind-altered and drug-enhanced perspectives on, what would seem like to us, a normal, almost dull, trip to Las Vegas. Things that could only happen if you were clearly sniffing some ether.The main misunderstanding in this tale is, quite obviously, the incredibly high drug-influenced theme. While some people choose to not take this too seriously and only find the drug-induced adventures of Hunter Thompson extremely funny, others do not. They see this story as basically pathetic, since their lives are so incredibly overtaken by the substances they use. One should not choose one extreme or the other: Of course it is a highly amusing story that is guaranteed to make you laugh, but is also a cause-and-consequence story, showing how much drugs like these can ruin a lifestyle. The main thing to focus on, I believe, is their particular perspectives on the world around them. Their viewpoints on life and people of the world are much different than any normal person's. It almost has a "Catcher in the Rye" appeal because of the main character's unique and cynnical views on the world, which can prove to be extremely interesting.The film itself I believe was put out much too late for the book, since it basically revolves around the San Fransisco acid generation of the late 60's. Still, this is by far the best book-to-movie transfer I have seen. The story in the film follows the novel almost identically, including much of the dialogue. Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke is fantastic, since Depp can so perfectly nail the strange accent and the paranoid personality of Hunter Thompson. Benicio Del Toro also does an exceptional job as Dr. Gonzo, and no one else can do such a good job of several random freak-outs in a single scene.All in all, I highly recommend this film to anyone, although it is not for the faint of heart. It still remians incredibly realistic, which includes a few vomit-induced hallucinations. But there is a great deal of humor as well as realism, but this film is certainly more than a comedy. But the first-hand experiences and general perspective of the characters can't be beat. Overall this story is more of a day-in-the-life of an average junkie who's put into extraordinary surroundings and the mayhem that insues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this film on video, way before reading the book. I found some of it very amusing but also found it confusing. It was difficult to make out dialogue and scenes and I was left with a 'what happened there' feeling afterwards.However, a friend was reading the book on holiday last year and told me that it was worth trying as it was a blast. I got a copy a few days later and I was hooked. I ended up reading it several times within a month as it just seemed to work so well. It wasn't long before I purchased a copy on DVD and enjoyed the film so much more. I certainly thought that both Depp and Del Toro carried off the roles perfectly and both added their own little sparkle to each of their characters.I recommend anyone thinking of watching this again or for the first time to get hold of the book first. If you enjoy the thought of mindless violence on inanimate objects and coping with every day life whilst under the influence of controlled drugs then this is for you.

		<fullReview>I've never been a member of the drug culture. I've frequently been intrigued by the philosophical movements it evoked in the 1960s, but my own personal experiences with drugs have been quite limited. Still I find Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to be irresistible. It is certainly askew from the norm, and true, it has no plot in the traditional sense. Some have also called this movie pointless, but with this I must disagree. I would suspect that most people who dismiss this movie also dismiss the drug culture in general, and I fear that this is a grievous mistake not only in cinema but in life. I would like to think that I understand Fear and Loathing, but I do not. It would be folly to think that I did, because I am outside the drug culture. I haven't felt the euphoria nor have I experienced the terror necessary to really see things in the same light as Hunter S. Thompson. It has also been said that this film glorifies or attempts to excuse recreational drug use. The movie itself is a testament to drug life, with all its hills and numerous valleys, but it always shows the consequences that follow the characters' actions. To quote Thompson himself, "No sympathy for the Devil. Buy the ticket, take the ride." I recommend this film to anyone who can follow that advice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam has excelled in translating Hunter Thompson's book into film. Although I did see the movie before reading the book, so perhaps my opinion is retrospective... but again Johnny Depp has shown his flair for oddball roles (Edward Scissorhands). In acting terms, playing the part of Hunter S Thompson and making people actually believe in him is surely difficult. The role did not lend itself to a more conventional or method actor, it takes someone with the X-factor, and who better than the man who convinced us he was the real Don Juan De Marco!It's a pity that Benicio Del Toro seems unhappy with this movie, I believe he critised the film and complained about the money? He convincingly plays the part of Dr Gonzo (who those in the cult following out there will know is a hedonistic freak!), Depp does not steal the show by any means.True to form, the director Terry Gilliam pushes the visual medium to it's limits (does Gilliam have limits?) . His visual style and use of the camera remind me of an Oliver Stone movie. Fear and Loathing was not a mainstream success, mainly because it is adapted from a book that doesn't seem to make any sense either!Maybe the secret to it lies in Dr Johnson's quote (found in the start of the book and also at the start of the film) -'He who makes a beast of himself, takes away the pain of being a man.'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From Depp's opening line of narration to the happy ending, I enjoyed this movie!! I also like Gilliam's "Brazil" and "12 Monkeys". I have not read Hunter S. Thompson's novel. I have never used drugs or alcohol in my life and I probably never will. This movie is one of my favorites. It's very fast-paced (although some short parts of 2 or 3 scenes may drag a little, but perhaps that's only because I was so eager to find out what happens next). It's also very funny. How the 2 main characters talk and dress is funny in itself. Depp's narration really helps with that too, how he's always talking with his ciggarette holder in his mouth. And those huge yellow sunglasses!The cinematography is wonderful. The camera seems to be a character too. It's always just floating around, tilting, moving, even running in reverse in one scene. There's so many vibrant colors jumping out all the time. ---The following is a spoiler for the first 30 seconds of the film---I think this movie seems to be based on the opening quote, "He who makes a beast of himself gets rid of the pain of being a man." The movie makes more sense remembering that.---End of spoiler section---Much of this film is quite disturbing. And I don't think I understood it completely. But that doesn't matter because this one crazy, wacky, roller coaster that I found very easy to enjoy and appreciate. Don't listen to the critics that said this movie is bad, because they're wrong. At the very least, it's good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost exactly like the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this film I read the book. This film contains everything the book does. Some of the scenes were switched around, but it's all there. I almost felt cheated because I spent the time and money to read the book. Hunter S. Thompson is a very talented writer though, and with the expert direction of Terry Gillium this film comes off very well. Unfortunately the book was, in my opinion, meant more to be a statement of the times than it was a story. Therefore while the film presents itself well as that, it does not include a classic Hollywood narrative. So I think many people will be disappointed. I also must point out that there are a number of great cameo appearances in this. Although it would have been great if Dennis Franz was at the convention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let me tell you why this movie is a big let down...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the book, we see Las Vegas through the eyes of Hunter S. Thompson. In the movie, all we ever see is Hunter S. Thompson. Unfortunately, unlike the far more enjoyable "Where the Buffalo Roam", we are never given any reason for wanting to see him."Fear and Loathing" is one of my favorite books. It presents wonderful insight into the absurdities inherent in a society which attempts to simultaneously worship Calvinistic morals, rugged individualism, and self-gratification through mass consumption. In such a world, people from all walks of life converge on Las Vegas to capture a small distorted piece of their American dream. HSTs own small piece is an expense-paid drug-filled weekend in America's capital of instant gratification and over-stimulation. The story itself is structured as a madcap road trip, made hilarious through HSTs understated literary style.The movie, by trying to depict HST and friends with a certain degree of reality, completely abandons this style. What was funny in the book becomes simply disturbing or scary on the screen. Furthermore, the high energy antics of HST completely overshadows any observations he is making. Any social commentary is completely lost in the noise. And so we get to sit and watch a loud, frantic HST indulge himself with drugs and wonder why in the world we should care.Ironically, the deadpan delivery of the book might have been successfully brought to film if Depp had used one of his stoic stare performances (Dead Man, Gilbert Grape) rather than one of his over-the-top emoting ones (Ed Wood, Cry-Baby). Perhaps HST really does look and sound like Popeye on speed, but it takes more than looking and sounding like someone to actually be them. In this case it's irrelevant because, as described above, the book really has nothing to do with realistically portraying HST.If you liked the book as much as I did, you will probably want to see this out of curiousity. And you will probably leave the theater shaking your head wondering what was the point and hoping that maybe someday in the future someone who understands the book makes a film out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for a great way to get a headache, this is the movie for you. Remember that five minutes in the movie "Easy Rider" where they're tripping on acid? This is two hours of the same type of insanity. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, just bizarre, EXTREMELY bizarre, perhaps the MOST BIZARRE movie that I have ever seen! Yes, that even includes the movie "Brazil" (also directed by Gilliam). I liked parts of it, though. It has some very memorable quotes and superb, difficult acting by Johnny Depp. The movie is also packed with cameos (Cameron Diaz, Flea, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci, and others). However, the bottom line in judging this movie is, no matter how "artsy" and "symbolic" it is, was I truly entertained? I had to really force myself to sit through it. "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is humorous and packed with symbolism, but it made my head spin and I found myself checking my watch every five or ten minutes. In this way, I would compare it to movies like "Trainspotting." And, just like "Trainspotting," I give it a five out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember originally reading Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, sometime around my high school graduation. I was highly entertained by the complete decadence of the trip Duke and Gonzo were undertaking (lots of us wanted to go on a trip like this maybe just once). Well, the movie was just like the book. Just like an acid trip, it was entertaining, tiring, miserable and funny as hell. Johnny Depp was great (he always disappears into his characters), and Dr. Gonzo was completely disgusting and repulsive (good job). Good job adapting a really strange book into a really strange movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One bad trip....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"He who makes a beast of himself, gets rid of the pain of being a man" is the opening quote of Terry Gilliam's film based on the writings of Hunter S. Thompson. As I'm not familiar with Thompson, I approached this film on it's minor cult status, along with a strong cast and director.The plot, what there is of it anyway, revolves around Duke (Depp) and Dr. Gonzo (Del Toro) as they embark on a drug fuelled road trip to Vegas, to cover a desert bike race. Gilliam brings his strong, expressionistic visual style to the film, turning Duke and Gonzo's drug fuelled experiences into a subjective nightmare. From surreal scenes involving giant lizards, to a grotesque circus-themed casino and totally debauched hotel rooms, the film is one long, bad trip - too long in fact. Gilliams usually distinctive and very personal visual style feels a bit restricted, perhaps attributable to sticking to Hunter's vision, rather than his own.Depp provides some hilarious moments as he stumbles, bow legged and muttering incoherently from one weird incident to another. Del Toro gives Gonzo a more dangerous, even psychotic, character. This culminates in the film's most "realistic scene" - the terrorising of a waitress which exposes, and brings consequence to, both of the characters chemically fuelled immorality.Unfortunately, the film is successful only on a superficial level. There are hints at the importance of broader 1970s American culture, notably the Vietnam war and the death of the 60s "flower power" counterculture. It is only when considering the film on it's opening quote that the film's pointlessness and immorality takes any meaning. After a period of great optimism in American history through the 1960s, all was shattered by the 70s, leaving an empty and uncertain future - it seems for some the only refuge was to leave a painful reality via chemicals and become immoral beasts - only perhaps this route brought nightmares infinitely more disturbing.For all the film's visual style and hyperactive performances, I found it ultimately unsatisfying - not just through lack of plot - but also because I couldn't help but feel that the film may have had more depth, and arguably been more disturbing, had the social context which formed this American nightmare, been explored further. It does however, make me interested to read some of Hunter S. Thompson's work, just to experience such a mad vision in literary form. 6/10</fullReview>

Nothing beats Fear and Loathing. Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro play the best roles of their life's, the played it so well that at the end, you want to become them..

		<shortDescription>One weird trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Fear and Loating in Las Vegas' is one bad trip from director Terry Gilliams. Johnny Depp as writer Hunter S. Thompson and Benicio Del Toro as his lawyer Dr. Gonzo go to Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race in the desert. All they do the entire film is take drugs in every form before walking into a situation that could be funny for some and too weird for others. The problem with this kind of film is that you really have to see for yourself what you think of it. You can't compare and say if you liked that film, you will probably like this one as well. Even if you are a fan of Depp or Del Toro I am not able to say whether you will enjoy this. I can say that I did and I can try to explain why.First of all because I thought it was pretty funny at times. Directly after that I have to say I can understand a lot of people will not find this funny. I like weird, I like 'Ace Ventura', but also 'Donnie Darko' or 'Mulholland Dr.'. 'Fear and Loating' is weird, but in a way that has nothing to do with the above films. We see Depp and Del Toro take drugs, Depp's voice over tells us how they feel and how they could react to the stuff, and then they do react to the stuff. They walk and talk weird, become aggressive, have a lot of hallucination, sometimes shared with us as the audience, fall asleep and wake up in a mess. Time for more drugs. Yes, this could be funny for some including me.But there are some other aspects that are nice too. The performances from Depp and Del Toro. They become these unlikable people and they do a great job at it. Both Depp and Del Toro are actors who can completely disappear in a character. With Depp you keep realizing it is Depp who does such an amazing job, with Del Toro you forget who he is. Here I constantly was aware of watching the both of them, but I thought about the character the film wanted me to. The style of the film itself is another tricky point. It is perfect for a film like this. The camera moves exactly the way it should move, representing the state of mind from the two men. But by doing that the film becomes pretty hard to watch. That it is the intention is the good thing, but some people will not be pleased by this, which is not a good thing.Films that involve a lot of drugs like 'Fear and Loathing' always seem to be made for certain audiences. 'Trainspotting' is the best example, even the great 'Requiem for a Dream' will not be for everyone. All three films have a visual style that will be loved by many but hated by probably the same amount of people. 'Fear and Loating in Las Vegas' is not as good as 'Requiem for a Dream' or 'Trainspotting', therefore even less accessible. It is a film without any judgment about drugs, except that you will go crazy if you use too much. But it is original in its own way and unlike any other film you have seen. I guess I appreciate that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surreal,unbelievable,frightening,disturbing superbly made film, that, though 98% of the world would never accept for one minute as reality. It is, in fact, just a "day in the life" for so many. I know,I vet been there. I simply lack Hunter s Thompsons ability to put it on paper. The cast is fantastic, Johnny Depp's role as Hunter S Thompson and Benecio Del Toro as Hunter's alter ego "Gonzo" was truly an inspired casting. I have seen the real Hunter S Thompson in interviews and Depp (as usual) nailed it. In fact I will state that about half the movies Johnny Depp has made could not have been made without him in them. And Benecio Del Toro is long overdue for "superstar status". His performance is almost to good. This film is for the curious, those who (wisely) chose sobriety,work,family and decency over self-indulgence,self-gratification and ultimately, of course self-destruction, for them it is voyeuristic journey into madness that may have been only a couple of bad decisions away from a possible future. It is also for people like myself to see just how incredibly lucky we are to have survived that part of our lives, And of course to reflect on the casualties, there always are. lastly, its a pure and simple wild ride, original, edge of your seat entertainment with superb performances,writing,directing,production design. One of my "100 movies on the deserted island list".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie, One of the best in the last twenty years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a fantastic film! Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a film based off of the book of the same name, written as a semiautobiographical account of one crazy weekend in Las Vegas. The book was written by the famous journalist, Hunter S. Thompson, telling the story of Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his good friend, the Samoan, Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) during their short stint in Las Vegas. They receive an advance from a magazine to cover the largest motocross event in the country. With this advance they fill a suitcase with every kind of illegal drug, they can find, and several cases of beer. With this suitcase, and the beer, they rent a fast convertible, ant head for Las Vegas. The rest of the movie is completely without plot, it simply spells out a series of events that happen over the weekend.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the modern-day western. Two buddies go out west and break every rule there is. They show up at the hotel completely out of their minds of acid, and the entire population of this hotel turns into giant reptiles. The rest of the movie is very similar, showing what is happening, and showing it again with the wildest special effects, simulating a drug trip. From start to finish, the film never ceased to entertain. The movie, by the end, showed the capable devastation of drugs. One of the more memorable scenes of the movie was when Raoul takes the adrenal fluid and everything goes to hell and a hand basket. He "wakes up" and he has a dinosaur tail, his tape recorder tapped to his body and there are several inches of water on the floor of the hotel, and realizes his lawyer, Dr. Gonzo, is missing. When he finds Dr. Gonzo, the Dr. has taken a young girl (Christina Ricci) captive, and is drugging her into being his slave. This scene in particular shows how harmful drugs are, and what evil they can create.The paramount facet of this film was that it gave Terry Gilliam a chance to take his creativity from the odd and hysterical animations he made for the Monty Python movies, and turn them into a live action motion picture. The style of the animation present in the Flying Circus, and especially in The Holy Grail has transitioned beautifully to a live action cinema.Above all else, the acting in this movie was superb. The ability to act so completely out of one's mind is quite possibly the most difficult thing to do as an actor. The characters are practically unrecognizable, compared to their Hollywood images. Del Toro gained forty pounds for his role, and could not find work as an actor for a long time after Fear and Loathing. The casting directors thought he was a druggie. Depp is totally bald and looks absolutely nothing like any other character in his other movies. My sister (a worshipper of Johnny Depp) walked in while I was watching the movie and proclaimed "Who's that? He's ugly." I looked blankly at her and said Johnny Depp, and I could swear she almost wet herself. Beyond Depp's image, his actual acting was amazing, his acting has never ceased to amaze me, but this was defiantly his strongest act I have ever seen. Not ever has an actor so convincingly played out a demented psychotic maniac (who remains lovable at the same time) better than Depp. When an actor tends to overact (Al Pacino) it normally detracts from the movie (Scarface). However, in this movie it fits Depp's character perfectly. Because it fits the character so well, and Depp does not overact in other movies, it was perfectly acceptable in the film.This is the movie that comes to mind when I think about what movie coming out now will be a classic when I am older. Absolutely brilliant, I loved every second of it, and would recommend it to anybody looking for a good movie.</fullReview>

It also annoys me that people criticise Terry Gilliam for being too weird but then rave and rant about Twelve Monkeys!! Most don't even realise that it's a Gilliam film!Face it Gilliam is an extraordinary director, it just upsets people that he makes his films more intelligent than most people can get!This film is awesome!

Don't get me wrong, Depp and Del Toro were averagely great, but the direction sucks(Gilliam should have took his name off this film, imo) If I'm not mistaken, this came out the same year as "Half-Baked," another drug-induced high feature from Universal(makes you wonder, doesn't it?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)Funny, garish version of the Hunter S. Thompson novel directed by Terry Gilliam with the usual Gilliam brush strokes: cluttered sets, Monty Python remembrances, funky camera angles, relentless energy and a satirical eye. His "shoot me if you find a plot," and "torture me first if you find a subplot" style is regressed to after the agreeable hiatus of "12 Monkeys." Of course such a chaotic style goes well with gonzo journalism on a bad acid trip-a VERY bad acid trip.Johnny Depp plays Hunter S. Thompson as Doonesbury's Duke with the FDR cigarette holder and pastel shades. Benicio Del Toro is offensively loutish as Dr. Gonzo, a fake Samoan from East L.A. or thereabouts. Most of this is pretty "bad," but Depp got the cartoon character down pat. The psychedelic and day-glow sets, populated with lizards and ugly Americans, splashed with glaring reds and pinks, etc., captured well not only the "fear and loathing" but the seventies Las Vegas milieu as well. The voice overs from the novel seemed a bit miraculous in the movie since at no time is Duke ever coherent or sober enough to write. Piping Debbie Reynolds's "Tammy's in Love" into the Duke/Gonzo hotel room amid the brain cell mayhem was an inspired cultural juxtaposition. Ditto for the Barbra Streisand portraits.Best scene: Gonzo and Duke watching a clip from "Reefer Madness" at the narc's convention. Second best scene: Duke being admired by the highway patrolman who wants a kiss. Most fun: trash driving those two big Caddy convertibles.One of the amazing things about Gilliam is how he can make fun of people without their seeming to notice. Hunter S. Thompson looks like an idiot here, and Gilliam is really satirizing the sixties/early seventies drug culture just as surely as he trashes the cops. His rapier is razor sharp, so sharp you don't feel it until you look down and see the blood on your hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to categorize this movie --- or even describe it. On the one hand, it's very bland. It's a collection of not-very-imaginative drug-induced visions coming from a hedonist journalist. Johnny Depp looks good as a bald, sweaty guy, but you know it's all a put-on from the start. You KNOW he's going to survive, he's going to have some cynical comments about the American Dream (or Nightmare), and he'll drive away wondering about it all. None of the scenes really add up to anything. It's a collection of half-hearted attempts to match "gonzo" filmmaking with Thompson's gonzo journalistic style.On the other hand . . . no one but Terry Gilliam could put together such a visual feast. And who cares about plot? That's not the point. It's great to see a movie about drugs that's completely free of the hippie vibe. Very few movies depict drug use in this way, as self-induced psychosis. Gilliam captured the spirit of the book by making bright colors ugly, showing everyone at their worst, and essentially forcing you to watch people act the way they really do. So he gets points for honesty, but in the end the movie is not very entertaining or creative. Weird, dude.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam, with FaLiLV, has crafted a textbook example of bad art. The movie has a number of points to make, and generally manages to convey them (albeit with the lucidity of a drug addict). However, Gilliam constantly goes way over the top, hammering the same ideas into his audience's heads incessantly. Forty minutes into the film, Gilliam has already made his points, and the next eighty minutes are incredibly redundant. Much of the voice-over narration, particularly in the early parts of the film, creates an astonishingly pretentious ambience which only adds to the sense of malaise felt by viewers. While there are a couple of good scenes in the film (the rotating, mirrored bar, for example), as well as a great deal of visual brilliance on Gilliam's part, the majority of the movie is overdirected and overwritten. In the end, I'm more interested in figuring out exactly how Gilliam went wrong, rather than further considering the themes of the movie, which have already managed to completely play themselves out.</fullReview>

The movie is based on a story by Hunter S. Thompson, which was in fact was based on his own experiences. Though I haven't read the book, I read a biography on Thompson, and he was really a fascinating man, he had some interesting philosophies and no one ever knew what he was about to do next. I was excited to watch the movie, but once I watched it, I found nothing intriguing in his character. He came across as a grade A idiot. Benicio Del Toro was alright though. I guess I was expecting something a little more dimensional from Depp seeing as he was such good friends with Thompson. Maybe he could have given his character more of a posed and captivating side. To sum it up the movie was goofy and painful. oh welll.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The funniest thing about it is that director Terry Gilliam never used drugs.Recently deceased, writer/journalist/all around psycho freak, Hunter S. Thompson's real life 1971 drug induced 'trip' to Las Vegas to write a story on the Mint 400 motorcycle race for the national sporting press.Subsequently, the story was never written and the hero finds himself in a psychadelized nightmare of high powered blotter acid and an assortment of multi-colored uppers, downers, laughers and screamers. . . .and some pure human adrenochrome along with the wild night life and flashing neon that makes Las Vegas so full of. . . .Fear and Loathing.With more cameos and better acting and finer cinematography and a better all around believable story than any three Oliver Stone movies that you could take in on any given night(unless one of them is Salvador which is about on par with this minus cameo).Get the special collectors edition DVD featuring a 1978 BBC documentary following the real life 'Dr.Gonzo' across the U.S.A. with artist pal Ralph Steadman. It is uncanny to compare Hunter Thompson from the documentary to Johnny Depp from the feature because Johnny Depp, for at least this movie(see lingerings of the power of playing Dr. Thompson in Depp's character portrayals in Once Upon A Time In Mexico and Pirates of the Caribbean), is a perfect depiction of Thompson's own impression of his fictional character based on himself.The moral of the movie, I have noticed quite a number of 'educated smarties' pass it off as though it has no moral, as though it's just two maniacs doing maniac things in maniac ways to nice 'normal' people so that maniacs will become agitated and perhaps copy it. The story of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the entire Raul Duke catalogue, Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision, Where the Bufallo Roam and the entire Hunter S. Thompson book series is a genuine look into the mind of a dreamer who just wanted to find something nice. When he couldn't, he would smash up what was already ugly and people would complain that he made the ugly. The morality behind the entire life of Doctor Hunter Stockton Thompson is that evil is not out there. Meanness and anger are not out there. They are in here, inside us all, waiting to break out and do something that we must apologize for. As though it were impossible for another person to commit the same evil you'd apologized for. The moral of the story is to always say thank you but never say that you were sorry.While I am aware that this makes little sense, if it makes any sense to you then watch the darned thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, absurd and very twisted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear And Loathing In Las VegasRaoul Duke and his attorney, Dr Gonzo is heading for Las Vegas to cover a desert race, their car is packed with drugs and their only intention is to get as drugged up as possible while their company is paying for their press coverage of the race. From here the movie follows their rampage in Las Vegas.Well, this is one of the most crazy and pointless movies i have ever experienced. To be quite honest the movie is actually very well constructed, Terry Gilian uses the camera very well in symbolizing the situation using crooked camera angles and a good amount of color impressions, however this can't save the movie from having no depth at all, all it simply does is giving a shallow description of drug abuse, it doesn't go into any deep moralizing questions about it, it doesn't bring any discussions up, it just describes and portrays, something that at first seems ok. But as the movie passes on it feels like everything is repeating itself, the same thing happens in a different way, it's pretty much the same, nothing that makes us think happens, and then it ends. The movie is simply too hollow and empty for being a great movie, all it describes it madness, pure madness, and the effect and possible feeling of drug abuse.I guess this has become a cult movie because of the madness it describes, in a very wild and obscure way, but towards that i can only say, cult movies does often divide the audience, and this time i got stuck on the negative side. Because this madness it describes so pointless just doesn't get to me, actually i found myself rather bored at times and especially towards the ending waiting for it just too end, i hated how the movie avoided all possible moral questions. Just as you thought it was gonna go in the depth with something, it turned around and walked out of it, something that for me made the movie feel very pointless and empty.What saves this movie is the great directing, and especially the amazing performances given by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. I can't even begin to imagine what kind of skill it have taken to play these two odd balls in this movie, this movie really shows how talented they REALLY are, if the acting had been awful in this movie, it would have been a completely useless movie, but somehow this does manage to squeeze in a few enjoyable scenes in a movie that pretty much makes no sense.To sum it all up, a crazy and absurd movie. However it's just too empty, the description of the state of being drugged is well done, but the movie avoids too many things and focuses only on a portrait of being drugged, it's a crazy movie, that some will like, and others will disllike, i disliked it. But it's worth checking out Del Toro and Depp showing off their talents.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear, loathing, and intolerable vibrations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the recollection of a drug fuelled trip of a journalist and an attorney to Las Vegas.Johnny Depp's acting is great, his paranoia is portrayed well. Christina Ricci and Cameron Diaz appear in very minor roles, which I think is a waste of their talents. Scenes of hallucinations are actually quite entertaining, especially the "lizard zoo" scene. The atmosphere of drugs and distorted reality is conveyed well by colours, the disoriented camera and the acting.However, I find the film a disappointment because I find it too long and tedious. The film is basically a collection of drug fuelled encounters of the two main characters. It has no central story line, and things occur rather randomly. I was looking forward to this film due to the high rating it received on IMDb. To quote a line from the film, "Fear, loathing, and intolerable vibrations" really sums up my feelings towards this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mind Butterflies Become Words, and Now Images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hurlyburly meets Dick meets Stone's DoorsI thought Brazil was sophomoric; 12 Monkeys thinly profound. But here, Gilliam has found his subject. The book was much better because it represented the real connection -- a man living on another planet superimposed on mine sends me a telegram because he's been able to hold onto words. Actually, he's used the weaving of words to continually reconstruct his mind as it unravels.In the book, these words bridge the gap between dimensions, proving that words themselves are beyond beyond. Now we take a step back in creating this series of film images. We don't have many of the actual words here, so the expression comes not from the disembodied traveler, but from a film journalist and his skilled avatars. Makes it an entirely different thing -- the humor is directed against the situation, not found intrinsically in it. The narrator and his muse are objects of the vision rather than originators of it.The book was the real report from the sixties. Then, we did it. Now, we consume translations and reflections (that incidentally must be amusing, just read the comments here). But if you take this film at that level, as a Python skit of the time, it is terrific. Depp is quirky, but he has balls and this time it clicks. He's intelligent, and knows how to play an actor, playing a character playing a role, with each level thinking he's connecting with the cosmic audience, which for Depp we faithfully provide -- damn our voyeurism. Depp is similarly intelligent in Ninth Gate.Del Toro gets left out because he only knows how to play things straight. Works in Way of the Gun, but not here. No wonder he is unhappy with it.Gilliam still doesn't know how to live with a camera, so the eye here is never from a master. But he does know how to build startling images from props and sets. (The circus was masterful: how about that trapeze birth scene!)Contrast this with Requiem for a Dream, which has a good eye, but little understanding of the visual mind. And Hurlyburly, which masters the mind part of this world, but might have been better as a radio play.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be difficult to assess the literary merits of Hunter S. Thompson's book "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" from this film. As I have not read the book I will leave that issue aside. It seems to be some kind of broad satirical look at Las Vegas the premise being that the only way to appreciate the weirdness and loathsomeness of this gaming mecca is to get weird on various kinds of hallucinogenic and mind-altering drugs. Instead we are treated to a kind of journey through the bowels of the protagonists complete with infantile orgies of destructiveness which are supposed to be some kind of expression of the well-deserved contempt one feels for crew-cut mentality of the early 70s political milieu. In the end like whatever it is one ate last night, it courses through the dark passages of one's interior only to find an exit in a toilet bowl. Considering the material presented in this film, making for an exit without delay is the only sane course of action even if some of it has to reverse normal peristalsis and leave via the entrance.</fullReview>

The voice overs, however lazy a story telling device are likely taken from the book and are somewhat worthwhile as a piece of writing.I did not care for any of the characters but they did a great job with the garbage they were to portray. As others have said. This movie is too long and painfully dull. It would have been a great 10 min. short. There is no plot and their is no sense of who these people are- other than stoned. I'm not sure what type of person enjoys this type of lame childish humor - but not me. I do not recommend this for people who like to care about characters, enjoy movies where something actually occurs, or anyone who generally does not use drugs.

My guess is that as I noticed I can't watch the movie when I am sober. It bores me. I can't ever finish it. I laugh only a few times. When I am on something, even if just alcohol, I love looking at it. Not that I am following the story then, it just seems like a lot of great colorful pictures.I am not even sure I like how Johnny Depp acted in it. Yes, I can't imagine anyone else doing it anymore, which seems that he created the right character. But there are so many parts where his overacting is just irritating.Sure there are some scenes which I think are perfection. Mainly the reptile scene, but all together the movie is just a combination of bad trips. It sure will stop one from doing LSD.And while I get the idea how it is supposed to be pointless and get you a look into the acid world of being on a trip, it still doesn't do anything for me.Still give it a 6. For being so unique and because enjoying it when drunk makes it do a partially good job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGASHmmm... now that is a trip!The movie is about a journalist and his lawyer go on a trip to Vegas to find the American dream. On the way they are constantly intoxicated on drink and various drugs.This film completely messes with your head. It is completely psychedelic and all over the place. The imagery is great. I love the feel of the movie. Granted, it is not all easy to follow... there were times where I was wondering what the hell was going on.There are some funny moments in it, but none that made me laugh out loud. I just found the amusing.The film stars Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. Johnny plays his part well... but I think he played it as a comedy character. The way he walked and acted was very funny. And he looks great with a bald head... not! haha. Benicio did well too... he had to put on a big beer belly for this role. It makes a change for the Hollywood stars to make themselves look horrible. There were also some great cameos in the film. Other faces that appeared were Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Ellen Barkin, Gary Busey, Lyle Lovett &amp; Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.The story was completely out there... but we have all come to expect this from Terry Gilliam. The legend that once was a member of Monty Python has made a few movies now... and most of them are weird in some way. That is not a bad thing.There are some good effects, but it is not a big special effects movie. There are a few scenes where you are seeing what Johnny sees... and it is drug fuelled. There are things moving and faces changing and people turning into creatures etc... it is bizarre. But I have never taken any drugs, so as far as I know, this is what probably happens. It is entertaining.I will give this film 6 out of 10.Quite good and amusing... but I have seen better drug related movies. I get a feeling I will have to watch this again before I can fully appreciate it.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terry Gilliam's picture gets off to a surprisingly dull start, two eccentric money packed friends (each with his own neophilosophical views on life and drugs) driving to Las Vegas, no worries, only psychedelia.Anyone who tries to justify the whole meaningless of the movie will advocate surely the spirit of the Gonzo journalism merged with the spirit of the total drug liberation, and sure, one can make such a film, a film with no point, that doesn't want to teach a lesson, just show you what the experience is like.But, if so, this film fails in this endeavor too, never really gripping the spectator nor getting you inside of the action.Both Depp and Del Toro, without doubt at least above average actors, seem impaired here by the whole charade of their delusional experiences, which, on the other hand, feel repetitive and vaguely conceived.One should not come to this film expecting to receive any ideas to think about, or any deep emotions to be touched by, and, if on the contrary you really feel like watching two people partying in Las Vegas, I don't see why this movie can be any different from a lot of teenage-centered comedy movies that are popular nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was marketed as one of the best movies out there and, when you look at the cast alone, you can't help but believe it. Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro in a wild psychedelic trip through Las Vegas? What is not to like?Unfortunately for me, I couldn't relate to the characters. The acting was top notch, the direction of Gilliam was its usual great yet insane, but I couldn't get in, even if partly stoned myself. Or maybe that is why. The film is two hours (very) long and it is exclusively about going around wild eyed, hallucinating and destroying things.Perhaps the only part that made sense was the ending, the main character expressing his sadness over the death of drug culture, a death before a proper birth. In that light, the entire trip is nothing else than a desperate attempt to live past great feelings that no one can legally have anymore, only to fail in a pathetic and confused daze that holds no beauty and no greatness.Bottom line: Gilliam is a difficult director to begin with, but I liked some of his movies a lot, despite or because of their strangeness. This one, I could not, no matter how much I tried.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something was missing from Johnny Depp's attempt to portray the late Hunter Thompson, and I could not put my finger on what it was until I saw the cover for Thompson's book The Great Shark Hunt. Hunter Thompson was six feet three and filled with a kind of lumbering, growly menace that promised that not only weirdness, but random violence could happen at any moment. Depp captures the mannerisms but not the manner. He grumbles semi- intelligibly, but in a completely benign, non-threatening way. The whole movie is the same way. Imaginatively and colorfully weird, but without the threat and menace of the truly dangerous weirdness that Thompson himself embraced and made famous, the whole exercise lacks the bite and shock value of the book. Read the book first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp's acting seemed really forced and unnatural. The plot was very slow moving, and most of the time, it was just two druggies swatting at non-existent animals. I was surprised at how two-dimensional Benicio Del Toro's character was. I think it was the script that was horrid, because the directing seemed great. I guess we could call some of the quotes 'clever,' but, using an analogy, just because I recite pi to the 400th decimal in a mosh pit does not make it a brilliant film. It reminded me of the films by Andrei Tarkovskiy or possibly David Lynch, in terms of how slow moving it is, but even their films appear to have a point to make.Perhaps I'm missing something, the TV monitor was turned at a bad angle, or a subliminal high-frequency noise was bothering me, but this movie, from the very few minutes in, had me turned off. To think this movie is presently rated 7.6 blows my mind, and makes me question myself of my negative perspectives.But for me, this movie was indeed a saltine without the essential salt.</fullReview>

His voice is hilarious! Overall, Fear and Loathing was a fairly good movie but it was really strange and lacked plot and there are a lot of people who will not like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hunter Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, on the surface, is prime property for Terry Gilliam. And he nails it. Visually, it's quite interesting.If only he'd understood a single Goddamn word of what the book stood for.At best, it's a naive adaptation, more intent on showing off neat visual tricks than making a point. At worst, it's a lousy mess with some good performances that elevate it above a complete disaster; a very weak movie worth watching. One that substitutes substance with all the fun of watching people do drugs (which, if you've ever seen it, isn't much fun). It's nice if things look good, it's not nice if they're meaningless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(This comment was originally written in 2003.) I think the reason I hadn't seen this one before is that I'd been on a chick flick kick for so long, going through the entire Jane Austen movie phase, etc...and didn't think I'd be interested in a "drug movie." (Probably why I also hadn't seen many Benicio Del Toro movies until recently.) But a few weeks ago, I started paying attention to BDT and so began renting his movies, and am extremely impressed with his acting. Anyway, this one is hard to get hold of - copies are missing from video rental places all over my town - but finally, I pinned it down and rented it. I haven't read the book yet, but plan to now. Yes, it's completely bizarre, and gets extremely gross, but the performances are amazing - the acting is really spectacular, the makeup should have won lots of awards, Terry Gilliam did an outstanding job directing, and I will put my hand up and say that I will sit and watch a movie for the cinematography (in respectful response to another reviewer's comment), but then again, I'm interested in the technical side of film-making. There IS more to this than the cinematography. There are clever, funny scenes and lines throughout the film, although it does take a strong stomach and some patience to watch the whole thing. I'm glad I did, because I got an extra reward by the time I got close to the end - found out MY AUNT is actually IN the movie, as one of the upset shoppers, when Duke and Gonzo are trashing the white convertible...that was pretty neat! I need to pay more attention to her credits on her IMDb.com page (Mary Gillis)! So, anyway, family bias aside, I think it's definitely worth watching for serious film critics, but if you know you don't like movies that are graphic and "too real" (a strange term for this movie, but somehow fitting) then stick to safer films, such as my old fave, Pride and Prejudice 1995 - there's nothing wrong with that. But what I'm learning from just studying Benicio Del Toro is that there's a lot more to a "good" movie than what's on the surface, and what may just seem pleasing. Like art, it's often subjective, but the more you experience, the more you can appreciate the effort and talent that goes into something, even if the end product is something you loathe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear And Loathing Dr. Gonzo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time I saw this film was in the theaters when it was first released. Now this film has became a cult classic because of its drugged out nature, stylistic picture, and good acting, especially on Johnny Depp's part. But other than that this film has almost no story. It is basically about a drugged out weekend in Las Vegas. Roule Duke (aka Hunter S. Thompson) and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo, are in Vegas to cover some sort of off road race. But the real objective is to get messed up on any sort of drug as possible.Dr. Gonzo played by a heavily overweight Benitio Del Toro, who is annoying and sadistic. And while Duke is the "sane" one of the two, they seem to completely trash two hotel rooms. Del Toro really put a damper on this movie. His character was very annoying with him always flashing his gun or knife around and getting mad for no reason. But when he is "sane", Duke is messed up on either ether, LSD, or artificial adrenaline.Finally, after this mess of a movie, we finally get to the end. Apparently after "overdosing" on some sort of experimental drug. Duke wakes up to find himself with a tape recorder duct taped to his chest and is wearing a huge vinyl lizard tale. The hotel room is trashed, and he starts to listen to the tape and pick out moments of the events that happened over the last few days when he was pretty much blacked out. We see some more of Dr. Gonzo being crazy with a knife to some waitress, and then Thompson getting Gonzo to the airport on time. Then the movie ends with the strange ramblings of Duke ala Jerry Springer's "Final Thoughts." This film is directed by Terry Gilliam (Monty Python, 12 Monkeys, Brazil, The Brothers Grimm, etc.) and has a large amount of cameos: Cameron Diaz, Christina Ricci, Toby Maguire, Gary Busey, Flea, Verne "Mini Me" Troyer and even the great Hunter S.This film could have been so much more but is still a good, not great, achievement in film as an art. Just Average for a film.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure torture!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" was absolutely pure torture for me to watch! I had to spend 3 hours watching this movie, rewinding and stuff because I didn't want to miss 1 thing. "WARNING!" People who don't like other people doing drugs, stay as far away as you can from this movie. What do I mean when I say it was pure torture? I mean that I could not stop laughing while watching "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". I know that Johhny Depp is a brilliant actor, but I had no idea that Benicio Del Toro could act so good. I have seen a few movies where Benicio was a part of, but never really noticed him being there. He is noticed in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"! Acting score in my opinion for both would be 10/10. The story, well that's another 10. But I think the most important in "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is the movie all together. If you are not used to laughing, you should try watching this movie bit by bit, not all at once. This is a killer!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this film. I had to go out and buy it. I've watched it dozens and dozens of times and I never get tired of watching it. Its a psychedelic approach to understand whats cooking in Thompson's mind. It's an amazingly wild adventure to watch it sober or tripping. Laughable man. There is no need for a plot here because Thompson's work of art astonishes you in every scene of the movie. Duke and Gonzo couldn't be portrayed by anyone else rather than Depp and Del Toro. They unravel the mystery of the acid-rock days of Thompson's adventures and give the watcher a mind-blowing performance in the film. I recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in comedy and psychedelic sci/f-genre. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>most successful try of turning a book into a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I wanna say, every movie that was based on a book, no matter how good the movie has been, is nothing compared to the original book. Every true reader would agree with me. Its not the question either the books or the movies. Some people are fans from movies some like books more. I am talking about book fans now. When you read a book you imagine the whole story, and automatically you adapt it to your person. When they write the girl was pretty, you imagine a girl that is pretty for you, it don't has to be a concrete person, just a imagination of a pretty girl. You just know she is pretty. And the second thing by books is that they describe also feelings and opinions of the characters and also of the writer. Thats why the movie cant give you the experience you have while reading a book, the actors cant capture all the feelings with acting. Every movie is maybe 10% of the books quality. Except of this movie, this movie is same quality. There is nothing in between for me. I never seen movie that was more than 10% until this, whats 100%. Congratulations to Terry Gilliam, Benicio del Toro and of course Johny Depp. They should get academy awards for their performance. I watched the movie maybe 30 times. You have to watch it at least three times to get the right impression. And also after 10th time, something can surprise you. There are so many little details, you have to watch everybody in this movie and listen to every word spoken, even in the background. This was the first movie when I was laughing out loud like crazy in a movie theatre. I usually just laugh a little, but here I couldn't stop, my stomach was hurting me already. It is also the first movie I went 4 times in movie theatre to see it. This movie is great, is beyond any judgments. And I am still talking only about capturing the book. I am not talking about the story, which is great as well, thanks to autor Hunter S.Thompson.Between 1 and 10 its 29. its the best movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only way to watch and understand this movie is to be stoned out of your mind. I watched this and it made absolutely no sense and had no point. But I still enjoyed it because Johnny Depp is completely amazing. I actually fell asleep and missed almost an hour of it. It just couldn't keep my interest. Though I think everyone should see it just to say they have seen it. I've never heard of this movie before one of my friends called me up and was like "We should watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." I was like "WTF?" and then I found out Johnny Depp was is in it, and decided to give it a try. I wasn't that impressed though. I would watch it again though if I could because some movies are just better the second time around.</fullReview>

Johnny depp's performance is sublime, he must have taken some serious drugs in his life to get such a good handle on the character. if you still live with your parents, never let them see you watching this film, they will think you're either a total drug fiend or or a psychopath. you have been warned.</fullReview>

The movements, mimics, and this transformation for this film( I mean the appearance.) Really realistic for that era. Altogether, I suggest everyone to see this film. The best parts, are those weird scenes, the race in the desert, the elevator with Cameron Diaz, the circus, and the police officers' meeting. That atmosphere in those scenes reflects the feeling the directors wanted very successfully.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in the Mind of an Addict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A "wild outlaw with a pen," the rules were definitely not made for Hunter Thompson (the "rules are not for me" attitude, symptomatic of early- to middle-stage alcohol and other-drug addiction, is fully described in my book, "How to Spot Hidden Alcoholics: Using Behavioral Clues to Recognize Addiction in its Early Stages"). His 1971 semi-autobiographical story "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," the book on which this movie was based, was proclaimed a masterpiece of "New Journalism." Yet, it portrayed drug-addled brains and outrageously destructive behaviors which, while not quite glorified, were not deeply criticized. In classic alcoholic style, he was termed eccentric and a "cult" figure, while sharing his nihilist views that life is absurd and the world has no meaning. He was successful because he put his feelings to paper apparently succinctly at a time when so many others of his ilk in the '70s who couldn't write held the same vacuous beliefs. He wrote nonsense very well indeed, reportedly never wasting a word.The story portrays two druggies in grown-up bodies with the minds of, at best, the fraternity boys in "Animal House." Benicio Del Toro, who gained 40 pounds for the role, beautifully plays gun- and knife-toting lawyer Dr. Gonzo. Gonzo accompanies seemingly cogent chain-smoking journalist Raoul Duke (Thompson's alter-ego, which served as the model for the thinly disguised sleazy "Uncle Duke" in the Doonesbury comic strip), played by Johnny Depp, to report on the 1971 Mint 400 Desert Race and a District Attorney Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, both held in Las Vegas. While the movie clearly does not glorify the use, it leaves us bewildered over the incredible luck in failing to get busted for destroying hotel rooms and endangering others on the road as they drive to and around Las Vegas with a suitcase full of every drug imaginable while stoned out of their minds. Snorting coke during speeches at the D. A. Conference, they haven't a clue as to what's going on. Nothing gets written on either event for Duke's employer.The movie was billed as one about two guys who find that "sometimes going too far is the only way to go." No it's not. It's about two addicts on a binge who destroy cars and hotel rooms, steal room service (averaging $35 per hour for 48 hours in 1971 dollars), and adversely affect more than a life or two. While there was no real message to the movie other than "it's the only way to go" for those who enable such behaviors and "disgusting" for those of us who don't, there were at least a few laugh-out-loud moments (but then, I have to admit to having a bit of a taste for ridiculous Leslie Nielson movies and, even, "Animal House").More importantly, although you'd have to listen very carefully to notice, inflated egos, the central clue to early- and middle-stage substance addiction, were evident. As he's readying himself to cover the race, journalist Duke comments, "Those of us who had been up all night were in no mood for coffee and donuts; we wanted strong drink. We were, after all, the absolute cream of the national sporting press." While cruising the Strip and thinking of themselves, he says, "Stoned, Ripped. Good people." After running into a beauty in an elevator (played in a cameo by Cameron Diaz) and threatening her boyfriend with a knife, Del Toro's character tells Duke, "She fell in love with me, man; eye contact, man," claiming she was flirting. While the first two comments may have been sarcastic, the latter was a clear sign of euphoric recall, which causes the addict to view everything he says or does in a self-favoring light (which, as I explain in my book "Drunks, Drugs &amp; Debits: How to Recognize Addicts and Avoid Financial Abuse," leads to the massive ego-inflation of the typical early-stage addict).They also consistently display a "rules don't apply to me" attitude. I explain in "Get Out of the Way! How to Identify and Avoid a Driver Under the Influence," my book on detecting DUIs before they become tragically obvious, that parking wherever someone pleases is a telltale sign of alcoholism and likely DUI. They do exactly this as they arrive at a Debbie Reynolds show, which they are quickly thrown out of after talking their way in without paying (no doubt, using alcoholic charm, which I discuss at length in my other books). And one astute point is made when Duke talks about leaving, with Gonzo wielding his hunting knife: "One of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug. Especially when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye." Note his use of the term "it," suggesting that even Thompson, in a rare moment of total honesty, knew he was dealing not with a real person but, instead, with an addict, and that the problem is not the person or the drug, but rather the person on the drug.The movie was directed by Monty Python's Terry Gilliam ("Life of Brian") and was billed as a comedy. While for the addiction-aware it's more of a tragi-comedy with a decent-enough portrayal of poly-drug addicts, I must admit to laughing out loud at several scenes, particularly the check-in scene at the hotel where Depp's character is hallucinating. In addition to Diaz's cameo, Gary Busey plays an enabling cop, and you will also find Tobey Maguire and Chris Meloni of "Law and Order: SVU," in amusing cameo roles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"He who makes a beast out of himself, gets rid of the pain of being a man" whilst dubbed over the top is Johnny Depp's character Raoul Duke or Hunter S. Thompson saying "We were somewhere near Barstowe, on the edge of the desert, when the drugs began to take hold" This is the best start to a film, it explains what you can expect from the film, a wild series of events involving lots of drugs. Since buying this film, i have seen it many times. Without a doubt, it is one of the best films i have ever seen. It is a bit weird in places but its very funny due to it's many references of drugs plus the line "I felt raped! The pig had done me on all fronts, and was now going to chuckle about it on the west side of town" I would advise anyone up for a good hour and a half of laughter, watch this film. It's not as well known as some of the comedy films out these days (Dodgeball, Meet The Fockers etc) but in my opinion, it is better than these films</fullReview>

Las Vegas is a place that makes you feel small, it's so huge and pompous, this 2 guys change the picture and put Las Vegas in other view, it doesn't mean that drugs will give you the courage to enter the casinos and shows easier, but it's more fun for a week end in Las Vegas to be with a friend, and not only for gamble, of course drugs and gamble is not good for earn your living, but for once in a while as a holiday its fun, the 2 professionals showed an "special" respect for human beings, and even thou there are some scenes with white arms, like the knives, they don't show vulgarity or loathing, the title of the picture is wrong...I haven't feel hate in the film at all..the way B. Del Toro reacts in the elevator and keeps thinking that the girl loves him was very romantic...like true love. B. del Toro was excellent in the elevator, he can play Rhett Buttler in a new "Gone with the wind". Scarlet O'Hara can be played by Jennifer Anniston, J. Depp and Cameron Diaz the other 2 roles... B. del Toro can get an Oscar.The whole picture is excellent because of B. del Toro, other actor wouldn't have the charm he's got, J. Depp is complementary to Del Toro. The director is excellent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is an amazing work that was based on events from the great author Hunter Thompson. People may not like it the first time they see it because it is confusing, but the second time, many more things are noticed, and every time I watch it, I see something new. Being in the driver seat and seeing the hallucinations of a drug user in first person is a thrill, even if you do not ever want to try drugs. It can explain to you why people are so clueless when on drugs, but the fact that they can develop theories that would never have been thought of is interesting. If you want to explore the world that so many venture through on drugs, then sit in the comfort of your own home and watch this movei. "BEAUTIFUL F-ING TITS!!!" -Raoul Duke</fullReview>

But then each time I watched it after that it got better and better. it is hard to see the brilliance of this movie the first time you watch it. the brilliant thing about it is that its point is that it doesn't really have a point it is just a story about two guys and their search for the American dream strung out on every drug known to man. I wish I had read the book before watching the movie because after I read the book it made me understand the movie better and the pure genius of Hunter S. Thompson. I have also never seen two actors get so into their characters as Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro. These characters go to extremes and push each other to the edge and over it and then their are times, especially when HST talks about life in the middle 60's, where he really hits on something meaningful to a lot of people. This movie is just jam packed with so much stuff that each time you watch it you discover something new.</fullReview>

At points, it's so frenetic that I was tired just sitting there watching it on my couch. But it's also much too interesting to look away. Nothing important is said by this manic slice of life, it's more like a melting piece of art on fire than a great narrative and it takes a while to wrap your head around the dialog. (almost like trying to understand a film spoken in a heavy accent). There's something infectious about it at the same time though. You might want to keep the kiddies away too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much deeper than you think...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is much more than people make it out to be. Sure, its funny; its interesting for drug enthusiasts; and its quite strange. But remember that it is based on the book by the late Hunter S. Thompson, a very satirical and often cynical writer. The book was a criticism of society, with different occurrences, objects, and even trips symbolic of the political and social turmoil of the era. Thompson was the founder of "Gonzo" journalism, and a great modern writer. Director Terry Gilliam translates the book beautifully, which is a great feat for such a deep book. He retains many of the main ideas in the book, while condensing the novel into movie form, and many of the deep literary elements of the novel are still present in the movie. He also does this without making the movie completely boring. That said, some people WILL find the movie boring. However, I can say that you probably will find the movie interesting if: 1) you are a Hunter S. Thompson fan. 2) You are a patron of narcotics. or 3) You like deep movies, with meanings beyond simply making you laugh, or action movies.I personally thought the movie was excellent. However it is not comparable to any other movie I have ever seen. For me this adds to how great I think the movie is. For others, however, this may leave you wondering 'what the f#&amp;k?' I think this was one of the best movies ever made, based on one of the best books ever written, right up with the ranks of Faulkner, Miller, Camus, and the rest. I hope you find the movie just as enjoyable, and if you don't, don't blame me; it's not for everyone. But those who understand it will love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing is the most infamous and brilliant drug culture film ever made, right alongside Trainspotting, Half-Baked and Requiem For a Dream, although it stands alone in it's own sub-genre of hilariously perverted, crazy-psychedelic Gonzoism. Hunter S. couldn't have written a better story and Gilliam brought it into film with a masterful hand and a true reverence for the man, the myth and the legend. Whoever cast this one with the Depp and Del Toro combo was a genius and really must have read the book because I couldn't imagine a better Duke and Dr. Gonzo. I must have watched this one two dozen times (often while partaking in similar recreational activities as the characters on film) and it made me smile and laugh out loud every time and every time I saw something new I hadn't noticed before. The film is layered so thick and has so much going on, it's impossible to take it all in after seeing it one, two, even three times. Not everyone gets this film and that's perfectly okay.

		<fullReview>Undoubtedly one of the best films ever made, my hat comes off to Terry Gilligan. He's made an almost perfect adaptation of the insanely funny (and sometimes disturbing) drug-fuelled novel by Hunter.S.Thompson. I not sure how Johnny Depp didn't win an Oscar for his performance as Thompson's alter-ego Raoul Duke as it was absolutely perfect. If you've ever read the book I think you would agree with me. In my opinion it was some of the best acting I've ever seen and only Depp could of pulled it off thanks to his, shall we say, experience in the field of chemicals. Slightly over-shadowed but still a staggering performance was given by Benecio Del Toros as the disgustedly vile and twisted Dr.Gonzo (a clever little mention of the anarchic form of journalism Thompson created}. Del Toro is almost unrecognisable but pulls of one the performances of his career. Also there cameo appearances for Toby Maguire, Camaroon Diaz, Flea, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci and funny enough, Thompson himself. See if you can pick him out. The story follows journalist Duke who has been assigned by his editor to write an article about some obscure dirt bike race somewhere in the desert on the outskirts of Las Vagas. He is joined by his Lawyer Dr.Gonzo and a dangerous amount of mind altering substances as they terrorise various casino's and establishments around Vegas (I found the whole hotel room/bathroom sequence amazing as it manages to make you laugh out loud and cringe desperately at the same time. What it all adds up to though is the craziest, zaniest, damn right most twisted adventure I've ever had the pleasure to watch. But Thompson also has a serious message to tell people in his story. Thompson is deeply concerned about the disintegration of his country's soul and culture and Las Vegas (in Thompsons mind) is a living piece of evidence of this. His character Duke constantly reminds you of this point (while under the influence of an assortment of drugs) with his inspired observations. I think if you haven't seen this film then you really don't know what you're missing out on. I advise you as your attorney to rent this film, sorry, buy this film as soon as possible and watch it. After you've read the book of course. Let's hope the next Thompson novel adaptation 'The Rum Diary' is as faithful and brilliant. I would also like to say how much I admired Mr.Thompson for his ideas and his work and what a shame it is that hes gone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fear an Loathing in Las Vegas" is hardly to be considered a "movie", since movies show signs of dramaturgy, plot, and at best, a gist. The movie in question, however, is a weird way of killing time to watch.Many people I know are intrigued by this movie. This kind of people, to mention some diagnostics, also like punk, drugs anyway, hating everything serious, and talking about ways to destroy the system without offering better alternatives. They are low paid and have mediocre education.Liking a movie like this makes them part of the system. Watching two actors do things like that is just what they want: a legitimation to go on with their suicidal lifestyle. Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro did not go off like this; they were paid to pretend. That is a lot of a difference.Drugs and nihilism, the pathological desire to make fun the most important thing in life, and if soberness will not be enough, taking drugs to go one step further, are the catastrophic messages of this movie. But in the end, all seems to be legitimized by Mr. Depp's typings about Timothy Leary. How many of the exited viewers of this movie do actually have an idea who Timothy Leary was? And what proportion of those who do ask themselves finally research it? The most important lesson of adolescence is that nobody has the right to remain uninformed. Make yourself a fully rounded human being! Try do achieve that with a movie like this! Fail, and look somewhere else! And then, be part of a bigger world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>absolutely insane, I saw this movie and absolutely loved it, the movie is extremely trippy and funny, it's randomness and constant wonder if he's tripping, or just weird always keep u on edge, the storyline may lack but it is entirely made up by the cinematography and the fact that it's based on a real guy, , it is a trip that will take you personally on a ride that will wonder who is actually doing the drugs, this movie is best viewed in 0 lighting to truly appreciate the colors and the trippy entourage I would recommend this to any person into drug culture at all or who liked movies like Alice in wonderland or even is into college plays</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Big Trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terry Gillam's "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" is a quite powerful movie. Especially in entering the surreal visions of the mind of the drug abuser. They, I think, are pretty close to the real thing - so far from reality... And the movie actually is like on big trip. And this compensates for the lack of the real storyline or a thoroughly thought through plot. There is no plot in a trip. And in this (in what many might see a downside), in my opinion, this movie succeeds. The amount and tight sequence of the hallucinations, visions, fears and paranoias of Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo might seem even too chaotic and anarchistic - but isn't that the point?Journalist Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) are on their way to Vegas to cover a big motor-cycle race. They're following the American dream, as Raoul tells us. They're going to get the best of Vegas and get high, so high where even god can't see. And their trippin' - non-stop. If the race stops, Raoul doesn't even know who won. And the trip goes on like this. Until the end. Doesn't it get boring? No. Under Gilliam's golden hand "Fear and Loathing" takes forms so surreal and deep dives into an abusers mind that it will never get boring. And the script? - Who cares about the script, when you get a trip of your life?Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke reminds me a little of Tim Roth in "Four Rooms", but where Roth over-acts, Depp is totally in his element as the totally screwballed journalist. Beautiful performance. Benicio Del Toro as the weird Gonzo seems a little like the lizards which Raoul sees on one of his trips. Nice acting, comes pretty close to Depp. "Too weirs to live, but too rare to die," as Raoul describes Gonzo - works for Del Toro, too. His performance in his movie is manic, and here, it is apt. Both leads go so far out here as never before, and as they never will again probably. Lovin' it."As your attorney" I advise you to suppress all your prejudices that you have for weak story-lines and brace yourself for the trip of your life. Instead of drugs, take a hit of "Fear and Loathing"8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will never forget this film. It's a master work of our director, Terry Gilliam, one of the many men behind Monty Python which conspired to made that act great and infamous. I know there are people out there who will disagree with me, probably running up into the millions. I'll say this about them though, all of the people I've watched this movie with who haven't liked it, have all been either pretty sheltered, or were not the sharpest knives in the box. Not to say there aren't intelligent and experienced people out there who dislike it, for whatever reason, but I'm betting the asshats are in the majority of the nay-sayers.I won't ruin anything about this film in my commentary here, because a lot of the jokes will take explaining to some degree. I will say this, if you haven't seen this film, and especially if you don't know who Hunter Thompson is, you are missing out on people and events which may eventually wind up in our history books.10/10 - One of my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not for everyone. Not only is it funny, but it's got a meaning behind it. Sure, Cheech and Chong were funny, but it was more or less a bunch of stoner jokes (not saying that's necessarily a bad thing). Fear and Loathing is more than drug jokes, and more than showing the dangers and/or joys of drugs. It's about the American Dream. I won't start with the spoilers.. One of the most amazing things about this movie is that it's almost a DIRECT translation from the book. The book was amazing. If you enjoyed this movie.. hell, even if you didn't, go read the book. The book is fantastic. Beautifully written. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A savage &amp; hilarious journey to the heart of the American Dream.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas is based on a book by the same name by the infamous King of Gonzo Journalism, Hunter S. Thompson. The story follows the drug-riddled escapades of journalist Raoul Duke (HST's alter-ego) and his attorney, Dr. Gonzo (the alias of Chicano rights activist &amp; lawyer Oscar Zeta Acosta) as they search for the American Dream in the heart of Sin City itself, Las Vegas. The movie holds very true to the story line of the book, and director Terry Gilliam has done a fantastic job of conveying the effects of the drugs &amp; the chaos of the story itself - all on a very limited budget. Johnny Depp (portraying Duke) and Benicio del Toro (Dr. Gonzo) put on the most underrated performance of their careers as they portray the Good Doctor &amp; Acosta - Johnny lived in Hunter's basement, "The Dungeon" for 3 months, studying the Doc's every move &amp; borrowing extensively from his wardrobe, and, eventually, the Red Shark (a 1971ish Chevy Impala convertible). Benicio packed on the pounds, read everything he could get his hands on by Acosta as well as thoroughly consulting Hunter on his friend's habits &amp; mannerisms to gain insight on his role. The trip was originally to cover the once famous Las Vegas motorcycle race, the Mint 400, but immediately descends into a downward spiral of violence (just a little bit of gun &amp; knife waving), a full menu of drugs and scaring naiive tourists. It's a hilarious romp, involving hitchhikers, an anti-drug police convention with Duke &amp; Gonzo smack-dab in the middle, and an unfortunate Barbara Streisand portrait-painter, but there is a brief moment of lucidity, an eloquent speech written by Hunter Thompson, that encompasses just what the trip was all about. Look for cameos by Flea, Lyle Lovett, Ellen Barkin &amp; Penn Jillette, as well as the Doc himself.It's definitely not a mainstream movie, with climaxes &amp; action heroes, that everyone will enjoy, but to those familiar with Dr. Thompson's work and those that can maintain an open mind - ENJOY.</fullReview>

I swear, some of the things you people come up with in your spare time. The way I see it, there are two ways (that i recognize, possibly more) to enjoy this nice piece of moving abstract art. The first is to watch closely for all the nuances and try to discover the meaning behind it all, but this is potentially perilous because it all just might bust a vein in your head. The preferred choice i believe is to sit back, relax, and just enjoy the damn ride. "Buy the ticket, take the ride". Best damn advice i've heard in ages. This movie is practically slapping you in the face and telling you to not take yourself too seriously. So sit, recline, spark it up (if you are so inclined), and take the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The craziest trip without acid.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who is a fan of Terry Gilliam or Dr. Hunter S. Thompson will find something to like in this movie. It has Gilliam's odd take on reality and Thompson's cleverness with words which makes for a great combination. Johnny Depp and Bencio Del Toro give one of the best performances of eithers career lending credibility to the project. But be warned...there is a message here that will probably be lost on stoners looking for a thrill. This isn't a drug movie. If you go into the film with that frame of mind you will find much to love and ponder about. And if you have seen the film yet never read the book, go out and bye it, you'll find the next time you watch it that there is added meaning and substance to something that was originally just a "drug movie" to most. This is definitely the craziest midnight movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a master-piece of cultural experience. It captures both the phenomenon of Hunter S. Thompson, and the "feel" of it's time and place.If you're already a fan of either Gilliam or Thompson this is arguably the best work produced by either of them. If so, chances are you're already a fan of this film. Personally i think this film is magnificent in it's capture of Thompson the character as well as Thompson the writer. The dialogue is almost directly from Hunter's book, but is visually interpreted by Gilliam as if Gilliam was inside Hunter's head. If you've never watched it i do offer this: The first time you watch this film you may not get it. (Or at least not fully. The first time i showed this movie to a bunch of my friends they thought it was crap, a couple months later they invite me over to watch it saying it is the greatest film ever).

		<fullReview>The reason that fear and loathing is one of the greatest films ever is purely jonny depp. I mean granted hunter s thompson s book is one of the greatest literary texts about life in the drug culture. But jonny depp in the film is just unreal. He studies Hunter obsessively and it paid off big time. He was nominated for an Oscar as Jack sparrow, but this is his best performance ever. If you have not seen the film, you must. I must admit that the first time I saw the film I was not blown away despite the obvious comedy, but the more you watch it the more you pick up and the humour starts to jump alive. When you are drunk the film is even better to watch but you must watch it sober. Benicio del toro is a great doctor gonzo and camio's from Cameron Diaz, Tobey maguire, and Gary Busey add other class actors into the equation. In my experience the one line you will remember the first time you enjoy this masterpiece will be 'Wait no! We can't stop here this is bat country'. Watch it enjoy it and tell your friends 11/10</fullReview>

I don't think any other two actors could have grasped the role and acted like they were drugged and messed up outta their mind any better. As soon as Johnny appeared on the screen I knew it was going to be a great drug movie because he was in another great movie called BLOW. I thought the movie was hilarious. I loved Toby M. in the movie playin the scared blonde teenager who didn't know what he had gotten himself into! I enjoyed watching Del Torros interpretation of what it's like to be trippin on acid. He convinced me with his depressed and fearfully violent and suicidal actions. The movie is also very intelligent too. It has a very wide selection of drugs;Ether,mescaline,acid,adrenachrome,marijuana and probably more i forgot. I think you can actually learn about them from watching the actions of the actors. All in all i thought it was a 10!!!</fullReview>

It is very entertaining and very literate, the way that Raoul Duke phrases things.Johnny Depp does a wonderful job as one of his zaniest characters to date, and based on a real person no less. One of the most entertaining films I've seen this year, one of the best from a top-notch filmmaker. The directing, acting, and screenplay are all top notch. Definitely bizarre and unusual, this film is not for everyone, but if you want a literate Cheech and Chong this might work for you.

Gilliam takes care of business like no other film he's ever done. Gary Busey is the man that has one of the funniest scenes in the movie when he tries to persuade Depp to meet him at a rest spot for some hot love. I've never seen more cameo's ranging from Christina Ricci,Tobey McGuire,and even Hunter Thompson himself. If you understand even only a fraction of the world of Hunter S. Thompson then you will not be disapointed. If you do not undestand please educate yourself and realize why Gonzo journalism was only something that Raul Duke could pull off. Special effects will give viewers a peak into a world they may never be apart of. A masterpiece and extremley underrated. People that hate movie probably have'nt had much fun in thier lives.

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a complicated film, and a difficult experience to put into words. It cannot be categorized and it defies all conventionalism. But, then again, we must remember that Terry Gilliam is anything but a conventional director. Just three years ago he gave us 12 Monkeys, a thought-provoking and mind-boggling study of time travel and insanity, and three years before that he made The Fisher King, an utterly unique fable about deejays, homeless people, and the quest for the holy grail. In fact, if you trace this dynamic film-maker's career, it would seem like a fairly obvious step to follow up a science-fiction drama with an attempt to bring Hunter S. Thompson's controversial and seemingly unfilmable novel to the silver screen. There have been several preceding trials to turn this rambling odyssey to the heart of the American dream into something resembling a screenplay, but I would assume that most any writer mad enough to attempt this would surrender after the first several pages. Yet, somehow, Gilliam pulled it off, and while you may criticize his final result all you want, no one is in any position to deny that he fully captured the heart and soul of Thompson's writings. Fear and Loathing follows Thompson's alter-ego, Raoul Duke (played brilliantly by Johnny Depp), and his Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo (a somewhat indescribable Benicio del Toro), as they go through every drug imaginable and wander aimlessly around Nevada. While this is the story presented on the surface, there is much more going on beneath the acid trips and the ether binges. Fear and Loathing is ultimately about escapism. It's the early seventies and the mind-set of an entire culture has shifted from free-loving to a sudden awareness of social problems and the dangers of their previous lifestyle. And this is the setting in which a pair of seemingly oblivious potheads hallucinate their way through a reporting assignment in the city of sin. The film opens with a startling sequence of black-and-white news footage of protests against the Vietnam war set to an eerie arrangement of The Sound of Music's "These Are a Few of My Favorite Things." In between cuts, red ink splatters across a black screen and eventually forms the title card of the film, scribbled in the one-of-a-kind writing style made famous by artist Ralph Steadman. A similar sequence takes place half-way through the film, providing temporary relief from the previous barrage of dizzying visuals. Every image in this film is bizarre, eccentric, and strangely beautiful. While some failed to find this mesmerizing, and others went as far as to call the film downright "boring," anyone capable of seeing beyond the nonsensical hijinks of Depp and del Toro will certainly be fascinated by the visual effects presented here. Take the scene where Duke carries his typewriter down the hallway of a hotel to Dr. Gonzo's room: it's a simple scene, and it certainly doesn't demand much attention visually, yet Gilliam turns it into a feast for the eyes. The camera begins by following closely behind Duke and focusing on the carpet, it's swirling red-and-gold pattern flowing across the screen. It then rises to center on Duke, framing him against floor-to-ceiling mirrors on either side. The scene carries that type of perfect symmetry Kubrick was known for, and it's an excellent example of Gilliam's thoroughness as a film-maker. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas will surely be feared and loathed, but it will stand the test of time and, in my opinion, prove to be a future classic. Just like Dr. Gonzo, the film is too weird to live, yet too rare to vanish without a trace. All this said, I wouldn't have missed it for the world.***1/2 - Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie reminded me of two third graders on the floor trying to be funny and silly and thinking they were so cool they could do anything they wanted in front of anyone who was curious or repulsed enough to watch. So if the poop and vommit scenes weren't bad enough they had to put a bloated Benicio Del Toro in a bathtub farting bubbles and waving a hunting knife at a (miscast) Johnny Depp. I couldn't believe they cast Johnny Depp as Hunter S. Thompson.As for Benicio, I hope he doesn't do stuff like this anymore because he is too beautiful to turn into a whale just for a part in a movie. I don't care what Johnny Depp does, he's incapable of playing anyone other than Johnny Depp. Depp seemd like he was at a Halloween party dressing up as Hunter Thompson, but Benicio bless my soul WAS Oscar Acosta. There was actually promise during the Beverly Heights and Ice Water scenes, but the rest was too sophmoric and frat boy-ish that didn't do justice to the book.Final word: I loved the book but some things do not translate well on screen. A good actor is a terrible thing to waste. 6/10</fullReview>

I put the movie on and start watching it and I figured maybe it'll get better when they go to Las Vegas but it really didn't accept for the really (trippy) parts when Depp starts to see all these lizards. Then it starts getting more interesting when Del toro is gone out of the picture cause he was so wasted that it got really annoying then boring when he's back then interesting again. It seems like Del toro kinda ruins the movie sometimes. Anyway the film basicly turns on and off but it's still really good I'd recommend to people who arrent a bunch of stiff's and freak out when they see drugs.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this because I am a big fan of Terry Gilliam due to his Monty Python days but I was amazed at the sheer crapness of the film. I have watched Gilliam's past films and I know they can be a bit surreal ala Brazil but this is definitely OTT(over the top).Johnny Depp's and Bendicio Del Toro's characters can not be related to at all. Although there are a small number of humorous parts I would definitely not watch this again. It has taken me 4 attempts to get throuht the whole film.The only reason to watch this is if your a fan of Gillliam, a fan of surreal films or to see the star packed cast. But be warned Rent before you Buy!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas can assist one in breaking denial regarding the world we live in.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILER! The movie is a perfect example of how a group of people, sometimes classified as dysfunctionals - addicts, alcoholics, and people hailing from backgrounds which contained addicts and/or alcoholics, and also classified by some as the low-dopamine gang, view the world. A major circus, or as the Main Nerve residing in the center of a circus. The Main Nerve and The Matrix being synonymous. "What is control?" There is a lot of philosophy contained in the movie, if one is looking for it. Raoul Duke openly talks to his God and to the devil. The best one in my opinion being, "Lord, you better take care of me or else you'll have me on your hands". It is a classic scene when Dr. Gonzo is attempting to open the vial, or whatever, of cocaine in the top-down convertible traveling at a high rate of speed. Naturally, the coke flies away, and he asks something to the effect, "Did you see what God did?" Raoul Duke replies something to the effect, "God didn't do that, you did. I always knew you were a narcotics agent". These guys may be addicts but they are brutally honest, which is a Godsend. Both are intellectually with us, Gonzo is an attorney and Duke is a journalist. Their I.Q.s are obviously above average, which is standard for chemical dependents. Their comments and sarcasms are adorable and accurate.There are some esoterics involved in the movie; the bat country scene, Duke sees another of his selves in the club The Matrix, and experiences another consciousness dimensional shift in the men's room when he has spilled the white powder on his sleeve and also consumed some of the white powder. Even though his dimensional shifts are drug-induced, they are no less valid. The data regarding adrenochrome is accurate and some dealings with the Dark Force are portrayed. The bar scene with the reptiles is also a classic. Spiritual seeking is referred to frequently and the movie leaves us with the knowledge that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, operated and/or owned by a Force or a Being. The movie contains more truths than untruths and can be classified as "fiction with a purpose".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really didn't like this movie, but I did admire the acting. I did not know ANYTHING about the movie when I hit the "play" button, not even who was in it. After about five minutes of the beginning car-ride sequence I got this itchy feeling that I knew all three of the actors... First, I recognized Benicio Del Toro, then I thought that might be Tobey McGuire... I had to look on the box to figure out Johnny Depp. As in other movies I have seen, Depp made himself something totally new. That is impressive to me.Other than that, though, I didn't find much to like. It didn't make me feel anything, and only made me laugh a couple of times. One of which was when Del Toro was trying to get off the revolving carousel bar thing - I liked that.I guess I will have to try the book - maybe a lot of things are funnier to imagine than to actually *see*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people keep saying how faithful the book is to the movie. Fine. Does that excuse it from being mean-spirited? boring? ugly? anti-female? aimless? incomprehensible? unentertaining?The first scene has our two heroes hitching a ride in a red cadillac convertible. Because of all the drugs in their system, they hallucinate being attack by bats. The scene went on and on with no pay-off. Well, that scene didn't work, I thought to myself. And it went on from there. Like grown up children, these two bums feel they can get away with everything, from harrassing/threatening every female they meet to destoying their hotel room.It's just another one of those movies where the central character is really "cool" and everyone else is a jerk. Much like any Robin Williams flick.I almost could excuse this mess...IF IT WAS FUNNY!!!! BUT IT'S NOT!!!Every scene is the same. Duke and Gonzo appear on the scene (no matter where) and either insult or injure the people there. And it goes on and on and on like that.There's a short scene in the desert between Duke and a highway patrolman played by Gary Busey. You can almost imagine Gilliam thinking, "Now how can we make this cop look like an ass AND get a laugh? Of course, he'll ask Duke if he can kiss him. Haw Haw"It doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An awesomely awful flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With top-notch, hard-working actors such as Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro, Ellen Barkin, and Christina Ricci, how can you miss? Easy, if you have a pathetic loser of a script. This is supposed to be a comedy about 1970-era drug culture, but all of the funny moments in the entire movie add up to about 3 minutes out of a 2 hour running time. Yes, there are funny movies on this topic, just go see one of the Cheech &amp; Chong comedies. But Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not funny, is not droll, and is not even pleasantly nostalgic of its era. It is just excruciatingly boring, while you're waiting for punch lines which never come. And to boot, it is strongly misogynistic...where no woman is worth the time of day. Poor Ellen, poor Christina.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding reality in the chaos of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't enjoy Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas that much...Well...wait maybe I should start with what I did like about the movie. For example, Duke's (the main character expertly played by Johnny Depp) narration is at times completely hysterical and almost always clever. As usual Johnny Depp plays his role with great depth and sincerity, he is truly a great American actor. Del Toro also gives a great performance. I liked the actors and I think the movie is very clever in several respects (e.g. how it presents several different views on reality).Having said that, one might think I enjoyed the movie but...First, The plot was minimal; two men trying to deal with reality while on a drug bender. This is not a particularly strong or compelling plot and can only be shown in one movie from so many different angles before it starts to feel redundant. I think this whole movie could have been shorted to 30 minutes without sacrificing the main points or deeper messages. The last hour 1/2 or so is completely redundant; watching 2 guys get really high in one hotel is not to much different from watching 2 guys get really high in some other hotel. Despite flashy direction by Terry Gilliam, I still felt it was a completely directionless experience. Certain parts are very entertaining in a comedic sense (e.g. The "Reefer Madness" video showed at the Police convention), but the film often (more often than not) seemed boring to me. It seemed like it was trying to entertain me by shocking me with drug reactions rather than provide a good story for me to be interested in. I was not shocked by Del Toro or Depp's reaction to the mass quantities of drugs they consumed nor did I find their reactions particularly amusing. Since their reaction was supposed to be the entertainment, I was left feeling mighty bored during most of the drug crazed hotel scenes.FINAL RATING: 7/10 I give it a decent rating because the narration is most often very clever and there are some good deeper messages about drugs, reality and perception in the movie. Good job by Terry Gilliam and all actors. However, good direction and good acting can't make up for a weak plot drawn out past its abilities to be entertaining, annoying and boring redundancy, and the overall depressing hopelessness ever present in the cinematic mayhem that is Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.If you wish to discuss my views or send me a comment or question.

		<fullReview>Just like when you watched Wizard of Oz in mute along with Pink Floyd's "Dark side of the moon", Fear &amp; Loathing is one of those movies that you have to at least live part of the lifestyle to get through it. I saw it the first time and fell asleep right around the middle, after they got out of the hotel (the incident with throwing the tape recorder into the bathtub), but it was only temporary.On second viewing (and after reading the book about 3 more times), I was in a state of mind that wasn't quite right. Lying in the basement of a friend's house at 4am with the carpet soaked from the leaking house, drugs, booze, just DIRTY. And then, the whole movie made sense.It is a great film. But it is also a great book. Some parts of the movie take things from the end of the book and mash them right in the middle, which ends up working okay.It's a good movie, just make sure you're in the right state of mind.</fullReview>

Maybe these people needed a different book (how about another stab at NAKED LUNCH...) or MORE drugs to raise this to the level of "somewhat entertaining". If you erase the source material, FEAR is like an overlong non-animated tribute to HEAVY METAL's "So Beautiful &amp; So Dangerous": yes, That Bad. We should all celebrate any "amoral" ('though I could detect elements of "reaction") Big-Bud excess, but THIS is all rather sad &amp; pathetic - the product of a duped minority attempting to turn s*** into diamonds - perhaps that was The Intention? Lest We Forget: the "counterculture" this film exemplifies greased the rails for the New Left's contribution to the canon of Fascism - "political correctness" - and, isn't THAT one tolerant, non-judgmental, free-spirited, non-oppressive creed?!

After 2 hours I still don't know what I've watched. What's it about? Why didn't I hate it? I mean, I should hate this film because it doesn't have anything going for it. But it does, it's an acid trip for 2 hours!Reading the novel is a good start to understanding the writer's point, but I don't think I will. The answers lie in the film. How many films let you find the answer in its own negatives? Not many, huh?For 2 hours, we are taken on a acid trip with 2 people in 1971, during the time when Americans were searching for the American dream. I'll leave it at that, it's a film which commands your attention. The performances are fantastic!!!! Depp is brilliant! Technically, the film is breathtaking, the widescreen frame is used very well, each shot is composed with authority. I'm not a fan of the director but this is very good. The photography is perfect.You must see this film in widescreen otherwise you haven't really seen it.Overall, it's not easy to understand the point but this reason didn't stop me from enjoying it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hunter S. Thompson's book was, partly, a figure of its time &amp; place. Like Ken Kesey's "Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test" it described the lives of California hippies, bikers etc. during the late 60s &amp; 70s. But it also included political and social criticisms that were not only fashionable during the hippie revolution, but are valid for all humanity at all times that conformity of thought rears its ugly face. This is the chief problem with making a film of such a book today: the heros are mistaken for silly stoners. For much of the novel's social criticism, acted out through desperate drug abuse by those poor, immature individuals who were unfortunate enough to become involved in the revolution, who were indeed the brash, young heros against conformity known as hippies, is today mistaken for irresponsible behavior, or worse, the silly &amp; humorous and ultimately inconsequential behavior of the stoner.Was the behavior of the hippies entirely inconsequential? Or do we indeed have more freedom of speech and behavior today than we did in the 1960s? Of course the latter is the truth. But many neo-conservatives today wish to suppress this fact and are thus involved in painting such social criticism as nothing more than a fashion of the 60s-70s, the silly misadventures of stoned-out kids. This is the most dangerous aspect of political satire today; that is, when it makes light of such serious issues and thus demeans them. I suspect that director Gilliam, originally a comedian, has more of a mind to make fun of, than take seriously, the issues of fear, loathing and social repression. His "Monty Python" styled satire goes over the top in the case of this film and finally serves to detract from the original novel's subtle social criticism.The terms "fear" &amp; "loathing" in the title of Thompson's novel describe the life of the social/political subversive. The hippies, who are represented by main characters Duke &amp; Gonzo, stood for freedom of expression against the tyranny of such conformity, otherwise known as the "establishment" of "rednecks," "blockheads" and other conservatives who were sexist, had crew haircuts (ironically popular today) and believed that Americans should "Love it or Leave it" (meaning: love your country and a Christian god at the expense of thinking for yourself). Such conservative thinking overpowered and suppressed alternative, or liberal, thought in America and had been increasingly doing so since the second world war as liberals gradually were substantiating civil rights and other liberal conduct.The movie didn't explore these social criticisms very much, not nearly as much as Thompson's novel did (though it should be stated that much of the novel's social criticism was subtly portrayed within a veil of satire). Instead, what little social criticism can be found in the film is more thoroughly hidden within dialogue that is itself so sketchy that making sense of it is too difficult for today's average viewer. Meanwhile the rest of the production concentrated on the satire of being stoned on illegal drugs (as if that is a satire, which it isn't), with the silly-stoney camera angles, stoned characters etc. Consequently the gist of the novel, found in its title which suggests a socially subversive experience, was completely lost. This is why Hunter's novel is a satire AND an important social criticism, while this movie is simply a satire, and a silly one at that.As for Las Vegas, I can tell you from personal experience that little has changed since the time that this novel was written. I've often worked there (I'm a jazz musician) and every time I leave, I breathe a sigh of relief from its middle American, redneck, fenced-in-security-landscaping-for-$1,000-a-yard mentality. Gated communities may be desirable to some folks, but to an ex-hippie they are a particularly poignant nightmare to behold. Also, we mustn't forget Nevada's state motto: "Born to Fight," itself a testament that all outsiders must heed and tread in fear &amp; loathing. Just one shot of an automobile license plate displaying this motto would have convinced me that Gilliam was familiar with the social criticism at hand. But there was no hint of it, and therefore I give this movie a zero.</fullReview>

Johnny Depp has probably the best acting job of his career to date as Raoul Duke. The accent is hilarious. Terry Gilliam, who in the past has given the twisted gems of Brazil and 12 Monkeys, serves us yet another plate of the bizarre. Insane special effects and wide angle lenses provide an offbeat look into America's most offbeat city. Cameos by Christina Ricci and Cameron Diaz are an added bonus. The time frame is jumbled and half the fun is trying to decipher Raoul Duke's jumbled incoherent writing and narrating into something that resembles sane recollections and a plot.

I think that you only have to have been outrageously drunk to get a lot of it, and it is visually stunning and wonderfully surreal throughout. And the soundtrack's great too. My only advice is for those women who think Johnny Depp is the sexiest man in the universe - not in this film he ain't.

		<fullReview>As a history enthusiast, I enjoy watching old movies to see how the familiar places looked like in those days and one thing I don't like is a period movie, tries to imitate old times while nothing matches, not even the music! Everything looks like a parody. That was the very first blow, trying to picture early 70s Vegas in 1997??? It could be more fun for the audience and less money out of producer's pocket to just set the movie at present time even though its based on true story but who cares? who knows those REAL guys? Cut this period crap and leave the old image for Rat Pack, that's my advise. Now to the main point, screenplay! Awful! Nothing is in its place. We have 2 supposed to be heroes who are disgusting, not funny and no one sympathize with them. They have no goal. came to Vegas to cover a race but started to wander around for their own sake, so what? If it was not a parody quality period movies, with a well written screenplay it could have been a trendy Vegas guide-movie like Hangover and then a classic on enjoying Vegas in 1998 but what we ended up with was pure boring nonsense. I was a torture to watch this movie, I barely stayed awake to watch it till the end although it was too obvious by end of first hours that nothing special would happen. I would rate this movie as unwatchable TOTAL WASTE OF TIME!</fullReview>

I've seen interviews with him, saying he studied Thompson's mannerisms etc. He just didn't come across how I had always imagined Thompson to be; eg, I had never imagined the silly walk (ranging from very silly when HST was semi-straight to over-the-top silly when bent).And the only way I knew what Depp was mumbling through the teeth-clenched-around-cigarette-holder was because I have read the book so many times that the dialogue is etched into my brain.If you haven't read the book, you probably won't be able to understand what's being said or what's going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Johnny Depp. Wow. What can I say about this guy? He's amazing as an actor. But for his movie choices, he's a little weird. It took me a couple times to really get into this film. But it's actually pretty decent. You have to be in a strange mood to watch it. The whole story is kind of interesting. If you have never been on an acid trip and don't want to be, but are interested, watch the film. It's so crazy and psychotic. I thought it was good though. It has good acting and dialouge. I would recommend it. But like I said, you have to be in a certain mood. It takes a little bit to get used to. Johnny, he's one heck of an actor.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the point of a pointless movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people says this movie is funny but pointless, some otherssays it's stupid AND pointless. I think that this is a great characterbased movie, in which the point for including all those weird acidhallucinations, dizzy camera movements, confusing speeches andstrange silly adventures are a way to show how sick and rotten isthe world in which the characters are trapped. It works mostly forthe main character's monologues. When he talks about theAmerican dream and how society spoiled it, it's easier tounderstand the meaning: It's implied that American dream is nolonger a reachable goal but a bunch of forgotten ideas that nobodybelieves anymore, and when this character realized it, he had noother way to escape than self-destruction. It's a metaphoric,reflective movie rather than a plot movie. It is not a tale about twocharacters reaching a goal, it's made to think about what isexposed. It can be either a masterpiece or a piece of crap. It's just a matter of perspective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonny Depp is a good actor, granted. He plays this role well. Aside from him and his unique lines and delivery, this movie is just not worth seeing. Why?Reason 1: Drug culture is boring (and at times, nauseating). 'Nuff said.Reason 2: Failed intellectualism. Aside from the constant zany antics *flails arms around, sarcastically* of the two leads, there are brief moments of 60's nostalgia that try SO VERY DESPERATELY to be important but just come off as something that was thrown in to make this movie seem like less of a self-indulgent drug binge set to film. Someone else said that one of the reasons this movie is great is because it shows that the whole Leary philosophy was bass-ackwards and that drugs end up destroying your mind, not freeing it. The only problem with this interpretation is that it doesn't fit with the mood of the film! This film, despite all the dark bits and such, still glorifies drugs! The characters, despite all the ill effects they suffer, keep doing them!Unless you like pathetic drug movies or you're just very, very, very easily amused, avoid this movie. Two thumbs down, 1 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Gilliam is an underrated director, as is Depp as an actor. I've not read the novel, but the film spun a cranky, funny tale in and around Las Vegas.

		<fullReview>Filled with the usual wild imagery that one comes to expect from Terry Gilliam, Fear and Loathing... feels undercooked. Perhaps is stems from the fact that Gilliam inherited this project in the middle of preproduction. All of his other films, he started from day one. There is a sense of completion with the others, but something about this one just doesn't feel up to the high quality of his previous efforts. Johnny Depp is fine as the gonzo Thompson, and he is pretty much the highlight of the film. There are moments where it attempts to break out into a better film, but it unfortuneatly falls back into almost greatness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie as a whole was not great. There was no plot, and the humor which isn't great begins to drag on after no real point is established. The only thing that really kept the movie entertaining and sometimes amazing was Johnny Depp. He is absolutely astonishing with his voice and character mannerisms. He was absolutely incredible. I can not praise him enough. However most of the drug effects were exaggerated for comedic reasons and were sometimes unbelievable. Acting goofy doesn't make you high. I couldn't really find much of the humor funny due to an earlier comparison of the movie to requiem for a dream. I kept feeling bad for these people and the fact that they were never sober was scary. It was sad, and these feelings finally came to play in the scene with the waitress at the end. I couldn't really find the drug effects funny because these people are so messed up. People say I'm looking too into it; however this is a "true story". Johnny Depp delivered most of the funny lines and they were due to his character not the drugs he was using. Without him the movie wouldn't be half as good. 5/10 not three because of Johnny Depps amazing talent for characterization. Jake</fullReview>

Well, it's not a bad movie, but it's almost too weird too understand. Reporter Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and lawyer Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) go to Las Vegas - aka the domain of Frank Sinatra, Henry Kissinger and Debbie Reynolds - to cover a convention. The only thing is, they're doing polypharmacy (many drugs at once) and they get SO-O-O-O-O-O-O MESSED UP!!!!!!!!!

		<shortDescription>Another drug movie, about two morons wasting their time in Las Vegas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Breaking Things &amp; Acting Silly In Las Vegas", more like. A visually flashy film: so far for the one positive thing I have to say about this film...As for the rest... This relentlessly pointless and quite boring film makes one wonder what has been going on in the life of Terry Gilliam recently for him to decide to waste his talent, his energy, his time - and other people's money - on making it. Is he going through a mid-life crises? Possibly. Is this movie a way for him to weep over the oh-so wonderful "free-spirited" and "concerned" 60s? Probably. Is he a bitter old left-winger who desperately wanted to make a "hip" drug film (perhaps also inspired by the success of "Trainspotting") to impress the young viewers of today and inject into their brains some more of the old and tired counterculture nonsense? Definitely. Gilliam must have been terribly impressed by "Natural Born Killers" to the extent that he decided to make his own "NBK", only his would be about drug use, Vietnam, and all that. He uses similar visual tricks as Stone, but they don't help. Sure, this film would have been even more boring without the visual gimmickry, but unlike "NBK" it's dull. Gilliam's hatred for authority (and capitalism) is obvious, but his criticism of it lacks intelligence. His simple-minded portrayal of cops as brain-dead morons shows that he indulges in stereotypes just as much as the people he despises, which makes him just as bad as they are (if they are "bad"). Las Vegas is supposed to represent all that is/was foul in the American system etc etc etc, and this "point" is hammered onto our heads, on and on, with constant references to the "American Dream" and with American flags cynically displayed in every other scene. Gilliam has embarrassed himself and hurt his reputation with this big, indulgent yawn of a film, and it's really no wonder that the critics uniformly thrashed it. (Even Maltin, for once, managed to identify a bomb successfully.) Before the movie came out, Gilliam said that the "90s need this movie". No decade needs a movie like this.There is no good acting to speak of. This is by far the worst film I've seen Depp in, and his one-note line-delivery and unfunny performance get boring after just a few minutes. Depp and del Toro show us the full spectrum of grimaces they have learned to "master" over the years, and I only wish that the viewer could have as much fun in watching these two as they had in playing their manic roles. It is clear after just 2-3 minutes into this film that it'll be boring. The narration makes no sense 80% of the time, and the dialogues are even worse. The HMO is awful; there are maybe two or three moments in the film that might raise a feeble chuckle out of you. The so-called "events" and characters just pile up, without rhyme or reason. "Well, it's a drug film, after all." Ha. Nice try.http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/johnny_depp__a_biography</fullReview>

I was bored from the very beginning watching Depp stumble around in a way that was more akin to a Jim Carrey film than some supposedly intelligent view of a drug-related '70s trip. The plot was barely existent, and the film flapped around from scene to scene with no real direction. Technically, it was competently filmed, but as far as I can see this is definitely one of those films you either love or hate - and I think you'd have to be tripping to love it.

		<fullReview>Here we have Hunter S. Thompson's screen adaptation of "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". I don't remember this film when it was released back in 1998, and I don't need to wonder why. There are hundreds of bad movies out there, they are a dime a dozen, but the truly horrid ones are at least memorable, not so with this excessive nonsense. This forgettable slop is about Thompson's trip to Vegas, with his lawyer, to cover the Mint 400, 500, or whatever. To think that Thompson did not embellish his drug soaked experiences is a tad naive. In my humble opinion Thompson was so drugged out, many of the experiences he had were the hallucinations he witnessed while stoned in his hotel room. Depp is at his worse here, trying to deliver his lines while clinching his teeth around his cigarette holder, Del Toro does most of the heavy lifting here. Many of us today, like myself grew up during the 60's counter culture, and don't need films such as this fantasy to know the drug experiences of the day, along with the strife of the times were not anything to invoke laughs, unless your only memories were through the fog of booze and drugs. Like this film they were a bitter experience , better to be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gilliam's first bad film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although it is generally agreed that Terry Gilliam peaked early as a director, with 'Brazil', it's also generally thought that his subsequent films were usually at least good, and sometimes excellent. With 'Fear and Loathing', his batting average drops alarmingly.To be blunt, this is just a bad movie. It's annoyingly bad. Johnny Depp, who is capable of being endearing at times and annoying at others, seems to have taken a massive dose of annoying pills for this movie. In fact his character is so jaw-clenchingly annoying that it's hard to think of anything else when he's on screen, other than wishing it was a holographic novel, so you could strangle him. And even that wouldn't be so bad if I thought that he was being purposefully annoying, but I think he's actually supposed to come across as eccentric and wacky. In other words it's a plain abominable bit of character realisation.When you can wrench yourself away from homicidal thoughts about Depp's character, and actually look around at the rest of the movie, you find a boring, addled, stupid and pointless film that completely fails to capture whatever the book had going for it (and it was a good book, wasn't it?)Perhaps this should go down as a book that should never have been filmed. Not by Terry Gilliam, anyway: there was a distinct sense of Gilliam's ego and vision - and possibly Johnny Depp's - struggling against Hunter S. Thompson's. After suffering through this mess, I had to watch 'Ed Wood' again to reassure myself what Depp is like when he's on form. 3.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit to having a bit of a handicap when it comes to watching this movie, as I haven't read the book and had no knowledge of Hunter S. Thompson prior to researching the movie. That said, I feel the movie may not be as brilliant as it seems because of its dependence on the book, which left me, and many others, clueless.After repeated viewings, I was unable to grasp the point of the movie. Through researching it and Thompson, I've gained an understanding of the movie, however, I still can't get into it. I absolutely love the narration - the way he speaks, the words he uses, the phrases he comes up with - and how passionately Depp and Del Toro portray their characters. I love the way the director is able to simulate the feelings of nausea and dizzyness that are (presumably) associated with heavy drug use. The problem is, for me the movie can't win on technical merit and excellent acting alone.I feel that a movie which is an adaptation of a book should be able to successfully stand independent of the book, and this is something I did not see with Fear &amp; Loathing. Though I may fall in love with the movie if I take the opportunity to read the book or gain a further understanding of H.S.T., the apparent fact that reading the book is a prerequisite to fully understanding the movie is, in my opinion, a major downfall. Thus, I have to give Fear &amp; Loathing two thumbs down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Fear and Loathing" the movie is a bang on adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's same-named book. The book itself was a rather meandering, plotless tale -- an account of a frenetic drug-fueled escapade thinly disguised as a journalistic assignment -- expect Gilliam's movie to deliver much of the same.What the movie does have that the book doesn't are amazingly, frightful visual effects. One might think that a film that portrays such gross over indulgence in illicit drugs would persuade impressionable youth to do the same. Not so. Having been a life-long abstainer from drugs, watching this film only reaffirmed that choice. The psychotic highs and lows to which these two rise and fall would be enough (one would hope) to scare any adolescent to "just say no".Both lead actors forsook their vanity to bring these roles to life. Depp sported a receding hairline and Del Toro an extra 50 pounds -- all of which were accentuated by tight polyester of the 70's.While the movie focuses primarily on this hedonistic duo, the movie is filled with some unexpected cameo appearances: Cameron Diaz, Lyle Lovett, Tobey MacGuire and Christina Ricci, just to name a few.As the film is a very accurate depiction of this tale, one does not need to read the novel prior to viewing it. However, keep in mind that "Fear and Loathing" is not (largely) plot-driven: sit back, enjoy the ride and count your lucky stars that your mind and body will (most likely) never suffer the abuse that Thompson and his lawyer did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a shocker. I am an admirer of Hunter Thompson's writings, particularly "Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail" which perfectly captured the paranoia of Nixon's 1972 presidential campaign and helps to explain a lot of what happened after. When it comes to ungovernable passions, Thompson has X- ray vision. But this movie! If I were him I'd sue.(Maybe he has.) He and his "lawyer" are portrayed as a couple of very tanked boorish boring druggies who somehow avoid being nabbed in a place where the security is only slightly more relaxed than in a nuclear power plant. At least I think they do because I didn't last to the end. I suppose its a tribute to Johnny Depp's acting that I didn't recognise him as "Duke" (curious name in view of Thompson's famous dislike of the Gary Trudeau Doonsbury comic strip character allegedly based on him).It seems the director was Terry Gilliam. His is a talent requiring somebody else's discipline to produce good results, as was the case in the "Monty Python" series and "Time Bandits." This film looks like he was left to his own devices. For no apparent reason the whole film is shot in a red tinge from a variety of weird angles. Monsters left over from Jurassic Park pop up in a hotel bar but don't seem to unduly worry the stoked Duke who finds his way out without much trouble. Despite the pyrotechnics, nothing much happens and the two main characters are just... well, dopey. Definitely a "don't bother." Read Hunter S. instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for pretentious stoners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this film expecting a visually exciting, interesting, funny drama, and I was seriously disappointed. After the scene in the bar at the hotel (the first few minutes are quite good), the film dives into a boring slog through weird unlikeable characters, random events and irritating performances. This film proved nothing to me except that Hunter S Thompson is a pretentious hack and a waster who spent his time getting high and spending weeks coming to conclusions anyone could have reached. I myself am ashamed to know a group of stoners who all think they're Oscar Wilde when they're high, and I can assure you; they're not. The 'jokes' are unrecognisable and mostly unfunny. It uses needlessly derivative and meandering vocabulary (delivered in a way that will make you bang your head against a wall in irritation about 1 hour in) to disguise the fact that, ultimately, this film has nothing to say. If you found Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow annoying after 3 films, avoid this like the plague; he overacts to death. Benicio Del Toro's character is just a dickhead who mumbles incoherently for two hours and does whatever his character requires him to at the time; every other character is either unfunny, stupid, or a pointless celebrity cameo. If you're seriously delusional and think that getting high turns you into John Lennon, by all means watch this film. For those with a decent independently thinking head on our shoulders- avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Enough "Fear" and Too Much "Loathing" . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not even a twisted comic visionary like "12 Monkeys" director Terry Gilliam can capture the satiric lunacy of the late Hunter S. Thompson's hallucinatory, semi-biographical tale "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." Universal Studios clearly waited too long to shoot a film version of this screwball, drug-crazed 1970s' stream of consciousness narrative. The mocking novel documented a pill-popping, pot-puffing, coke-snorting buddy team on a psychedelic "Lost Weekend" in Las Vegas, enriched by layers of droll Thompson commentary that have a Groucho Marx spin. Like the Cheech &amp; Chong comedies, "Fear &amp; Loathing" suffers because it came out too late to cash in on the era. Drug campaigns, such as Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No to Drugs" and the ultra-violence of Oliver Stone's freaked out saga "Natural Born Killers" have make "Fear &amp; Loathing" appear less than fascinating in retrospect. I read Thompson's entertaining tome long before Gillian brought it to the big-screen and it just doesn't seem as much fun as when I perused its pages in the 1980s.While Gilliam's film shows incredible fidelity to its source material, the cinematic "Fear &amp; Loathing" seems hopelessly dated, thickly trenchant, predictably tame, often grotesque, and ultimately expendable. Despite its laudatory cast and first-rate production values, "Fear &amp; Loathing" amounts to just another tedious anti-drug message movie, lacking both the characters and the witty ingenuity of Art Linson's "Where the Buffalo Roam" (1980) with "Saturday Night Live's" Bill Murray.The loosely-structured, episodic screenplay contrived by Alex "Repo Man" Cox, Cox collaborator Todd Davies, Tony Grisoni, and Gilliam is embarrassing nonsense, featuring one-dimensional, zombie-like characters, hazy motivation, and a meaningless plot that wanders in search of an ending. Many critics have argued with good reason that Thompson's book defied the standard cinematic interpretation because of Duke's stream of consciousness plot. The story follows Thompson's journalistic alter-ego Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp of "Pirates of the Caribbean") and Dr. Gonzo (a beefy Benicio Del Toro of "Excess Baggage"), his free-spirited Samoan lawyer, on an odyssey to Vegas to discover 'the American Dream.' Ex-Monty Python member Terry Gilliam tells the tale with a heavy hand that deadens the satire in Thompson's literature. The result is a movie that generates little forward momentum after a promising start.Duke careens into Las Vegas in a blazing red convertible Cadillac. In narration lifted directly from the novel, Duke takes inventory of his narcotics: "The trunk of the car looked like a mobile police narcotics lab. We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of uppers, downers, screamers, laughers . . . and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls." Clearly, Dr. Gonzo and Duke are ready to rock'n roll.Duke's unnamed magazine dispatches him to cover a massive dirt bike race, but he spends most of his time smoking, drinking, snorting, and abusing just about any drug that he can when he isn't trashing his motel room. Only a few moments reward the audience that takes in this incoherence. When Duke registers at the front desk, the spiral pattern in the carpet begins to swim before his zonked-out eyes and the reservations clerk (Katherine Helmond of "Brazil") morphs into a giant moray eel. On acid, Duke staggers into a lounge populated a la "Star Wars" with goofy Ralph Steadman type lizards resembling TV's extinct "Dinosaurs." The rest of the time our heroes struggle to maintain their grip on reality while plunging ever deeper into their destructive fantasies. Dr. Gonzo abandons Duke, and Duke never files his assignment. Instead, Duke migrates to another motel across town where Dr. Gonzo rejoins him. The pair encounters a less than memorable array of characters, impersonated by Ellen Barkin as a waitress, Gary Busey as a gay highway trooper, Cameron Diaz as a bimbo TV journalist, Tim Thomerson as a hoodlum, Penn Jillette as a carnie talker, and Christina Ricci as a vagabond artist.Johnny Depp is ideally cast as Raoul Duke; he's a spitting image of the Thompson character in the Doonesbury cartoon. Thompson and his alter-ego Raoul Duke are both indebted to the late great comic Groucho Marx. Depp's Duke resembles Groucho's Captain Spaulding from "Animal Crackers." Depp very much looks the part of the gonzo journalist. Sadly, Gilliam and his scribes have invested Depp's Duke with minimal character beyond his wacky wardrobe. Duke prefers irresponsibility. He runs out on restaurant bills and refuses to pay for room service.Terry Gilliam took over the directing chores from Alex Cox about a month before the cameras rolled. "Fear &amp; Loathing" lacks not only the audacious punch that enlivened previous Gilliam classics such as "Brazil," "Time Bandits," and "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen," but it also doesn't have the grand wit, devilish paranoia, and the fiendish forces that appeared in those earlier Gilliam movies. Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo seem pretty dull. Never are we meant to sympathize with them, mainly observe their destruction as the destruction of Las Vegas, pictured as a cheesy take on paradise. Gilliam takes some nasty swipes at middle-class America, particularly the District Attorney's Conference where "Evening Shade's" Michael Jeter gives a cretinous speech about drug addicts while puffing on a cigarette. Such barbs are not without interest, but Gilliam appears to be embroidering clichs."Fear &amp; Loathing" ranks as Gilliam's most straight-forward and restrained film. Most of its physical action occurs over a 48 hour period in one basic location. Gilliam relies strictly on cinematographer Nicola Pecorini's use of wide-angled lens and Dutch tilts to give folks a clue about the warped perspective of the protagonists. Gone are the flamboyant touches that are a Gilliam trademark.Altogether, "Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas" qualifies as a major, mediocre disappointment from an otherwise brilliant director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good actor in a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'm going to see all the movies with Johnny Depp, because I think he's an outstanding actor. I liked his performance in "Dead Man" (1995) very much, it was incredible! That's why I started watching "Fear and loathing in Las Vegas". But I almost turned the movie off! Despite Depp's acting being good, it was certainly below his usually high standards.The movie itself was quite bad. I haven't read the book so I didn't get the point at all! Cinematography was bad too. I don't like movies about junkies, but "Trainspotting" (1996) was a good example of such movie. The main difference between "Trainspotting" and this flick is ideas. While "Trainspotting" did implemented some innovative ideas, this movie simply did not.If you watched just first 20 minutes and the last half an hour of this movie and skipped the rest, you wouldn't miss anything important.Overall score: 3/10. Just too boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a personal taste thing...Depp overacts like no one before or since!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998)There are some some strikes against this one--Johnny Depp is playing pure cornball, the wide angle camera wears thin, the bright colors are too bright, and the rest of the acting is pure silliness. But hey, this is exactly why people like it. I didn't. It lacked the wit of Monty Python (the director is an ex-Python man), and the intelligence. It depends mostly on being surreal, exaggerated, and overtly stupid, like a bunch of stoners might really be.So maybe you need to be high to get into it.Further, if you read the book of the same title, you catch this kind of cutting satire and smarts that is dumbed down here. When I read it I never thought it was slapstick stupidity, but a kind of pushing of acceptability, a fearlessness, and a willingness to experiment. It doesn't illustrate a psychotic world, and it doesn't recreate a drug experience, despite the visual effects. It throws painful narrative monologue voiceovers (Depp) too often. Things distort and it gets beautifully weird, but it doesn't seem enough. In fact, it seems like special effects.Be prepared that there is no "plot" exactly, but a series of incidents. This is not a bad thing...you are after all just supposed to dive into the world being created here. But the episodes seem to be free-for-alls, fun to make (I suppose), but maybe you had to "be there," literally.What can you do to enjoy the movie? Well, be in a very silly mood. How do you get past Depp's self-absorbed zaniness? I don't know. I couldn't do it. Personal taste at work. Why does it have a cult following? Well, that's the nature of cult followings--offbeat movies find an appreciative audience and word spreads. Read the book, maybe. That struck me as brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is this? This is no movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie appears to have garnered a totally bipolar reputation among the reviewers here on IMDb. Many people absolutely love it, many people absolutely hate it, many people think it is OK.Honestly, I had no opinion on this movie when I went to see it on DVD with my friend. It had its amusing moments (my favorite of which being the start, "We can't stay here! This is bat country!") But it appears this movie is nothing more than a series of moments. Much like life, but without any cohesion or purpose. Why live a life without purpose? Why watch a movie without purpose? For a summary, I can honestly say it's nothing more than "Two insanely high/stoned/intoxicated junkies wandering around Las Vegas, tripping out, and with Johnny Depp's character yammering rapidly on a variety of subjects, while Benicio Del Toro's character says virtually nothing save for the occasional line, and the scene where he freaks out in the bathtub." There is nothing more to it than that. Not even any sort of depth to it or message like "Drugs are bad" or "Drugs are good" or "This is what doing drugs is like." It just shows the two characters doing drugs.For character development, this appears as if some effort has been pushed into it on a very flimsy front. Johnny Depp's character is the paranoid delusional maniac, whereas Benicio Del Toro's character is the big silent guy who occasionally flips out. I didn't even discover until near the end the entire purpose of them being in Las Vegas---Johnny Depp's character is a writer having to write an article about a car or motorcycle convention of some sort.Random characters appear to have some emphasis in the plot or in reviews I've read (such as Gary Busey's highway sheriff, or Tobey MacGuire's hitchhiker), but serve no purpose except to proverbially pop in and say hello to the protagonists, then disappear It's not that little effort has been made plot-wise to the story--- NOTHING has been done to advance the plot; they do drugs, they fail their mission (writing the article), Johnny Depp drives off alone after the other guy mysteriously disappears and never returns (unless he DID return and I simply forgot.) All in all, I saw no stylishness that I hear about in the reviews, I see no artisticness to it. I see a shitty movie about two guys doing drugs and acting wacky. STYLISH, ARTISTIC, OBSCURE if you like, those weird kind of movies that confuse some people and are done really eccentrically and not in typical fashion, movies like Rob Zombie's two movies House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, "Natural Born Killers", "Memento", etc</fullReview>

A former cartoonist, he has his leads play their roles like characters from Tom and Jerry, while the tragically literal representation of Thompson's hyperbolic description of acid-psychosis is endless and unconvincing. This movie manages to be neither personal nor political, although occasional excerpts from the original prose hint at a depth and purpose wholly lacking in the rest of the film.

I mean movies that revolve entirely around the experience people have when they're using. At their very best, I find them tolerable (like Smiley Face). At their worst, it's a struggle for me to watch them until the end. This adaptation of the Hunter S. Thompson novel of the same name definitely falls into the latter category.Fear and Loathing is really just one sequence or events, repeated ad nauseam. Depp and Del Toro take drugs, see crazy stuff, freak out, and then take drugs again. If there's a point to it all, it's buried so deeply underneath the hallucinations and narcotics-fueled paranoia of the pair that I couldn't be bothered to try to find it. I found the movie to be annoying and repetitive. I guess it's an understatement to say that I wasn't the target audience for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that the late Dr. Hunter S. Thompson was involved in this atrocity of a motion picture. Didn't he realize what they were doing to his concept regarding Las Vegas? Aside from that, this so-called production wastes the considerable talent of a lot of gifted actors. Christina Ricci is fortunate that her vapid role in this travesty didn't stall her career before it actually caught fire. Ellen Barkin is totally out of place at the end as a waitress in a run-down dive of a restaurant in North Las Vegas. Her make-up job was so BAD that I failed to recognize her at first. What can I say about casting Gary Busey as a California Highway Patrolman? Not much. The scenario as such is disjointed, pointless, and lacking any kind of real social comment or value. After reading the other reviews here I am giving some credit to the cinematographer. The lenses were in focus most of the time.</fullReview>

It just felt like I was high on acid myself during the entire movie. For your information: I wouldn't know what that is really like, because I've never used drugs in my entire life, but how else would you describe what this movie does to you?I haven't read the book, so don't expect an entire debate on how good or bad this movie was adapted to the book. I guess they did a good job, because others who have read it said that it was exactly the way they had expected it and I believe them. So let's not go any further on that subject. But what I can say about it is that it visualizes very well what LSD and other psychedelic substances do to you. Thanks to the nice imaging and the good acting, you get an interesting view on how it is like.However, what I really missed in this movie was some kind of story. OK, perhaps the movie speaks already for itself just by showing how these guys react to all the chemical stuff that they put in their noses and maybe it doesn't need a story because than it all would be too mainstream for some people, but personally I still like a good story in a movie. I'm not saying this is a bad movie. It had some excellent, really funny moments, but the lack of a story really bothered me too much to enjoy it fully. I give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

The pacing is even through the film and the effects to try to give the viewer an idea of what the mind altering substance is like are good but not unique. Depp, DelTorro and Gillium have all done much better work in other films when they had a better script to work with.

The choice of Deltoro as the attorney was very poor and I feel that his erratic acting style performed here was not up to par, if one is to compare the previous films based on this subject. Too much twisting and over all the movie seems to be a complete disaster. Johnny Depp is a great actor, and closely resembles Murrays' character, when I first began watching it, I thought that it was Bill again. I cleaned my lens and realized that the connection between the two is much closer than Lazlos character played by Peter Boyle. The two movies simply don't match up in terms of direction, and style, despite the fact that they are closely related to the same people, though 18 years apart in film making. If you want to laugh a bit more, and feel closer to Hunter Thompsons general storyline, watch the 1980 version with Bill Murray.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, based on a book of the same name by Hunter Thompson, is about two complete idiots spending a weekend in Vegas, ostensibly to cover a motorcycle race, but primarily to see just how wasted they can get on just about every mind altering chemical known to mankind. Is there a point to this movie? Other than as an effective anti-drug "message" for teenagers, I can't think of any. Admittedly I haven't read the book, so perhaps this tale works better in print than on screen, but I cannot come up with much to recommend about anything in this movie.Is it supposed to be funny? Maybe, but mostly it's just sad, in a moronic sort of way, as we watch these two buffoons, stoned out of their pathetic minds, stumble from location to location, trashing hotel rooms, rental cars, and otherwise making total, obnoxious fools of themselves. It'd be one thing if they were actually having fun, but mostly they seem to alternate between raving paranoia and drooling cluelessness. If you want to see people being funny while on drugs, then the early Cheech &amp; Chong movies are much better, or for that matter, "Dazed &amp; Confused" or "Scary Movie".Is it supposed to be a form of social commentary? Possibly, although about the only conclusion to be drawn is that these two bozos are so whacked out as to make even Las Vegas seem normal and wholesome. The Thompson character (AKA Duke) and his lawyer sidekick are simply too stoned to offer up any sort of insights into the Vegas scene, the ONE thing (short of genuine comedy) that would have redeemed this effort.Like I said, about the only value I can see in this movie is to show it to kids, since the message of "This is your brain on drugs" comes through much more forcefully than those cheesy old ads with the egg and the frying pan.</fullReview>

For us good sober Americans, this movie is entertaining for at most a half hour, simply becuase two heavy drug addicts are somewhat funny to watch. But then it just drags on and on. And worst off, there is no plot, none that i can discern at least, other than two drug addicts go to Vegas and walk around high. Thats it! For two hours and more cameos than Charlies Angels, we see Depp and Del Toro walk around stoned, most of the time muttering unintelligable gibberish. This movie will not capture your attention. You will be sitting on your couch and when you wake up two hours after you started you will realize that yes, it is still going on, and no there is no way of knowing when it will end. Its amazing how much this movie can suck, seeing as how the director is great as are the two lead actors. All i can say is whoever greenlighted this project that at most should have been a ten minute gag needs to be fired. If you want to see a funny trippy movie, rent Brazil.

		<shortDescription>a movie this bad gets me curious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just what was anybody thinking? I know that Gilliam isbrilliant, so he must be aware that this movie is gorgeouslybad. so what's terry's story? was it blind nostalgia for a timewhich has passed? the opportunity to play with some new f/x toysand funky camera lenses? i want to know the story. i wouldbelieve that Thompson himself is baked beyond the ability todiscern wildly fabulous from tedious, but what was everyone elsethinking? dare i ask: what were they on?i read fear and loathing as an impressionable young teen; in myunconsciously internalized sexism i thought it was funny andliberating. i guess it is a worthy social document in its way.perhaps the movie can be seen as a paean to capitalist excess.the movie is a mini-Vegas unto itself, regurgitating crassimagery, propagating some big penis-y dream of wanton abandon.but aren't there more rewarding projects to engage in? morecompelling stories to tell?seeing this movie made we want to engage in Buddhist meditation,become an acolyte, a cloistered nun. There must be more to lifeand the movies than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The difference between this flick and Cheech and Chong is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cheech and Chong were funny. "Fear and Loathing..." is a big budget loser about a couple of druggies' odyssey around Las Vegas while hyped up and strung out and otherwise blasted out of their gourds on acid, ether...etc., blaaa, blaaa. The film makes no sense and relies on its star power and kaleidoscope of silly situations for entertainment. Unfortunately about the only way to enjoy this film is to be on drugs. Give it a try but remember, I told ya so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've actually watched VEGAS many times with different people to get a more honest "USER COMMENT" for anyone who cares what I think about this movie. I think Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro made this a cult classic for any and every drug addict out there. 'Special time and effort' was probably set aside to make sure everything was done right. It sure in heck is long, and many times you may miss some things, but when your buddy breaks out laughing at bats or lizards or carousels, you may wonder yourself if you should care or not.Two pot heads take a trip to Las Vegas, looking for the "American Dream."The actors try hard. If I had one thing to say about VEGAS first off, it's the effort in the acting. The sets were downright unbelievable. Cleverly thought out so everyone trips out at EVERY scene. It is too long and overbearing in the end. I do not understand any other point to making this piece of junk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't believe its the same guy who made Brazil (1985)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just can't believe that the same Terri Gilliam who made the classic cult film Brazil (1985), made this disgusting, repugnant and shallow movie. Whereas Brazil was a complex, graphically challenging film, with masterful performances; this film is an almost two hours long dull frivolous spectacle!! I hope Terri returns to his "Brazilian" roots, instead of making another awful movie. Personally I liked Benicio del Toro's performance, but the story lacks an argument, and it has a sequence of gratuitous events that don't explain anything at all. Plus, the movie centers too much in the main characters monologue, which impedes the viewer from understanding the argument.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a terrible movie. It has no redeeming qualities. Only a loser could identify with anything in this movie. Ha, ha, screwing your brain up on drugs is *so* funny! If some day any of my kids try to use drugs, my punishment will be forcing them to watch this movie 10x in a row. It is kind of ironic that a movie by druggies and for druggies is the best argument against the use of drugs (too bad this wasn't intentional because then the movie would at least contain a message). Depp and Toro are both considered two of Hollywood's sexiest men these days, I don't think that would hold up if more women saw this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, now. I believe you have to be on some sort of controlled substance to faintly enjoy this movie, and being that I'm not big into heavy drugs, just beer, I found this movie not only boring, but lacking in any rational thought.Thumbs down.&lt;3, Dave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've got three words for this movie but first I rather waste my time watching the lord of the rings trilogy then watch this crap. Here goes Worst Movie Ever. For those who are stoned watching this crap here goes I've got three words for this movie but first I rather waste my time watching the lord of the rings trilogy then watch this crap. Here goes Worst Movie Ever. Oh no are you too drugged out to figure out what a good movie is? Are you too stupid that you have to watch this crap? The reason why is simple there is no point second of all most people who probably watch this movie and though it was good are teenagers who had to stay behind in middle school. People wake up here this movie is crap and the people who created this should burn it and never let it be sold again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Loathed This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is way too silly and surreal for a mainstream film fan like myself to enjoy . The director Terry Gilliam fails to keep the two leads under control which means this is one painfully embarrassing experience . Please note that a couple of actors doing funny walks pretending they`re on drugs does not make a comedy classic . In fact it`s nowhere near being a comedy film but more like a sub-standard David Lynch movie , that`s how bad it is . Yes the cinematography might be good but hands up anyone who sat down to watch a film because of the cinematography ?My final abiding memory of FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS ? Well apart from the fact it`s total crap I do remember that Dr Gonzo had too much hair and that Rauol didn`t have enough . Life`s often not fair where hair is concerned</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is half way between being like a drug based film, and a road movie. So basically its a mix between Trainspotting and Thelma &amp; Louise. Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke/Hunter S. Thompson and Licence to Kill's Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo/Oscar Z. Acosta are two heroin addicts, and are driving through Las Vegas for nearly no reason at all. Along the way they pick a hitchhiker played Spider-Man's Tobey Maguire, offend a caf waitress played by Ellen Barkin. Also starring Christina Ricci as Lucy, Cameron Diaz as Blonde TV Reporter and Michael Jeter as L. Ron Bumquist. An interesting film from The Fisher King and Twelve Monkeys director Terry Gilliam, but kind of a one-time-see film. But Johnny Depp's voice and accent is very good. It was nominated the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm for Gilliam. Johnny Depp was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor. Good!</fullReview>
