		<shortDescription>A movie I can neither recommend nor rate. But acknowledge as film making surpassed by few others.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never written a review before - of film, television, book or any other. In fact, I've never written anything.But having, what I can only describe as, endured "Snowtown" for the longest two hours of my life, I feel compelled to put to paper what an extraordinary accomplishment it is.On the one hand. On the other, I damn the director, writer, producer and actors for making it. Or at least, making it so well.Because if this film had been made badly, it would be forgotten and brushed under the carpet. Instead, it will be revered as a blueprint of all realistic horror, a benchmark to which others will undoubtedly be judged. Which is an accolade that should be nowhere near someone as vile as John Bunting.This is not your usual movie-goer horror. Save for one never-ending torture scene, there is little gore, blood or screaming. Just empty lives, slowly dissolved by an evil one. For me, the Saw franchise was aimed at the teen market. And whilst there is no doubt that it is horrifically gory, I don't think I would lose sleep over my teenage child watching it. However, if I discovered my teenage child had watched "Snowtown" I think I would want to spend the next week propped up at the end of their bed, making sure they knew I was there. "Just if you need me."Following the perspective of 16 year-old Jamie Vlassakis, the film traps you in the room as a silent participator, whilst he is befriended and groomed by Bunting.By the time it had finished I felt as though I was complicit - that having merely watched had turned me into an accomplice. On more than one occasion I was close to switching it off. But such is the masterful direction, the suffocatingly silent screams of emotion and need to see whether the boy will escape from the hell he is zombie-footing towards, you feel you owe it to him to ride it out. Before watching, I knew only one thing about this film - that it was based on a true story. The gaps left in the plot by the director are intimidatingly adept at disorientating you, making you feel as manipulated as the individuals re-shaped at will by the serial killer John Bunting. The treatment of the murders is so skilfully handled - at times using voice recordings of the victims to tell you that time has passed and the depths of evil he has swum to have increased. At others, using morally numb expressions to warn you of the horrors either being carried out, or to come.The torture scene itself is abhorrent, yet disturbingly hypnotic. Where I would usually look away, I couldn't and found myself glued to what was unfolding; mentally pleading for it to stop. It, in itself, is a reduced study of everything John Bunting pursued. The acting from both Pittaway and Henshall, in this scene, but not alone, is worthy of any peer or award.Henshall is magnificent. Charismatic, believable and chilling - initially as an undeniable, albeit ruthless, role model in a town bereft of individuals with self-worth or respect. And latterly unfolding to reveal a cold, blood hungry psychopath. The stench of death truly is palpable, of both flesh and society. It doesn't make you want to hide behind your sofa, it makes you want to claw at your sofa so that you can curl up and hide inside it.Recommending this film to your friends would be a bit like recommending hard drugs to them. It may open their eyes - but at what cost? It is something that should not be your choice, you don't need the responsibility. My final words must go to the director, Justin Kurzel, for whom I understand this to be a directorial debut. I genuinely don't know how. I have watched many films, almost always with an amateur critic's eye, and this ranks up there as one of the most soul trembling films I've seen.Please turn your hand to action or comedy. I don't think I can face another of this genre from you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A harrowingly realistic portrayal of torture and murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Snowtown is probably the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. (Note: To back that statement up, I have watched most so called 'torture-porn' flicks, including hard-edged foreign stuff like Martyrs and Audition.)Unlike the vast majority of horror films, Snowtown depicts torture and murder in a way that is almost documentary-like - nothing is sensationalized, which makes it all the more horrific. You are essentially a fly-on-the-wall during a real-life murder. The strangulation scene in the bath tub is almost unwatchable - and it seems to go on forever.I found it incredibly hard to watch and it has seriously shaken me to my core. Cinema is supposed to affect us, and Snowtown certainly did, which is why I've given it 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why people are coming down on this film, i thought it was amazing and spectacularly represented the emotions of the people involved rather than the actions. I am glad it didn't go into all the violence into more detail even though i know the real killings were worse than depicted in the film. I think that it was not the intention of the director to have another gory wolf creek serial killer story. I had not heard any hype about the young actor looking like heath ledger until now but had commented to my partner a few times in the movie how striking the similarity was!I loved this film and thought it was well directed and have no idea how the actors got through some of those scenes.. well done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and affecting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite a well crafted film and the concepts it presents are quite disturbing. It shows the killers to be very cold, calculating and generally indifferent in the way the murders unfold.I don't think it will be a very accessible film for most cinema goers, as the style and tone are very depressing. It is a very simple plot on the surface but the way it presents the characters is sometimes quite confusing, and i found it quite hard to follow who all the characters were and how they were related. It is appropriately photographed, the production design is correctly sparse and bleak and the soundtrack is very effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intense look at Australia's most infamous murders.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film to cover the horrific 'bodies in the barrels' murders, SNOWTOWN has been eagerly awaited by many fascinated Australian's; all assuming the movie would glorify the events which took place in South Australia.Snowtown premiered, fittingly, at the Adelaide Bigpond Film Festival in Australia to much applause and approval from the audience. Several documentaries on the murders, majority of which took place in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, were very over the top. There was a lot of worry about the movie being just as graphic and violent.Raw, confronting, and chilling in content, the movie did not cover all the murders. Many know that John Bunting and Robert Wagner would have the victims record messages for family before being killed, which was referred to as 'voices from the dead'. Instead of portraying most of the murders, the movie would just echo the recordings of the victims.Another surprise of the movie, was the lead character being Jamie Vlassakis; who would eventually accomplice Bunting and Wagner in the murders. Even myself would have thought the movie would focus more on John Bunting.The movie began showing the raw and impoverished lifestyle Jamie shared with his younger brothers and sick mother Elizabeth Harvey in the Adelaide northern suburbs. When a neighbour 'looks after' Elizabeth's sons, along comes John to watch over the family and begin his relationship with Elizabeth. Jamie and John connect immediately, with Jamie taking a liking to John and the relationship he has with the family.Unbeknownst to Jamie, John and his friends are on a killing spree, targeting homosexuals and pedophiles.Until John shows Jamie the body of his friend Gavin, Jamie becomes reluctantly involved; taking part in the murder of Jamie's half-brother Troy, who earlier in the movie raped Jamie.One of the only flaws this movie had were the two murder scenes portrayed. Most of the violence was off-screen, but saying this, the movie was made tastefully and is respectful to the victims families and friends, not going into too much details on the murders.Justin Kurzel did a terrific job directing the well casted unknown actors, and was able to create a very raw, unsettling and draining atmosphere without focusing too much on the murders, but focusing more on the relationship between Jamie and John. The real highlight of the movie was Daniel Henshall's portrayal of John Bunting. Henshall was able to bring much dark and light to the character, which made his performance as Bunting very believable and the film much more powerful.Snowtown is definitely worth a watch, but if going to watch with little knowledge of the background of the murders, I would recommend reading up on what happened otherwise the movie may be hard to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Snowtown follows the experience of young Jamie Vlassakis as he partakes in the infamous 'bodies in the barrels' murders. Director Justin Kurzel has created a film that gradually pulls away the illusion of justified vigilantism to reveal the sadistic and evil core of John Bunting and his co-accused. The rare scenes of violence have such a profound impact that they are difficult to witness, the imagery of the Australian welfare suburb is captured with such florescent realism that you can almost taste the atmosphere. While at times fragmented, Snowtown is a rare and expertly crafted biopic that will tear at your senses and stun you into submission</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eye opening, shocking and brilliant... it made "This Is England" look like a Disney film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not like any other film I've seen before, I think that it would be an understatement to say that this film was chilling and eye opening. This film terrified me, and amazed me in it's brilliance. I don't know where to begin, but when I think back to this film I remember how I'd felt while watching it, which is also something I can't even begin to describe. I never write reviews but for this one I felt I should just because I believe that a lot of people pass on watching films that don't have a rating above 7/10. But this film, definitely deserves to be watched. At the time when I watched the film, I only found out afterwards that it was a true story. And you won't believe how little difference that made to how I already felt, because it was that powerful already. I felt terrified, and I'm not the one to be 'scared' easily, but you should've seen what it did to people who do get scared. This film like many other brilliant films has left me with something to think about afterwards, but unlike any other movie I've ever seen before, Snowtown gave me a slap across the face to open my eyes to an obvious truth. And it felt harsh to realize it, as it probably did for anyone who's seen Snowtown. It's that murderers exist, and yes it's no surprise, but this film showed me just how desensitized we all are to murders, serial killers. That's why watching this film felt like I'd experienced something. It's like that same exciting feeling you get when you watch Avatar and you're 'experiencing' the 3-D aspects, but for this you're exhilarated and experiencing something so f"cked up and real. It made "This Is England" look like a Disney film. This is actually a quote that seemed to best summarize what we all felt as me and about 8 other people discussed the film outside the cinema. And we could still hear a hint of fear in our laughter then. It wasn't just another film. I've been inspired by how realistic the scenes are, I can't imagine that it was just scripted scenes, it truly felt all real. The actor that played the killer was the most terrifying character or man I've ever seen on film. You must watch this, a lot of people have become obsessed with this film, and it definitely deserves a higher rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snowtown Murders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Snowtown Murders also known as the Bodies in Barrels murders were the murders of 11(the twelfth charge of Suzanne Allen was dropped due to lack of evidence)people in South Australia, Australia between August 1992 and May 1999.The crimes were uncovered when the remains of eight victims were found in barrels of acid located in a rented former bank building in Snowtown, South Australia on 20 May 1999.The leader of the perpetrators was John Justin Bunting.He hated paedophiles,gays,drug users and obese people.The victims were horribly tortured before death using everyday tools such as pincers,pliers and clamps.The final victim of Bunting and his murderous crew was cannibalized."Snowtown" is an unsettling crime drama based on The Snowtown Murders.The acting is great,the atmosphere of decaying landscape is bleak and there are some brutal scenes of torture,murder and animal dismemberment.8 murders out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful, authentic and confronting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant in it's authenticity and simplicity. The attention to detail, costume and set design deserve recognition and credit. As the viewer you actually feel like your in the 90s, from the Nike Air sneakers to the Sega Master System etc. There is no clear distinction between characters at the beginning of the film, who are complex to say the least.This may leave some audience members confused, but also add to the intended emotions of the film. The actual murders were committed amongst the seemingly mundane and relatively normal lower class suburbs of Adelaide. The director Justin Kurzel, does a fine job at recreating that image. I loved this film because I am some what a crime buff and have a profound interest in Australian criminal history. This movie captures the very essence that is Snowtown. Crime buffs especially will enjoy this movie. The director doesn't necessarily rely on graphic imagery to the extent some people may think. More the psychological game of fear and suspense is applied through out the feature with impeccable brilliance. My heart was racing for a majority of the time, even the quieter moments don't allow you time to relax as the suspense builds. Snowtown is definitely not for the faint hearted or squeamish, but it is for those who can appreciate gritty Aussie crime flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good, but can be confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you watch this film, I recommend going to YouTube and watch a doco titled "Serial Killers - The Bodies in the Barrels". It's about 40 mins long, but fills in a lot of details that you might struggle to understand in the film.Snowtown is actually quite a good film, but I'm not sure I would have enjoyed it without watching the doco beforehand. It focuses more on the people involved (and is quite a masterful film in that sense - great cinematography), and is quite restrained in its depiction of what actually happened. The major flaw is that you really have no context for a lot of what is happening - people, timeline etc. The doco I mention fills in a lot of the blanks and makes the film far more powerful.The film is told from the point of view of James Vlassakis. The narrative doesn't really display the true horror of what happened precisely because it is about James, and what he saw/was involved in. He becomes involved in the killings towards the end, but they had been going on for some time. Unfortunately, I think that means that the real horror of the events go largely unnoticed. That is both good in that it really is told from the perspective of James, which I appreciated after watching the doco and also bad, in that the audience doesn't get to see just how horrific and depraved the killings were.Because I had watched the doco prior to the film, I knew what the other killers had been doing, and at what point James became involved and why. Without that context, I think the film will feel a bit dull to a lot of people. Seeing as I knew what was happening (but is not shown in the narrative), it helped to contextualise it, and also appreciate the narrative as being told from James's point of view. The doco delves into James's character a little bit, and that helps the film.(EDIT:) For instance, the doco points out (or at least theorizes) the reason why Bunting and the others were murdering people. The film doesn't really address this. Perhaps the truth is just too complicated for a narrative film. I can appreciate that. However, there's a lot of unanswered questions (both from the doco and the film, although the film doesn't delve into those too much). The mother of James Vlassakis was herself involved in at least one of the killings (although the film doesn't depict this). Some of the characters actually helped kill people, and then were killed themselves. The film doesn't say why.Without some context and background info, it can be hard to sort out the characters. This is both a strength and a weakness of the film.I can remember when this story broke, and the news all reported that the killings were motivated by money. Bunting and the others would impersonate the dead people and collect their welfare cash. The doco claims quite a different story. It notes that Bunting seemed to target suspected pedophiles, and had a "spider wall" - a chart - of suspects on his wall. This is seen in the film, but not really explained. I personally wonder if the money/fraud aspect (which did indeed happen) drew some people in to assist in the killings, whilst the core group of Bunting and others were motivated by more sinister intent.One significant part is that after the final murder, Bunting and another man actually cooked and ate part of their victim. That's not the actions of people who are just killing to commit fraud. I don't fault the film for not showing that, but it gives an insight into the true nature of the actual events. Although I praise the film highly, I do so having previously digested and read about what happened. In that context, as I've said, the film is excellent, and one of the best Aussie films made. It's dark, gripping, harrowing and throughly compelling. (END EDIT)It's quite slow, but has an inexorable pull to it. The acting feels quite authentic. Bunting's character seemed a little too young, at least compared to how he looks in real life.Despite being called Snowtown, most of the murders happen in Adelaide. Snowtown was where they discovered the bodies after the killers moved them from Adelaide.Watch the doco on youtube, and then settle in for an engrossing film that is really very good (if a little too long). Watch it without seeing the doco, and you might be bored.7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Boddies in the Barrels Murders.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The press junket and first wave of critical notices built Snowtown up as a throat ripper that will cause you nightmares. That didn't do it any favours as per expectation levels for the horror enthusiast. However, this is a superb piece of film making, a real gritty and grainy deconstruction of the human condition gone sour. As with all films of this type that are based on real life incidents, it pays to read up on the facts if you be so inclined. Debut director Justin Kurzel doesn't shirk from the horrors of the case, but skillfully he doesn't bang everyone over the head with shock tactics to grab the attention. It's a relentlessly bleak picture, there's a continuous build of impending dread, of human devastation wrung out by a master manipulator (Daniel Henshall as John Bunting superb), the depressing story told through the eyes of the simple and confused Jamie Vlassakis (Lucas Pittaway).Not to be watched if one is looking to be cheered up! But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be sought out as essential cinema. It's a strong and potent film, worthy of inspection by adults who understand that not all film is about entertainment. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent example of gritty Australian realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the other people who have written reviews who say that it is good to get some background on the murders as I watched this without any and was confused in parts. What is interesting is that the film makers either assumed that you would have this knowledge, or accepted that the plot would only partially be known. In that sense we really are like witnesses who aren't let in on all the facts - in a strange way keeping some of the plot details leads to the sense of claustrophobia in the film.Snowtown is an excellent example of the genre of gritty Australian realism which includes films like The Boys and Idiot Box.This reminded me a lot of The Boys in building tension slowly and I think the rhythm of the film was spot on. It was also similar in the sense that it suggested that poverty and a lack of opportunity lead to violence (not necessarily for Bunting but probably for the other characters). But I think this just reinforces prejudices about poverty that middle class people have.I think that Jamie was a very good choice as a main character because he clearly had the most complex relationship with Bunting and what he was doing. As the audience we were also invited to have that relationship thenI was pretty surprised that the film only had an MA rating rather than R, particularly given the nature of the violence portrayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, grim, realistic and brilliant Australian movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't quite know what to expect when I put this DVD into my player, but it certainly wasn't this. Snowtown was so much better than what I hoped for, and it left me with a satisfaction which only some movies manage to do for me. Of course I knew on forehand that it was a movie about serial killings, but it got well above all those cliché SK movies that have begotten so common. For starters, Snowtown feels very realistic. We don't get to see the story from the perspective or main focus of the main serial killer, but we see the world through the eyes of the son of the family - soon to be dominated by John. John initially comes over as a charming guy who likes to be the Knight in Shining Armour against pedophiles, but it doesn't take long before we know that his ideas are obsessions which go from 'let's teach the guy a lesson' to an excuse for executing his sick fantasies. Jamie, our protagonist, initially likes John's charms but soon finds himself in a very vulnerable, confusing and dangerous position. One can not help but feel sorry for the lad.The movie takes place in a realistic setting in a poor part of town, which is made even more depressed by the bleak colors of the movie. There is no Yellow Brick Road in this Land of Oz. Though the story may initially be confusing, and some reviewers advice to read up on the case (Snowtown Murders, Bodies in the Barrels), it's certainly watchable without that information. However; I do agree that it's the best if you dó read up about it, no matter if it is before or after you have seen this movie. Bits of the puzzle will fall into place and it makes the movie even better, because of the authenticity of what happened. There are a few very violent scenes in Snowtown, so it's not for those with a weak stomach, but most is kept to your imagination. It's a psychological thriller that focuses on what happens with Jamie. So do not expect to get a full story about John Bunting's life. Snowtown is a story without a real beginning and without a real end. Still; it doesn't need any, it is just perfect the way it is. The acting is convincing and natural, Daniel Henshall gives a chilling performance of Bunting going from reasonably charming to a total sick creep. Lucas Pittaway is well cast for the role of Jamie, and he does remarkably well in making the audience believe how the lights fade out in Jamie's eyes throughout his nightmarish experiences, going from adolescently bored to traumatized numb. I gave Snowtown a 9 instead of a 10 (though I would rather have given it a 98 out of 100) for the parts which are a bit confusing, especially the beginning is a part you really sort of have to sit through. But be patient; once it's at speed, and you let go your expectations but simply experience it, Snowtown drags you in and will not easily let you go. I watched it about one and a half week ago and it's still fresh in my head. It's a movie that grows on you, even after you have finished watching it. Well done, very well done indeed, Mr Justin Kurzel! This is exactly how I like my movies. I do hope to see some more of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ideas, not emotions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting film.It forces you to confront your assumptions about justice, family, loyalty and class. Many of the shots stick with you, and feel uncomfortably real. The acting is all impressive, especially Daniel Henshall who is mind-blowingly good as both the affable father-figure, and the blood-thirsty maniac.But with all of these great qualities, you can't help but feel like you're just observing things happening, and not engaging in anything emotionally. This seems to have been a specific choice made by the filmmakers, since they put us in the point of view of Jamie, who barely reacts to the world around him.It's an interesting idea - putting us in the point-of-view of a teen who has become deadened after a nightmarish upbringing where he's molested by the neighbor and ritualistically raped by his older brother.As an experiment, it works - we watch the events of the film with the same detachment he does. But as a story it fails, because it's impossible to engage with anything we see taking place. Instead it all just adds up to a few grisly deaths on and off screen, and an endless number of conversations around the dining room table about murdering child molesters (seriously - do these guys talk about anything else?).Overall, it was an interesting idea that left me totally indifferent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have some ambivalent feelings here. Surely Snowtown Murders deserves several awards for what it is. The raw portrait of psychopathy is fleshed out and probably perfect, delivered trough profound performances and classically skillful direction. Also, the agenda works on a level that few directors dare to, or even can work on, reflecting information in a way that it actually appears as meaningful as it can and should be. Also director Justin Kurzel refrains from any voyeurism where most other directors would have given in to the temptation. This is a serious theme and Kurzel threats it as such. And this is exactly the point. Putting some queer sense of enjoyment beside, this movie is not meant to be enjoyed and it probably can not be for most people. This serves it's agenda and it works, but you must ask yourself: is there entertainment for you beyond entertainment? Obviously, if you are a film student, there is a lot to gaze on here, but besides that, is there anything you can really get out of this movie that is worth voluntarily spending two hours of your life on? Unfortunately, to know, you must see for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relentlessly grim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If director Justin Wurzel was trying to make a movie that could be described as bleak, grim, depressing and dreary, he certainly succeeded. He also made a movie which could be described as dull, boring and tedious.This film stretches out for nearly two hours and in that time there was no hint of a narrative nor of any fully developed characters, good or bad.It looks as if the filmmaker was striving to create an art-film depiction of a suburban wasteland where anonymous faces are interchangeable and no one really matters; people drift in and out with no real purpose to their lives and are unable to see any purpose in anyone else's, and when neighbours start disappearing and there are whispers about what is happening, no one says or does anything to stop it.It was in this environment that a group of dead-eyed wraiths lead by a Manson-esque psychopath, John Bunting, murdered twelve people over seven years and the scariest thing about this film is that it all really happened and was allowed to happen.All of this should make for fascinating viewing. Unfortunately this film is so focused on tone, boring things like plot and character have been neglected. It's a series of events in dull lighting that may or may not correspond with each other. The who, what and why's of the actual events are never revealed.Where did Bunting come from? Why were the others so in awe of him as to do his evil bidding? Who *were* the others? Who were the victims? How did all these people know each other? How were they caught? Who knows. I couldn't keep up.Watch it if you want to throw away two hours of your life. Don't watch it if you don't (or if you love dogs).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, another indie film praised to be blah blah amazing etc whatever.Films starts off with a confusing monologue to passing fields filmed from inside a car.Main character barely speaks at all....gets raped by his brother......acts like it never happened....????Main character Jamie (who is aged 15/16 or around that) lets a paedophile take nude pictures of himself and his younger brothers......is that even realistic???? Is this guy a retard with no brain and just lets people abuse him constantly? He is a puppet throughout this film.Mum gets a new boyfriend whos a serial killing psychopath and kills quite a few people throughout the film without her knowing, and by the way where the hell is she during all these violent scenes in the film? Shes NEVER there.We find out that Jamie is a schizophrenic so could explain his behaviour to everything happening around him. BUt by this point in the film I'm losing track of what is going on.Sorry but this film is so disjointed and its like watching a film about mentally ill people.There is a nasty graphic bathroom scene which involves the serial killer slowly killing Jamie's brother, the one who raped him. Seriously, what is the point???? What is the point in showing him chop up dead kangaroos also????I never believe the reviews by critics and the like but I at least expected this to be a well made film and its not. It's a incoherent mess which relies on violence to make an impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Snowtown Murders - Catch It (A-) All I knew that I was really exciting to watch the Snowtown Murders based upon infamous Snowtown murders in Australia. But to my surprise I couldn't have been speculated the reason or story behind these murders since I forgot about its promos which I saw 8 or 9 months ago. It won't be wrong to say that this is one of the most disturbing movies I've seen in recent years. It creeps into your skin and you want to pause for a moment to digest what exactly you're watching. This Australian is based upon infamous serial killers who brutality murdered almost 16 people who were either pedophiles or homosexuals. The movie is revolves around Jamie Vlassakis, who along with his young brothers get physically amused by his mother's boyfriend. When her mother finds out with help of a transgender and his group who are helping people against pedophiles, she goes ballistic on the boyfriend and report to police but as usual police fail to provide justice. After that one of the helper against pedophiles John Bunting moves in with their mom and becomes the missing father figure in boys' life. He helps them getting rid of pedophile off the street and also entice fellow neighbors to do something about it. His persuasive nature forces neighbors and young Jeremy to commit multiple killing alongside his rapist step-brother and innocent Half-brother. The Snowtown Murders is almost perfect but there are moments when you want more clarity than imagining what's happening behind closed doors. Beware; the torturous death of Jeremy's rapist step-brother will make you squirm. The performance by Lucas Pittaway as young Jeremy is absolutely incredible. He may not have many dialogues but as an abused teenager, he gave a superb memorable performance. Daniel Henshall as psycho serial killer John Bunting is creepy as hell and perfect to play the infamous psycho killer. All supportive cast was natural &amp; brilliant. In the end, it's a great emotional &amp; physically brutal movie which leaves you dazed long after you watched it. It stays in your head, and I'm sure everyone will hit GOOGLE to get more information about the most infamous Snowtown Murders in Australia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snowtown: when reality is horrific enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On 20 May 1999 in Snowtown, a small town about 100 miles north of Adelaide in South Australia, police discovered the bodies of eight people in a disused bank vault. Following a five-year investigation, John Bunting, Robert Wagner, Mark Haydon and James Vlassakis were arrested and charged with a total of 11 murders, as three other victims were later discovered buried in nearby locations. The corpses found in Snowtown were all kept in barrels of hydrochloric acid, leading the media to dub the incident the 'Bodies in the Barrels' murders.They are some of the most shocking and notorious murders in Australian history. Led and orchestrated by Bunting, the group tortured and killed homosexuals, suspected paedophiles and anyone they deemed unworthy to live. Most of the attacks targeted people from their own community, and even their own families.Earlier this year, the final few suppression orders surrounding the case were lifted so that a film about the murders could be released. A significant amount of criticism emanated from the communities in which the killings took place, and it's easy to see why. Not only would the film be a stark reminder of a very dark time in the community's history, but contemporary art also has a habit of trivialising tragedy. Marcus Harvey's portrait of Myra Hindley, for instance, which was composed of blue children's hand prints, is a prime example. Whilst it presents itself as a comment piece on the media's valorisation of murderers by turning Myra into a pop-art muse, the painting only further exploits a morbid fascination with murder for the sake of gaining a reaction.The film Snowtown, however, deals with its subject far more tentatively and director Justin Kurzel's gruelling commitment to naturalism allows the film to be respectfully authentic, yet incredibly horrifying at the same time.The film opens with single mum Elizabeth (Louise Harris) who lives with her three boys Alex (Marcus Howard), Nicholas (Matthew Howard) and Jamie (Lucas Pittaway). Leaving her children in the charge of her neighbour Jeffrey (Frank Cwiertniak), Elizabeth returns home one day to find he has been taking naked pictures of them. Inexplicably, the police do nothing about it and, other than receiving a sound beating from Elizabeth, Jeffrey goes on living across the street unpunished.Shortly after, a new man comes into Elizabeth's life; the smiley, bearded John Bunting (Daniel Henshall). Horrified at what happened to the boys, John encourages Jamie to take revenge against Jeffrey and together they terrorise him - pelting his house with ice cream and mutilated kangaroos - until he is forced to leave the neighbourhood. But whilst John seems only to be looking out for his new adopted family, his true intentions are far more sinister. Taking advantage of Jamie's increasing devotion to him, Bunting recruits the teenager into his crew of vigilante serial killers.Despite the vast amount of dramatic fodder the story offers - from Bunting's extensive torture practices to the bizarre father-son killing team he forms with Jamie - Shaun Grant's screenplay is incredibly withholding. Not only do we witness very few of the murders, but it's often difficult to understand what the hell is going on. The dialogue is unrelentingly realistic and not a single line is wasted for the sake of clarifying what is happening. To make matters worse, a fair bit of it is either inaudible or completely inconsequential to the plot.Furthermore, other than Henshall, the entire cast have never acted professionally before, and they were all chosen from around the area in which they filmed. As such, most of the performances are wooden, unrefined and austere. This dedication to naturalism is on one hand incredibly frustrating, yet on the other hand the film is also all the more convincing for it.The devotion to a more authentic reconstruction of events never threatens to sanitize the implicit horror of the story. Indeed, the heightened realism makes the killings we do witness all the more shocking, as the distinct lack of narrative progression means we are often thrust into a hellish scene without the slightest warning.Henshall's stunning portrayal of Bunting encapsulates the difficult balance this film maintains. He plays him as a likable 'man's man', who the audience, along with the family, are invited to fall in love with. There is no point in the film in which he suddenly transforms into 'the beast'. In fact, he remains largely the same throughout, and this is what makes him a believable psychopath.In much the same way, the film's impact lies in its ability to render the unthinkable thinkable, and to make us believe in the reality of these almost otherworldly events. In its refusal to sensationalise or sterilise the story of the 'Bodies in the Barrels,' Snowtown is an example of the 'true story' genre at its very best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film after hearing good recommendations for it, and I have struggled to give it a score of 2 to be honest. The only reason I have is because the acting was good and it's quite well made.I have quite a strong threshold for violent and unsettling films, as I think many are very powerful. (I'm not referring to all the 'torture porn' ones) This on the other hand, was just on a whole new level for me personally. I still have some scenes playing on my mind, and I guess some would say at least that shows the film is 'powerful' but I didn't view Snowtown in this way at all. I think they could have still kept it gritty without the inclusion of some of the content, which seemed to be very drawn out in places. For me personally I actually felt physically sick at a few points. (Not because it was too 'gory', just the whole tone and content of the film) it was just so hard to endure, and even though you can't expect an easy watch due to the subject matter as it is, I just think this is the most vile film I can remember seeing for a very long time. I don't think I have ever felt like that to this extent before, and I have seen many unsettling films.Certainly not a film I would be able to recommend to anyone, but there have been many positive reviews on Snowtown. I can understand people see things differently, that's why it's good to have a place where you can review films and someone will be able to make their own judgement, but I personally was so disturbed by Snowtown, and wish I had never seen it. I actually regret not turning it off, but I always like to try and see films to the end so I can base my opinion on the whole thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very tedious and confusing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film get good reviews and thought I would give it a go, like you do. I sat through it to the end even though nothing really seemed to happen and the events in the film were quite random and I did start hoping it would finish soon. I think the film-makers were assuming people would have prior knowledge of the events of the film before viewing it, as it seemed to veer from scene to scene quite randomly, i got the gist of what was happening but it was not really compulsive viewing. The story matter is based on real-life events and I found it to be grim viewing, with little reward or insight into the characters, and I felt the boy playing the lead was not very interesting to watch. I guess I expect to be entertained or gain some insight into something when I watch a film but in this case neither of these things happened. Quite dull all in all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing plot, but a well-made film with many strong points</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For casual viewers who don't know anything about the real case (look it up - very interesting/disturbing), this film is VERY hard to follow. The plot is quite disjointed and it would have benefited from probably a shorter duration and a more coherent flow for those who did not know much about the case. I found myself becoming disinterested in some of the long, drawn out scenes where I did not really understand what was happening. In retrospect, after researching the case, I will probably give the film a re-watch.Other than that the film was solidly acted and had some very impressive, raw cinematography - the film was full of very simple, banal elements like power lines, water towers, naked trees, isolated landscapes and low ceilings of clouds? and while the film is set amongst this industrial ugliness and poverty/malaise of the outer suburbs, there is a lyrical, dreamlike beauty about the way this harsh world is presented, often in saturated, dark low light reminiscent of David Lynch, the early Cohen Brothers work and the similarly themed "Boys Don't Cry" (1999), which would be worth checking out if you enjoyed this one.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an Australian film based on true events. A 16 year-old Jamie falls in with his mother's new boyfriend and his crowd of self-appointed neighborhood watch. They develop a relationship that leads to a spree of torture and murder.This is a highly disturbing movie. To say that they are white trash is to insult white trash. The rampant homophobia is shocking, but then it gets much much worst. I feel that I have to warn that it dives head first into pedophilia and serial torture murders.It is truly soul grindingly gruesome. It gets really tiring to one's being. I do like the atmosphere in the movie although it does drag at times. It is a tough watch, and good only for people who are willing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ever deepening layers with each viewing . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is somewhat difficult to review, or give a star rating to. That this is Justin Kurzel's first film is nothing short of phenomenal. Snowtown has the feel, pace, editing, and direction of a mature filmmaker and the performances from nearly every character (especially the two main characters John and Jamie) is mesmerizing. The film may also be the least compromising, most difficult film I've yet seen -- and it takes a lot to shock/affect me. This film isn't really a story about a serial killer -- if that is what you are/were expecting, you've already missed the point. That part of the story is incidental; it's the vehicle by which the director examines other ideas (I do understand that this concept is far too subtle and complex for Americans to grasp). There is very little actual violence on screen, but the little that is shown is the most brutal/honest depiction of not only the sheer terror of torture, but even more unsettling, the psychology (or lack there of) behind such acts and the unimaginable sensation/satisfaction John Bunting gets from torturing a human being. The fact that this film is based on true events only doubles or triples the impact. All of which I greatly applaud and would like to see far more of, rather than the tide of escapism that saturates most filmmaking. Many of us who love honest, uncompromising art are willing to sit through a horrific experience because the work will eventually give back to the viewer more than what it demanded emotionally and psychologically to initially experience -- Breaking The Waves or The War Zone are good examples. This film does exactly that. With some intelligence and participation from the viewer, this film reveals ever deepening layers with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Menacing, unforgettable and I cannot recommend.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film haunts me still. Gritty, realistic and with absolutely no gloss Snowtown makes Saw or Silence of the Lambs look like soap operas. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire movie. Snowtown depicts the events surrounding Australia's biggest trail of serial killings. I found the acting and portrayal of the story based on these true events a real glimpse into the dark and evil aspect of human nature. I found the characters engrossing, the main ring leader being at turns charismatic and quietly scary as hell. The fear surrounding the young lead being manipulated I found palpable and the rest of the characters portrayed extremely well by a cast that reminded of people I've met. Which is why it scared the hell out of me and left a very lasting impression. Snowtown also reveals how holes in society allowed this to happen. No punches are pulled and the violence is certainly not there as shock value but as a statement of plain fact. I wouldn't recommend any one watch this and that some (like my girlfriend) simply do not. It is an unpleasant business that for me impacted precisely the evil of what happened and how with extremely disturbing themes. Because of that it is an extremely well made very adult movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is unapologetic and extremely well made. There's only gonna be a handful of people who'll be able to actually stomach this kind of material, but if you're the type who appreciated "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", chances are you will appreciate this. I say appreciate because "like" is almost inappropriate unless you're some kind of sadist. A good film will make you feel things and this one may leave you feeling somewhat hollowed out if you can actually endure it. "Snow town" is the story of a serial killer killer who brainwashed a group of poverty stricken youths into joining him on a murderous crusade against homosexuals. It's a true story filmed in the actual town where the murders took place and uses real people with the exception of the lead actor. So real looking it's almost unbearable to watch. Fine acting and brilliant writing and directing. Just don't watch it if you can't handle heavy duty real life horror, this isn't Evil Dead or A Nightmare on Elm Street.</fullReview>

However, the subject matter is so gruesome, and because it's directed so well, and acted so well, there is a realism to it that makes it hard to watch.Every scene is well crafted, with masterful attention to even the most minute details. Because it is crafted so realistically, it almost seems like a documentary.It's like being a silent witness to the horrendous and on-going atrocities of a psychopath. Your disbelief is fully suspended, and in every scene, you want justice to somehow prevail. And when it doesn't, you feel personally responsible for the outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant but upsetting Australian drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer/director Justin Kerzel's first feature length film is a brilliant, harrowing ,and upsetting drama based on actual events surrounding a series of murders that took place in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, Australia in the late nineties. Sixteen-year-old Jamie (Lucas Pittaway) is surrounded by violence and abuse. When his mother brings her charismatic new boyfriend, John (Daniel Henshall) into the family home, he appears like a saviour, swiftly assuming control and 'taking care' of the bad issues directly affecting Jamie and his brothers. Even the most desensitised of viewers will find segments of this film almost unbearable. From the moment we meet John, we are ill at ease. It's fair to say that as the film progresses, so does this feeling. It's a huge performance from Daniel Henshall who plays his role with an astounding level of sustained, frightening intensity. There were moments when i could feel my heart beating faster, a sense of dread of what might be around the next corner, of what horror may lay in wait. It would be impossible to discuss the film without mentioning the performance of Lucas Pittaway. For a young actor making his screen debut, this is something truly special. It's through his character Jamie that the story is told, and Pittaway handles a tough, emotional role with astonishing poise. The film deals with terrible events in a way that never relishes in them, but aims to convey the devastating emotional impact. In fact, many of the more grisly events are implied rather than screened until one scene, an initiation of sorts for Jamie, which is so gut-wrenching in it's prolonged exposure, that it's barely watch-able. The end result is disturbing film full of brutality which will weigh heavily for a long time after viewing. This has truly been a great time for Australian cinema. With David Michod's mesmerising Animal Kingdom so fresh in the memory, and now Snowtown, it'll be interesting to see what comes next. 4/5</fullReview>

It is a deeply disturbing, mesmerizing and unforgettable (unfortunately) glimpse of an horrific underbelly of society. Revulsion, fascination, frustration and disbelief churn in an increasingly unsettled stomach as the activities go through their awful gears and by the end you, like Bunting's victims, are begin for it to be over. And you yearn for Jamie to turn back on his way to Snowtown but you've been brought despite yourself to abandon all hope.The cinematography is superb - bleak, grimy, huge yet claustrophobic.The performances are astonishing - Henshall's demonic and seductive sparkling rides a razor's edge of tension in every single moment he is on screen. Lucas Pittaway's tortured mind works it's way through his every look. And there are no weak links anywhere.Quite quite brilliant.I'd have given the film 10 but I still don't feel right...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to watch but great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Snowtown is an Australian film based on the true story of 'The Snowtown Murders', also known as the 'Bodies in Barrels' murders, where 11 people in South Australia were murdered between August 1992 and May 1999. The crimes were uncovered when the remains of eight victims were found in barrels of acid located in a rented former bank building in Snowtown on 20 May 1999.Living in the United Kingdom I was unfamiliar with the murders, but as a big fan of true stories I thought I would check this out. What I saw was a horrifying film and something which really shows how little some people value the human life.The film starts by introducing us to the lead character, a young boy named Jamie. He lives a dull and uneventful life, in which his distressed mother Elizabeth looks after him and his younger brothers, and he lacks a father figure. One day his mother's boyfriend takes indecent photographs of the boys - which we are shown from the top up but this scene is beyond creepy - and since the police are reluctant to intervene, Elizabeth is contacted by Barry, a gay man who introduces her to John. John despises paedophiles and homosexuals, so he helps Jamie's family out and deals with the boyfriend by continually harassing him until he is forced to leave the town, making him seem like a hero and therefore John assumes the role of Jamie's father figure.As the film develops and Jamie befriends John, he is slowly drawn into his homophobic and violent tendencies, and soon realises that he is within John's control, unable to escape because of his charismatic and intimidating dominance. This is when the focus of the film shifts, from a slow burning start where the boys are meeting a new father-like figure to the realisation that John is out of control and Jamie is taken along for the ride. Towards the end of the film things get a lot more brutal. Whilst some action is implied or happening off camera, we do see some pretty gruesome torture scenes and an awful rape scene.Whilst being hard to watch, Snowtown also made it nearly impossible to look away as I didn't want to miss anything. The houses, sets, clothing, TV's etc, it was perfect in it's authenticity and made me feel like I was back in the 90's. There was a real gritty look and feel to the experience, and like most true stories I'm sure some liberties were taken to fill in the gaps between the murders, Snowtown really was an impressive film and one I'm glad I managed to see. It's tricky to recommend this to everyone, but for those that like true stories and can overlook some occasional blood and gore this is well worth checking out.For more reviews please check out my blog http://headinavice.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the reviews failed to warn about this movie(may contain elements of a spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the main controversial 2011/2012 movies is "The girl with the dragon tattoo" it's controversy being that of the brutal rape of it's main character,though with that said, those still choosing to view the movie are aware of the potential scene. ...Snowtown on the other hand has no such warning or even mention in any of its synopsis. Snowtown is a brutal story set in an impoverished and bleak neighbourhood, that focus's on the victimization of the main character "Jamie" a 16 year old boy and his highly dysfunctional family consisting of 3 brothers and a single mother. The mother seems to be battling some form of substance addiction and is unawares that a trusted neighbour has been sexually exploiting and photographing Jamie and her 2 youngest children. This is when we are introduced to the neighbourhood watchmen, who inform Jamie's mother as to whats been happening to her boys.After a violent confrontation between Jamie's mother and the neighbour,the police are informed,but the man is soon released on bail with in weeks. The lead organizer behind the group of watchmen,John begins dating Jamie's mother,and his group and the boys band together to terrorized the paedophile out of the neighbourhood. Jamie is then re-victimized when his older brother needlessly and shockingly rapes him on the kitchen floor,after picking on him for his new friendship with "John" the leader of the "watchers". Thus marks a rapid decent into madness, as kindness is rapidly replaced with cruelty and John's true nature is shown. This degeneration of saviour to monster is set amidst pointless animal cruelty,blatant bigotry,prolonged torture,and the heartless murder of Jamie's only friend. This is a story that nightmarishly unfolds and has no happy ending for any of the characters involved... While the acting is entirely intense,the scenes believable,at the end of the movie you are left feeling raw,empty and revolted at what just unfolded on screen,the point almost some how having being lost in the horror of it all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was incredibly impressed by this film. Especially considering that it was the director's first film debut &amp; none of the actors were professionally trained. The film is dark &amp; grim, but considering what actually happened, it was an easy watch. Take this for example, "Frederick Brooks received electric shocks to his penis and testicles, and had a burning sparkler pushed down into his penis; after his toes were crushed and his nose and ears burned with cigarettes, he was allowed to choke to death on his gag." Although a little dark at times, it was filmed beautifully. I love Australian movies, and I am fascinating by serial killers, so all in all, I immensely enjoyed this. If you don't have a weak stomach, and you can patiently watch a story unfold then I recommend this to you.</fullReview>

The movie just passes along, and you don't care that much as it seems that scenes are randomly cut together, there is no real story to understand.The only scenes which get your attention are those where torture happens (2 times for me). But that's not enough to be a good movie, especially not in this case, as it's based on a true story where you want to know some backgrounds etc.If you are from Australia and the background of this movie is well known to you, you might give it a try.

		<fullReview>The film is clearly well made, the acting fantastic but I couldn't help feel that there was a bit too much filler. Some of the throbbing musically and cinematographic scenes were just a tad drawn out for my liking.Don't get me wrong it's not the be all end all, but the film would probably be a good 15 mins shorter without subtracting from the overall tension.That said, it is a success on many other different levels. Firstly, I think it's very restrained for a 2011 movie about serial killings and that's not a bad thing. It borrows from the classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre in regards to how it generally portrays the violence and suspense and I respect the director for going down this route about something so very sensitive and disturbing. It's incredibly sad as these things actually happened between the years of August 1992 ? May 1999 resulting in the murders of 11 people.Secondly, the shots are gorgeous and give you a proper feel as to how suburban areas in Australia actually felt and looked in the 90's and adds a subtle form of depth to it all. The third notable aspect is, as I have opened with, the acting itself. Both Lucas Pittaway and Daniel Henshall steal the show here and are clearly extremely good at what they do. Other reviewers have rightly picked up upon the almost fly on the wall style of filming here and this is only more of a testament as to how well made and acted this film is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nausea-inducing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Snowtown Murders" follows a downtrodden teenager, Jamie, in South Australia who lives with his struggling mother and three brothers. After his mother's boyfriend molests each of the boys, his mother's new boyfriend drives him out of the neighborhood?but it doesn't stop there, as he takes it upon himself to be the local watchman; or rather, killer. I actually found this film borderline nausea-inducing?not because it was gratuitously violent per se, but because the violence in the film was so human and chilling. There is really only one in-your-face murder that occurs on screen, but it was so disturbing that I had to look away from the screen. Part of the wallop this film packs is the underlying content and themes at play, and the emotional elements of the characters (particularly the protagonist) are fully charged here.This is an emotional journey as much as it is a straightforward crime film, and at times even a horror movie. It is also a bleak and depressing portrait of low-income South Australian suburbia, and is at times reminiscent of Harmony Korine's "Gummo," except with serial killers as the prime focus. The performances in the film are understated and outstanding, especially given that most are from inexperienced actors. I did find the conclusion leaving me wanting a bit more, as it does end on a rather abrupt note, but I suppose this all is consequence of it being based on real events.Overall, "The Snowtown Murders" is worth watching if you're emotionally up for it. It presents a bleak and disturbing sketch of poverty, sexual abuse, depression, as well as torture and murder. It's discomforting at times to sit through, and is legitimately upsetting in a lot of ways, and the impact it has on the viewer is akin to someone sneaking up on you and, just before you know it, plunging a knife in your back. It is not pleasant, but it is remarkably well-crafted. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quietly and gripping - very, very disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't go into the plot. But this film is a visual masterpiece. It very slowly and steadily goes from being a somber character study to being a very disturbing and gripping horror. The dialogue is fairly terse and to the point - the visual tells the story. You could watch it without the sound and be just as entertained. It might even be more effective. The tension begins immediately and you don't quite know why it's there, save for the title. But it never releases its grip, but it also doesn't really grow. That same, steady, unrelenting level of tension is there, all along, whether the scene depicts children playing around the dinner table, a pastor at a church addressing his flock, a rainy scene of a dilapidated back yard, or a grisly, realistic torture killing. Brilliant really. You feel uneasy when the film is calm, and when there's a sharp upturn in violence, you expect the music or the cinematography or a character to well up with emotion to match it, but it holds you steady, not allowing you to feel an overture, like it's holding your head making you watch. Very disquieting. One of the better indie films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly directed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A perspective on Australia's most notorious serial Killer, John Bunting (Daniel Henshall), as he was seen by Jamie Vlassakis (Lucas Pittaway), a sixteen-year-old accomplice in series of killings carried out by Bunting and others that came to be known as the Snowtown Murders. The victims were alleged pedophiles, homosexuals, cross-dressers, drug addicts and anyone else the killers determined to be "unclean". When Bunting enters the life of Vlassakis' mother and subsequently takes the young man under his wing, Jamie comes to embrace him as a father figure. The dark path Bunting leads him down is the heart and soul of what makes this story so compelling.The film is extremely well directed and the performances, particularly that of Daniel Henshall as John Bunting, are impeccable. I viewed the film once and had a hard time understanding what was going on in many respects, but after researching the Snowtown Murders and viewing it a second time the intentions of the filmmakers became apparent. What I found to be particularly interesting was how the story was told primarily from the point of view of the killers, and in a way that made it seem as if the filmmakers were almost sympathetic to the killers' perspective. Murder victims were first shown victimizing others, forcing the audience to choose between a feeling of satisfaction or disgust when seeing Bunting ultimately take their lives. This, I would say, is the true strength of this socially conscious film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true crime story is always intriguing but this beauty goes beyond. If that's your thing, like it is mine to watch all those documentaries on serial killers, this movie will melt you in your seat. The way the layout of this movie is conveyed it just makes you want more to happen you want to know more. The actors in this movie each suited the role they played and were all perfect. There isn't one thing about this movie I'd change, in fact I could sit here and watch Snowtown over and over because each time I watch it I pick up something new,It's a must see movie, I would recommend this to anyone especially if you liked Chopper (2000). This is portrayed in a very similar way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie sounded interested, so I decided to watch it. I heard it would be disturbing but I couldn't even expect the extent as to how disturbing it actually was. Many scenes were shocking, and for me, at least three scenes had me very freaked out and were difficult to sit through. The character John, brought out a lot of fear in me. He was certainly one of the must cruel movie characters I have seen. I don't know if I liked or disliked the movie. I thought that several parts of the story were quite confusing, and I wish I could find a full synopsis of all the details and relationships within the story. Besides that, the cinematography was great. Overall, the movie was very unsettling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge attention to detail and realism.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a South Australian myself growing up close to these kind of bleak areas in country SA in the 1990s, this film was very well made and meticulous with capturing the atmosphere and bleakness of underclass South Australia. Everything in the film such as; the low saturation and contrasting colours, the personalities and emphasis of poverty and boredom of the people who live in Northern Adelaide, and the depressing tenure of the ghetto like environment, these factors are absolutely dead straight. There were many places in regional Australia that actually feel and look like this today, especially in the South East like Millicent and Mt Gambier.The great thing with Australian movies such as this, there is absolutely no need to sugar coat anything to really draw your attention to the deep level of the realism of the film, everything is there and raw. And because of this way of filming, you really feel like that you're actually there witnessing these horrible acts of murder yourself in real life and it makes a much larger impact of horror to the audience than what most movies with similar subject matter I have seen. This really made my toes curl up it was so sickening what the Snowtown murderers actually did to these people who they manipulated to trust.It is amazing how sociopaths can really manipulate others. Goes to show that even the most vigilant of people can fall into their traps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly 'powerful' serial killer film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Australia's worst serial killer, "The Snowtown Murders" - aka. The Bodies in Barrels Murders - is the story of John Bunting, a vicious and highly manipulative psychopath who preyed upon and murdered 11 young men around a Southern Australian suburb throughout the 90s. Bunting ended up marrying the mother of a teenager whom he convinced to assist him and his sleazy crew in exterminating those he deemed as gay, pedophiles or junkies. Many of Bunting's victims were found mutilated, usually with signs of rectal torture, and stuffed into barrels inside of an unused bank he had rented.This film does a phenomenal job of portraying these events in a very dark and unsettling, yet highly character driven mien. All of the performances are tremendous and the desolate locale makes for a very bleak and tragic backdrop. The movie doesn't rely too heavily on all-out on screen violence, although the few scenes of torture and murder depicted are truly harsh and gritty, as well as it's rather brash depictions of pedophilia and incest. There's also some animal butchering on tap."The Snowtown Murders" definitely ranks high on my list of strongest serial killer biopics of all time. It's one of those films that will stick with you for a bit. Gotta say, though, it's not for everyone, but if you're cool with "rougher" types of cinema, "Snowtown" comes highly recommended.More Gorepump reviews at http://swinesewage.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrowing, distressing, incredibly powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SNOWTOWN is a true-life story about a serial killer and his associates who were prevalent in Australia during the 1990s. A low-key production that goes for gritty realism above everything else, the film this most reminded me of was HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER; it has the same level of harrowing and distressing subject matter while being incredibly powerful at the same time.SNOWTOWN isn't quite up there on a level with HENRY - there are a few too many scenes of people sitting around and eating for a start - but it is an undeniably effective movie. The casual brutality of the movie will make this hard to sit through for many viewers, with the scene involving the dog being particularly gruelling; meanwhile, the bathtub sequence is one of the nastiest I've ever witnessed. Aside from these moments, the rest of the movie is surprisingly restrained, a slice-of-life exploration of how 'white trash' get on with their lives.The acting is fine, particularly from Daniel Henshall in a star-making performance, and the script is very good. I wish there had been a little more resolution at the end but then you can't have everything. SNOWTOWN is about as far away as you can get from a mainstream Hollywood movie and it's all the more effective because of that. And I'll reiterate how incredibly grim it is: would I sit through it again? Not a chance!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping, gruesome, and disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far one of the most gruesome and disturbing films that I have ever seen, perhaps because the horrific events in this story actually happened. Based on the case of John Bunting, Australia's most notorious and prolific serial killer, "The Snowtown Murders" contains scenes that literally caused me to shield my eyes and scream in fright. I'm not sure what standards to apply to a film like this in evaluating whether it's "good" or not?but it is undeniably effective at conveying the inhuman brutality and base sadism behind these murders. The performances (especially those of Daniel Henshall as Bunting and Lucas Pittaway as his psychological victim/accomplice) are masterfully creepy, and the story WILL haunt you. A tip for most American viewers?the cast's Australian accents are quite thick, so I recommend viewing this one with the subtitles turned on for greater comprehension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely not a no show, Snowtown does Adelaide proud</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When hearing of this film being cast, I had no idea, this film would be this good, or so well received, at it's premiere's. As from all the hearsay, over it's sickening scenes, which had people walking out, turning away, or their stomachs churning, I found it an enigma. That one notorious torture bath scene for me, wasn't anything really disturbing, especially if compared to Wolf Creek. Let's face it, it could of been much more gory, which the film wisely held back on, with respect to the families of the victims, these gang of paedophile and gay haters killed, led of course by the notorious John Bunting. He's played with unforgettable menace by Daniel Henshall, in a a tour de force performance, one with a face that will stay with you for many years to come. All the other performers, mostly untrained actors, bring amazingly real performances. A great move. The film wouldn't have the same impactfull effect, if professionals were used, where everyone should be commended. Two nude scenes, one involving The Vsaislakas's kids being filmed nude by their Mom's current lover/paedophile, the other involving Bunting being entertained by a bare corpulent dancer (gees this guy really is sick) really disgusted me, although the real disgust was in the hideous crimes. Actually the CI reenacted documentary is more graphic. You actually see the top inside of the open barrels. But a shockingly true story like this grabs you, and you really learn about these monsters. The handling and flow of the story is great in a 120 minute well told masterpiece. The haunting ending of that vault door closing, in that notorious bank, before factual truths of the killer's arrests read across the screen, impactfully works. Snowtown is beautifully filmed and edited too. It uses more grainy picture that works favorably from it's first long dolly shot of fields and farms, as we head north along Port Augusta road, to it's haunting night shots in the house's yards and on the empty streets of the infamous town, which I've visited once or twice, in the last couple of years. Notable performances are that of Louise Harris at Vsaislakas's Mum, and the two paedophile filled roles. The dead on portrayal of Barry Lane, creeped me out, while the actor, Heath Ledger lookalike doesn't emit the same kinetic energy, as the oldest and easily led son, James Vsaislakas, the real one who copped it. He's still quite good in a great film that warrants viewing by all, well probably not everyone. Though nothing holds a candle to Henshall's amazingly real portrayal-what naturalistic actors are made of. Snowtown makes good use of location too, revisiting the areas of the killers. We are even shown the Centrelink, angle which led to the killers, pilfering the funds off the victims, where in the small lounge, outside the office, James is befriended by a kid, with a pet python. For director Kurzel, Snowtown is a top rate, feature, his baby, and one of course that is not gonna be loved or favored by everyone, in what is S.A's most sadistic serial killer case that will live on and haunt the memory for many years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Snowtown Murders</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe this isn't the right kind of movie to watch in my present frame of mind (I am a little depressed now). But well I watched this one.Somebody mentioned in the boards that this movie reminded them of the movies of Bruno dumont. Now I haven't watched any movies of that guy but I heard that there are scenes where pretty much nothing happens and the pace is extremely slow. I can't say the same thing about Snowtown. There are a lot of incidents, some really violent scenes (but not as violent as I thought) and the movie does not have as many long boring scenes at all.My problem was something different. The names. Yeah I know that sounds stupid. But there are too many characters and I just couldn't remember their names. Occasionally some guy would just wander into the movie and suddenly in the next scene he would be dead. Or he would just disappear. I couldn't keep track of who is Barry, Gavin, Pedo guy, whatever. Many of them even looked the same. Especially the young guys. I only remember the John character. Hell, I didn't even remember the main character's name. I had to read the wikipedia plot and only then I found out the characters names. When the names became clear, the plot falls into place. So maybe I should pay more attention to the names while watching this one.The performances are quite intense. The main guy especially. I just waiting for him to snap or something but that never happened. The John character was intense as well, scary at times. He could switch easily from being cheerful to being a cold blooded murderer.The whole atmosphere was dirty and grimy but I thought, for a bunch of blue collar guys, these guys had some pretty good lives. They lived in proper houses with TVs and so on. That's pretty cool. Even then their lives are a bit screwed I guess.I loved the music. The whole ambient music stuff really works for this one.The movie overall is OK, but for all the hype, I thought it would be a lot more disturbing. It wasn't that much but the theme is pretty disturbing. The performances are good, the atmosphere is good but somehow I just thought something was missing which prevents it from being a top grade one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The devil went down to...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the Australian case of 'the Snowtown murders' (1992-1999), this film stays mostly true to the facts (the relationship between Barry and Robert was cut out), be it that the viewer witnesses the story through the eyes of James Vlassakis. He becomes more and more involved in the torture, murders and disposing of the bodies.'Snowtown' is a slow-paced, eerie drama that mostly implies the (physical) horrors, except for the torture and murder of Jamie's half-brother Troy Youde, after an hour and ten minutes and a few shorter parts (the abuse of the boys, the cutting up of a Kangaroo, the rape of Jamie). The rest of it slowly and (in a way) subtly unfolds from the moment when James and his little brothers are abused by a trusted neighbor, and shortly after, a new 'gang' moves in, wanting to take 'justice' into their own hands. Their leader, John Bunting, is a charismatic psychopath who himself was assaulted at the age of eight, though the latter is never literally mentioned in the film.This tale never escapes the stranglehold of fear and misery (even without the murders and torture Snowtown looks like a miserable place) and there is a constant sadness surrounding Jamie, a sadness that is mainly apathetic, except for when he - somewhat 'heroical' - kills Troy in order to end the torture; I don't know how correct this is, since it is known he helped with the torture and murders of three more. I find it a weak point of the film not to adequately shed light on this.Other than that, if you can stomach it, this is a well-made drama of the bleakest sort. The acting was completely satisfactory and finally, I must mention an effective, mostly melancholically droning, soundtrack.A big 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I disagree with the comments about watching a documentary first. I went into the film knowing virtually nothing and didn't find it too hard to follow. For me the film is not about trying to understand all the details of the murders, but about life growing up in housing commission suburbs of Australia and the influence that environment has on people, eg drugs, rape, violence, broken families, and the influence one person can have on a bunch of people that are trying to fit in to society. This film is probably one of the most disturbing films I have seen not because of violence or gore but because of how real and accurate it is in regards to life growing up in these areas, and how the influence of one crazy person can drag quite a few other people into doing crazy things.I give it 8/10 for how raw and real the film is. You feel at times you are there and want to escape, but the hope that some how Jamie might be saved from this horror keeps you watching till the end. Watching the documentary first would have killed the movie in that regard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in South Australia in the 90s, Jamie and his half brothers live with their mother Elizabeth. Jamie is being molested by his half brother and a neighbour. They are friends with John Bunting, a guy who doesn't like fat people, druggies or gay people, and he doesn't care if you know it. Jamie is easily lead and John takes him under his wing. Jamie soon realises that John is not a nice guy, he comes across nice when his mum and others are around, but shows his true colours when he's with Jamie. Slowly but surely Jamie's friends and family start disappearing, and then Jamie is put in a situation he can't get out of. But is he as innocent as he thinks....Yes it's a true story, and yes the fact was shocking, but tide the film maker really have to make it as depressing and as morbid as this?It's well acted and the cast are incredible, and the story is fascinating. Some of the shots from the crew are sumptuous and really deep, but I couldn't enjoy any of this, because its just too hard hitting.When you are interested in a movie, but want to turn it off, in fear of ruining the rest of your evening, something isn't quite right.Good, but I'll never watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is a testament to the overall craft of Snowtown that it's most extreme scenes which lesser films would gain notoriety from do not overshadow the rest of the film. the torture scene which seems to be there to test the viewer as to how long they can endure it is shocking, make no mistake. and it is as brutal and shocking as anything i have seen. a serial killer inveigles himself into a run down and bleak community, becoming their moral arbiter and insinuates himself into one family in particular. thence forth he uses every opportunity to manipulate those around him into expediting the most hideous crimes, murders channelling his psychopathic hatred of most everyone but in particular, paedophiles, homosexuals, even people who's only crime is to be overweight.i had no idea whilst watching it that this is based on truth. but, again, this is no mere horror film or 'torture porn'. this is a portrait of the dispossessed, the impoverished, the spiritually vacant living in some rubbish strewn outer ring of suburbia. in the early scenes it seem that most of the adult activity is taken up with smoking and staring into space. an environment conducive to the nourishing of evil souls such as john bunting. the actor who plays Bunting is simply astonishing.( all the actors are nothing less that totally excellent), in THAT scene, when he is looking into the face of the boy he is torturing, to see if he is near his last breath, i was magnetised particularly to the killers gaze. in the same breadth i was close to switching it off. one hopes for the suffering to stop, but in this world, redemption never comes. it will haunt me for a long time. i have no wish to see it again. but, make no mistake, this is a masterwork. and deserves your full attention. if only for one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stark, Cold, and Bleak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Snowtown Murders," is an Australian film based on a true story. Jamie ( Lucas Pittaway) is a young man growing up in a severely depressed neighborhood filled with the ills of society. Jamie himself lives a depressing life that includes sexual abuse and is almost completely hopeless, and without any direction. His mothers new boyfriend, John (Daniel Henshall), comes into the picture and quickly seems to be a stabilizing force in the family, and Jamie falls in line and starts spending more time with him and his group of friends. John and his friends start putting together a neighborhood watch which quickly devolves into sadistic torture and murder, and shows the true nature of the cold, bigoted, and evil man that John really is. Jamie is left in conflict with himself and John, and caught in a cycle of abuse that may leave him even more helpless, depressed, or even dead.The Good: This movie is powerful as a very cold honest portrayal of hopelessness and despair. It confronts a few very tough topics that the viewer must confront as well while watching. There is no Hi-Def, big budget, beautiful visuals to confuse anyone into thinking this is going to be a feel good story, and in that respect, it sets a mood and tone that can't be denied.The two main actors, Lucas Pittaway and Daniel Henshall, do an excellent job in bringing their characters to life. Pittaway was pretty amazing and realistic as the tortured Jamie, and is completely convincing in a role that is very tough to bring to life. Maybe if Pittaway drops the "away" from his name he could make some good Hollywood films. Being based on a true story is also a chilling aspect that should make people take notice.The Bad: Although Pittaway and Henshall were stand outs, the rest of the cast was a little weak. The mother who is painted in the beginning, most of the rest of the film just seems to fade away, and as anyone knows, a mother is always a central figure in a family. Also at times the scenes of the "watch" sitting around the table conducting "investigations" become boring and monotonous. Although I believe the director was going for this as a artistic rendering of the callousness of some of the decisions being made, it still comes off as rather boring drudgery that could turn viewers off without appreciating the harsh realities of the film.Lastly, the camera work and overall cinematography was a little too standard for a film I am assuming had a very small budget. Although good and clear, and I am not a big "art film" fan, if you are going to make a film like this, you have to bring a few more creative efforts to break up the small budget and make a movie shine.All in all it's a 7 for me. The 2 leads were strong, the story was strong, and the portrayed stark, bleak reality makes it a strong movie overall. A lack of real good supporting characters, and a lot of boring drudgery for the viewer to suffer through combined with cinematography that was just a little too standard and vanilla, hold it back from becoming outstanding.Like my review?

		<fullReview>Snowtown occupies the space at the underbelly of society, where the forgotten and destitute merge with mental illness and marginalised families, in a notoriously violent and broken suburb of Adelaide in Australia. It's within this demoralised, dehumanising community that provides the backdrop for a real life tragedy involving Australia's most notorious serial killer, John Bunting. Bunting (Daniel Henshall) arrives unannounced to the breakfast table of Jamie Vlassakis (Lucas Pittaway), a quiet, doomed-looking sixteen year old, and his charismatic charm, and obvious domination are illuminated as he prepares a fry-up for the fatherless family, presuming the mantle over the four Vlassakis boys.Bunting begins a torrent of child-like abuse towards Elizabeth Vlassakis's (Louise Harris) ex-boyfriend and neighbour, who had photographed the boys naked in the opening scenes. The presumption is that he had raped the boys, but this is never explicitly revealed. Bunting's torments include chopping up a kangaroo and throwing the remains at the house of the accused paedophile, but it the way in which he "recruits" the young Jamie into these almost adolescent revenge activities, and eventually chase the man from town. Snowtown focuses it's attentions on the relationship between the dominating character of Bunting, who has assumed the role of father figure, and Jamie, who rarely says anything, and seems so beyond the fringe, that when he is sexually abused by his step-brother, he seems to simply accept it as part of life.Snowtown is also a comment on the nature, and dysfunction of community gossip. Bunting holds neighbourhood watch-like meetings, where speculation of paedophiles and homosexuals, and their alleged abhorrent activities. It becomes increasingly apparent that Bunting uses this community heresay to select his victims, but also as a way to gauge insights into the depravity of the community. He begins to derive a sadistic pleasure by twisting the concerned people to tell the group what they would do to these people if they had them. Inevitably these "confessions" provoke violent tendencies within the group. Bunting is a true manipulator of people.First time feature director Justin Kurzel used only two professional actors (Pittaway and Henshall), and the rest were made up of non-actors from the community that this event actually occurred. He films in the same community, which lends the film a totality of authenticity. The real events, known as either 'The Snowtown Murders' or "The Bodies-in- the-Barrel Murders' - due to the way in which the bodies were disposed of, - were perpetrated between 1992 and 1999, and Kurzel has managed to reject any of the usual trappings of the true crime film, lending it a grim realism. The spaces are empty, dull, and without character. Aside from the haunting charm of Bunting, the characters are devoid of humanity, broken to the point of catatonia. Because of these long, laconic scenes make the moments of violence all the more shocking.With two incredible central performances, particularly from Henshall, whose Bunting balances the polar oppositions in his psychology, Snowtown is a tough film, which does not flinch from gruesome reality, facing death and torture, not in the sensational ways that the torture-porn films often revel in. This is Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986) through the lens of Ken Loach. In other words Snowtown is fundamentally more real than Henry... Uncomfortably rewarding, this is devastatingly powerful film making, and it will stay with you, and haunt you, but will also leave you with a layer of grime over you, that you will need to wash off.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Poignantly eerie and graphic retelling..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Australian screenwriter and director Justin Kurzel's feature film debut which was written by screenwriter Shaun Grant after a story by Justin Kurzel and Shaun Grant, was inspired by Australian author and journalist Debi Marshall's book "Killing For Pleasure: the definitive story of the Snowtown serial killings" (2006) and Australian author and journalist Andrew McGarry's book "The Snowtown Murders: The Real Story Behind The Bodies-in-the-Barrels Killings" (2005). It was produced by Anna Mcleish and Sarah Shaw and is an Australian production which premiered at the Adelaide Film Festival in 2011. It tells the story about 16-year-old Jamie Vlassakis who lives in a suburb North of Adelaide in South Australia in a tract home during the early 1990s with his mother Elizabeth Harvey who is struggling to take care of him and his brothers. After discovering that her boyfriend Jeffrey has been taking violating photographs of her sons, Elizabeth reports him to police. The following day, Elizabeth learns that Jeffrey has been released and contacts her gay friend Barry who later shows up at her place with his friend John. John makes quite an impression on Elizabeth and her sons with his domineering presence, expresses his resentment regarding what has happened to Elizabeth's sons and takes an immediate liking to Jaimie. By giving Jaime and his brothers the chance to get revenge on Jeffrey by harassing him in various ways, he wins their affection and takes on the role as their father figure. Everyone feels safer now that John has come into their lives, but as Jaimie grows closer to John who acts as if he was his guardian angel, he is lured into an evil man's world. Acutely and precisely directed by first-time filmmaker Justin Kurzel, this poignantly eerie and graphic retelling of the eleven murders, instigated and mostly perpetrated by one of Australia's worst serial killers John Bunting, which took place between August 1992 and May 1999 in the country town of Snowtown near Adelaide, the capital of South Australia. With a social realist approach and while notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, the fine editing by film editor Veronika Jenet, cinematography by cinematographer Adam Arkapaw and the brilliant use of sound, this gritty and visceral psychological thriller, somewhat reminiscent of David Micôd's "Animal Kingdom" (2010), draws a harrowing portrayal of a mother's heartbreaking battle to support and protect her children and a rare father-son relationship. This character-driven independent film about an afflicted family who sees a sign of hope when they meet a seemingly charming, considerate and affectionate man who walks into their home and takes command, depicts an internal study of character and is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure and the unflinching acting performance by Australian actor Daniel Henshall and the heartrending acting performances by Lucas Pittaway in his first feature film role and Louise Harris in her first feature film role. A reverent directorial debut which gained the Audience Award at the Adelaide Film Festival in 2011, the AACTA Award for Best Direction Justin Kurzel, Best Adapted Screenplay Shaun Grant, Best Lead Actor Daniel Henshall, Best Supporting Actress Louise Harris, Best Editing Veronika Jenet and Best Sound at the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards in 2011 and a Special Mention from the Jury President at the 64th Cannes International Film Festival in 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this movie. there are no words. i'm still shaking. daniel henshall is phenomenal. so phenomenal, it alludes me why he wasn't nominated for any sort of award for his portrayal of john bunting in this film. he was perfect - terrifying but charismatic, and almost likable at times.an 8 out of 10 because as brilliantly acted and directed as the film was, it was still a bit slow moving for my taste. this, coupled with the crazy timeline of events, and what little background the film provides, meant it was even the more difficult to understand what was happening. before sitting down with this film, i urge you to watch a 44-minute youtube video called "serial killers: bodies in the barrels". it will help immensely to understand the story and who bunting was. highly recommended for a realistic look at a grisly time period in Australia's recent history. a different kind of horror movie. almost documentary-like. a sadistic piece of art imitating life. a relentless roller coaster of an experience that you won't soon forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic and disturbing debut for Mr. Kruzel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Snowtown Murders" chronicles a series of events that led to the arrest of John Bunting, Australia's most notorious serial killer. Between August 1992 and May 1999, Bunting killed 11 people in South Australia. However, Bunting, as it became clear later on, did not act alone. Kruzel's remarkable feature debut takes a visceral, grisly look at the true story of what the media dubbed, "the bodies in the barrels" murders. What the movie reveals and renders is truly horrifying and simply impossible to forget. The film follows Elizabeth Harvey (Louise Harris), a mother raising her three boys in Adelaide's northern suburbs. After her latest boyfriend displays some pedophile tendencies, she takes up with a new man, hoping for a better sense of security. John Bunting (Daniel Henshall) appears at the kitchen table one morning, and seemingly assigns himself the role of father in the family. However, John's friendly demeanor hides a coldness that is unfathomable. It slowly reveals itself at impromptu "neighborhood watch" meetings at the dinner table, where John holds court with concerned neighbors outing other supposed molesters, perverts, and undesirables in the town. John enlists his crew in acts of sadistic vigilantism on those he considers deviants, and in the process, takes Elizabeth's son Jamie (Lucas Pittaway), under his wing. Abused and neglected for so long, Jamie can't help but be swayed by anything resembling a father figure, and John's overtures of trying to "toughen up" the boy are a transparent ruse to mold him into an accomplice and disciple."The Snowtown Murders" is a raw and uncompromising film, which focuses on the relationship between John and Jamie which is truly the centerpiece of the movie. Henshall and Pittaway deserve an enormous amount of credit, and their transformations are chillingly convincing. Henshall is alarmingly fantastic as John Bunting, but it's Pittaway's portrayal of Vlassakis that is so outstanding. With Kurzel's direction, Adam Arkapaw's voyeuristic cinematography, and a cast of almost entirely nonprofessional actors allows the film to convey a devastating and convincing reality.The film generates most of its tension from the uneasiness from its placement of viewpoint, and in terms of violence, what to show, and what to cut away from. "The Snowtown Murders" is distressing and highly disturbing, one of the more difficult films to watch about psychopaths. There are very difficult scenes to sit through. There is no way to understand John Bunting. He is quite simply evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Captures realism at a whole new level; this is one tough and brutal film to watch. The most natural performances I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one hell of a brutal film to sit through. Realistic to the point that you feel like vomiting with the tension, "Snowtown" is one fine film in the regard that it is very authentic and the acting is phenomenal. Justin Kurzel's directorial debut couldn't have been any better, and of course, he could not have picked a more controversial or tough story to portray. The notorious 'Bodies in Barrels murders' which took place between 1992 and 1999 in a poverty-stricken suburb of Adelaide, Australia sickened the world and no doubt left a horrendous scar on the community of Snowtown where the murders took place. John Bunting was the ring leader of a 'degenerate sub-culture' of vigilantes who targeted paedophiles and eventually homosexuals in their community. The men involved - about four of them, however John Bunting and Robert Wagner were the prominent executors - tortured and murdered men and women they 'suspected' of being paedophiles or aiding them or whatever. They contained the bodies in barrels in an abandoned warehouse, which is why it took the police years to catch them. They were sadistic, no doubt about it, however, the morals behind it is questionable. Did they really believe in what they were doing? Or was it just a front to vent their sadistic and violent impulses? Either way, they are both currently serving life sentences without parole and don't look like they'll ever be released. "Snowtown" is the first film to tackle this horrendous yet fascinating tale of murder and madness, and it serves as an undisputed and relentless look at how easily someone can take matters into their own hands in areas where the authorities have failed them. For the murders in Snowtown could happen anywhere, anytime.Teenager Jamie (Lucas Pittaway) lives in poverty and isolation in the suburbs of Adelaide with his single mother and three brothers. His mother's new boyfriend sexually abuses Jamie and his two younger siblings while his mother is out, but she eventually discovers this and is introduced to John Bunting (Daniel Henshall) and Robert Wagner (Aaron Viergever) who preach to the neighbours about how paedophiles are molesting kids everyday of the week and nothing is being done about it. John adopts a father role amongst the boys, particularly Jamie, who develops a strong bond with him, and eventually, gets dragged into the violent and dangerous world of Bunting and Wagner as their vigilante-ideals develop into a sporadic spree of torture and murder.As the old saying goes, you do not enjoy this film, you experience it. That certainly is the case with "Snowtown". It is not a film to be enjoyed or to be entertained by. On the contrary, it will sicken and disturb you. It is relentless in its raw emotional power, it is violent and it is fearless and full-on. Kurzel is an amazing director and looks promising; this is a superb debut. The best aspect of this film is without a doubt the absolutely phenomenal performances; honestly, Oscar-winning performances have nothing on these guys because of one vital reason; they are naturals. These guys are not big-time actors, but what they do have is style and a compelling raw nature. The characters sit around chatting, smoking and eating. Even when they do not say anything, we can see the emotions on their faces, we see their faded tattoos, the wrinkles on their faces, the scars... their overall detachment from any emotional reality. That is the most frightening aspect of this film. Lucas Pittaway is superb, however, it doesn't look as though he will pursue a further career in acting. Nevertheless, his performance is on a calibre which many long-term actors will never achieve. His mother, played by Louise Harris, is just as good. She is the only character who has any kind of emotion; she loves her boys, and throughout the course of the film, it takes a toll on her the most. Then we have Daniel Henshall and Aaron Viergever - words cannot possibly describe their amazing performances. It's unbelievable how these actors only have this film to their credits all through their careers; they are naturals. It's all in their eyes and their facial expressions; no acting class can possibly teach you this folks, the looks, the moves... these two men are just natural and the effect is uncompromising and fantastic. The pounding score by Jed Kurzel drives the film along and raises the hairs on your neck during the scenes where we view the poverty and desolation of these streets and when the characters are just sitting about, staring at the walls or the TV. In every scene, someone is either smoking or drinking. They smoke with an intensity which makes you wonder if they truly believe that the world could end any moment and they need to get as much nicotine as possible into their hard and battered bodies.I would not recommend "Snowtown" too easily to anyone, however, I do believe it is a must-see for any students who are hoping to be filmmakers. This is priceless in terms of characters and directing techniques. Kurzel may have just pioneered something here; this is realism at a whole new level...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty Confronting Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me say that this movie is absolutely not for everyone. If you are the kind of person who uses cinema as a means of escape, likes movies that are feel good and fun, a person who only enjoys big budget movies with explosions, clearly defined goodies and baddies and a hero who triumphs, this movie is definitely not for you. If you are someone who likes everything spelled out for you, doesn't like to have to think for themselves, doesn't like movies that seek to make you understand the confusion, isolation and emotions of the characters, then this movie's not for you either.This is cinema that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. This is cinema without any gloss or polish or sparkle. It is an amazing portrayal of some of the most inhuman people that have ever lived and the vile acts they committed. While the filmmakers use some particularly vicious, brutal and shocking scenes in some places, the majority of the violence that takes place happens off screen and is merely insinuated. There is no one to cheer for, only characters to try and understand and in some cases attempt to have empathy for.Snowtown shows us a world few of us will ever see, but one that does indeed, sadly exist. For those reviewers who claim the reactions and behaviors of the characters are unrealistic I challenge your notion of realism for these are circumstances that could only be judged from within them, none of us knows what the normal human reaction would be in these circumstances as the majority of us will never have to endure them.Keep an open mind, be prepared to be disgusted and horrified, understand that this film doesn't seek to provide all the answers and maybe you will be able to come as close to "enjoying" this film as is possible for a movie with such unenjoyable themes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another unedited/unfinished review. This one from 9/27/2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Snowtown" is a shocking true-life tale of murder and manipulation that doesn't follow the linear paths of normal serial killer films.Jamie lives with his Mother, older brother, and his two younger brothers. Life appears meaningless, stagnant, damaging, and as the film develops early on, it seems like it's only going to get worse before it gets any better. That is until John enters the scene and takes a firm hold of Jamie, introducing him to the real rights and wrongs of life as he knows it.Finding out that this film was true was surprising to me, and then adding in the fact that the character John was Australia's # 1 serial killer really threw me for a loop. The majority of serial killer films that I know don't normally humanize their serial killers. Usually, you're just told this guy's evil and then you watch him do evil things. It's not like that here, as we're shown a man who shows compassion and care for family, but then that's intertwined with a man who's so utterly die-hard in his beliefs and ways, that you're confused about who this man really is. He seems to want to help, but he's doing so in the absolute worst way - which seems to be the only way he knows.Now knowing that John became one of Australia's most infamous serial killers delivers a surprise to the viewer, and it also gave the filmmakers the opportunity to utilize the character of Jamie to be the centerpiece and emotional backbone of the film. Witnessing John act as father, friend and mentor to Jamie created an ambiguous relationship between the two that had you constantly on guard for Jamie's well-being. Not showcasing hideous murders or spotlighting John as the main character was risky, but it seemed to pay off well. Unless, of course, you're fully aware of the story of "Snowtown," then you may be hoping for something more vivid ? which was probably not the right thing to do, for the sake of the victim's loved ones.Besides the different directions the film went, I was also impressed by the acting of the entire cast. First-time actor Lucas Pittaway delivered a believable and tragic portrayal of a meager-minded individual, whereas Daniel Henshall, who played John, gave us an imperious, conniving, and highly talented acting performance. Highlighting the actors was the film's creative camera-work; at times moving in gritty hand-held fashion, instinctively capturing the troubling atmosphere, and at others, brightening the story by showcasing the Australian landscape, an effective decision that acted like the yang to the desolate ying.</fullReview>

This comes across but actually added to the film's gritty authenticity. It's quite harrowing in it's content. Sometimes the characters are not very well explained or introduced and this can lead to some confusion.I found it difficult at times trying to figure out where various characters fitted in to the plot But on the whole a movie which packs a punch. Some scenes will linger in the mind long after you've watched this movie. The summation at the end giving an update as to where the main protagonists are now is a sobering jolt to the realization. this actually happened! Not for the faint hearted!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got the name of this film from a list of 'extreme' horror films and was curious.Dear god, it was slow and dull. The 'characters' were indistinguishable - right from the start I was often unsure who was who (something brought up by other viewers)-I actually thought they may be playing scenes 'out of sequence' and it would settle down to an actual narrative - no.It's unclear who has any relation to who - almost like CCTV footage you are supposed to interpret. Was a boy in the original family being raped by his older brother? This comes up quite early in the film but I found it impossible to tell what was going on? There is originally a family with a trailer trash mother of many boys(no fathers around. Was that a point)?? All the people look similar, no-one appears long enough to establish a character (the mother of the boys??) She is in it throughout the film but her involvement is offscreen?.This is one of the most needlessly unfathomable movies I've ever seen: 6+ on IMDb?! I know it's based on a real case, but really? OH, and there is nothing even faintly controversial for any gore hounds if that's what you are after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and rewarding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Snowtown is fantastic, well shot, intricately told and it is haunting and drawn out to the point you actually want it to end but reflect deeply upon once it is over. The manipulation of Vlassakis by Bunting is expertly portrayed with fantastic scenes like Bunting attacking Vlassakis but immediately comforting the vulnerable teen afterwards telling him he needs him. The pacing is slow, very slow but it really suits the setting and the content. Henshall does a really great job as Bunting, the way he eats and stares is truly haunting, he makes the viewer feel incredibly apprehensive upon entering any scene with him involved. The violence is expertly limited to one horrible scene, the rest hinted at through chilling phone conversations. The only criticism I have is perhaps that some of the facial expressions and silent interactions between characters is a little, and i mean a little, over used but all actors are fantastically cast, any research into the real victims and killers will reveal that they are very similar to the real ones too. I can guarantee I will never watch this film again but only because of how uneasy it makes me feel not because of it's quality. I will recommend it to a lot of people however and I trust they will not desire a second watch for the same reason. Given the films content this repulsion but intrigue I feel for it is the mark of a successful film. Chopper, Animal Kingdom, Samson &amp; Delilah and now Snowtown are becoming some of the top Aussie films recently and perhaps all time. In fact this film has invigorated a desire to watch more Australian cinema. Hopefully films like this will help bring our virtually non-existent film industry out to bloom, oddly though Aussie films tend to depict what wilts inside of us, not what blooms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set against the sun-starved suburbs of northern Adelaide, Snowtown is an unflinching look at the sordid underbelly of Australian life and crime that rejects common sentiment despite delving into a much chartered niche in Australian cinema: the gritty, crime fuelled drama with something to say.First time writer/director Justin Kurzel's bleak, brutal and bloody nasty rendition of the notorious Adelaide killings is certainly a step up in class from last year's overrated Animal Kingdom and although his work fails to rank amidst seminal Aussie films like Romper Stomper and Chopper, Snowtown is a harrowing, hand-held drama of considerable patience, poise and impact that deserves attention.Shot on a shoestring budget and based on true events, the film follows 16 year-old Jamie (Lucas Pittaway), a troubled teen who becomes involved with his mum's "welcoming" new lover John Bunting (Daniel Henshall): the hateful head of a self-governing, self-righteous group of neighbourhood watchmen who would go on to commit a string of heinous murders that would shake Australia to its very core.The similarities to Animal Kingdom, then, are obvious; a mislead, partially moral teen gets caught in a morose web of communal crime and killings. Snowtown has a look, sound, setting and feel akin to its crime-based predecessor yet somehow emerges a far more chilling, absorbing text.The restrained and multi-layered performance of Lucas Pittaway brings to mind the work and aura of a young Heath Ledger and despite Daniel Henshall's forbidding and intense portrayal of the bearded Bunting, it's Pittaway's turn that steals the show in this grim and fearless affair of the tense and the intense; of hate crime, malevolence and a descent into evil and all out madness.First degree murder, drug use and poverty aside, a host of challenging themes are also thrust to the fore and shot with unflinching clarity and realism. Paedophilia, rape, sodomy, animal cruelty and sadism all fall under the microscope. One particular scene featuring a stop/start strangulation of a local victim is nigh on impossible to watch. Its also worth noting that a great deal of the facts and details regarding the actual events were omitted from Justin Kurzel's script as they were deemed too distasteful by the Australian Film Council.Snowtown is a slow-boiling and ultimately shocking experience that'll unnerve even the most robust of film fans. It is an unforgiving film. As bold, real and as harsh as they come. It's not for the feint of heart. Do not expect to be entertained or even excited by this one. That's not its intention. That's not its purpose. This claustrophobic docudrama merely casts a callous eye over an irrefutably dark period in Australia's history that follows the likes of Animal Kingdom and the stirring Martha Marcy May Marlene in its sombre depiction of a young and mislead soul in torment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After all the critical praise I read about this movie, before going in to watch, I did expect more than I got. So maybe I was a little bit preconceived and my expectations should have been lower. The actors did meet them mostly. This is a great piece to stretch your acting muscles over with.Unfortunately the story evolves at a speed that would make a snail shake his head. It's a shame really because the themes that are being played out here, are really good. There is much to discover (if you stick with the movie that is) and it can get very disturbing. But the pace just isn't right (that's my feeling of course, you might want to check in for yourself and get a clearer picture of things).

		<shortDescription>The Town Synonymous with Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between 1992 and 1999, seven people were either directly responsible for or complicit in a South Australian torture and murder spree. Eleven people were confirmed victims, while a twelfth was dropped from the case due to lack of evidence. Eight of the bodies were stored in six acid-filled barrels, which were moved by the perpetrators to various locations before finally being stored in a disused bank vault in the sleepy hamlet of Snowtown. The discovery of the barrels, made possible due to a five-year investigation, led to the uncovering of all the crimes, which eventually came to be known as the Snowtown murders or the Bodies in Barrels murders. Despite its notorious association, only one murder was committed in Snowtown, and none of the victims or perpetrators were actually from that area.Four people were ultimately arrested and charged for the murders. The ringleader was John Bunting, described by Penelope Debelle of the "Sydney Morning Herald" as "Australia's worst serial killer." His victims, people he knew or was somehow related to, were chosen on suspicion of crimes and behaviors that were never officially proved as fact. These included homosexuality and pedophilia, both of which he passionately detested. He also showed hatred towards drug addicts and the obese. After entering a relationship with Elizabeth Harvey, he took under his wing her son, fourteen-year-old James Vlassakis, and over the years groomed him into becoming his accomplice. After several pretrial hearings, Vlassakis was given four consecutive life sentences in 2001 with a twenty-six-year non-parole period. In 2003, Bunting was given eleven consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole.This story has been dramatized in "The Snowtown Murders," easily one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. It would not be accurate to call it a horror movie, during which you always have that little voice in the back of your head telling you that what you're watching isn't real. All the same, the film is unremittingly frightening and at times painfully unwatchable. It filled me with disgust, and yet, because I believe that was the intention, I'm forced to concede that it was successful. Unlike exploitative trash such as "A Serbian Film," "The Snowtown Murders" depicts rape, torture, and murder in such a way that we can actually identify with the victims, and therefore experience a genuine emotional reaction. The effect is undeniably powerful. It's also emotionally draining, so don't say I didn't warn you.Bunting, as depicted by Daniel Henshall, is an intense man who runs the narrow gamut between an unsettling presence and a sadistic monster. To an extent, we understand his corrupting influence over young Vlassakis (Lucas Pittaway), who we see being photographed in his underwear by his mother's original boyfriend and who is soon thereafter raped by his own half-brother (Anthony Groves). It's obvious that the kid, who eventually shoots Bunting's dog at his behest, is torn between misplaced hero worship and paralyzing fear, both likely fueled by his lack of a father figure. Despite this, we don't really get a sense of Bunting's authoritative power ? or, more accurately, how he was able to obtain and exercise it. On the basis of the film, all the right people just happen to come into his life. This definitely includes a ragtag band of lowly chain smokers who convene every so often at a kitchen table and rant filthily about what they would do if they ever caught a pedophile. They fancy themselves a neighborhood watch, but they're really nothing more than a second-rate gang of vigilantes.We have a better understanding of Vlassakis' mother, Elizabeth Harvey (Louis Harris), who always seems frazzled and is never seen without a cigarette. You can tell she consistently attracts the wrong type of man, and would therefore be blind to the negative idiosyncrasies someone like Bunting continually projects. In the film, we're torn between feeling sorry for her and wishing she would finally get her act together. We're also not sure of the extent to which she's aware of Bunting's crimes. In real life, Harvey knew what he was doing all along, and even ended up assisting in one of them at his encouragement. She escaped punishment only because she died of cancer before she was found to be complicit.One of the film's biggest drawbacks is its structure, which is at times curiously random. We also never get a sense of the passage of time; for all I know, the seven-year timeline of the actual murder spree has been condensed into several days or weeks. Having said that, I appreciated the atmosphere created by director Justin Kurzel, specifically the authentic feel of Bunting's lower class neighborhood ? the patchy lawns, the chain link fences, the stray dogs roaming the streets. I also recognize that technical skill applied to the scenes of torture and murder, which are graphic but not gratuitous. This doesn't mean that I enjoyed watching them. Truth be told, it's difficult to imagine anyone in their right minds enjoying "The Snowtown Murders," as I don't believe entertainment was the goal. It's an uncompromising historical film made with such proficiency that it cannot be dismissed. At the same time, you could never make me watch it again. Not in a million years.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)</fullReview>

I didn't really hear (or maybe understand) all of the dialogue either.I can't really blame the movie for that though! Such extremely great performances from all of the cast. Really nice photography and suggestive atmosphere that never was over the top. Looked liked a perfect blend of documentary and great cinematography.If you're intrigued by the synopsis of this movie - watch it! It is however a very dark experience that will create the mood the events deserve.(I don't know anything about the real events or how close to them this is however, but knowing that it is based in real events makes it a lot darker imo.)</fullReview>

And thats the theme of the rest of the movie, pedophilia, rape and depression. The acting was quite good, but it could have been so much more. All talk about gore, brutality etc is so exaggerated, I was expecting a bloody and horrific experience, but all I got was 2 mediocre, depressing and dull hours. As I mentioned before the acting was solid and the story was okay, but I wanted something more. The hype of this movie is far too much, it does not deserve everything.

		<fullReview>Snowtown is an extremely disturbing film. I would not recommend it to anyone. But I wouldn't say it's bad. This is a strange case in which I could agree with the reviewer who says that this is a totally pointless portrayal of the Snowtown killings (redneck realism). And I can also agree with this statement: "Cinema is supposed to affect us, and Snowtown certainly did". I think my tolerance is extremely high towards violent films. But this is exactly the kind of realism which you don't want to see. Believe me. It won't make you think, except that you can't wipe out some scenes from your brain no matter how hard you want them to go away. I don't think it's artistic either. There's no real climax. The only reason I sat this through, because I wanted to know, how the story ends for the boy. It was a clever move from the director to show Jamie as a sympathetic character. But I think, I wouldn't missed anything if I read about the subject on Wikipedia first. Martyrs is an easy watch compared to this. If you hated titles such as Irréversible or The killer inside me, don't watch this. Despite of the negative things I wrote before, I give it a 7. I have to admit, building the tension was masterful.</fullReview>

We found the movie to be very disjointed. It was extremely difficult to follow the story line. The story was not written or filmed in a logical manner, it was very chaotic. It was difficult to follow the relationship of the characters, their motives and ultimately, the story. The pace of the film was also very slow (especially at the beginning) and it was easy, at times (given the pace and the chaotic storytelling) to lose interest in the movie. We actually researched the story on the internet to remain engaged in the film and in an effort to follow the story. We found that the story was actually interesting and the movie was not! It seemed as if the movie was filmed by students in film school. We would highly recommend researching the internet and skipping the movie. Its a difficult movie to watch if you don't already know the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking story, poorly directed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We see some people being murdered, but learn little about them or why most of them were targeted and tortured to death. With the actual events, at least half the victims seem to have been murdered so John and the others could receive their welfare cheque, but virtually no attention is paid to this motive in the movie. There is no explanation in the movie of why the last murder victim was chosen. He was neither a pedophile nor a homosexual, and was not a welfare recipient whose cheques could be taken by the criminals. The cannibalizing of the final victim is not mentioned in the movie, and we get no hint that by this time, the murderers were simply addicted to killing and were doing it to satisfy sadistic urges. It would have been better if the some of the time-consuming drawn- out scenes were shortened, and replaced by a bit more information on what was going on and a better background of the people involved.I found the same in Justin Kurzel's version of MacBeth. It was not nearly as good as Roman Polanski's movie, because some of the most important parts of the story and some famous lines are left out, and there are those unnecessary long pauses where little happens.With a more capable director, this story could be re-made into a better, more informative movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gripping and Horrifying Tale of Reality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lucas Pittaway stars in Snowtown, an all-too-true story of how one man's influence can summon the deepest evil from within the most innocent of humans. Right from the get go we are introduced to the unrelenting grey skies that drape themselves over Snowtown for the remainder of the film. Jamie (Lucas Pittaway) introduces Snowtown by describing a strange nightmare he had, suggesting that the individual is slightly disturbed to begin with. We're given a fly on the wall type perspective into Jamie's household, who although appear to be on the low end of the wealth scale, make up for it in family values. Everyone is just chipper. But not for long.As the film progresses, we begin to understand why Jamie is such a reserved character. He lives with his mom who is struggling to make ends meet, his mom's pervert boyfriend, and his three brothers. It's about fifteen minutes or less into Snowtown that you begin to realize what you're really in for. A dry, raw tale of the darkest sides of human nature. The film itself is an amazingly crafted work of art, but its contents are down right disturbing. I would not recommend this film for everyone. As a fly on the wall, you spend most of the movie just wishing you could intervene in this family's lives, either to help them, or stop them. It's difficult to sit through to say the least, but is no doubt an eye opening story that does what it was intended to do; remind you that what happens behind closed doors in quiet suburban neighborhoods is a total mystery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Struck by the poster and trailer preceding its release, I was compelled to watch this film. And while it is a hard watch, particularly in light of the true events on which it's based, I was immensely taken by the deft hand with which I thought it was made.It captures a microcosm of poverty-stricken/skewed domestic life that is at once repulsive and made fascinating by the nature in which the characters have been scripted, portrayed and captured on screen.It is a Monster of sorts, and other films besides, where the real events inform the telling, but where no prior knowledge of the lead characters' crime is necessary for the impact of the story on screen to be felt.From the quiet compliant younger boy to his violent and vile mentor, and some of the suburban cameos writ large, these characters share the Australian accent and landscape, but it is only through the camera lens that their world, is possible to attempt to fathom. We are a third party in the room, present but not of the action, and with some of the more graphic scenes, even given permission to look away, as the camera deflects focus from the gore at hand.This is one of two films released at around a similar time with similar themes, a window into Australian suburbia ? the other, Animal Kingdom ? an operatic version of domestic crime-driven mayhem, celebrated internationally and rightfully catapulting some of its stars, such as Ben Mendelsohn, into long-awaited international careers. While Snowtown does not herald the bigger name Aussie actors, both films share narrative notes, leading an impressionable lead male teen down a destructive dark path of familial influence, with as much aplomb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I wanted a horror piece. It was on Netflix under that specific genre. I wasn't really calling for any specific type of horror, but as for what this is, I don't know if I would call it one. Or maybe, if anything, it's one of the few under that genre that DOES earn its label because this is a brutal, unflinching, extremely hard to watch film based on true events. It's not even about gore or anything shown (although there's one scene where they do show a lot, and it gets to you). It's just that the characters in this, including the leader of this twisted pack, are so despicable, so outright sick that just seeing them interact surrounded by families makes your stomach turn. It's a heavy, heavy film and I mean that. You feel outraged and frustrated that these things actually happened, and outraged at not just the killers, but even at all of the people connected with these characters and settings that are guilty of horrible stuff. Ultimately, this is an effective and incredibly brutal film. I will totally get anyone who hates it though. In the past I've also shown my disdain to how the term "torture porn" is carried around and stuck to really gory films like the Saw franchise. Not that most of them are any good, but there's a fine line between being gory and actually being "torture porn". Take a moment and really take in what those two words mean, and the kind of meaning they carry. To me, porn is supposed to make you feel good. And this will hardly arise any type of feel-good sentiments in anyone. I won't even really recommend it, but it is well- made and well-acted and it accomplishes its goals. Now excuse me while I go take a shower.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not exactly a film about Santa Claus and his merry green elves up north. Nope. It's from Australia, the continent overflowing with creepy crawlies and apparently also a lot of white trash. I can't recommend this film. I just thought to watch it on the grounds of it being said to be a recent powerful film from the land of down under. It has solid acting and a slightly menacing atmosphere. Moved too slow, though.Again, it's really not a family film, unless you're the Adams Family, and in my opinion not terribly good, but it is a film with guts and a heart and a look into some really dark corners of civilization.Or maybe it's one big, long commercial for cigarettes...***, mate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Story, very confronting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is made all the more shocking because it was true. I was living in Australia when this was happening, it was all over the news then and it had me gripped. It was known as "the bodies in the barrels" case, because the killers kept most of the bodies of the dozen or so people they killed in barrels obviously. They would kill someone and take over receiving their benefit payments. When this movie came out it wasn't received that well because people felt it was too soon, even though it happened over 12 years ago, and it only made just over $1,000 in the opening weekend. The movie itself is quite well done, keeps true to what actually happened and some of the scenes are hard to watch, very confronting. You get to see how it would've been for the victims, quite harrowing. And the role of John Bunting is played very well, along with the role of Jamie Vlassakis. This movie would have to be one of the most shocking films I've seen this year, only because of the realism portrayed in it. Well done, so I give it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Snowtown' tells the story of 16-year-old Jamie who befriends Australia's most infamous serial killer John Bunting. The film follows Jamie throughout his relationship with Bunting who begins dating Jamie's mother. It's a very difficult film to watch. The themes of this story are quite tragic and from the beginning of the film you are exposed to disturbing scenes of child exploitation. The story has been written very well but tackles these issues head-on and sometimes a bit too brutally. The acting is as good as any Hollywood film which is surprising. Lucas Pittaway performs very well despite not saying very much throughout the film's duration. Louise Harris, who plays Jamie's mother, also performs very well though her character is not seen a lot. Overall, there are no weak performances in this film; certainly none of the major roles are ruined by poor acting. The scenery used in this film works really well in creating a hopeless atmosphere for the film. The bleak, saturated colour used all the way through the film provides great effect. Overall, this film stays with you for a long time. The story is truly horrifying and they have portrayed this very well. This film contains a lot of extremely graphic violent and sexual scenes. There are also a lot of scenes which can cause a lot of emotional distress so this film is not for the faint-hearted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hired this movie out as i was interested to see how a movie could be made about such horrible murders that occurred from the early 90's to late 90's in the northern suburbs of the city of Adelaide in Australia The main strong suit of this film is the solid acting. Lucas Pittaway is superb in the lead role of Jamie, the actor that plays the main serial killer John Bunting is also brilliant and they both give a very realistic feel to the film. Some very sensitive issues are touched on in the movie, and is certainly not appropriate for a young audience.This film is not for the faint of heart, it is very graphic, a reasonable amount of profanity and some scenes are very disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gruesome movie about Snowtown serial killers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was very bleak from start to finish. There were moments of its cast connecting and the tone of this connection being positive, but the whole tone of the film underlined that such moments of joy were short lived. Which was a shame as we knew what to expect from the story of the incident anyway. David Henshall and Louise Harris definitely deserved winning the AACTA awards for their respective performance, David was just chilling and Louise gave a lot of heart in her love for her children and it really resonated with me. I still can't believe the cast are all non- actors, I have to say it was very well cast and the performances were real.The film did make me feel physically sick in the stomach though. I nearly had to walk out. Somebody mentioned it was like Wolf Creek, it was nothing like it as it was less gratuitous in the physical violence. More like the end of Wolf Creek or The Clinic, with that sense of weird eeriness that you got from it. I just didn't enjoy it one bit from that standpoint but I do see the merits of it nonetheless. Just don't expect to come out after feeling all 'sunshine and lollipops', it will stay with you long after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very slow, bleak, as cold as it's title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a slow, grim, dark, chilling, creepy and real film. It's power is in it's sinister poverty and the fact that the murders actually happened. Snowtown is a trailer trash styled estate where in 1999, John Bunting was convicted of 11 murders making him Australia's worst serial killer. Robert Wanger was also convicted of 10 murders, with Mark Haydon guilty of assisting 7, and Jamie (the main focus of the film) jailed until a possible release in 2025 aged 45.The film tales the mega-grim tale of a vigilante trio, led by the visiting John Bunting, dealing with local paedophiles and gays. Bunting inducts young teen Jamie, a quiet teen and victim of incestuous rape. Bunting is a sinister but likable leader, this evil force almost a product of the area's backwards, aggressive, abandoned poverty. Jamie is taken in and involved in a series of murders that follows. The movie is very slow, bleak, as cold as it's title and features scenes of anal rape, brutal torture and 'gay bashing'. I found it a tough watch, mainly due to its pace, with a few electric scenes amidst the shadowy nothingness. The brutal scenes and ending are praise worthy but in the main the film is too slow, long, cold and simple. Better films from this genre and neck of the woods include the better 'Horseman' and 'Animal Kingdom'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incessant swearing and animal cruelty don't a good drama make.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wildly over-hyped, overestimated Aussie flick about their local serial murderer celebrity.This attempt at gritty and crude reality has been seen time and time again before, with usually better results. The thing drags and drags on and on, with interminable scenes including a bunch of people who are never introduced in the first place (who'll only vanish later, without further explanations) bantering and chit chatting back and forth for what seems forever.From time to time, though, the perpetrator of this celluloid waste does try to wake the spectator with some violent scenes, the most gruesome of which involving (real) animal cruelty. Excuse me? Dude (yes I'm talking to you, beginner Kurzel), the happy days of Cannibal Holocaust and all are over, hello? To have real animal cruelty in a movie today is totally inexcusable. If the producers of this crap didn't have the doughs necessary to plod forward with special effects, they should have abstained. Period. Notwithstanding the cynics, you don't take lives for the sake of entertainment. And this thing is not even entertaining.Lastly, if you want to understand ANY of this mess, you'd better have a solid grasp on the John Bunting events before you watch this. Otherwise, it'll be nameless characters galore which won't make any sense to you.Pass on it, though. And hope Kurzel isn't allowed to approach a camera ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snowtown is a beautiful, horrible, terrifying look at the world we live in and the things people can do to each other.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this evening I watched a film called Snowtown and let me start by telling you that you are not ready for this film. You will start watching expecting one thing and be given another and it will leave you with a strange taste in your mouth and a tingling sensation in your body.This is not a film for the faint of heart.The opening of the film sets the tone for the next two hours with a strangely soothing yet simultaneously unsettling rhythm, a feeling of not really understanding everything that's going on but being unable to look away. In that respect we share many similarities with the main character in that he also rarely seems to understand what's really going on. This is not to say the film is confusing, it can be at times, but rather it's a significant statement about the brilliance of the film overall. We never really know how to feel about Jamie, which leaves us feeling a bit adrift in the same way he must feel and in doing so actually brings us closer to him. Those familiar with the story of the Snowtown murders will find plenty of little hints and snippets and nods to the actual happenings of the real world events, but the film doesn't assume knowledge or indeed aim to provide knowledge to those without. Instead it tells a story that can be felt and understood without any prior knowledge of the actual events and still cause a deep and truly unnerving sensation of recognition.This is not recognition of something we know, but rather something we understand in our fellow human beings; the capability of cruelty and the tiny thread upon which many balance on a daily basis. It's a scary film not because it tells the true story of a scary thing but because it investigates perhaps too easily the true story of what people are capable of. As much as I want to recommend this film, tell you to go and see it, take a friend and really experience a beautiful moment of brilliant Australian film, I feel I would be doing you disservice as this film is not for everyone.It is quite likely that having never seen this film you might live a slightly happier life. I would not hesitate to theorise that seeing this film will make you feel at least a tiny bit less in love with the human race. Snowtown is a beautiful, horrible, terrifying look at the world we live in and the things people can do to each other. Having said all that and given you fair warning I believe you owe it to yourself to see this film if you have any interest in understanding cinema as the art form it can be. It's very difficult to watch at times, but the horrifying is outweighed by the masterful way in which this film was crafted. If ever a story this dark, this sinister, was told quite so beautifully before then I've not heard of it. See this film on a quiet evening with a couple of friends with all the lights off. Talking through it will help you process it and while it might ruin your night in terms of bright pleasant thoughts, it will most definitely give you something to talk about.I can't say it's a 'must see' because giving to do so seems arbitrary and almost insulting. Instead, let me say that I will buy this film, I will keep this film and though I will rarely watch it, the few times I do will be an occasion, something with wine and friends, not a passing fancy. It's that kind of film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>***Spoilers*** Snowtown tried to underplay its hand. But it went too far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand the director not wanting to over-sensationalize an already highly sensationalistic story line. However, this film goes way too far in the opposite direction, and as a result, misses the mark by a country mile. Even knowing the actual facts of the case doesn't help, although it does aid somewhat in the understanding of what's happening on screen.The filming tried so hard to be artsy and dramatic that it was painfully inadequate as a result. And I'm not just talking about the unnecessary attempts to be dramatic through its repetitive use of disjointed choppy cuts, which was a problem in its own right. I'm also talking about the endlessly LONG shots that are, I assume, supposed to give the viewer time to think about what's going on. On the contrary -- all those needlessly long shots only have the effect of boring the viewer to tears. At least this viewer.It's rare, indeed, when I view a film in which I want EVERYBODY to die. That was the case with this film. Maybe the lack of a clearly defined protagonist complicates the matter. But this film fails miserably in generating any compassion for ANY of its characters. And that's just poor film making at its worst. About the only thing this film accomplishes is portraying a very ugly underbelly of Australia that most folks outside of that region would never know. I wish I never knew.The landscape is perpetually bleak, so the cinematography has no contrast whatsoever. The same can be said about the pace -- or lack thereof of this film. It's like staring at a piece of gray paper for 2 hours. And the decision to use non-actors to give it a real feel only had me yearning for REAL actors. It's ironic that it takes real actors to portray real people, but this low budget Walmart special looked and felt exactly like that, rather than an accurate portrayal of real people, if that makes sense. If it doesn't make sense, just watch this train wreck to see what I'm talking about. Then again...if you value your time, just take my word for it, and save yourself the 2 hours you could spend doing something else. You won't regret it. I promise. If not...have a go at it then. But don't come back and say I didn't tell you so. Buyer beware when it comes to Snowtown. Rating: 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you'd never watched a documentary or read a book on the true story this film is based on, you are likely to be scratching your head throughout the bulk of this film. Thankfully, I had found a really good documentary online recently. Sitting through the film, I noticed this film was missing all the really shocking moments from this story. The murders are only lightly touched upon. The torture was played down. There's a lot of missing moments. There's not much to show that some people are even being murdered &amp; the editing is done in such a way that it's not even clear. There's plenty of moments in which I found myself wondering why on earth this was what was being focused on rather than the real moments that were likely to grip the audience a lot more. Way too much dialogue &amp; not enough of the real violence &amp; horror of the story.The ending is a total anti-climax. It cuts before the final killing to white text against a black screen to tell you what happened next. Nothing to show the police investigations. Nothing to show justice being done to the killers. If you wish to watch a fantastic Australian movie based on true criminals, I would recommend 2010's "Animal Kingdom" over this. And if you want to watch a good documentary on this story, look online for "Serial Killers - The Bodies in the Barrels"Overall, not worth a second look.</fullReview>

Half the time I didn't know who the victim was, or who was the target. Just a whole bunch of scenes thrown together that just don't make any type of real connection. It probably could have made for a really good movie if someone with some experience in film making was involved with it. Just my opinion, Watch it, and please feel free to tell me I'm wrong.

		<fullReview>Aside from the horror described in this movie, the actor's know only on word, the F word, repeated throughout the movie thousands of times, and with the Australian accent, this word was the one that came through all the time. The actors are, in my estimation,mediocre with no talent to say the least. The complete nude scenes (two of them), were unnecessary and vulgar! If I was to rate this movie on a basis of 1 to 10, I would give it a -25! The murder scenes were realistic in every way. The one thing I did like was the scenery of Australia. The scene where they were chopping up a dead kangaroo, and then tossing the grizzly mess on a neighbors house across tghe street, also had nothing to do with the story line, bu it did show the mentality of the star performer. The scene of the rape of a co-star, also was not necessary! The scene where the one star shot an innocent dog at the order of the main star, also was disgraceful. The movie is about a serial killer, and thees scenes as mentioned, did not do anything to show the story as being shown. I would suggest that anyone who wastes his or her money to buy such rubbish, should delegate this video to the nearest garbage can!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit i had never heard of John Bunting. Australia's most notorious serial killer . There has been lots of critical acclaim for Snowtown , the story of Bunting and i have to admit it has a lot about it that you have to admire.It's hard to gauge this film. It has a very amateurish feel about it . in regards the acting . yet that is part of it's charm. ( if charm can be used in a film about a serial killer). It feels very real and you get the feel of impending doom , yet to be honest nothing very much happens.There is no blood fest , You don't see murder after murder but what you do get is tension by the barrel load. The way the we see innocence of the children amongst the manipulative household of Bunting is fascinating and your never really sure what Bunting wants to do with these kids.Most of what happens is suggestive and not in your face and for that , director Justin Kurzel has to be applauded.One criticism is that it could have been longer and the ending is far too abrupt leaving the viewer wanting to know more ( or anything at all) about his capture .Snowtown is well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snowtown: A very uneasy film to watch if you're against useless torture films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was a bit confusing after I viewed the 1st hour because I had never heard of any of the serial killers featured in this film. I initially thought it was a typical artistic Australian film about a white trash family that had a bit of bad luck with a pedophile neighbor that was going to get beat up or killed. Then he moved away after being harassed by the lead serial killer. That's not what it's about. So I went back to the beginning to watch it with a different mind set.I won't bother to try to explain the story because you can search online for bits and pieces (no pun intended) of the killers involved and how they tortured their victims. I give it a 2 rating because when I started watching this film, it presented too many uneven/incomplete situations for the viewer. You have to either think back in your own mind or rewind the DVD player to figure out what is really going on.Another reason I give it only a 2 rating is because it is filmed in a realistic manner. It almost appears as if some of this stuff is really happening to these characters and to me, this is what makes it appealing for so many new and old killers to do what they do and get away with it. Yet there are no obvious reasons why people become senseless serial killers at all and that question will never be answered by anyone entirely. This type of film also glorifies violence in a subtle way that most people will not comprehend right away. Throughout the world, there are people loving every moment of these horribly violent films more and more for various reasons. Especially in films that can afford to make it look realistic. Why the need to chop up 3 real kangaroos into pieces on camera as the filmmakers of Snowtown does? And I'm not even an animal person and I found that scene unnecessary and disgusting to watch.I also just noticed that YouTube has many Documentaries about the true events that inspired this film. Why make a confusing film when the documentaries can give us better details about what really happened? To win awards, to get more jobs as a film director and more. The film does look interesting at first glance with a few adequate actors but very unpleasant to watch many of the scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Horrible and Hard to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just tried to watch this movie and didn't even make it halfway through it before we just had to turn it off. If you wanted to show what really happened you could have chosen a much better way to do so. Most of the time you have no idea why they're doing what they're doing and unless you have a pretty good imagination you have absolutely no idea what's happening. Horrible writing, acting, directing, everything!!! Very hard to follow and no story line at all. I read reviews before I rent movies and unfortunately they only show the good ones first on here. But I can't for the life of me figure out how anyone could have possibly enjoyed this movie. I would never recommend this movie to anyone!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Living in Australia I am familiar with the background of this movie....unlike a lot of others who may watch it throughout the world.I must admit that I was looking forward to watching as I had heard some very good reports....needless to say I was very disappointed with the whole film.....not only did it NOT give any indication as to just what it was all about but the stunted dialogue, the bad acting and the disjointed story left a lot to be desired......The final scenes did not make sense at all.....left a lot of unanswered questions.....anyone seeing this film would be left totally in the dark as to just what it was about........There were also too many scenes of actors just talking over one another in what seemed like unscripted dialogue.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't like the film at all. Shooting a horrible, disgusting story well, does not make a movie good. It is full of violence; it makes you sick. There are many things that cannot be understood (these make you not like the film). For example, in the beginning why three of the boys did not say anything or not struggled or not resisted to the naked guy (forgot his name)at home??? They are 3 boys. They could have beaten that psycho man!!! Are all gay or did they happy with the pedophile's behavior?! On the contrary of some reviewers I think that the characters not portrayed well. We definitely don't understand why their mother says lies ("I'll see my x" but she didn't see... , am I wrong?)... We don't understand why Jamie is so quite and accept everything??? such as the rape of the guy who I forgot his name, in the beginning and also the rape of Troy...etc... Isn't there his responsibility on all what have happened? Everything seems to me unrealistic. Why doesn't Jamie go to the police?? I can understand teenagers psychology but Jamie seems lacking any value also any intelligence. Also many people around know what have happened but nobody go to the police!! Very strange people if this story is real. As you know seeing/witnessing any crime but not going to the police makes you also guilty (in many countries laws say this). Mother...She isn't around while Jamie living all those horrible things with John? What is the problem of this woman? What kind of mother she is?! Why doesn't she going to police taking all of her children with her? Isn't there police in that part of the Australia??I'm very bored and get disturbed.As a summary, with creepy and disturbing scenes and the characters we don't understand at all and don't feel any empathy or sympathy to them this film is a real waste of time. I regret that I lost 2,2 hrs. Film doesn't have anything to say and doesn't give any feeling except sickness in the stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could not finish this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may be better than the rating that i am giving it but as a dog lover when they shot an innocent dog 2/10th of the way through the movie that was enough for me. The movie was slow from the start and i was having a hard time staying interested in it anyway. I wished i had never started watching it since it is hard to get the cries of the dog out of my mind. I don't think cruelty to animals in any format is good viewing or necessary. I know this review is totally negative and it may be a good movie but once they killed a dog that was the end of me watching it. I removed the movie from my DVD and broke it in half, because, i my opinion any movie that has cruelty to animals in it needs to be round filed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was brutally hard to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution labels should be attached to this movie. I almost quit watching after just ten minutes and to be honest I wished I had stopped watching. It never once makes you feel good. The main actors were alright but the supporting cast was very weak. The directing left me turning the volume up and down through out the movie. The story lines needed to be presented in a way that made them easier to view. Just because it is based on a true story doesn't mean people want to see it like it is presented here. There are so many more tactful ways of presenting real events and making a much better movie than this was. Oh but then there would have been actual spending money which this movie lacks a lot of. I try not to be harsh but this was close to the worst movie I ever saw.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but worth a miss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Snowtown is a really hard film to watch, and I don't mean 'hard to watch' in a so-deeply-disturbing-and-harrowing-and-confronting-and-interesting way,(which it should be) I mean 'hard to watch' in a so-incredibly-pretentious way, which is just so disappointing isn't it? Yet another missed opportunity to resurrect audience's faith in Australian filmmaking. Sigh. True-crime-film is a delicate genre, and, unfortunately, Snowtown hasn't pulled it off.Let's get one thing straight before I begin, Lucas Pittaway (who plays the lead, Jamie Vlassakis) is nothing, whatsoever, like Heath Ledger. Sorry to start with such a seemingly inane point, but all the lead up hype to this film has been banging on about Pittaway being Heath Ledger and it's been really irritating, it's just such absurd, PR, rot. Ignoring the fact he's not got even half the looks Ledger had, Heath Ledger was actually an actor. Pittaway, like most of Snowtown's cast, is not, and it really does show in his far, far, less than mediocre performance. Justin Kurzel has attempted to tell a 'humanised' version of the story by centering the film around Pittaway's character, Jamie, and show the seduced-and-corrupted-by-the-desperately-craved-father-figure angle on the tragedy. However, sadly, what with not actually being an actor, Pittaway doesn't have the range required to pull off the angle?(Let's not even get into whether this a tad sensationalized and irresponsible,insensitive, way to tell the story? Surely the kid had agency in the horror that shouldn't be excused with a but-he-was-corrupted-and-coerced telling of the story?) Snowtown is littered with banal shots of Pittaway not doing much. Pittaway 'acts' by looking blankly at the camera in the hope the audiences will do the work and insert complicated emotions. It makes sense, he's a non-actor so he's been directed by Kurzel not to do much, because the camera is a sensitive eye and picks up everything, so the best thing to do with non-actors is to get them to stay still and then they won't over act. In this way, Pittaway delivers a sort of adequate performance, punctuated with moments when he gasps a bit and dribbles tears in a mildly moving manner. It is certainly not an embarrassing performance but it isn't enough to make the boy the lynch-pin of the story. We're supposed to see the story through his eyes and understand him to an extent, but as nothing much goes on in his eyes (apart from when he cries) we just don't and the whole story merely lingers around him, weakly.Casting non-actors was one of Kurzel's many pretentious choices that didn't end up paying off in his art-house film. A choice that means Daniel Henshall, (who plays John Bunting,) being the only trained actor in the film, has to carry the entire film, and, while his performance is sound, it's not good enough to carry or save the film. The performance Kurzel didn't pay enough attention to, (but I'm betting audiences will) is that of Louise Harris, who plays Elizabeth Harvey, Jamie's mother. It is Harris, not Pittaway that is the really exciting fluke of the non-actor casting. It is with Harris that Kurzel did find that gritty combination of performance and real. That terrifying, and heartbreaking, edge of artifice, that honesty and earnestness that can come from a truly gifted non-actor who is free from all the pretension and ambition of having acting as their vocation. I feel, it would have been a truly fascinating film, if told through the eyes of Elizabeth rather than Jamie. Her journey is heart-wrenching and Harris goes well beyond doing justice to role. She embodies vulnerability and strength. She explores the (sickening and terrifying) love that Elizabeth felt for Bunting. Her performance is complicated and nuanced and heartbreaking and breathtaking. She is the little bit of human that makes this dreadful film watchable. Harris is sensational but at the end of the day, (and the way-too-long-film) I think the non-actor thing was a really silly call and didn't do the powerful thing that Kurzel was banking on it doing? but then, the whole film didn't do the powerful thing Kurzel was banking on. Kurzel has delivered a really adequate film. It's not a masterpiece and it desperately wants to be, and pretends it is oh-so-profound, which is really awkward to watch. The aesthetic is cold and bleak. The film starts abruptly in a we-have-been-whisked-away-into-this-frightening-world sort of way and begins with mood-setting voice-over and heart beat like score. The cinematography (by Adam Arkapaw) is really pretentious. Heaps of self-consciously artful shots like shots through blinds or from between poker-machines behind ashtray, or reflections from arcade games. It's very look-at-me-be-an-artist. Which is annoying. Kurzel needed to get on with telling the story and not spend so much time loudly proving how clever and interesting a film-maker he is. I really disliked the disorienting way the story was edited too. It is mostly chronological but you never really know where you are in the story and you don't get enough of a sense of ending at the beginning. The story does come the full circle, but by the time we get there we've forgotten where we were because the beginning was kind of forgettable. Meh. I'm bored of writing. Save your time and money and give Snowtown a miss. Australian film will make its comeback one day. But not just yet? Sadly?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a $1 movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apart from a millisecond of good acting by some newcomer found at a shopping mall, SNOWTOWN is a boring Australian film about rednecks killing each other in crappy houses in garbage strewn suburbs. As a film it proves that the untalented can grind out a film as competently as anybody but unfortunately it just ends up being bogan misery. To what end? Redneck Realism.... apparently. With a script full of crude cruelty dialog and shot in greyscale color SNOWTOWN depicts the uneducated killing their neighbors and then going for a drive in the car as sports play on the radio or TV. So what. Yes exactly. A terrible waste of resources and a tedious waste of your time, SNOWTOWN is for illiterate film makers who think filming atrocities and having unknowns recite swearing is some major step forward in their career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose there are some people out there who will revel in this kind of movie; but for the serious movie buff - save your money. I have seen a few real stinkers in my time, but this is way beyond the boundaries of acceptable movie narratives. The actors are all second grade to start with. The Director is off the planet or on a very strong substance. There is no real attempt to bring cognizance of the actual happenings to the screen, the focus by the director is mainly on his own view of the occurrence. If you followed the court case at the time, this movie has very little bearing on what was given in evidence at the trials. A totally fictitious, drawn out, movie to no purpose whatsoever. A rating of -10 would be appropriate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Australian version of a serial killer movie. Cool. I couldn't wait. For me, Snowtown was in the same category as Titanic and Apollo 13 ? I knew the story and knew what happened, so what could they do to make it surprising and entertaining? Well, I was certainly surprised. I must admit to being slightly conflicted about writing this; without wanting to go for the cheap joke, I should say, I have no axe to grind, and it's not without due consideration, that I pour scorn on other people's labours (after all, I'm sure the writer and director set out to create the best movie they could, and, when all's said and done, one's best is all one can do in life). But I left the cinema slack-jawed. And annoyed. Miraculously, the story of Australia's most prolific serial killer, which, at one end of the spectrum could have been treated as a splatter extravaganza, has been made to be, well, boring. Just utterly tedious. And that, for me, is the worst crime a movie can commit. Whatever the subject, style, treatment or genre, before the other layers of social commentary, polemic exposition and cultural observation, the cinema is an entertainment medium. Plug into my emotions and make me feel something; positive or negative, amused,amazed, repulsed or disturbed ? that's all part of the cinematic contract, for which the audience signs up - but not for seat-shifting boredom. Okay, clearly establish the characters' environ by all means, but when I was checking my watch in the reflection of the screen after what turned out to be only twenty five minutes into the session, I knew this was going to be a long two hours.It could easily have been called 'Mastication Nation' as there were so many scenes of people eating ? messily and loudly. I heard myself saying 'oh not again'. If you took kitchen tables out of the script, that'd be half the props gone. I'm sure the eating scenes could be post-rationalized, or intellectualized as depictions of a sense of family, coming together, communion, safety in a brutish, base world. I don't care. After a couple of such scenes, we were just aware that Mr Bunting's parents apparently hadn't taught him many table manners. But we didn't even find out if Mr Bunting's parents had taught him how to appropriately pack a barrel; that part of the story, again,was pedestrian. For what it's worth, I found the music incredibly evocative, the casting was spot on, and the actors acquitted themselves superbly(Jamie's eyes filling with tears on cue was astonishing). But generally,it all made Mike Leigh look like Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two hours to do something better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two hours is not a long period of time but it's possible to do something useful, like organize one's sock drawer, or clean out the garage. In any case choosing to watch this mediocre film should not be one choice: it's a waste of time.It may be that the idea behind Snowtown was to reflect on Hannah Arendt's phrase, "the banality of evil" which she applied to Adolf Eichmann's trial and his mass murders, in other words, to unravel the mind of a killer. Whatever the case may be, this film lacks any insightful intelligence in that regard and is an incompetent telling of a gruesome story. It is also very, very boring for a number of technical and creative faults.Firstly: it lacks any story as the outcome is known and secondly, the film fails in dramatic pitch or arc between the characters: events simply unfold in the same metronomic pace. The pace is identical throughout which is a huge creative failure and leads to a numbness of interest. The camera work is all close-up reality TV style and the pacing is consistent but consistency is the work of mediocrity. But the worst error is editing as all the scenes have the same rhythm and shot syntax: hold shot on character: revert shot to opposite character: hold shot to close.After 30 minutes it is evident that this is incompetent and unfinished work. The lack of dialog does not help either as no one speaks often and certainly without any intelligence: these are the dregs of humanity. Two hours in their company is dispiriting and without any value at all, especially in the way the filmmakers have rendered the story.</fullReview>
