		<shortDescription>A Classic of the Idiot Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Zoolander was released, I think I can safely say that it's become one of the most popular dumb comedies of the past ten years (a decade that was all too saturated with dumb comedies). Maybe it's the tongue-in-cheek attitude, or the clever writing, or the fact that it's immensely quotable ("I'm pretty sure there's more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking"). But whatever it is, it makes for a terrifically fun movie.Ben Stiller is Derek Zoolander, three-time male model of the year, whose brainpower never quite caught up to his really, really ridiculous good looks. After losing his title to up-and-coming model Hansel (he's so hot right now), played by a Zen-ed out Owen Wilson, and the death of three of his model friends in a tragic gasoline fight accident, he goes on a quest to find his purpose in life. Turns out, his purpose in life is as the face of Mugatu (Will Ferrel with the world's best hair)'s new Derelicte fashion campaign--or so he's led to believe.The plot is not strong. The characters are not fleshed out. But Ben Stiller keeps Derek's stupidity hysterical instead of irritating, and the rest of the cast adds gimmick after gimmick to keep things running. (Come on, the coal mines of New Jersey? Tell me that's not funny.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zoolander is stupid funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander is stupid. So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the fashion industry's number one male model, but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel (Owen Wilson) provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) takes advantage of this and Zoolander's stupidity, and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister, after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live's Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented, while for Meet the Parents' Wilson, it is the chance to play a comedic, confident, character role. Stiller's father and wife also appear in supporting roles, with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent, and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries, a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson's `Beat It' as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren's own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The previews didn't lie, you get what you see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a 9/10 for this reason, if you have seen the previews, you know what you are going to see. You are going to see a movie that is exactly the kind of humor that the preview TELLS and SHOWS you it contains. They don't expect Oscars, and arent even trying for them. This movie is not to be taken seriously, its for FUN, people. The movie's main characters did great jobs, and had good charisma between them, there were tons of other actors putting in small bits (some of which were amazingly funny, I laughed out loud in a few parts, and I almost never do that). There were some truly funny moments, moments I found much funnier than I thought the film would be. When I told friends and family I saw it they all said, `You did?' when I said I liked it they said with even more incredulity, `You did?!' because I don't like certain kinds of stupid humor. I liked the Three Amigos, but hated Austin Powers. Potty humor doesn't do it for me. But this movie was surprisingly witty and funny without thinking it had to be disgusting to be humorous. There were a few parts I could have lived without, gladly, but overall you get what you think you are going to get, and more!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, but so hilarious it doesn't seem to matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this I was expecting a total disaster of a movie. Persuaded by my older brother, I rented it and watched with a skeptical mind. I like Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson OK, but the idea just seemed so stupid and the fact it was based on some short on VH-1 making fun of male models seemed like it wasn't thought out too well.What I ended up doing was laughing so much I nearly died. This movie's story is definitely pretty ridiculous and not completely thought out, but the list of characters and cameos alone make this worth a treat. This is probably the funniest I've seen Will Ferrel, and Jerry Stiller plays his usual old crotchedy man with flying colors. Almost every scene with them makes you laugh out loud. It seems pretty obvious that even though it was a feature film, Ben Stiller seemed to have a lot of control over this. Definitely isn't made to please the masses, but those who can appreciate ridiculous, campy humor and are fans of these actors will find themselves wanting to show this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. I won;t ruin any of it, except to say the funniest line in the movie is "Merman! MERMAN!!!" And expect many great cameos, especially Billy Zane. You'll understand once you see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absurd but smart send-up of our image-obsessed culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released a few short weeks after Sept. 11, Zoolander became the target of "this is why they hate us" diatribes. I didn't see it until months later and immediately recognized what I can only hope I would have seen if I had watched it earlier--that this is a superb satire/farce. There aren't many movies that manage to be both silly and smart at the same time, and this is one. It is not only a send-up of the modeling and fashion industries, admittedly easy targets, but of our whole image-obsessed culture which commodifies love, spirituality, patriotism, heroism just as easily and unthinkingly as it does kitchen appliances. This is not a "stupid" movie, even though it is about stupid people and stupid situations. It keeps the targets of its satire within its sights at every moment, never letting that focus flag to pursue maudlin subplots, but at the same time, it is unfailingly hilarious, with marvelous comic acting, sight-gags, sets, and costumes. The screen is just packed with visual jokes at almost every moment. This is not a movie that anyone needs to be embarrassed to watch or enjoy. But it is also just plain damned fun!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets better each time I watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A really great take on the modelling world. Each Time I watch it I see something else that makes me howl with laughter. Out of all the Stiller/Wilson collaborations this is definitely the funniest. There is so much going on in the film and I love the way all the celebs join in on the joke. Zoolander has a great soundtrack a very humorous plot and is light enough to enjoy whatever the mood.I would definitely recommend a few viewings before you make judgement. Will Ferrell is manic as Mugato and Wilsons Hansel is as laid back as all his all his characters. The scene in the coal mine is the best. Enjoy whilst partaking of an Orange Mocha Frappucino. More from the duo please or a Zoolander II</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny For Those Who Like Absurd Humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be a movie that people would either laugh their butt off watching, or turn it off and never finishing it because it was so stupid. Fortunately, as someone who loves absurd humor, I was entertained by it. Yes, it's one of the dumbest films you'll ever see, but it's supposed to be stupid, a satire on the shallow people and world of male fashion models.Ben Stiller is outstanding as "Derek Zoolander," the brainless model who's number one male model status is upended by newcomer "Hansel," played by Owen Wilson. In light of Wilson's recent real-life drug problems, I couldn't help but think "how can these actors play absurd roles like this and be normal?" It's almost understandable by so many in the film business are whacked! You have to hand it to them, though: Stiller, Wilson, Millo Jovovich and Will Ferrell are good at playing weird people, as they do here. But it's all in fun - plus a serious comment about child labor - and the movie is simply to be enjoyed for what it is. Of course, it's stupid overall, but it's a spoof, like the Austin Powers films.Film fans and celebrity geeks will enjoy all the cameos in here, along with the wild outfits - male and female - and all the goofy looks on the faces, mainly Stiller's poses. In between all the dumbness is some smart satire on several topics dealing with the fashion business. Just know what you are getting into here, and you should get enough laughs to make it an entertaining hour-and-a-half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious 'poke' at the fashion industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Zoolander came out, I remember big deal plugs that were made for this film by the media. The movie, after all, is poking fun at entertainment, in particular, the fashion and model industry. This was a hilarious take on it, and Zoolander, our main character, is stupidly lovable. Ben Stiller proves once again his flexibility with his comedic acting. Just watch 'Meet the Parents'and this, you'll think it's 2 different actors. Showing you how much work Ben can do, he also helped write and produce the movie. Owen Wilson usually ends up in a movie with Ben, and he's hilarious too. And of course Will Ferrell is always a riot. Read the Plot Outline in the details, there's not much to it. But you don't watch movies like this for incredible story lines, do you?No, it's not an oscar winning comedy, most aren't. It's not an intelligent look at real-life, it's not the greatest storyline driven kind of movie, and it doesn't have top notch acting. But it's incredibly funny, especially the DVD. The DVD is filled with so many extra goodies, it's worth getting. The movie is filled with cameos like David Bowie, Paris Hilton, Billy Zane, AH! There are so many, you just have to see the list yourself.Rent or buy it, and leave your brain on the table next to the popcorn. Because there's more to life then being really, really, ridiculously smart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AUSTIN Posers--Hip, Daffy, Yet Kinda Sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Entertainment Weekly, Ben Stiller described this feature-length adventure of the moronic male model he created for the VH1 Fashion Awards as "MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE meets EYES OF LAURA MARS." Me, I can sum it up in two words: "AUSTIN Posers." No, better yet, I'll boil it down to one word: "endearing." That's right, endearing! As lighthearted as it is lightheaded, this daffy spoof of conspiracy thrillers and the mad, mod world of male models and other hipsters has a surprising undercurrent of sweetness to it. Star/director/co-writer/co-producer Stiller plays dopey Derek Zoolander as a gentle, essentially kind-hearted naif under his hip veneer. The same is true of Owen Wilson, putting his twang and quirky humor to good use as Derek's rustic yet hippy-dippy rival-turned-ally Hansel. I suspect folks will like ZOOLANDER even better on DVD, since there are tons of hilarious extended scenes and deleted scenes as well as the original Zoolander TV sketches that Stiller &amp; Co. did for VH1. As Derek says in the voiceover intros on the DVD menu, the ZOOLANDER disc is a wonderful introduction to "the world of DiviDuh"! :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very intelligent movie about stupidity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a favorite on the first viewing, when it premiered, this movie is - I have to admit it now - hysterical. Don't forget that it's a parody, it's quirky, completely ridiculous, insane &amp; over the top and yes, people in it act stupidly. I'm not a fan of Ben Stiller, I haven't enjoyed any other movies of his, but this is spot on. I say justice has been done: it's been finally revealed that stupidity knows no gender when it comes to the fashion world, and it comes in epic proportions. By the way, the fashion world redeemed itself by participating in this movie. Watch for the countless cameos from famous people in the industry. The fact that they accepted to make a little fun of themselves shows that they do have a sense of humor, and that's quite refreshing. Oh, and Jon Voight deserves an Oscar for his deadpan performance as Derek's estranged father. He made me break down and cry tears of laughter over the terrible drama of the Zoolander family. Words are useless here, just watch the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is definitely one of my favorite comedies. It is a feel-good, cleverly-written film that will leave a majority of viewers satisfied. The acting is great, and the story flows well--overall a very solid comedy. Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male model who is far from the sharpest tool in the shed, which is showcased in the most hilarious of ways. Suddenly, Derek's world as THE top model is disrupted when Hansel, brilliantly played by Owen Wilson, arrives on the scene and disrupts Zoolander's throne with Hansel's seemingly effortless, avant garde approach to male modeling.This is my very first review, so I apologize for the lack of well-articulated perspective. What I can tell you is that this movie is hilarious and absolutely worth a viewing.This really should be in the 7 - 8 range on IMDb.This film is definitely worth a watch.Enjoy!</fullReview>

I will admit that I laugh most times I watch it, sometimes I groan because of the stupidity, but I usually have a smile on my face.The plot? Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a washed-up model who has been brainwashed to kill a foreign Prime Minister. Sound stupid? That's because it's supposed to be. We have a handful of male models, all of them with IQs lower than their body fat percentage, and all of them getting into situations that they are not mentally equipped for.You can't watch "Zoolander" for its story or its characters, you can only watch it for its inane humour.

		<fullReview>After spending today reviewing all of my favorite movies, I had to pump out a review for the heinously bad Ben Stiller vehicle, Zoolander. Previously liking the principal cast of this film, (including Owen Wilson and Will Ferrel), I was more than a little dissapointed after seeing what a clumsy mess Zoolander turned into. The concept wasn't great to begin with, but such terrible execution on the tried and true Dumb and Dumber formula turned this film into an example of what not to do in a comedy. There are a few moments that may cause tiny giggles, but these moments are also mind numbingly dumb. Proceed with caution... this movie sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zoolander - Colorful, Creative, Original and Thoughtful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the exaggerated tagline, "3% body fat, and 1% brain activity," I just knew that Zoolander was going to be smart and funny. And, it was. If you can rise above the literal visual interpretation to the gasoline pump fight, you'll find it too, has an underlying educational, or at least, helpful message. The characterizations of good guy versus bad guy are whimsical, creative, colorful, and funny. Derek Zoolander, (Ben Stiller) is Ben's wonderfully exaggerated version of the male model, one who is offering his best attempt to be "Balls Models" 4th year in a row, model of the year. Sadly, he loses to Hansel, (Owen Wilson) a sweet blue, green, star eyed, soft lined, model. At the loss, quirky, carefree and complex, Derek questions his reflection in a puddle of water, "Who Am I?" In search of an answer to his question, he returns home to the coal mines of New Jersey, where his generally reluctant father, Larry Zoolander ( John Voight) and what looks to be his two evidently, (one Judah Friedlander) inarticulate brothers, reside. But, it is Derek's agent, Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) who encourages him to return to New York, so that Derek can take on the assignment, as model for Mugato's (Will Ferrell) "Derelicte," campaign. Maury is passionate and sincerely wants for his models to succeed, at making a living, in modeling. Mugato is obsessed with having Derek assassinate Malaysia's prime minister, Hassan (Woodrow W. Asai), one with a fondness for fashion and vogue, and a desire to increase pay standards, in the production industry. Derek takes the job, but little does he know that Mugato's black leathered assistant, Katinka, (Milla Jovovich) will be leading him into a day spa, that is more like a torture chamber, one designed to brainwash him into assassinating Malaysia's leader. Matilada Jeffries, (Christine Taylor) a reporter for Time, assigned to reporting on fashion events, will soon find herself in the midst of discovering a personal life, originating from her professional one. And fortunately, Hansel, is more than a competitor to Derek, but a friend, who saves both Derek and the leader of Malaysia, from an untimely death.The entire script is so creatively and colorfully articulated and presented, that one cannot help but have just so much fun, or alternatively be filled with suspense, as to whether or not Mugato will have his way with Derek. David Duchovny's scene, (mystery man on the cell phone), as scruffy bearded, eye glassed, and glass encased hand, J.P. Prewitt, at the cemetery, is really well done. In an interestingly woven monologue, he begins by explaining buried models' pre-mature deaths, scenes that include butt cheeks and abs sculpted on gravestones. It's very Tim "Robbinseque" in mood and tone and very well performed.Zoolander was much more rich in plot, characterization, and development than I had expected, after hearing, that "it didn't get great reviews." And the story still results in a very happy ending. Good wins over evil, and good guy hero gets girl. So who is Derek Zoolander? Answer: A really sweet guy, who is cute, funny, sensitive, articulate (although can't say eulogy, and instead says ulogee, but just adds more to his cute and funny attributes), and one who, we gather, has a terrific girlfriend, and cool best friend, with whom he pursues one of his true life long passions, to open up a school for kids, "to read really good." Zoolander is absolutely a "hip"comedy for every audience member.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stiller and Wilson are great together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hilarious, ridiculous comedy that does a great job of poking fun at celebrity. Ben Stiller seems to think that fame is rather silly and he shows his contempt for it in the form of male super-model Derek Zoolander. The intellect-challenged, self-absorbed Zoolander pouts, struts and mispronounces wonderfully throughout this comedy that's aimed at being stupid.The "plot-line" begins when Derek is targeted by a clandestine fashion alliance in need of a dim-witted, male super-model. Fitting the bill to a tee, Derek is brainwashed via a Clockwork-Orange-esque treatment that orders him to kill the visiting Prime Minister of Malaysia, whose progressive take on child-labour laws and sweatshops has become a serious thorn in the side of the fashion cartel. Whenever Derek hears "Relax" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, that's his trigger to kill the Prime Minister.Some movies try so hard at being ridiculous that it actually kills its comedic value (see "Scary Movie" and "Scary Movie 2"). It's quite a feat to maintain a balance, which Zoolander accomplishes. You'll either love or hate this movie. If you like silly, you'll like Zoolander. Also, I found that this movie gets better with age, so don't be so quick to cast it aside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller Delivers A Classic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The complex world of the male modeling profession, including the inherent rivalries and the significant impact the industry has had on history is explored and revealed in `Zoolander,' a brilliant comedy directed by and starring the versatile Ben Stiller. With chiseled features that bespeak the best of Michelangelo, as well as an arsenal of three `looks,' preeminent of which is the riveting `Blue Steel,' Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is poised to win the coveted VH-1 Male Model of the Year Award for an unprecedented fourth year in a row. But this year-- for the first time-- he has a rival, a newcomer, who just may be able to usurp his title: the charismatic and popular Hansel (Owen Wilson), who-- with chiseled features of his own-- has burst upon the scene only this year and threatens to steal Zoolander's thunder in one fell swoop. And as if this wasn't enough for the seemingly (until now) invulnerable Zoolander to have on his vapid mind, a reporter for Time Magazine, Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor-- Stiller's real-life wife), has written an in-depth article about him in which the true nature of the man behind the Adonis is objectively and succinctly revealed, and it's scheduled to hit the streets the week of the Awards. Suffice to say it's a full plate for Derek Zoolander, male model, who-- unbeknownst to him-- has yet an even greater personal vexation awaiting, which involves a sinister plot and the Prime Minister of Malaysia. The Prime Minister of Malaysia? And what-- you may ask-- does that have to do with the male modeling profession? Well, it's just that kind of movie...Like a toothless attack dog that suddenly lunges at you and chomps down on your elbow, `Zoolander' has a harmless bite that will grab your attention immediately and refuse to let you go. And like that dog it will continue to gum your elbow until it tickles your funny-bone and you become helpless to do anything other than pet it on the head and want to take it home with you. That's the effect of Stiller's film. It's an hilarious excursion through a world in which glitz, glamor and good-looks are the commandments by which to live, and one-on-one `walk-offs' and break dance fighting are the realities which mask a degree of shallowness that is nearly unfathomable. All of which Stiller delivers in his own inimitable style, with subtle nuance and an instinctive sense of comedy that really makes this satire work. No one-- with the possible exception of Albert Brooks-- can set up a comedy and put it across as effectively as Stiller, who always plays it straight and never fishes for `cheap' laughs. What he gives you is the real deal, and it's classic.In Derek Zoolander, Stiller has created a character who manifests the myriad facets, ironies and idiosyncrasies of pop culture, offering a perspective that allows us to laugh, not only at Zoolander, but at ourselves, as well. And such a perspective is a rare and welcomed gift; for too often matters of insignificance are taken too seriously by too many, and it is at such times that we need a Zoolander among us to dispel the complexities we foist upon ourselves and to negate the self-imposed burdens that keep us in thrall to the most trivial things in life. Zoolander holds up a mirror and points out the furrow in your brow that simply doesn't have to be there. Stiller is a truly gifted artist who can make you laugh, think and feel good about yourself all at the same time. But like Chaplin and Fields before him, it will undoubtedly-- and unfortunately-- be some time before his true genius is widely and sufficiently recognized.Owen Wilson, as well, is a talented actor/writer/performer who has demonstrated his own unique style in such films as `Bottle Rocket,' `Shanghai Noon' and `Meet the Parents,' and here makes Hansel the perfect counterpart of Derek Zoolander. Hansel is the flip side of the same coin that carries the likeness of Zoolander; so different, yet cut from the same cloth. And, like Stiller, Wilson plays it straight, with a subtle delivery that is entirely effective. He and Stiller, in fact, are possibly the greatest comed-team-who-aren't-a-team in the history of the movies. Wilson has the driest delivery this side of Gene Wilder, his timing is perfect and his quirky looks and the timbre of his voice give him a veritably captivating screen presence. He brings Hansel to life with facility, and makes him a memorable character.The supporting cast includes Will Ferrell (Mugatu), Jerry Stiller (Ballstein), Milla Jovovich (Katinka), Matt Levin (Archie) and features cameos by David Duchovny, Cuba Gooding Jr., Lenny Kravitz, Vince Vaughn, Jon Voight, Billy Zane, Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, David Bowie, Andy Dick and Fabio. Already the second-greatest cult film of all time (behind Stiller's `Mystery Men'), `Zoolander,' like Stiller himself, is destined to be initially under appreciated, but in time will be recognized as the comedic masterpiece that it is. It's entertaining and funny, at times dark, but never offensive; and it's the kind of film that gets even better with repeated viewings. A true classic that will endure the test of time, this film is what the magic of the movies is all about, and one you do not want to miss. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very imaginative and silly comedy starring Ben Stiller. Stiller plays a world-renowned male fashion model who is brainwashed to kill the new Malaysian Prime Minister. The short description of the plot may make the movie sound stupid, but it is a goofy and light-hearted comedy that is worth watching. You will either love it or hate it. Exceptional performances by Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Jerry Stiller.9 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie may have had somewhat of a weak plot (which is part of the humor in itself) but the actions of all the characters in the movie are hilarious. Ben Stiller plays a somewhat 'dumb' (putting it lightly) male model. He's been hypnotized to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. All the characters are great and the humor is non-stop. I laughed in the car on the way home. So go see it "You freakin' idiot!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathetically dumb and ridiculous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have teamed up on so many films and still haven't been able to be funny. "Zoolander" is no exception, where they compete as top male models in a dumb and stupid plot that results in a bunch of forced jokes, regretful performances, and overdone performances that just simply are not funny or daring in any way, shape, fashion, or form. The famous models who act overly dumb who are dragged in a series of bad plot twists and turns never make you laugh or even smile. At least they didn't for me. If you laugh easily, then "Zoolander" may actually be a good pick for you. But if you prefer intelligent and original humor, like me and other sophisticated minds, then stay the heck away from this worthless mess. Even worse, I hear there's going to be a sequel. Hooray to those who liked this film. I'll be sitting out and waiting for a more clever comedy to pop up.</fullReview>

It doesn't quite rate up there with the Alligator in the NY sewer movie, but it is riding on its tail. The plot is old and outdated and out performed lately by other movies(i.e. austin powers), the characters, playing the role of dumb models aren't even remotely believable. The additional roles of some very famous people is about the only thing it has for it, but let's face it, that doesn't carry that far. If you are in the hospital or jail, or you just forced into viewing this movie...chuckle even if you dont get the joke. Otherwise do something more amusing like clipping your toenails.

		<shortDescription>It has its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zoolander isn't really a film it is a bunch of sketches stitched together, and it shows in both the short running time and extreme stretching of some jokes. There is a moment in the film when you think that it's going to hit its target hard -- child labour and how the fashion industry exploits it to manufacture incredibly cheap clothing and then sell at obscene prices -- but then it backs off and goes for the cheap gags instead. Models are stupid, pampered and vain... yeah, tell us something we don't know. That's not to say there aren't lots of funny moments in it (Derek and Hansel faced with getting info out of a computer is brilliant), but when you add it all up you are left with... not much.Maybe it is because the world of fashion and modelling is a ripe target for spoofing? It's just too damned easy to rip on the vacuous and shallow -- and what's worse, the fashion industry is, by its nature, an attention whore. It wants you to watch for whatever reason. So any barbs sent their way are just laughed off and turned into more publicity for them, and the whole thing just seems to celebrate instead of excoriate. Or maybe that's what Stiller wanted all along.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing. I have fun every time I watch this movie. Everything about it is funny. It's almost indescribable how ridiculous (ridiculous as in really really goofy/silly) Zoolander is. I'm not big on Ben Stiller's work. I disliked both "Meet the" films, and I didn't like "Dodgeball". But he was...amazing in this movie.This is what comedy should be all about. It's surely a movie that you could quote on forever. And what really makes it unique is that if you enjoy the jokes, and get a feel for the goofy atmosphere, you really don't care about the story. In fact, you SHOULDN'T care. Ben Stiller shows that through his eyes as a director. It's very hard to find a decent/creative comedy these days. This film is certainly underrated. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A critique of designer fashion and America's image-focused celebrity culture where the not-particularly-glamorous Ben Stiller has fun playing a male model</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2001 film ZOOLANDER is a comedy about two male models, the eminent Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and the up-and-coming Hansel (Owen Wilson), who with the help of an investigative reporter (Christine Taylor) must thwart the plans of a megalomaniac fashion designer (Will Ferrell) to maintain third-world child sweatshop labour. Most of the humour in the film comes from Stiller's portrayal of Zoolander, a dimwitted manchild with a heart of gold, and the fact that the actor playing this male model isn't remotely glamorous. Hansel is an exaggeratedly alternative guy, embued with a hippie aesthetic, centered in New Age spirituality, who resides in a festive warehouse flat with, among others, a Sherpa and a quartet of Finnish dwarfs. The supporting cast includes David Duchovny as a conspiracy theorist and Jerry Stiller as Zoolander's conflicted manager.A remarkable aspect of the film is the huge amount of cameos, with over 30 celebrities making brief appearances. There's an interesting tension here in that celebrities were drawn into what is, ultimately, a brutal critic of the American celebrity culture and worship of images. That said, ZOOLANDER has become surprisingly dated in the few years since I last saw it, as many of those late 1990s/early millennium celebrities which it uses to build its case are now practically forgotten. I would have rated this rather higher only five or six years ago, but now the movie feels painfully awkward at times.If there is one aspect of the film that has stayed fresh, it's Owen Wilson's Hansel. This character is in some ways quite similar to that which Wilson played in THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, which appeared the same year, but is distinct enough to not just be a retread. Wilson has got a real gift for coming up with these eccentric freespirited types, often aloof from their surroundings because they are stoned or on hallucinogens. And sure, ZOOLANDER still has a lot of funny dialogue, and the audience can pleasantly sense how much fun Stiller, Wilson and Ferrell had while shooting it, but this isn't an especially great film and even its prominence in pop culture seems to be on the wane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie for those who have a sense of humor. It makes fun of models. The characters are great. Ben Stiller's character, Derek Zoolander, is full of himself. He's the biggest name in the modeling world, and he knows it. He wears all white and gives a press conference/eulogy at a funeral, and he competes against another model in a "walk off." Will Ferrell from Saturday Night Live plays a bad guy named Mugatu. Mugatu has funny hair, dresses like he's from another planet, and behaves as if he's out of his mind. Best of all is a character named Hansel McDonald, who's played by Owen Wilson. This guy rides around on a fold-up scooter. When he's not riding, he carries it around on his back. To ride, he takes it off his back like Robin Hood would an arrow, and he quickly unfolds it like a pro. Some of his lines are hilarious. He shares his pad with some pretty exotic people. This film is loaded with cameo appearances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If we define comedy as the genre of movies dedicated to making people laugh, then Zoolander is probably one of the best comedies of all times. At least for me.But beware - this movie may not satisfy most viewers. You'll need to know at least the fashion industry basics if you are to be amused by the wacky insane plot involving top models, sweatshops, lots of vanity and a global conspiracy to murder the prime minister of Malesia (or "the Klamatian dude", to quote one of the funniest lines in the script). If you've ever met models, read trendy fashion magazines or had the opportunity to attend fashion shows' after parties, you'll be screaming with hysterical laughter from the opening scene until the end. If you weren't that (un)lucky in your life, you might find the movie a wee bit silly and not entirely too amusing.I saw Zoolander for the first time with several friends. One of them worked as a fashion photographer, the other as his producer - they were absolutely delighted, and started using quotes from the movie in daily life. The others were not so impressed - they hardly laughed during the movie, and at all the wrong places as well.Well, excuse me, but I think I'll be having an Orange Mocha Frapuccino now.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a scheming fashion designer named Mogatu unleashes a plot to assonate the Prime Minister of Milasia he brainwashes male model Derek Zoolander to do the job for him. With three of today's most promising comedic talents (Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson) you would expect a lot more than this but hey what can you do? What we have here is a parody of the fashion industry that will prove hilarious to some and painfully stupid to others, but who can honestly say that they wouldn't want their children going to the Derek Zoolander Centre for Kid who can't Read Good? Much to goofy to be a smart satire although it has some very smart scenes, one in which male models are made out to be more like apes than men, or when Derek inquires that you don't spend a week in a d-a-i-y-e spa, funny stuff. Ben Stiller is hilariously stupid as Zoolander, Owen Wilson is equally as stupid and funny as Hansel, Zoolander's competition who seems to be parodying Doors front man Jim Morrison more than a male supermodel. The film features hundreds of cameos from all of today's hottest starts. You can catch a glimpse of everyone from Fabio To John Voight. You may hate yourself in the mourning but Zoolander proves to be pretty darn funny while it lasts as long as logic is not required.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>God help me, I love movies about dumb guys, and this one is definitely a dumb-guy classic. And believe it or not, it's all rather good-natured humor. I'd say it's the best Ben Stiller movie I've seen so far, just edging out "Meet the Parents" and not a gross-out flick like "Something About Mary." OK, it's totally silly and frivolous, but it's silliness and frivolity at it's best. The best scenes are the brainwashing segment and the "walkoff" between Zoolander and Hansel with David Bowie as referee. And it's great to see Ben and his dad working together.</fullReview>

Ben Stiller is excellent as Derek Zoolander, and Owen Wilson is an absolute riot as Zoolander's rival, Hansel. The situation is so far fetched that it's simply perfect for the movie. The modeling sequences make the film, E! has nothing on this film. Will Ferrell is the perfect fit as the "evil" fashion designer. Stiller's performance as an ignorant male model is classic. This is one of Stiller's better films. The celebrity appearances are great, thankfully Ms.Garafelo doesn't make an appearance. What other movie has gasoline fights, fashionable Russian assassins (Milla Jovovich), and the 80s hit "Relax"? If this is male modeling....where do I sign up?</fullReview>

Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), an immensely famous yet immensely dumb male model at the end of his career, is brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia, by one of the only people who never hired him, Mugatu (Will Ferrell). So he needs the help of TIME reporter Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor), and rival model Hansel (Owen Wilson) to help keep him from destroying the prime minister. With great performances from all the actors, including Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's mentor, this will be remembered as a classic (at least by me)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond the Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is undeniable that Zoolander (2001) was meant to act as a comedy and to portray numerous satirical views on life, however, there may be an underlying meaning hidden behind all of the foolishness. The director, writer, and star of the film, Ben Stiller, may have intended to teach everyone a lesson through the humor that he created. Although the reason that most people enjoy this film is simply because of its tendency to keep you laughing, there may in fact be a message being communicated. By taking a humanistic approach to the evaluation of this movie, we can find the statement that it is trying to make about society.The protagonist, Derek Zoolander, is a male-model and throughout the entire movie, there are satirical moments where his stupidity is made evident. Some may believe that Zoolander only speaks towards the actions of models, however, it is directed to all of those who let society tell them what they can and cannot do. Initially, Ben Stiller portrayed Derek as a hopeless person that merely followed conformity rather than actually using his own brain. A fashion designer named Jacobim Mugatu, realized that he could easily brainwash Derek into murdering the Prime Minister of Malaysia. This part of the movie clearly exposes the fact that he can be pushed around and told what to do, however, as the film nears its end, Derek becomes his own person. He becomes conscious of the fact that he has been brainwashed and he ultimately saves the Malaysian Prime Minister from his death.In creating this movie, Ben Stiller was trying to make a statement. He was trying to show that everyone should use their own mind, and should not try to live off of anybody else's; especially since Derek essentially performed a great deed after gaining his independence. By evaluating the film, a critic would notice that beyond the hilarity, there is a great moral significance which communicates a better understanding of life. Zoolander simply proves that anyone can make an impact on the world if they would legitimately use their head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has a somewhat unlikely hero, a male supermodel named Derek Zoolander. He will eventually be programmed by evil-doers to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia. He really isn't too bright, and his stunning beauty is apparent only to himself and a surprising number of admirers ("He's almost ... too good looking", "It's like there's a light around him") who don't notice that his special facial expressions, his "looks", are all identical. He loses a model contest to a rival, Hansel, but doesn't notice, and accepts the prize anyway. By the time his faux pas reaches Time magazine's cover, he is becoming aware that all is not well. There's lots of wacky and grossly outrageous humor, situations, and action in the film, which only loses momentum a bit before the climactic wild and zany grunge fashion show scene, with Derek alternately hyper-athletically modeling, and trying to murder the Prime Minister. When shown a model of a school he proposes to establish for children who don't read too good, Derek hurls it to the floor; even he knows it has to be at least three times bigger for anyone to fit inside! If you get a laugh from that, you'll probably like the movie. Ben Stiller as Derek may be the chief actor whose personality and ability make this film watchable and enjoyable. The DVD has some funny outtakes, and an excellent short on modeling from the Derek Zoolander University of Modeling for Men. (Tip: while on the runway, don't be distracted by celebrities to the left and right of you; pretend you're wearing blinders, "like a cow".)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the surface this looks like the stupidest comedy ever conceived, but in actuality it's... well, actually it's every bit as dumb as it seems, but it's also inconceivably hilarious. Loaded up with eyeball-rolling gags and perfectly-timed celebrity cameos, it's overstuffed with stream-of-consciousness satire and the very best veins of Ben Stiller's unchained sense of humor. Stiller's ironic crosshairs wave all over the place, landing precise jabs at society, fashion, politics and celebrity while still finding time to keep the ridiculous primary narrative in motion. Owen Wilson is flawless as Zoolander's flaky new-wave rival Hansel (he's so hot right now) and Will Ferrell makes the most of a criminally-brief amount of screen time in his own inimitable way. I was blown away by how creatively funny this was the first time I sat down with it, and I'm equally amazed with how well it's held up over the ensuing eleven years. The laughs simply do not stop coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is yet another disappointment in a long list of poor movies released in the last few months. I saw "What's the worst that could happen" last week--I should have read between the lines: Zoolander. From the opening scenes I could see that this movie was going to insult my intelligence. Of course, I would never have bought a ticket knowingly to this movie, so I was prepared for anything, but I could take only 30 minutes of this trash. I gave it a chance and them after the fiftieth glare into the camera by Stiller and having my senses assaulted by the obnoxious 'mugambo' (or something like that) I walked out. As usual the Austrian audiences loved it. Seems the weirder the movie, the more they like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Man It's Exhausting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson) are the worlds greatest two models. And nobody in the world could play them quite like Stiller and Wilson. Stiller was also a writer and the director of Zoolander and knows how to put together a movie. While the movie often focuses on Derek and Hansel out modelling each other, I believe the real contest was off screen being played out on screen between the two. This being who could play the more sarcastic and larger than life model. Stiller may win this, but the sheer arrogance of Wilson's on screen demeanor tips the scale in his favour for me. When the two work together they are up there with the great duo's of comedy.This is far from Stiller's best work however, moving along a little too slowly at times. Having said this it is still well worth a look and should give you plenty of laughs providing you appreciate the Stiller Wilson combo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Underwhelming (Warning, stream of consciousness)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, Zoolander. I'm really unimpressed so far. There a couple of good moments, but I'm not liking the main point. To be fair, I could just be a bit of a prude or whatever, but I'm not really feeling it. It doesn't help that this movie has been hyped to all hell. I mean, I could definitely get into a movie like Anchorman, but it's pretty simplistic and whatnot. I mean, not a really fan of any of the characters. Derek has some good qualities, in his desire to help the children, but it just seems like an easy way to make him a somewhat relatable character, and abandon it early after it brings him back. The backstory with his family seems pretty predictable, though I'm sure they'll do something with it by the end. Hansel is kind of a cool guy I guess, but there's not much to him. Also, Derek and Hansel are so dumb, it kind of takes away from the plot. I mean, the whole computer joke was telegraphed to all hell, though it didn't help that it's part of the movie that I believe I've seen before. Matilda's there, for some reason. I mean, just to kind of give that one lady her "lady comeuppance," and that is kind of stupid. I mean, also for some weird bulimia jokes, some no sex jokes, and for Derek. I mean, I don't want to get SJW on this, but not exactly gonna pass any Bechdel tests (or just the 1, I guess). With Maury running around, none of the women have a particularly nice time of it anyway, I guess. Will Ferrell is probably the best part, and he's only all right.If nothing else, the plot is kind of fun. I mean, it's interesting at least. And some of the jokes work pretty well; probably the best would be Will Ferrell's crazy dancing in the hypnotizing scene, and during the credits as well. The quotable ones were possibly the most disappointing, though. "Crazy Pills," and "a building for ants," were pretty telegraphed for those who knew it was coming, and if you didn't know about them from general internet culture, I feel as though they wouldn't be as significant or useful.As a last ditch effort, I'd like to try to gain some respect for it by putting myself in the shoes of the movie, and trying to see what the point/purpose/goal was, a la Movie Bob. To spitball, and see if I can find it, I could assume general entertainment, some satire, owed to the eating disorders, general vapid nature of the models, and corruption of the fashion industry. I don't know much about the time of this movie being out, but I can't really think of anything late 90s or early 00s. All in all, pretty underwhelming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Or does it? Some may think that is the case with the sequel, especially considering the voting it received here at IMDb. But let's stick with the original, that paved the way and/or elevated the career of those involved. The comedy trio in this do a great job selling their actually ridiculous roles and "looks".And by looks most do know what I mean, even if they haven't seen the movies. Zoolander and his facial expressions can almost be described as epic. As well as completely and utterly bad. If we would be talking about a quality or a class if you want to call it that, this movie would be slide ride under it. So lower your standards and enjoy a well executed and funny ride</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Both the Greatest and the Dumbest Comedy Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zoolander follows the male model Derek Zoolander as he embarks on a journey to discover who he truly is and is ultimately manipulated into doing something evil for the sake of another person. That plot synopsis was not very good, but with a movie like this it's hard to get one that is. Zoolander is a very odd movie. The humor is very goofy and dumb, but it's also very good and pretty clever at times. It's easy to laugh at and enjoy, and it truly is just a weird movie. As far as character depth and plot development goes, this movie does lack. It doesn't show during the movie because it's clear that this is kind of it's intention. It's not trying to be a masterpiece, it's just trying to make you laugh. And it does just that. I don't wish that it'd been deeper or anything, either. With a movie like this that simply wouldn't make any sense. Every time it did 'go deeper' that moment was immediately shot down by some goofy joke, further proving that the movie was trying to be anything but deep or emotional.Overall Zoolander is a lot of fun. It's very funny in a dumb and goofy way. While nothing about it is particularly deep or developed, it's clear that it's not supposed to be. And that's not a bad thing. It was made to entertain and that's what it did. In the end I would recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to watch the first movie before going to see the second. I'm hearing mixed reviews about Zoolander 2 but I don't care. I'm still going to watch it. I heard it flopped and that is a good thing because it means they're not going to make a Zoolander 3. Zoolander was meant to be a stand alone film. Anyway, what can I say to review this film? It is a comedic classic that stands the test of time. You'll have a grin on your face for most of the movie. The one part that was a little played out was the scene were Zoolander and Hansel are looking for files inside the computer and slapping it around like apes. The joke goes on for a few seconds longer than it should have but that's about it. The only negative thing I have to say about this movie, which has been quoted by me maybe over a million times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is as silly as it is funny. Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a fashion icon who's stupidity matches his Blue Steel looks. His competition, Hansel (Owen Wilson) ends up winning VH1's model of the year award, beating Derek to a fourth time. A small blip in Derek's career throws him off the rails. It's all hilariously ludicrous, and it (almost) pains me to admit, because this comedy is quite an average film made good by its gags and cameos. Zoolander's brain-washed, by the evil guru Mugatu (Will Ferrell), to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Take it with a pinch of salt, there's much to enjoy if the mind's in the right place, with the fashion face-off between Derek and Hansel, and Derek's accidental award pick-up standing out the most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually a very clever and smartly executed comedy revolving around dumb characters. I just found this film to be amusing and I had a smirking or chuckling most of the way through the first time I saw it. Ben Still is actually really good at making these comedic movies. So the movie is revolves around a very exaggerated male modeling. With most of the humor coming from mocking models and the modeling career. How models are dumb and so superficial, which can actually offend some real models out there if they don't have a sense of humor about it. But than again, there are plenty of movies that bash on handicap people and overweight people. Where it has that it's funny cause he or she is fat kind of ordeal. But in this, it's funny cause he is so dumb and lack common sense type of humor. Which has been done many times before as well. However the way the humor connects so well with each scenario is what makes this movie really work as a comedy. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the first time around and I am currently looking forward to the sequel.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will start off by saying that I didn't particularly like or dislike Zoolander the first time I watched it a few years back now, I don't know I just thought it was pretty daft and pointless. Now having seen it numerous times it gets funnier and funnier with each viewing to the point that I'm laughing even before the jokes arrive.A clueless fashion model Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is brainwashed into assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia in order to stop him banning child labour laws that the fashion world needs for cheap materials. With the help of a female journalist and his male model rival Hansel (Wilson) can he hold out?One of the best thing about the film is the writing it is clever, smart and witty, with jokes abound and many quotable lines ( The "Is this a centre for ants" scene is hilarious) . What's also great is the ludicrousness of it all that every actor and cameo (And there are many Bowie maybe being the best) goes along with it and gets into it. Its played with a certain tongue in cheek from the main cast that the stupidity never gets irritating. Many references from other movie including a particularly stupid 2001 sequence.One of the best comedy's of this type, dumb comedy to which there are plenty most of which are not great with a few exceptions. It's extremely daft, with no real emphasis on plot but a film that gets funnier with each viewing. Extremely enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is filled with all kids of jokes, and little moments that just make you laugh. It's a really funny comedy. It's the end of Derek Zoolander's (Ben Stiller) fashion career as a male model due to a negative news story by journalist Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) and increasing rivalry with fellow male model Hansel McDonald (Owen Wilson). Meanwhile fashion industry moguls Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) and Katinka Ingabogovinanana (Milla Jovovich) are plotting to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia because he opposes child labor. Because they need a dimwit who won't protest, Mugatu chooses Derek to be the assassin. Matilda meanwhile investigates the shady business to save Derek. The movie is just nonstop jokes throughout and it's an overall hilarious movie. The characters are all great. Derek, Hansel, and Mugatu are all especially funny. It's a good flick so if you have some extra time on your hands give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never heard of this before, until the sequel was announced a few weeks ago. I was enjoying it and I was laughing, I wouldn't call it a favorite or fantastic movie. I would actually just call it a movie to watch if you need a laugh or just plain bored!It was very surprising to see some of Ben Stillers family members including his wife Christine Taylor playing his love interest in the movie. She is gorgeous and I honestly think Ben Stiller definitely doesn't look like his father, Jerry Stiller. You wouldn't think they are father/son team. You would think they are just plain random actors acting together! Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller honestly make a great team but without the fake 'cool' accents and mention sexual jokes made the movie a bit distasteful. Especially the threesome scene made me cringe even though I know it's comedy! I think if they just be themselves and less sex jokes, they would've got a 9 or 10 star rating for this movie! It's an alright film but we'll see if I can watch the sequel..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander (2001): Dir: Ben Stiller / Cast: Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Christine Taylor, Will Ferrell, Milla Jovovich: Ben Stiller plays supermodel Derek Zoolander who is the best in the business with his latest fashion called Magnum. He is on top of his game until Hanszel wins male model of the year. Now they are engaged in a bitter feud, which involves a competition where they both yank their underwear out of their pants. Enter Christine Taylor who is attempting to uncover an assassination plot where male models are brainwashed into committing the crime. This all climaxes with extreme stupidity but Stiller succeeds in creating a film that is far different than his Reality Bites with obvious inspiration of Austin Powers. It is obvious that he researched his subject matter and took aim at the sometimes pompus world of the fame seeking. Stiller as Zoolander seeks appreciation from his father as well as retain his public dignity. Owen Wilson steals his spotlight as Hanszel. Taylor is a mere prop with hinted romantic intentions. Will Ferrell is hilarious as the villain with outrageous hair. Milla Jovovich plays Ferrell's evil henchwoman, which is just as well since she has done the Resident Evil films. The climax is sidelined by numbing violence meant for humor but is merely just corny. Good concept satires the world of modeling with colorful production but it still wallows in stupidity.

		<shortDescription>Zoolander was ridiculously good-looking. A must-watch comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who would have thought that a stupid comedy about a clueless fashion model, being brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia would be so hilarious!? Who would had thought, that years later, that film would be popular enough to get garter a sequel? Nobody thought that in the late 90s. When the character of Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) was first create in a series of Russell Bates, TV Shorts for the 1996/1997 VH1 Fashion Awards. It only reach, moderated success as a minor hit. When Zoolander was released to theaters, it was two weeks after 9/11 &amp; no one was going to the movie theaters in fear of a terrorist attack. If they did, they weren't going to see, a comedy based on three year old TV short, that barely noticeable. There was a lot of fear that this movie would indeed flop. Director, Writer, and Producer, Ben Stiller was even, asked by the studios to push back the release date, because they felt that nobody would bother watching it. Instead, Stiller didn't push it, because he thought that people of the America needed a laugh after so much misery. He really stood his ground on the subject &amp; released it, regardless if it makes money or not. In the end, his risky decision really did paid off, as the film was a box office success as many saw his absurdity satire on the fashion industry, funny as hell! For me, personally, I have to agree, Zoolander is a really fun watch. I love the movie, at the time and after rewatching it, years later. I still found it to be, very funny. The movie has a lot of very quotable dialogue and the slapstick humor that became so memorable. Even, the most hilarious of body language pose, 'Blue Steel', later become popular, as the notorious duckface look in the selfie generation. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, I was never a huge fan of fashion, but I have to say, Ben Stiller's performance as the blank-faced, slack-jawed, self-obsessed male model is one of his better movie characters. He made me, want to see this film. He was very funny as the clueless, wash up model. His co-star, Owen Wilson, not so much. Wilson was alright as the new male model Hansel taking Zoolander's runway; however, his character is somewhat, underdeveloped. I just wish, the movie had some better jokes for him. At least, he wasn't annoying. I like how, this movie serves as one of the very first, main-stream Ben Stiller &amp; Owen Wilson's joint comedies. They both were able, to play off each other's strengths, to the point, that their on-screen chemistry, became, somewhat of a marketing tool for their later films. As much, as I love the two leads, the supporting characters, the frat pack and celebrity cameos were just as good. Christine Taylor as Zoolander's love interest, Matilda Jeffries &amp; Jerry Stiller as Zoolander's manager, Maury Ballstein was alright in their roles, but if I had to pick one; that outshine them all, it would be Will Ferrell as Jacobim Mugatu, the film's villain. He was so comical. He have the right amount of body language and dialogue timing to make every scene work. I never laugh so hard at his work, before then. He really show, that he can carry a film, after this performance. Glad, their original choice, Andy Dick drop out. Gees that would be horrible! Anyways, the music in this film is also a great treat. It's nice, rehearing songs like 'Relax" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood &amp; 'Wake me up before you go, go" by Wham. It plays so well, with the scenes, it's surround with. I also love, how much the movie does shout outs to director, Stanley Kubrick, with all the film references such like Derek's brainwashing sequence which mirrors 1971's A Clockwork Orange &amp; Derek and Hansel imitate the "Dawn of Man" sequence in 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey, complete with the soundtrack playing 'Sprach Zarathustra'. I also, like how whole movie is clearly inspired by the 1962's The Manchurian Candidate. What a classic movie! However, some people believe that Zoolander was more of a rip-off of the 1998 satirical novel, Glamorama by author Bret Easton Ellis. I do have agree with those critics. The similarities between the two media sources are a bit jarring to say the least. No wonder, why Ellis attempted to take legal action against the film. Glad, both parties were able to settle out of court. Still, the movie had some other troubles. The film was never shown in Malaysia, the country mentioned in the film, as it is depicted, the country as impoverished and dependent on child labor's sweatshops. Not only that; but the plot of trying to assassinated the prime minister of Malaysia seem too dark for the country. Malaysia's censorship board deemed, the film definitely unsuitable and banned it. Nevertheless, a certain amount of people from Malaysia has gone on, to watch it, and enjoy it. However, there are somethings that didn't work with Zoolander, for me, personally. I didn't like how the film didn't fix loose ends. Honestly, whatever did happen to shadowy evil council who have been killing world leaders for decades? Also, what did happen to J.P Prewitt (David Duchovny)? There are just, too much questions, this movie didn't answer. Overall: Not only listen to your friend Billy Zane. He's a cool dude, but listen to me, check out Zoolander. You'll be laughing your head off, for sure. It's a great comedy masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outrageous, typical 2000's humour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander is a dim-witted, but well meaning male model who is brainwashed into a plot to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Zoolander is typical early 2000's comedy: a plot that could have easily been written by an 8 year old with an over-active imagination, cheesy and predictable humour and interesting fashion statements. It's a ridiculous but fun movie. It's one of those movies that you can pull out on a rainy day for sh**s and giggles. But at the same time, it's not overly hilarious of its own accord. You laugh because the movie is silly, not because the jokes are ingeniously funny. It's completely random, it's full of plot holes and stereotypes, and overall - it's a stupid film, but it means well. I can see why it has such a cult following, but it didn't have me rolling on the floor laughing by any means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) finds his life turned upside down when he fails to defend his male model of the year title (losing to Hansel - Owen Wilson). However, Derek's life seemingly takes a turn for the better when he's hired by Mugatu (Will Ferrell), but Mugatu isn't who he seems to be and it turns out that he intends to hypnotise Derek to get him to kill the President Of Malaysia.Despite the stupidity of the premise, this could have actually stood a chance. The storyline is daft, but to its credit it is at least original and fairly imaginative. Ben Stiller and his co-writers also got the characterisations of the models right; both Zoolander and Hansel are self-absorbed, shallow, and unintelligent which are very much the given clichs for models. This is all well and good, but what the film lacks is any real laughs (I don't think I laughed once). The humour that did exist wrapped around the same concepts (the models being self-absorbed, shallow and unintelligent) and it got to the point where it became tiresome and uninteresting.I was also surprised about the casting of Owen Wilson as a model. Whilst Stiller isn't that convincing either Wilson is less believable given the fact that his nose looks like it's been smashed with a hammer about a dozen times. I wouldn't mention any of this if the idea of them being the two best looking men around was something that was merely a figment of their imaginations, but the fact that we're genuinely meant to go along with this means that it lacks some of the irony that I'm sure that Stiller and co were striving for. Sticking with performances I found Will Ferrell to be not funny here and too much most of the time. Everyone else was OK, but there weren't any standout performances. This film is probably best remembered for the numerous cameos that are seen here and yes they're fun for a bit, but it gets to the point where spotting the cameos starts to lose its appeal.Zoolander has a promising and original idea, but sadly the material isn't great and the result is a film with very few laughs. Most attempts at humour are either predictable or simply not funny. Many of the performances are over the top and irritating (particularly Will Ferrell who was unbearable). To its credit, Zoolander does have quite a good, positive end to it, but unfortunately it has far too much working against it and is a film that is best avoided.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun comedy from Stiller and company</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zoolander" stands out in Ben Stiller's sometimes uneven film career as one of his most memorable movies. In it, he plays title character Derek Zoolander, a dimwitted male model whose career is on the decline. Disillusioned with the business, he seeks to do something meaningful with his life but instead becomes a pawn in an assassination plot.The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and is definitely slanted more towards dumb humour. That isn't to say that the screenplay is lowbrow but rather that it utilizes the cluelessness of its lead characters for much of its humour. It's also worth noting that there are a number of memorable quotes throughout the course of the movie.I find Stiller's portrayal of Zoolander to be a bit broad for my taste but it is an effective characterization nonetheless. Owen Wilson is much more natural as Zoolander's rival Hansel. The two have good comedic chemistry together and also work well with female lead Christine Taylor. Will Ferrell is memorable as outlandish designer Mugatu and so are Milla Jovovich, David Duchovny &amp; Jon Voight in smaller roles. The movie also features a number of celebrity cameos, including notable ones from David Bowie &amp; Billy Zane.Behind the camera, Stiller's direction is nicely handled and more focused on comedic effect than flashy visuals. That being said, the cinematography, costumes &amp; production design combine to give the movie a vibrant look. The soundtrack is also well chosen.Ultimately, "Zoolander" may not be a masterpiece of sophisticated comedy but it is a fun (and funny) movie with memorable performances and an entertaining script. I'm not sure if there's really a need for the sequel that's currently in development but the original is certainly worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is one of those popular comedies that have divided many audiences. Most people will either like Zoolander and enjoy themselves, others may find it average, and other may say Zoolander is an overrated comedy and dislike it to bits. I thought it was disappointing and overrated, although there were some funny moments.Basically Zoolander is about dimwitted male model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) who has lost his crown as #1 male model to the brash Hansel (Owen Wilson). Derek Zoolander finds that his fame, friends and fortune disappear until Mugatu (Will Farrell) hires Zoolander to turn his career around but instead brainwashes him to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Can Zoolander prevent the incident as well as recapture his fame? The movie also has an all star cast including Christine Taylor (Ben Stiller's wife), Jerry Stiller (Ben Stiller's father in real life), David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Milla Jovovich, and a non-stop array of cameos including Donald Trump, Christian Slater, Heidi Klum, Paris Hilton, Claudia Schiffer and many more celebrities who appear as themselves.Basically to sum up Zoolander, what you see is what you get. You can enjoy yourself and leave your brain at the door, or you may not care for it at all. It really depends on what mood you are in.I thought it was just average and a bit on the overrated side.5/10.</fullReview>

Well I can Honestly say that I will Not get those 89 minutes back.Basically this is another film of a comedy dream team known as Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Generally their films are quite delightful and very funny. My favorites are Meet The Parents, Meet The Fockers(Little Fockers is not on there because that was a Bad Movie), and Starsky And Hutch. Although this movie was not a good one to sign up to.The movie follows a very popular Male model played by Ben Stiller who has a little competition with another male model played by Owen Wilson. That brings me to my first problem of the film they fight on screen for about 1 minute and then say Hey lets be friends which is really stupid.While all of this is happening There is a very strange character played by Will Ferrel who wants to destroy the world of male modeling(in my eyes he is the hero of this movie).Now I don't completely hate this film. I laughed at Will Ferrels performance through the whole film and the tiny cell phone gag was pretty funny.My biggest problem with this film is that Zoolanders weakness is( and I am not joking here) that he can't turn left. That has got to be the stupidest weakness and running joke I have ever seen in a film. This movies story doesn't really make sense and the film just tries to hard for laughs, but the cast is very good. I don't really recommend it but it's not that bad either. This is kind of like a time waster movie that you have on in the background.This is a message to my 6th grade teacher: I don't hate the film it just could have done better. And you are going to be happy when you read this because in the year 2014 there is going to be a Zoolander 2 which for me is going to be awful but for you a dream come true. So now that I rethought about Zoolander Could you give Pulp Fiction another try? Rated PG-13 FOn Appeal For Sexual Content And Drug References.1hr 29min/89min.**/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wacky, stylishly goofy comedy on the fashion industry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In about 1997 a new genre was invented with the coming of `Austin Powers'. While it was a spoof of such, it wouldn't be considered in the same vein as the ZAZ/ Mel Brooks movies. And after hits like `Scary Movie' and flops like `Scary Movie 2', the latest in line is `Zoolander'. And this is easily as funny, if not funnier, than the second two `Austin Powers' movies. Written, directed and headlined by Ben Stiller, this was quite a hat trick to pull off. But the job was done and a good job at that. At the same time, this is hardly groundbreaking material. And in retrospect it's only laughing gas.From some perspectives this is a satire on the style-crazy fashion industry in the same light as `Pret-a-Porter'. But the film is too stupid and inaccurate to be truly realistic, so this is best thought as a just-for-fun barrel of gags. As is the usual case, when the jokes hit they can be hilarious. But when they miss, they leave you staring blankly at the screen. And it does get a little carried with itself towards the end as it becomes to hip and trendy for all tastes. A slightly limp third act is well compensated for by hilarious proceedings. The central plot of the attempted assassination of the Prime Minister of Malaysia is a mere skeleton for the plot to stick to, and hardly the strongest point. But again, this isn't to be taken seriously. The character of Derek Zoolander represents the vapid male model of today and is hilariously portrayed by Ben Stiller. In most of his other comedies (`Meet the Parents', `There's something about Mary') he played the protagonist who is the subject of the jokes, and it's great to finally see him as the antagonist as he has a good flair for comedy. Particularly funny is his part as a merman in the informecial for water. As the over-flamboyant opposition, Owen Wilson has rarely been funnier. Will Ferrell's obnoxious fashion designer Mugatu is a half-realised character. He starts out funny but towards the end becomes increasingly annoying. The rest of the support is decent all round from Christine Taylor, Milla Jovovich, John Voight and David Duchovny among others including a host of celebrity cameos.The real star is the script that holds many memorable one-liners. And while many of the lines are delivered with impeccable gusto, others just fall flat. A good example is the classic `You can't think for yourself' `You're right, I can't' line. It isn't bad, but it's been used many times before and seems a little slack when attempted here. While it is shapeless, absurd and just as shallow as the subject matter itself, `Zoolander' is also one of the funniest movies around at the moment. If you want a good `stupid' comedy `Zoolander' is a passive and entertaining bit of gas. Just don't expect anything else. My IMDb rating: 6.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In reading the comments I note something I've known for a long time: many people have a tin ear for satire. They just don't get it. Perhaps the movie ratings should include a "CONTAINS SATIRE" warning?Ah, well, not every movie is good for every viewer. Sure it's not the best movie ever made (what movie is?) but this is a pure satire. Someone else said it well ... this movie is "part by part" funny. It really is. And as a satirical construct, in places it is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander/ ** 1/2 starsFor once a movie was as good as I expected, and better than others expected. Zoolander was just hilarious, I mean if you think about it, it was really dumb, but in a good way. It's not often that you enjoy a movie that is so dumb, but Zoolander seemed to pull it off.Stiller is once again great in this movie, much like he was in There's Something About Mary. Stiller seems to add so much more humor to movies, and he also makes them so much better, I hope he stars in a lot more movie in the future, seeing as he is such a good actor.Wilson was also really funny in this movie, I was glad to see him in this role as Hansel, he made the movie a lot better. It seems as though Stiller and Wilson star in a lot of movies together, which is a good thing since they are both really funny.Zoolander is a male model who used to be on the top, but with Hansel career rising, he is on the bottom. But a leading fashion designer needs Zoolander to be trained to kill the prime minister of Malaysia, and when the Fashion Awards show comes on, he will be triggered and can't be stopped.A really hilarious movie, not quite up there with There's Something About Mary, but still achieves being funny. Hopefully we see more comedies yet from Wilson and Stiller.</fullReview>

I had a similar experience with 'Austin Powers: Int'l Man of Mystery', which I think is wickedly funny. I can spot just about every Bond reference.Here, Ferrell and Owen were particularly funny.This movie does not try and pretend to be anything other than a silly comedy. And I think Stiller's comedic talents were perfectly showcased. I just hope he doesn't go Hollywood and try to make a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>come on! yes, the movie was goofy. yes, the movie was dumb. and yes, the movie was dumb AND stupid - but thats the whole point. to everyone who says that they hated this movie, i wonder if they have any sense of humor at all. maybe instead of harboring this strange resentment against the ridiculous jokes and names and acting, everyone should lighten up. zoolander is not an intellectual comedy, but it was never advertised as such. from the the start the ad campaign was basically "this movie = dumb." will ferrell was awesome. i understand that not everyone is a will ferrell fan, but mugatu is the most extraordinarily funny character in a long time. and ben stiller did a good job, too. you knew he'd be a dumb model and he did that well, while also adding a distinctly ben stiller something to the role. and jerry stiller! granted, he was similar to his seinfeld role, but without him the movie would not have been as whole. the character of katinka was somewhat unnecessary, but you can't always get what you want, as mick once sang. the point is, if you just stop waiting to be impressed by some artsy, intellectual comedic think-piece, and stop hating the world for an hour and a half, this movie rules.

		<fullReview>I admit that the first time I saw this movie, I didn't like it one bit. I thought it was dumb, not funny and annoying. But the more I watch it, the more I love it! it is really funny once you shut your brain down and enjoy it.it's about a super-dumb male model, Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) who has been brain-washed by Jacobin Mugatu (Will Ferrell) to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. The plot is interesting, and the dialogs are pretty clever. The performances were pretty good as well, Ben Stiller was good as Zollander, I mean he makes you feel annoyed over him, which i think was the whole point, considering that Derek is the most stupid guy ever! There were some pretty good performances from Christine Taylor, Jerry Stiller, Milla Jovovich and of course Owen Wilson. But the best actor in this movie is definitely Will Ferrell, he cracks me up as Mugatu, and steals every single scene! Another great thing about this comedy is all the celebrities! We get to see Christian Slater, Nataly Portman, David Bowie, Steve Kmetko, Fred Durst, etc.... It really gave it a touch. The direction was fairly good. The music was really good, it has lots and lots of good songs.I think that somebody who enjoys a good comedy, and doesn't question every single thing; the you should see this movie. If you are the kind of movie watcher who sees a movie only to find mistakes, then do not see it! I give it a **** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people butchered this film for it's "stupidity". What is stupidity in films? For me, it's lack of proper filmaking. Bad script, terrible direction, etc. However, in this case people are probably refering to the jokes made. This film is rather well- made. Ben Stiller doesn't know much about filmaking but he does a solid job as a director and an excellent job as a writer. This film can also be viewed from a satire point of view as displaying the downright absurdity of male modeling. There is actual acting required to do this film. Acting like a moron, a genius, whatever, acting is acting. Ben Stiller leads this comically stellar class with a refined performance as Derek Zoolander, who may be a bit of an idiot but he still has a heart. Will Ferell provides excellent support as the evil Mugatu, whose plans are somewhat baffling yet make sense. Also noteworthy is Owen Wilson, who I found to do the least best job of acting, he was a bit too over- the- top in his character's sillyness. The music is very cool 80's style with some great songs like "Call Me" and "Everyone's Working for the Weekend". Sure, this film may not go down in history as one of the best films ever made. Yes, some of the jokes fall flat, Ben Stiller's direction isn't amazing, but this film is still an entertaining experience. Not for those looking for a deep film, but it's still enjoyable. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 Question Quiz to determine whether you'll like Zoolander or not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>it seems like people are completely split about his one. Either they love it or they hate it. I, for myself, had so much laughs in this one, that I even ordered it on DVD ... As some of my favourite directors are Kubrik, Kitano and Greenaway and I'm generally considered by my friends to be a film-snob, I had to wonder WHY I found Zoolander so entertaining, while thinking that 'meet the parents' was ... ~mostly adequate~.if you laughed during at least one of these Monty Python sketches, chances are you won't be disappointed by Zoolander (you might not absolutely love it, but you probably won't hate it at all)* the 'Is you wife a'goer' sketch (wink wink nudge nudge)* the 'English Upper Class Twit Contest' sketch * the french cursing at the englishman in 'Monty Python and the holy grail'* also from The Holy Grail : the Llamas credits * and, while we're at it, the troyan elk scene from the same moviehmm ... Zoolander is, in essence, as silly as the silliest of the MP sketches. MP did some extremely intelligent sketches in very silly ways (just to stay with the same source, the peasant scene and the witch scene in MP&amp;tHG are examples of witty social commentaries IMO), but you won't really find that in Ben Stiller's comedy. What you will find is complete sillyness and stupidity witch might carry some message, but ... well ... the stupidity overshadows it by far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I had seen Zoolander for sale at stores, it wasn't until both XBox Nation and The Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine gave it glowing reviews that I decided to rent the Zoolander DVD.Ben Stiller is a great actor trying to come out from the above-average product he's been in. He's due to do something grand in Hollywood and although this film has some laughs, this isn't his breakthrough.In this film, Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, the best male supermodel in the world. He recently lost his crown to the weirdly-snouted Hansel McDonald (Owen Wilson, complete with his Texas accent). Upset, he is used by a group led by a madman designer named Mugatu (Will Ferrell) to assasinate the leader of Malaysia because he plans to eliminate the child labour that produces all his clothing. Chrsitine Taylor plays a reporter who tries to unravel the conspiracy and save Zoolander from committing the deed.Stiller, who stars, directs, and co-wrote and co-produced this, delivers a nasally "Kids In The Hall" performance as the dumb Zoolander, as does Wilson as the naive Hansel. Jerry Stiller (who play's Zoolander's agent) plays Jerry Stiller. Will Ferrell is a hoot as Mugatu, with his crazy hair and antics. Christine Taylor is only in the film so Ben can show off to the people what a lovely wife he has. Milla Jovovich is wasted as the she-male with the James Bondian name.The film does have some good laughs and the movie is done in an 80's style with lots of music in the background, but even at 90 minutes, it starts to wear thin. You get annoyed by Ben's impersonation of Kevin McDonald of "KITH".This film is filled with tons of cameo appearances, including female supermodels who are the real people being spoofed because of their beauty on the outside, shallow and dumb on the inside persona. Also, the DVD contains tons of theatrical trailers, extended scenes, deleted scenes, out takes (including commentary by Stiller in the deleted stuff), an alternate credits film, some spoofs of modeling at the VH1 awards, and a music video. Quite a lot for a short film. Still, I believe that Stiller's best is still to come. I feel he can do some good in a dramatic role like he had in Reality Bites.</fullReview>

Maybe because I was expecting one stupid joke after another and so on like in Zucker/Zucker/Abrahms movie, those that you can't help to laugh like one of those idiots starring the movie. Or maybe Zoolander just isn't funny. No. I'll stick to the first option. Perhaps I had had a bad day. What's good about Zoolander are the characters and the female cast. And not to mention the amount of great cameos like Jon Voight and Vince Vaughn as Derek's father and brother, and David Duchovny as the deep-throat-anti-conspiracy-former-worlds-greatest-hand-model.If you like Ben Stiller as much as I do, Zoolander is a smart comedy funny sometimes, that you'll like. Just don't expect to laugh at your ass for 90 minutes, it's simply not enough.6/10</fullReview>

To look at, this movie looked like a pile of crud, I refused to see it at the theatre and only hired it at the last minute at the vid shop cause everything else was gone. Now I own a copy and make everyone I know watch it with me everytime they come over.Zoolander is a great movie purely intended for giggles and memorable lines. "orange mocha frappachino!" If you have previously enjoyed Ben Stiller movies along the lines of "ha ha hurty pain is funny. owwy that ball in my crotch, haha. lets strangle this dog n set fire to this cat" then dont bother seeing Zoolander, its just not the same. However if you have a sense of humour which doesnt revolve around maiming animals give it a go, its classic, culty n plenty of fun. Owen Wilson rocks in it but I could have done without Marsha Brady.

		<shortDescription>Not fulfilling it's true potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers!!!******Sorry for my not so great English***I liked the movie Zoolander, it wasn't a great movie and has some flaws, but overall it was a enjoyable experience watching the movie.Zoolander is about the male model industry. Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a legendary male model who made male modeling what it is today. He plays his part pretty convincing and is truly funny. Owen Wilson plays the part of Hansel, a young upcoming model and competitor of Derek. Christine Taylor plays Matilda Jeffries, a reporter for Time Magazine. Will Ferrell plays a great role as the bad guy of the movie, Mugatu, an evil fashion designer and former member of "Frankie goes to Hollywood" before the became famous with their huge hit "Relax" and then there's his female helper Milla Jovovich as Katinka Ingabogovinanana. All of these roles are played great by the actors. There are a lot of small roles who are played great as well. David Duchovny plays a former hand model :). Jon Voight plays Derek's mining father and Jerry Stiller plays Derek's Agent (or something like that). Lots of cameos are included too. Look for: Donald Trump, Christian Slater, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tommy Hilfiger, Natalie Portman, Fabio, Lenny Kravitz, Gwen Stefani, Heidi Klum, David Bowie, Fred Durst, Lil' Kim, Stephen Dorff, Claudia Schiffer, Billy Zane, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Winona Rider and probably lots of celebrities I didn't know.The music in the movie is great too. It has all those great eighties hits in it like the aforementioned relax, wake me up before you go-go etc. It has some nice sound effects in it too.Probably the best part of the movie is how it looks. The sets and environments look truly great. The clothing is absolutely brilliant and the hair of the actors and actresses is great too.The one, HUGE flaw the movie has is it's scenario. Although the male model idea is great it doesn't fulfill it's true potential. There are far to few (good) jokes in it as there should have been. I'm not saying it should be loaded with jokes as an over the top comedy but they could have put some more in it. The lack of jokes makes it an enjoyable movie but not merely funny enough. After the approximately 90 minutes you'll not be disappointed and think you've wasted your time but it's still not as good as it should have been.My score: 7/10</fullReview>

This movie is a pure entertainment, like Legally Blonde or Crazy About Mary or Meet The Parents. There's no big philosophy in those movies just because it never meant to be. I agree - there are some comedies that are funnier than others. Zoolander is one of the best comedies I've ever seen.

		<fullReview>Fruity fashion models that are bunch of airheads(I think too much gel caused their brain to not function properly.), fashion designer that's psycho(Will Ferrell playing as Jacobim Mugatu) yet also fruity. The characters are really weird and gets annoying at times but they are really funny. Christine Taylor(that was on "Hey Dude" on Nickelodeon, I watched that show when I was little) was like the only person in the movie that was normal. She was the one who had to keep saying stuff like "What are you guys talking about?" scenes which made some of the lame jokes funny. Her performance was great, a lot better then Wedding Singer. You can see Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are good friends in real life with this movie. They're really funny when they're on screen together. I can see where Ben Stiller gets his personalities, his real father was in this movie and acted weird like everyone else but had his funny moments. Will Ferrell is just too funny, he can act really stupid and yet still be really funny. He kept saying "Hansel is hot right now." when Hansel appeared and I couldn't stop laughing at that. Milla Jovovich? I thought she looked and performed better in Resident Evil.3 Fruity guys hosing themselves with gasoline and one lights a cigarette, when Derek Zoolander saw that he was screaming "Nooo". I guess Ben Stiller wasn't as stupid as those 3 knowing what would happen if you light a fire near gasoline. Mugatu should of hired one of those 3 to get brainwashed and get the prime minister. Oh well, just a thought.There's constant humor, some being beyond stupid and some being really funny. I really liked "The Cable Guy" and as much as Zoolander is stupid, it is pretty funny and gave us something new to watch so I enjoyed it. The movie is about 2 hours long but it goes by pretty fast. It has great music, a lot of celeberties, and some really funny scenes. I thought Ben Stiller did a good job directing again.A movie for laughs. If comedy movies stress you out then skip this.Overall Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was a little bit slow on some parts, but otherwise excellent. Ben Stiller did a great job in directing the film and starring in it. I suggest you see this film only if you can appreciate the humor in stupid situations. Derek Zoolander's (the main character) one liners and "bits of wisdom" are laugh-out-loud funny. Will Ferell was unusually dull, in my opinion. I wanted him to have a little more "oomph" to his character but we can't have it all. Nonetheless, it was a truly comedic "idiotic" film and I hope you will enjoy this movie as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was so-so, not a great spoof or comedy.It must be mentioned that Malaysia is not a poor country at all, like the movie says it is. Malaysia is a fairly advanced and rich country that has huge oil resources, besides rubber, tin and cocoa. I've visited Malaysia and by no means does it come across as an impoverished country. The film likely meant Indonesia which would qualify. Also, Indonesia has been referred to in news about exploited child labor - Nike, Kathie Lee etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first of all let me qualify this review by saying I hated Stiller's similar spoof film on comic book characters, Mystery Men, and movies like Dumb &amp; Dumber. I've also never seen his skits which this movie is based on. Make no mistake, this movie is stupid. Incredibly stupid. It's so stupid it's hilarious in my humble opinion. Stiller is hilarious, Owen Wilson is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, Ben's dad Jerry and Will Ferrel show us why they've been scene stealers on TV for years, and Ben's wife is there mainly to move the storyline along. This movie is no Dumb &amp; Dumber. It's not all fart jokes and immature humour, this is stupid humour, but it's a clever spoof on the modelling world that's realllllllly over the top. One of the funniest moments for me was the scene where Zoolander's model pals have a "gasoline fight" and accidentally immolate themselves (all to the horrid Wham tune "Wake me up before you go go"). Nope, this film is not for those who appreciate Woody Allen type comedy, but if you laugh at something that is so stupid that it's funny without really gross jokes, than see this film.PS. Don't worry about the plot. It's truly secondary to the idiocy of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is "ok", fun, an amusement. Though it does contain a couple of brilliant jokes (i.e. "Male Models having "Fun" at the Gas Station), basically the movie is aims very low. There are many idiotic childish jokes, which makes you feel sometimes uncomfortable, or may cause you regrets for buying the ticket/renting the DVD. But since it is a parody, we have to accept that level. Ben Stiller is a great comedian, but in my opinion he is much more funny as a loser type, rather than the "idiot" type he plays in most of his movies. That is why "Meet the Parents" and "There's Something About Mary" are funnier more intelligent films than "Zoolander" or "Dodge Ball".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day after i see this movie, he was out of cinemas. I thought it strange because was only there for 3 weeks, and in my opinion this is a brilliant film. Many critics saw it as a film to tare apart the fashion industry and then they thought the film had not accomplished his goal. I think this film is a comedy masterpiece because it has a not very original plot, a simple man destroys an international plot to assassin the prime minister, but its worked out fine. In this movie Ben Stiller plays Zoolander a stupidly goodlooking and stupid male supermodel in the end of his carreer because he s too old (30, lol), and there s a new male supermodel Hansel( Owen Wilson ) who beats Zoolander not because he is more goodlooking or better model but because in a personal contest he can take out his panties without taking his trousers off and Zoolander cant(who would thought of that? A genius i think). Comedy scenes in this movie are very well inserted in the plot not breaking the movie into pieces. This is a film to enjoy and laugh, not a serious movie neither a fierce critic to fashion world. Watch it and augh a lot, i did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There were some genuinely funny moments in this film, like the brainwash sequence and the orgy scene, but most of the jokes were kind of hit or miss. I liked all the great little cameo appearances by some recognizable faces, and many of the fashion gags were scathingly satirical. Not really laugh-out-loud funny, but humorous in goofy way. Stiller's stupid-male-model act can be a little grating after awhile, but the performances by Ben's father Jerry Stiller and comedian Will Ferrell really stood out over everything. I must say, the more I see Will Ferrell, the more I fall in love with his glib, comedic style. He is just a naturally funny guy. This can be seen all the more if you watch the DVD version which has all the extended/deleted scenes and outtakes. The man is absolutely hilarious, and I can say without a doubt that the Bonus material is funnier than the movie itself.All in all, a 7/10 because I'm feeling generous and because of Jerry Stiller and Will Ferrell.</fullReview>

When he pauses before speaking we don't sense a stupid man trying to think of something intelligent to say, but an intelligent man trying to think of something stupid.The current Malaysian Prime Minister has been in power for over twenty years. "Zoolander" opens with the election of his successor, a gifted and charismatic leader, or so we must presume. Yet when we meet him we see a simpleton in an orange Mao suit who is only capable of saying "Ooooh" in the awed tones of those three-eyed aliens from the Toy Story movies.

		<fullReview>When i decided to go and see this movie i was very sceptical to whether this was actually the movie for me or not and in the end im very glad i chose "yes". Although it was mainly the stupidity of zoolander and his model friends that made me enjoy the movie, i still think the movie on a whole was very good. Derek Zoolander, the dumb, young model with a wide range of looks, is played by the one and only Ben Stiller, Hansel, the rival of young Zoolander, is played by Owen Wilson and the Fearless Jacobim Mugatu is played by the wonderful actor Will Ferrell. This fabulous array of actors is just a few of the marvelous actors that take a role in this comedy exstravagansa and i think they are enough to encourage anybody to see this film. The plot itself is quite origional and easy to follow and of course very funny too. One particular scene that humoured me was the one were zoolander was hypnotised by a dancing Mugatu, but i wont spoil it too much for you. So make sure you see this film, like it and make other people see it too. I shall give it a 7 out of 10 as zoolanders stupidity was just too stupid for me at some points.</fullReview>

At first I thought it would be one of those poorly done type movies but Ben Stiller did a great job with directing the movie. In fact I found Ben Stiller to be very annoying until this movie. The way the fashion industry is portrayed is hilarious and the presentation is top notch. Owen "the nose" Wilson's character is very likeable (like always) and other than a few lines that were just a little too dumb most of the movie was very funny. The first review on this page is a good and fair review of the movie. If you went expecting anything else well... watch the previews next time before you make the trip. I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zoolander (***1/2/****)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a fine line between a stupid comedy and a stoopid comedy. Let me explain. A stupid comedy knows full well that it's stupid, and milks it for all the comedic possibilities it's worth. A stoopid comedy simply blunders it's way through, blissfully unaware that it contains the intelligence level of your average pet rock. Thankfully, Zoolander belongs in the former category.Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is the biggest male model ever, but his career is now winding down as the throne is being handed down to up-and-coming hunk Hansel (Owen Wilson). "Maybe there's more to life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking," Derek ponders. So, to find himself he quits the modeling industry to help underprivileged children learn to read. But, soon he is drawn back into the world of fashion when a lead designer offers him a new line. Little does Derek know that he has actually been brainwashed to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. Sound confusing? Well, as it turns out, the modeling industry has been behind every political assassination for 200 years. There. Now you're even more confused.Well, see this movie and it might make a bit more sense. Yes, that is a recommendation. Yes, it is a stupid comedy. In fact, it's one of the stupidest I've ever had the pleasure(?) of seeing. To set the tone - when Derek is presented with a model of his education center, he throws the model to the ground, angrily saying that it needs to be "at least three times bigger." Stupid? Yes. Funny? Definitely. Worth seeing? Go for it.Zoolander is rated PG-13 for language, crude humor, sexual situations, and drug references.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the worlds top male model and dumber than a half empty jar of baby-food. In fact Derek may be both the stupidest and best looking man on the planet if not for his only rival: extreme-dude/Hippie-Male Model, Hansel (Owen Wilson). The two pretty-boys must put aside their bitter rivalry and team up with sexy girl reporter Matilda Jeffries (Chritine Taylor? that's the girl who played Marsha in the Brady Bunch movies) to foil an assassination conspiracy headed up by the international fashion industry and their deadliest operative the evil designer Jacobim Mugatu (Pronounced Jacobeem Moogatoo) played by the funniest being to exist in this universe or any other, SNL's own bellowing, infinite wellspring of hilarity Will Ferrell (Pronounced exactly how it sounds.)Zoolander has the same kind of highly visual, campy feel of Austin Powers. Where as Powers zinged 60's style Zoolander mocks contemporary fashion culture. The getups in Zoolander make the costumes from Bat-Man and Robin look like the wardrobe of somebody's conservative 1950's Dad. In a day in age where Hollyrock (sorry I mean Hollywood? I forgot I'm not a Flintstone) gives us one lame rip off after another Zoolander proves refreshingly original. Case in point, how many films are bold enough to have a group of male models accidentally blow themselves up while having a semi-homo-erotic gasoline fight at a service station to the hit 1980's Wham song `Wake Me Up For You Go Go?' That might have sounded confusing but trust me it's pretty inexplicable when you see it in the movie too. But it's weird stuff like that that makes Zoolander a laugh per nanosecond. And here's fair warning when the Hypnosis scene starts put down your refreshing coca-cola (or is it Pepsi that owns my soul?) because you'll laugh so hard that your generic soft drink won't just shoot out of your nostrils but every single orifice in your body! Of course the same warning could apply to Male Model `Walk off' duel, Derek's romp through the coal mines and basically every time Stiller, Ferrell or Wilson are on screen. I couldn't endorse this movie anymore without having to get a full body tattoo of the films entire story board.. but (to quote Levar Burton's famous `Reading Rainbow' line) ? `don't take my word for it'? hear what people sort of just like you had to say? - `The Best Original comedy in years.'- `I'm like totally going to buy the sound track.'

		<fullReview>ZOOLANDER (2001) Rating: 9/10Some people will say this is a one-joke movie, some will say this is a plain stupid movie and others will even say this is one of the worst movies of the year. But hopefully not many. I really don't see how anyone could dislike this movie, it is vibrant, happy, full of story, the jokes are unbelievable and I embarrassed myself by laughing so loud and the film actually has intelligence, and isn't one of those dumb-fun comedies. Take the scene in the graveyard with the hand model, it tells us that all world leaders that were assassinated were actually killed by models ? an absurd point of view, I know, but it actually works, and that is one of the movies high-points. However absurd or stupid it may be, it actually gives explanations as to what is happening with the gags and story twists. What really kicks serious ass with Zoolander is not the intelligence it has, but the wide range of opportunity it has with its jokes. Whenever it has the chance for a joke, it goes for it. Some particularly funny scenes were when Derek Zoolander was getting brainwashed and the very last scene had me in fits. The movie is awesome as a spoof on movies that are too dramatic and male models that take themselves too seriously. Zoolander may not have as drama as the subject its spoofing, but it doesn't need it. The jokes are all there and we don't want any serious parts ? we just want the movie to keep on rolling with its crack-ups. I'm sure many people will diss this movie, but I found it very hard to find a fault in it, and I really enjoyed myself. I expected much less, but got some of the best entertainment out of a movie in ages. Zoolander is a great flick, and gives a new meaning to the world `laugh.' See it now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last year's Meet the Parents already proved to the world that the combination of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson was funny. Zoolander shows that the two of them can be downright hilarious.But be on the alert, schoolmarms: Zoolander is not a movie that wants to be taken seriously. There's nothing in the movie that even comes close to believability, let alone drama. However, this does not stop Zoolander from being incredibly enjoyable.Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male model who is really, really, really, really good-looking (which is, given Stiller's cute doofiness, a funny gag all in itself). Unfortunately, like most male models, Derek is also a complete moron. For this reason, he is chosen by Mugatu, an evil fashion designer, to assassinate the newly elected prime minister of Malaysia. Why would the fashion industry care about third world politics? Well, once in power, the new prime minister will put an end to the practices of child labor in his country. Since the fashion industry thrives on cheap child labor, they need to stop the prime minister. And Zoolander, more beauty than brains, is just the man to do it.Sound ridiculous? That's because it is. But don't worry. Zoolander never focuses too much on the plot. Rather, it chooses to belittle and mock the modeling industry, and it does so with a combination of gusto and hilarity. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller do a wonderful job of imitating the cocky arrogance of male models, while at the same time somehow making their characters likable.Wilson, who broke out into stardom with the Jackie Chan vehicle Shanghai Noon, is wonderful as Hansel, the male model who threatens to unseat Zoolander from the perch of male model superstar. Will Ferrell as Mugatu is as hysterical as ever -- especially in the "brainwashing" scene. And Christine Taylor, as TIME magazine reporter Matilda Jeffries, is also likable. The inclusion of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara (Ben Stiller's parents) in small parts in the film, is the icing on the cake.Is it up for Oscar contention? Good god, I hope not. Zoolander is a ridiculous movie, with more material missing from it than from the latest designer's dress. It's not as much a movie as it is an hour and a half of silly sketch comedy. But for a hearty laugh -- as well as a good escape from the scary chaos of the world today -- Zoolander should walk down the runway the winner. It's clever, it's silly, and it's just what so many of us now need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb male models have `walk off' and then one tries to assasinate a foreign prime minister. Sometimes funny but stupidly offensive politically. No flys out of five</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller (There's Something About Mary, Meet The Parents) appeared on a video at a fashion award presentation in 1996 parodying the industry with a character called Derek Zoolander. The video had some carry on the internet and eventually yet another short skit became a 90 minute movie. Again it shouldn't have happened.Zoolander isn't just boring, it would also be considered to be offensive, even inflammatory by a good many people. There are two major themes in this movie. The first is the premise that male models are dumb and shallow, much as popular film culture has painted blonde headed women to be. Stiller milks this for all its worth and the results are sometimes amusing. I especially liked when Zoolander appeared in a commercial as a rather fey looking merman. Fabio makes an appearance but was considered to be far more intelligent that Derek Zoolander. That's an attractive idea.There are a heap of cameos by stars, most notably David Bowie, but so what.But there's a questionable plot woven around Zoolander and his cohorts Hansel (Owen Wilson, Shanghai Noon) and Mugatu played by Will Ferrell. Here lies my main objection to the film.It seems that the U.S. fashion industry bigwigs are worried about the source of cheap labour with which they manufacture their goods.The Malaysian President is talking about banning slave labour in his country and so Derek Zoolander, a stupid, brainwashed male model, has been programmed to assassinate the Malaysian President no less. And this is supposed to be a comedy!To add insult to threat, The Malaysian President is played in the film as being a benign looking man of Chinese appearance, a racial slur that definitely wouldn't please the rather prickly Dr Mahatir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, who is proudly Malay not Chinese.Mahatir is no shrinking violet either. He was recently quoted in the Singapore paper The Straits Times as saying that ` While there are hordes of Malaysians who are eager to be in the vanguard of IT and the multimedia age, there are also quite a number who believe television sets should be thrown into the river because they are instruments of Satan."I'd love to read his comments on Zoolander!This does matter, particularly in our Southern part of the world. Most Americans probably couldn't pick out Malaysia on a map but our neighbours matter to us in Australia, particularly in relation to the current political climate. Given that Malaysia would have to be considered one of the more strident Muslim nations, Zoolander adds up to inflammatory politics, even if it was written before the September bombings in the USA But still they were able to find the time to paint out the World Trade Center from the Manhattan skyline for a final shot. Didn't want to offend Americans I suppose. Too bad they didn't drop the Malaysian stuff though. Knocking off a Muslim world leader to maximise American profits, in a comedy, is a bit nasty.No Dumb Flys</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a huge amount of difference between "Ben Stiller: The Actor" and "Ben Stiller: The Director." The latter is responsible for the extremely witty and underrated "Reality Bites," and the just as clever (but in a different way) and also underrated "The Cable Guy." (Yeah, so Jim Carrey wasn't playing Ace Ventura again. Sue him). "Ben Stiller: The Actor" invariably turns up in "Haha, man fall down" comedy, like "Meet the Parents," which is funny to some, but not to me.Hey, I loved "There's Something About Mary" just as much as anyone, but Stiller's got more going on upstairs than that. As of 2001, "Saturday Night Live," is stupid-funny. "Zoolander" is all true. That's WHY it's funny. Or should be.Yeah, every character within it is a blithering idiot, but man, I KNOW these people. I went to school with 3 or 4 Derek Zoolanders or Hansels, although they were less good-looking, which may or may not mean something.Bottom line, I'm still impressed with "Ben Stiller: The Director," even if "Ben Stiller: The Screenwriter" is something less than impressive. If you've got any hatred in your heart for pop-culture, this one may be worth your time. Otherwise, I hear there's a "Meet the Parents" sequel in the works. You're on your own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i first saw he preview for Zoolander on television, i seriously thought that i wasn't going to be a good movie. I thought it looked stupid and i thought that it would not be entertaining. So when my friends told me that one day they wanted to see this film, i really wasn't looking forward to it, but i went anyway, and now i am glad i went. Ben Stiller Movies always put a smile on my face, and this movie really made me smile and laugh. He plays a stupid supermodel in this film, and he acted really well... i wonder if he was acting. It had stupid and yet funny jokes in it. His wife Christine Taylor was in this, and Owen Wilson was in it, who also starred in "Meet The Parents," with Ben. I really did enjoy this film, and i think if you watch it, you will enjoy it for yourself.I give it *** stars out of ***** stars.</fullReview>

This movie if compared on a scale of 10 for comedy would deservingly be an 8. It makes clever jokes, intelligent jokes, and dumb jokes, something for everybody and a social comment about beauty in todays world as seen by a supermodel. So if you are under the age of 40, you will thoroughly enjoy the movie, and isn't that what it is about. It may be dumb, but it is enjoyable and worth the money for the movie ticket</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>my kids liked this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may not be SHREK but here is a decent comedy for kids and adults alike. It starts off kind of weak but picks up momentum- if you can call it that, let's say "random funny stuff"- after the first five minutes. There's a gasoline pump fight among a bunch of airheaded male models done to the tune of "Wake me up before you go-go" and a bit where Will Ferrel dumps hot latte on one of his groveling assistants that had me in absolute stitches. I thought Ben Stiller's Dr. Evil accent was uninspired but overall he did the best with what he had. Derek Zoolander ain't exactly the 21st century's answer to Hamlet. That being said, Owen Wilson, Farrel, Jerry Stiller and that "Marcia Brady" girl are very, very funny. Even David Duchovny's a riot. Like most of Adam Sandler's, Rob Shneider's and David Spade's movies, the supporting cast really do just that: carry the film when the lead's broad-based character has reached his plateau. And like the average Sandler/Shneider/Spade effort ZOOLANDER is choppy and uneven. You can tell they cut A LOT out of this movie. There are weird glimpses of anonymous cameos left and right. I had to look up the cast list for this movie on IMDB to see that Andy Dick (unrecognizable as a fat, pimply, unibrowed masseuse who has no lines) and Vince Vaughn (as Zoolander's brother, who again has a brief lineless close up) were in it. My instinct tells me they had bigger parts, but they just weren't working, and all but wound up on the cutting room floor. By the same token, my children (four and three years old) were enthralled by the cartoonishness of this movie. The outrageous characters, the sight gags, the music, the colorful production design, all are engaging for the young ones. And don't let the PG-13 thing dissuade any of you parents who've had it up to here with the standard kid-fare. Even the grown up jokes are done in such an innocent way, you won't need to cover anybody's eyes are explain anything on the ride home. If nothing else, you- the adult- will probably enjoy the almost subliminal nods to older movies, including a MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE subplot that is nothing short of genius. Say what you want about Ben Stiller, but as a director and writer, he knows how to reference the classics. So if you want to go see something that will keep the kiddies quiet and you entertained in a brainless kind of way, I recommend ZOOLANDER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zoolander" puts forth the notion that male models, and Fashion People in general, are shallow, self-obsessed, and sneeringly unaware of their own ridiculousness, and also that the bulk of international intrigue and diabolical scheming can be traced directly to the fashion industry. While this makes it plausible to argue that it is in fact a documentary, it is actually proof that Ben Stiller is one of the best satirists working in movies today. Okay, so it's a narrow field; but he is still a funny, funny guy, especially when you eliminate the Farrelly brothers, who would be lost without their casting director.Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is a famed male model, a man so shallow that he's actually convex. Crushed at being eclipsed by a younger rival, he is recruited into a shadowy plot to become a brainwashed assassin for the international clothes cartel. It's kind of like "The Manchurian Candidate" as imagined by Details magazine.Naturally, much is made of Derek's dimness, and that of male models in general. Though much of it is funny, it does wear thin after a while. The movie is a lot funnier when instead of mocking fashion types as empty heads, it aims at the conventions of the industry itself, as in a scene where Derek and his fabulously-dressed buddies' magazine-spread romp at a gas station spins hilariously out of control, or a "Bloodsport" style confrontation between rival models "at the old Members Only warehouse". The best gag in the movie concerns the concept behind a new fashion line, which is at once screamingly funny and scathingly true. The numerous movie references are also well-brought off, and it is great fun to see familiar spy-movie conventions transplanted to the world of style, as in a meeting of faceless international villains of fashion ("I trust you want to live to see your spring line.") The brainwashing takes place in a special "day spa" overseen by a Rosa Klebb-style dominatrix (Milla Jovovich) and her impeccably-clad goon squad who are always perfectly posed, even when tossing intruders out the steel doors.The cameos by notable real-life Beautiful People are a tad excessive, and lend "Zoolander" an in-jokey quality that it doesn't need, and dulls the edge on the sendup until the darts are more like Nerf arrows. Fortunately, most of the cameos are too fast to count, and they often do little more than walk by the camera (the movie often feels an annoying urge to name-drop and flash labels on the screen, lest you miss a card-carrying glitterati). An exception is David Bowie's funny turn as a kind of haute-couture Mills Lane. But the central cast is the real show here. Stiller's evocation of Zoolander's patented "looks" are hysterical. Owen Wilson's blank stare, misshapen nose, and ludicrous New Age claptrap make him a great foil as Hansel, Zoolander's scooter-slinging upstart rival. David Duchovny does a great parody of his "X-Files" persona, just as he did in "Evolution" (I get a feeling this will be the arc of Duchovny's future career, at least until he gets a better agent). Christine Taylor also makes a fine straight man as a reporter covering the Zoolander beat. However, Will Ferrell does his level best to steal the show as Mugatu, a crazed designer, who plots political murder without batting an eye, but gets all hissy when there's too much foam in his latte.Oddly, "Zoolander" is helped somewhat by the ineptness of its trailers, which for some reason chose the more lackluster jokes to showcase, the ones that display Stiller's weakness as a writer and director: he is too often shy about trusting the audience to get a joke, and feels a need to over-explain or over-stage a gag until it ceases to be funny. This instinct has hamstrung more than a few dynamite jokes in his career, and he needs to muzzle it. Some of the funniest gags in "Zoolander" are the ones we see in brief, subtle passing, not the ones that have giant neon arrows reading "Comic Moment"."Zoolander" may or may not be more amusing to those who are hip to the world of fashion. I frankly wouldn't know. But even those of us who couldn't pick Donna Karan out of a police lineup or wouldn't know a Manolo Blahnik if it kicked us square in the face, can appreciate the satiric skewering of those who do. Even more, perhaps.There is, at the end, an unintentionally sad note to the comedy. In the final credits, the movie gives special thanks to the Explosives Unit of the New York Fire Department. God bless them every one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could of been so much better!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that look like they're going to be one of the funniest movies you'll ever see, but it turns out that the preview was pretty much the whole movie. I mean it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It was disappointing. Ben Stiller has been in much better movies. Don't get me wrong it had it's good parts. Even with a 6.6 it's over rated. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't get the laugh out louds out of my body. This movie is the complete opposite of Rat Race. I didn't expect anything from Rat Race. It ended up being the funniest movie I've ever seen. In this movie the plot is something everyone has seen before, someone has been brained washed to kill a prime minister. Sound fimiliar??????????? I think we've seen something exactly like it, or have seen something close to it. We've probably seen it in a James Bond film, or The Jackal, etc. Oh yeah and we'll probably see it in an upcoming Mission Impossible film. But those movies weren't comedies. This movie attempts to be a competition with Austin Powers and I'll tell you, this is no Austin Powers. But I have to admit that I didn't care much for the first Austin Powers. I loved the sequel. My point is that, if they make a sequel to this, there is a chance it will be better. But Zoolander is one of those movies that you'll hate, not sure about it, or love it 'til the day you die. So go see it anyway if you want too. Besides it is only my opinion. You may love it. Rating: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie even though the ads didn't look that promising. But I remembered that I missed the boat on Something About Mary, which I thought had poor ads as well. So I though Zoolander may have something to offer, since Mary was one of the best comedies of all time (IMHO). Unfortunately, it sucked as bad as the ads suggested. And it is a real disappointment since so much talent was wasted. It appears to be an excellent sketch comedy bit, gone horribly, horribly wrong. It did have its moments, the opening scenes and the brainwashing montague were inspired and stylish, but the following scenes fell flat, and the audience could never get enough momentum to turn the occasional giggles to real laughter. The coal mining scenes were a waste (Why have Vince Vaughn just sit there, couldn't Stiller think of a single line for him) All the cameos were distracting, and none were very funny. The spy scenes were silly, and were meant to be. But Austin Powers proved that silly spy spoofs could still pack the laughs, despite the fact they are predictable. The modeling scenes were parodies of a genre that has already been parodied enough. (See Scary Movie spoofing a spoof) We all know Male models are vacant. Telling us again doesn't make it any funier. The plot against the Malaysian Prime Minister was very distastful (current events notwithstanding) The Prime Minister is a very real person, a muslim and an ally of the US. Why have a real person be the center of a death threat when it would be certainly very easy to make up a country like Bandonesilay or something. The whole movie seemed to be based around the one real joke of Zoolander's new expression (Magnum) which is so perfect it can stop steel. Funny for a five minute sketch, tiresome in a 100 minute movie. The film seemed unorganized and rushed. Jokes are overexplained and strange pauses in action left the audience giggling in confusion, rather than in humor. Cable Guy, Mystery Men and Zoolander is strike three. Stiller, keep your writing and directing talents for MTV, and leave the big screen to the Farrely Brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So, Zoolander is not the most intellectually dense movie you are likely to see this year. So what? It doesn't try to be that. It is instead an extremely funny movie starring Ben Stiller, one of the funniest comics right now. After the hilarious Meet the Parents, Stiller comes back for yet another hilarious comedy. This time, he plays Derek Zoolander, a dumb male model who is brainwashed to assassinate the Malaysian prime minister because he wants to put an end to child labor. Zoolander attacks with light(but extremely funny) humor the superficial and exploitative world of fashion. You will probably keep on wearing Nike shoes after seeing Zoolander but at least the movie as a target. But what is really important is Stiller and Owen Wilson, both absolutely hilarious as moronic male models who have to save the president. All the jokes either make you laugh out loud or at least smile. And there are plenty of them. Zoolander also has a lot of excellent cameos(including... DAVID BOWIE!!!... yeah!). As a parody of spy movies, Zoolander sure beats the dissapointing sequel to Austin Powers and may even top the first installement of Myers' James Bond spoof. I will have to watch them alongside one another and see. So, Zoolander won't change your life. So what, it will make you laugh a lot... Sometimes, that is all a movie should do.81%</fullReview>

In fact Derek may be both the stupidest and best looking man on the planet if not for his only rival: extreme-dude/Hippie-Male Model, Hansel (Owen Wilson). The two pretty-boys must put aside their bitter rivalry and team up with sexy girl reporter Matilda Jeffries (Chritine Taylor? that's the girl who played Marsha in the Brady Bunch movies) to foil an assassination conspiracy headed up by the international fashion industry and their deadliest operative the evil designer Jacobim Mugatu (Pronounced Jacobeem Moogatoo) played by the funniest being to exist in this universe or any other, SNL's own bellowing, infinite wellspring of hilarity Will Ferrell (Pronounced exactly how it sounds.)Zoolander has the same kind of highly visual, campy feel of Austin Powers. Where as Powers zinged 60's style Zoolander mocks contemporary fashion culture. The getups in Zoolander make the costumes from Bat-Man and Robin look like the wardrobe of somebody's conservative 1950's Dad. In a day in age where Hollyrock (sorry I mean Hollywood? I forgot I'm not a Flintstone) gives us one lame rip off after another Zoolander proves refreshingly original. Case in point, how many films are bold enough to have a group of male models accidentally blow themselves up while having a semi-homo-erotic gasoline fight at a service station to the hit 1980's Wham song `Wake Me Up For You Go Go?' That might have sounded confusing but trust me it's pretty inexplicable when you see it in the movie too. But it's weird stuff like that that makes Zoolander a laugh per nanosecond. And here's fair warning when the Hypnosis scene starts put down your refreshing coca-cola (or is it Pepsi that owns our school?) because you'll laugh so hard that your generic soft drink won't just shoot out of your nostrils but every single orifice in your body! Of course the same warning could apply to Male Model `Walk off' duel, Derek's romp through the coal mines and basically every time Stiller, Ferrell or Wilson are on screen. I couldn't endorse this movie anymore without having to get a full body tattoo of the films entire story board.. but (to quote Levar Burton's famous `Reading Rainbow' line) ? `don't take my word for it'? hear what people sort of just like you had to say? - `The Best Original comedy in years.'- `I'm like totally going to buy the sound track.' (She was right the track rocks.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller does a fine job in comedy. But playing a male-model is not his field, This movie would have worked out great with the likes of Jim Carrey. But none the less it works. Derek Zoolander, is about to kill the prime minister of Asia &lt;~~ or something close to it. And has to be stopped to think about this by friends/foe. Friends, Owen Wilson. Foes, Jerry Stiller and Will Ferrel.After his friends all get killed in a "little" gasoline fight, and attempt to smoke during it, blow up. So Zoolander desides to retire and make a new life, But Mugatu (Will Ferrel) Thinks differently.Out of 10-7.1</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It mocks the MTV culture, yes, but it also can't help buying into it -- it commits some of the same sins, shallowness, pop-culture reverence, overkill. Stiller's schtick -- the funny walk, the crossed eyes, the sucking-in of cheeks -- gets tired after a while, and he has written a one-note role for his dad, Jerry. Beyond that, no complaints. Will Ferrell's an unexpected riot, Christine Taylor a sweet foil, and the celebrity cameos are well placed. Most of all, the costumes are deliciously tasteless. Stiller has always been a master satirist, and the vacuity of the Seventh Avenue scene is as ripe a target as anyone could ask for. A fine hour and a half of escapism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of the best comedies don't have what one would call intelligent humor (perfect example: The Three Stooges). I love intelligent humor as much as anyone, but its a lot more fun to laugh out loud with friends over the stupidest little things than have a quaint chuckle alone at irony. This is why the world needs films like "Zoolander".Most stupid comedies of late have been just that - stupid, weighed down by bad toilet and sex humor. But here we have a comedy with a lead that takes his stupidity in stride down the walkway, and its (unlike most stupid comedies of late) really funny. Ben Stiller (who also directed) is great as Derek Zoolander, a male model who wows the fashion world with his trademark brilliant look "blue steel", and gives critics a headache with his less-than-brilliant manners of speaking. Stiller's intentional bad-acting gives Zoolander an even greater degree of stupidness, in all his blunders and absurdities; he really is THAT funny, especially in a "did he just say what I think he said?" sort of way because he really is THAT stupid. The film doesn't have the greatest longevity, since it removes most of the effect once you know what Zoolander will do or say next, and as the film winds down he actually gets a little smarter (fear not! a smarter Zoolander is still dumber than anyone you'll ever meet). The most absurd moments, including Zoolander as a merman, a fashion awards ceremony that begins Zoolander's "retirement", and a walk-off competition between Zoolander and his biggest competition, extreme-sports-model/stoner Hansel (Owen Wilson) refereed by David Bowie, are by far the film's most (only?) memorable aspects, but as mentioned earlier, they're that absurd and that dumb that they stick around for a while. There is also some subtle intelligent parody of the fashion industry and in-jokes that keep the film fresh for discussion with friends past the memorable moment's expiration dates.This obviously doesn't appeal to everyone (people who don't like cliches in their plots, for instance). But to those that it does appeal to, its great fun, especially after all those disappointing summer blockbusters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before watching this movie, I read some reviews of it, and for the most part, they said it sucked. Too bad. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard (oh wait, yeah I do, when I saw Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). I admit, Zoolander is not great, but the crazy visuals (the entire "Relax" scene) and numerous cameos (it's hard to name someone NOT in the movie) make this one heck of an entertaining movie. My only problem is the "male model is dumber than a bag of doorknobs" jokes that play through the entire film; most of them aren't that funny. But despite what any reviewer says, I recommend any "fan of silly comedies" to see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best spoof comedy Stiller has done yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wild, wacky and exceedingly good satire of the whole crazy world of fashion. Zoolander is really a difficult story, I mean, how do you make the audience feel for a lead character who is supposed to be completely dumb? Some reviewers here think the first 20 minutes is pretty slow, but seeing Derek get his ego slammed is pretty funny itself, and the whole point of the first act was to get you to like him. If you thought the rest of the film was funny, well, the first 20 mins got the job done.Actually if you stop for a second and think about the whole idea that someone like Derek can become the top supermodel in the world, and it only makes the rest of the film even more funny.I won't give away the gags in the review. Just remember when you watchh the film, let the jokes fly on, and if you don't catch every single one, the story will bring you through one very well done spoof. By the time you reach the climax of the film, with Derek saving the day, you'll just be glad that you paid the dollars to Ben and his team to make this genre of film.Watch this one. Its good. May Zoolander 2 be as good as the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I finished watching `Zoolander', I was as confused as the main character's mental state. I thought that Ben Stilller was super as the mentally-challenged male model Derek Zoolander. But I thought its plot that involved killing the President of Malaysia was a bit too far fetched. I also did think Will Ferrell was the right fit to play the freaky-haired malicious designer. However, I thought that Christine Taylor's performance as the female reporter made me bulimic. I thought Director Ben Stiller's mockery of the model business had a real humorous design to it. But on the other hand, at times it was too over exposed. `Zoolander' is one attraction that at times will make you laugh even though it is not the perfect model of a great comedy. *** Average</fullReview>

I can't. For some odd reason, I just wasn't sold. Ben Stiller's portrayal of Derek Zoolander came across very clunky at times, and the movie seemed to lack a whole flow, as if I was just waiting for the next laugh or cameo. I know it's just a comedy, but Stiller led a little movie called " There's Something About Mary" where I actually did care, and I just didn't here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good laugh, yet nothing more...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Perhaps one of the main reasons a person can be disappointed in 'Zoolander' is due to the high expectations of star/Director Ben Stiller. I have been a fan of Stiller since his early films including his funniest picture 'Flirting with Disaster' and on his TV series. In this film, Stiller returns to the Director's chair after directing the superb yet misunderstood 'The Cable Guy' One could say Zooolander can also be a misunderstood film. In this film, there is no subtle, dark comedy as in 'The Cable Guy'; only pure laughs in the midst of the weirdest plot since the original 'Ace Ventura' film. The story is constructed around the villain Mugatu. He is a clothes designer with the most outlandish sense of style; here played by Will Ferrell. In a nutshell, the plot goes like this: Mugatu's clothes are made in Malaysia where he relies on child labor to make a large profit. When Malaysia has a new President who vows on banning this form of labor, Mugatu hires Stiller's Zoolander character to brainwash him into assassinating the President at the next Fashion Show. Stiller plays the male super model who is seemingly at the end of his career; thus tempting him to take the job. 'Zoolander' is surrounded with great actors such as Stiller, Ferrell and the Fantastic Owen Wilson (Armageddon, Meet the Parents). Wilson plays Hansel; the new super model who forces Zoolander into seclusion after a botched awards show that serves as the catalyst for the end of Zoolander's career - A great scene. At the beginning of the critique I stated that perhaps one of the main reasons for being somewhat disappointed in Zooolander is the level of anticipation I had for this film. After a wretched summer movie season, I told myself I had to wait until the 28th of September to have a hard laugh. And while the laughs are plentiful, I must admit; they are quite forgettable. Stiller conveys the egocentricity of his Zoolander character tremendously, and his supporting cast including cameos from David Duchovny, Lenny Kravitz, Fabio and Winona Ryder all add to the laughs in this funny yet seemingly empty film. It reminds me unfortunately of a string of comedic scenes strung together in a comedic fashion. And while the film is funny, warm and gives you that feel-good 'shot' at the end - it could have been so much more. The main drawback to this film is that it falls into that category where every hero goes back to his roots to rediscover themselves after failed attempts. This is no exception - after Zoolander is not the male model of the world he goes back to Jersey where his father Jon Voight is a coal miner and disowns him once again. Thus of course forcing Zoolander to try again and prove himself to be the best and unknowingly save the President. All this of course with the help of a female (Stiller's real life wife Christine Taylor) who of course - they fall in love. This film caters to all the past cliches in other comedic films yet still manages to remain fresh by showing us a truly comedic glimpse into the fashion world. Despite its' tackiness and emptiness, one will find Zoolander a good laugh that is disappointing in terms of its' ability to remain constant and enjoyable. Some scenes have no place yet others shine, showing the audience that there is an imbalance within the film, but hopefully we won't notice. Unfortunately we do, and no matter how many cameos, we still notice these flaws that turn the film into one to watch at a 'cheapie night' at the movies. A good laugh, yet unfortunately nothing more. Giancarlo's Rating: **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoilers!! I don't know if this is really what the fashion world is like.....scary to think it's like this, but unfortunately, it's probably not too far from the truth.....anyway, this is a very funny parody of the clueless models and self-absorbed promoters. Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, who has been the pre-eminent male model in the US for many years. He has recently been upstaged though by shaggy-maned Hansel (Owen Wilson), a hedonistic free spirit. Zoolander wonders about the importance of his profession in the wake of a tragic gasoline accident and his declining popularity. He begins to believe that he what he is doing is not very useful in the grand scheme of things. Go figure. So in this time of earnest self-reflection, he tries to re-discover his roots. First, he tries to go home-to coal mining country in southern New Jersey, only to find his father (uncredited Jon Voight) ashamed of him. He then considers starting a literacy program which he inadvertently stops by failing to realize that the model of his center is not the actual center. He spurns modeling jobs, but finds he has very few other abilities. So he is lured back into the world of modelling by an offer from the legendary designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell), who offers him the chance to headline his new line of clothes, Derelicte. This is quite an opportunity for Derek as he has never worked for him. The modeling line is the pretext through which Derek will be positioned to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, a reformist who plans on eliminating child labor. The fashion designers cabal are scared about this as it will cut into their profits, so Derek is recruited to assassinate him at the end of the show introducing Derelicte. He is selected as he is the dimmest and most malleable of all the models the designers can think of. He is trained to respond in Pavlovian style to the stimulus of a song, and in the final confrontation, his attempt to assassinate the Prime Minister is jeopardized when another song is played.This really is a very funny film and is all meant in good fun. Stiller and his co-writer Drake Sather have put together some incredibly funny moments. I found the first 20 minutes or so to be largely non-eventful, though punctured by some very humorous moments. However from there, the film just gets funnier and funnier and I seemed not to stop laughing the last 45 minutes or hour.One really sees the inanity of the models and designers and there are many celebrity cameos in the film. Everyone seems to enjoy poking fun at the fashion industry which they ironically support. It is very well written. At some times, especially in the first half an hour, there were lulls in the laughter, where it seemed the air was sucked out of the theater. However these lulls were usually replaced very quickly with uproarious howls of laughter. I found this film to be a very funny send-up of the fashion industry and very entertaining.</fullReview>

Christine Taylor's character seemed totally out of place even though I wanted her in every scene but her sense of being normal in an abnormal film like this on the opposite side was like finding Bozo the clown in Hamlet.

		<fullReview>Zoolander offers both the classic, slapstick, "dumb" humor, along with presenting an array of intelligent humor. It brings to the screen references from other films, literature, and pop culture. Stiller brought in actors, models, singers, and other celebrities ranging from Billy Zaine to David Bowie. Many of the celebs that make cameos in this comedy utter not a spoken word, such as Vince Vaughn, who simply stands behind Jon Voight.Stiller's great writing fails only in comparison to his brilliant incorporation of other films - 2001: A Space Odyssey, Manchurian Candidate, and many others...The over-the-top acting of Stiller and Wilson was the perfect stylistic choice for the film. The on camera chemistry between the two has long been missed on the silver screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into Zoolander just wanting to laugh uncontrolably. Guess what, that is exactly what I got. The jokes on pop culture are right up my alley. The one thing I can not stand about society today, is the use of cell phones, and how small they have become. Ben thought of a nice joke, and the movie featured a cell phone the size of a half dollar. That is one of the prize pieces of the film. If you are somewhat aware of pop culture, and very cynical then you will find this picture hilarious. While in the theater no one was really laughing that much. People seemed to only laugh at the parts they had seen on television numerous times before. I think that people did not really understand the jokes, and therefore could not laugh. They assumed that it was a brainless comedy. This was not the case. The characters appear thoughtless, but the dialogue is rather witty. If you want to escape from things that have been going on, especially in Manhatten, then go see Zoolander. You will not regret you went, just make sure you do not turn your brain completely off, you will need part of it to understand some of the jokes. Well, what are you waiting for, go see this movie NOW.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seldom funny, mostly annoying...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People that go to comedies often come out saying, 'All the good parts were in the previews.' Ben Stiller's Zoolander didn't get that response from me. The response it did get was, 'The previews were funnier, and even they weren't really funny? Sigh.'There are funny moments in the movie but I could count them on one hand and still have enough fingers left to count up to three. I'm not counting the moments from the commercials that were funny once, some even twice, because the media saturation on this movie sucked the humor out of them long before the theater lights darkened.Ben Stiller is entertaining and annoying, mostly the latter. In fact, Zoolander as a whole is slightly entertaining and mostly annoying. And it's slightly entertaining in the way that someone farting is slightly entertaining.There really needs to be no comment on the acting, apart from two things:1) Ben Stiller has an accent throughout the entire movie. Did I miss this, somehow, in the previews? Or was it cleverly hidden just because it was so annoying? It reminds me of how the promotions for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon never mentioned the subtitles. People started watching the movie and groaned, 'This has subtitles? Aw, geez.' That's how I felt about this accent.2) Will Ferrell is just plain annoying, entirely. His constant overacting is painful to watch, even in a film like Zoolander that is pretty much built around overacting. He's seldom funny (in general, but also in this movie) and, again, mostly annoying.I don't want to put more effort into this than Stiller apparently put into Zoolander, so, in summation, as above: it's slightly entertaining in the way that someone farting is slightly entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, now the truth is out. It's worse than anything Oliver Stone could conjure.Male models are behind all political assassinations! Who would have thought it? Lurking behind those handsome dumb Himbo faces there was really -- well, nothing. But that's what makes them so dangerous as lean, mean, brainless -- gorgeous -- fighting machines.As Zoolander searches for the answer to the ages-old question, "Who am I?" he goes back to his coalmine roots, becomes ashamed of being a mermaid (actually a "Merman!"), battles evil in the St. Adonis Cemetery, and falls in love. Socrates would have been proud of the way Zoolander learns to "Know Thyself."The film has a zany sense of humor as it borrows freely from THE X FILES, JFK, FIGHT CLUB, THE GODFATHER, and 2001, among others. This satire is delightful in its sheer silliness. What a great comedy at a time when we need it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny while watching it, even funnier while thinking about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ZOOLANDER is one strange film. Its sort of like a full on assault on the brain, spitting out so many weird ideas and creative jokes all at once that its impossible to catch them all. The plot is so bizarre and haphazardly constructed that talking about the story almost seems irrelevant. It is probably useful information to say that the plot has to do with assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia and involves a somewhat disturbingly funny funeral scene that overlooks the city of New York. These events would be disturbing enough if we hadn't all witnessed the WTC attacks a few weeks ago, but now they seem just so disturbing that the scenes seem appropriate. This perhaps made the film much darker than it needed to be when released, but perhaps the way in which these events are presented, as being rather dark and still humorous, that this film seems awkwardly precient in a way.Still, as I said, the plot is irrelevant. What makes ZOOLANDER important is that it is probably the funniest film of the year, at least for me. Sure, its not as wholesome as BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, and it perhaps didn't have the unexpected charm of RAT RACE, and it wasn't as much fun as RUSH HOUR 2, and it wasn't as good of a film experience as SHREK. However, it is perhaps the most consistently funny film I have seen, and the biggest laughs are probably the most creative of the year. Overall, the film is so packed with cleverly conceived and executed ideas that just thinking about each individual scene provides entertainment in itself. My favorite scenes include what happens when Zoolander and his friends go out for Orange frappucinos, the orgy scene, Zoolander's film prepared for his nomination VH1 fashion awards, and the quite unexpected yet wholly appropriate 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY reference. I'm laughing very, very hard just thinking about these scenes. I wasn't quite certain how much I liked the film right after seeing it, but now I'm certain that it has provided quite enough entertaining memories to sift though.If you let your mind think about it too much, it is perhaps easy to find ZOOLANDER offensive, or find the plot ludicrous, or realize nothing makes sense, or realize that you can't explain why your laughing. But I would advise you just let your inhibitions go. The good laughs here are some of the most refreshingly original laughs in years. The only thing keeping this film from achieving cult comedy status from the likes of films such as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, WAYNE'S WORLD, or AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY is that it isn't quite well thought out enough to truly be as effective as a whole. It all just sort of fizzles out at the end, when everyone realizes that there's no way you could possibly lead up to with that incomprehensible of a plot.If the trailer of Zoolander seemed incomprehensibly stupid to you as well as unfunny, don't go and see it. However, if you laughed at Zoolander's trailer and are dying to see it, go on, as it is at least as funny as the film's trailer. There's a lot of weird stuff here, but it all flashes by so quickly that it will all wash out of your brain very quickly. Unlike many comedies, the hilarious moments are the parts that stuck in my mind after the film and all the bad stuff washed away, which is something I truly appreciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a bold, mad act of genius it was to make "Zoolander", or even think that it could be made. In a perfect world, "Zoolander" would exist solely as a depiction of darker days long since past, an American history lesson that concludes with reassurances that its horrors will no longer be perpetrated, tolerated nor celebrated. Alas, perfection eludes us on this mortal, earthly plane; "Zoolander" shows the evolution of change while beaming a spotlight on the stunted growth of that which has not changed. Its timeliness is a spine-chilling reminder that those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. Its story provides a blueprint not only of the past, but of the way forward. Derek Zoolander must be the strangest hero to ever stand at the center of an epic. To play him, Stiller cast one of the strangest actors in recent movie history, Ben Stiller, a lanky, almost clumsy man with a sculptured face and a speaking manner that hesitates between amusement and insolence. Stillers's assignment was a delicate one.I've noticed that when people remember "Zoolander" they don't talk about the plot. They get a certain look in their eye, as if they are remembering the whole experience and have never quite been able to put it into words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Male supermodel Derek Zoolander is on the way down after three years of continuously winning the "Male Model of the Year" award. When he is beaten by the hot newcomer Hansel, Derek starts searching for a new meaning in his life. Fashion czar Mugatu offers Derek a comeback in his new "Derelicte"- line. Nobody suspects that Mugatu plans to assassinate the new Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit to New York, so that cheap child labour is still available for Mugatu's fashion producing. By brainwashing Zoolander, Mugatu and his associates create a willing killer to do the job. By Lampooning the brilliant Manchiurian candidate, Stiller here has made his finest film to date. The film is that brilliant, that, apart from Dodgeball, every film he's been in has been hugely disappointing. And it doesn't help either that he's been promising a sequel to this for years.Why is it so brilliant? Stiller isn't the best looking person in the world, but he convinces as Zoolander, he and Wilson convince as supermodels, and it just makes a mockery of the fashion world.Do the many cameos of the fashion world not know that this film is contradicting everything a supermodel stands for? And it all starts with his face....The cast are brilliant, the cameos are surreal and hilarious, and Ferrell is brilliant as Mugatu.It has a strong similarity to the 60's movie Danger: Diabolik, but it doesn't rip the film off, it just pleasantly homages the film.It's still pretty fresh after nearly 13 years, but Stiller could be a one trick pony.His other films are pretty lame.</fullReview>

I was hoping for a few laughs (which I honestly did get in the end), but I ended up having to sit through a giant lump of crap.I am a big Ben Stiller fan, and Will Ferrell fan, and Owen Wilson fan, but why the hell would they make a movie like this? This is the kind of crap that Sacha Baron Cohen would make, but when he does it I actually laugh throughout most of the movie. Zoolander features way too many attempts at humor, but fails far too often.If you are looking for a fun, enjoyable comedy... this isn't it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a terrific film. Brilliant. I don't know how mister Stiller did this, but that's it and that's all. Forget about Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Godfather, Rear Window, forget them. Forget contemporary classics like Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight, There Will Be Blood, Memento. Ben Stiller did the greatest film of all times here, without a shadow of doubt. Saying otherwise means that you suffered a brainwash, even more evilesque than the one Zoolander suffered. In fact, Will Ferrell dancing and yelling 'kill the Malaysian leader!' with a blue background would look like a good dream, compared with the brainwash you suffered. Even more, dare I say.This film, vastly underrated, deserves at least one Oscar by year only for homages. Ben Stiller deserved the Nobel for Human Sciences here, and also a Nobel of literature, obviously by helping to create a script that could easily beat any book created by Freud, Dostoyevsky or Shakespeare. He deserves. I am afraid that I'm going to watch Zoolander for the rest of my life, because there is no piece of cinema made before, after or whats ever worth watching after that. Bravo! A film that for once, made me feel like a genius!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is not the type of movie you like instantly, it's the kind that grows on you. The more you see it, the funnier it gets. The piece is not kind on the fashion industry and least of all on male models, but it's fun as hell.It's difficult to explain what is good about it when you can't name any single aspect as a commanding thread. The enjoyment itself derives from a number of little things. The whole walk-off scene is a good example. The editing isn't miraculous but it's right. The music isn't perfect, but it's good. The acting isn't superb, but it works well. It's the meshing of every little pieces that makes that scene and its sarcasm totally hilarious.You want to see something offbeat, with odd humor, a silly story, and plenty of caricatures? This is probably a good movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Genuine Slap-Stick Entertainer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stationery Warning: 'Zoolander' is NOT meant for the Pseudo Intellulectuals nor is it for those who prefer black-comedies. 'Zoolander' is non-stop, non-sense, yet funny &amp; lively. Sure, it's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it hits the right points on more than one or two occasions. 'Zoolander' Synopsis: At the end of his career, a clueless fashion model is brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia.Late Drake Sather, John Hamburg &amp; Ben Stiller's Screenplay is wild, funny &amp; nuts. The characters, the situations, the entire execution, everything is either over-the-top or completely zany. Yet, it raises the correct amount of hilarious moments, that make this one a genuine slap-stick entertainer. Stiller's Direction, on the other-hand, is fast. Cinematography, Editing &amp; Art Design, are appropriate. Costume Design, is quite good. Performance-Wise: Stiller is superb as Zoolander. He plays the dimwitted model, with great energy. Christine Taylor supports well. Owen Wilson is astonishing as Zoolander's opposition. He brings the house down with his impeccable comic-timing. Will Ferrell is funnily menacing. Milla Jovovich is perfect. Jon Voight &amp; David Duchovny are memorable in brief roles. Others lend good support. On the whole, 'Zoolander' has, and will always, appeal to those, who relish slap-stick comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Funny Comedy- Still One of Ben Stiller's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Zoolander" holds a special place in my heart because it was the first theatrically released film I saw after 9/11. It was just one of those laugh-out-loud movies I needed to see, although I didn't know it when I paid for my movie ticket. I just came to the movie theater not expecting much other than a few pretty-good trailers I saw online, and ended up nearly falling out of my seat laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it.Ben Stiller really nails the character of Derek Zoolander and doesn't miss a beat. Zoolander is an incredibly ignorant individual, but not entirely stupid. His intentions are good, although sometimes misguided, and it makes for some really good comedy. The scene where he throws the miniature model of a building to the ground is still absolutely funny even though I know the scene by heart. Stiller really takes that scene and sells it.Christine Taylor is also incredibly good in her role. This was probably the role for her where she stopped being known as "the woman who played Marsha Brady in the movies", yet her resemblance to Maureen McCormack is still very striking. No matter, she played someone who was convincingly smart, and she played a great straight man (or woman) to Stiller and the equally ignorant Owen Wilson.Was this film perfect? Of course not, but I still liked it better than many film critics did at the time. Richard Roeper, a film critic whom I usually agree with, hated this film. Roeper said that the film made fun of male models when they really make fun of themselves in reality, using Fabio as an example. However, I saw this film not so much making fun of male models specifically, or even models themselves, but more the fashion industry and its seemingly self-centered nature. I also thought it was a great and unexpected way for VH1, who partially produced the film, to make fun of their pre-"I Love The '80's" image. Sure, the celebrity cameos were a bit much at times, but they really didn't overshadow the overall humor and appeal of the movie (at least not to this reviewer).The other problem critics had with this movie was using Malasia as a major plot point, and not a fictional country. In reality, Malasia has been democratic for decades, and is considered a U.S. ally. The critics probably have a point here, but at the same time, Malasia wasn't being made fun of in this movie, nor were there any hurtful, low-brow attempts at humor through racial stereotyping. Using a fictional country probably would have been better, but no movie is perfect.Despite the bad reviews, "Zoolander" went on to find an audience, particularly when it was released on video. I hear people my age quoting lines from the movie all the time, and the main people in the cast have gone on to bigger and better things. It's just that funny a movie, and I'm glad I'm not the only person that thinks so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stiller Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Did you ever think that there was more to life than being really really really ridiculously good-looking?" - Derek Zoolander. ZOOLANDER (directed by Ben Stiller, co-written by Ben Stiller, starring Ben Stiller) is Ben Stiller's best film. Ever. Did I mention Ben Stiller? Written by Stiller, Drake Sather and John Hamburg, ZOOLANDER follows Stiller, as the eponymous Derek Zoolander, a "really really really good-looking" male model, three-time winner of the Male Model of the Year Award, on his journey of self-discovery, from self-involved Male Model who trademarked the "looks" Ferrari, Le Tigre, and of course, Blue Steel (I've always been a fan!), to the realization that his good looks and incredibly chiseled abs could be used in founding The Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good. Existing on minimal brain activity, Derek lives with three other Male Models, apparently as intelligence-challenged as he, Brint, Rufus and Meekus. When they all meet a grisly end in a gas station explosion, Derek calls it a "freak accident" in his "eugoogly" - the fact that they were effeminately hosing each other with gasoline (in characteristic slow motion Male Model idiom) and then lighting a cigarette doesn't solve the mystery. So begins Derek's journey through the seedy underbelly of Male Modeling - Malaysian child labor for stylish slacks, the assassination of Kennedy by two lookers on the grassy knoll, and his own brainwashing by crooked fashion designer, Mugatu (Will Ferrell, as outr as he wants to be, in poodle haircut and petulance flamb), to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister who opposes child labor laws (because that would stop the flow of stylish slacks). Derek's subliminal signal ? of all things ? is eighties dance-slash-gay hit, Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.Along the way, he must face-off (or "walk-off," as the Male Modeling case may be) a new youngblood uber-hippie toy-boy, Hansel (Owen Wilson). When Derek loses Male Model of the Year to Hansel, in an attempt to desperately re-flame his career, he accepts an assignment from Mugatu, and all posing breaks loose. Who knew THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE would end up down Derek Zoolander's tight trousers?Investigative journalist, Matilda (Stiller's delectable real-life wife, Christine Taylor, eternally Marcia Brady), must save Derek from Mugatu's plot, and seek asylum with Derek's mortal enemy, Hansel, whom they discover idolizes Derek. Will Ferrell is so funny in this movie as crooked fashion icon, Mugatu, that we were all fooled into thinking he was a comedian. Until film-makers made the mistake of letting him star in his own movies... (UNRELATED SIDE-NOTE. Mugato: continually mispronounced as "Mugatu" by Captain Kirk on STAR TREK episode No. 45 A Private Little War, the Mugato was a goofy carnivore-ape-thing resembling an albino version of The Rhino (a fruity supervillain from Spiderman comics), that put Kirk in a coma).Jerry Stiller (Ben's real dad) is Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent; Jon Voight is Derek's miner dad, ashamed of his son being a mermaid in a commercial (MerMAN! MerMAN!). Roaring cameos by David Bowie, Billy Zane, Fabio; David Duchovny appears, unrecognizable, to mumble about - what else? - conspiracy.An insensate homage to insensate Male Models everywhere, ZOOLANDER is one of the funniest comedies ever made, because it never loses its way in the third act, where many laugh-a-minute movies turn into drama or chase films. ZOOLANDER gleefully retains its flamboyant extremism and piles on the idiocy to the very last frame ? the fountain dedicated to Derek's tragically deceased Male Model friends, splishing only water from their stone petrol hoses this time, sploshing out front of The Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good And Who Wanna Learn To Do Other Stuff Good Too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film would have to be one of the funniest movies released for its time. Unlike many silly comedies where the previews show you the only humorous parts of the film, this movie was funny the whole way through. The casting is just perfect. Ben Stiller is hilariously suited to the role, the way he speaks and moves and his facial expressions are just dynamite. Every time I see his face in the film I laugh. Owen Wilson is likewise perfect in his part, as are the rest of the cast. I like this movie because it is different, with an original plot and actors that support the plot rather than taking away from it. None of the characters are too large, the acting is just spot on for each person. I highly recommend this film for a good chuckle. It is so silly but so clever at the same time. My absolute favourite part? Derek's "Eugoogely" speak regarding a eulogy. He is so adorably clueless and this scene is hilarious, especially when he comes back to the "eugoogely" later in the film.</fullReview>

Anyone who doesn't like this movie hasn't really seen it. Male modeling isn't something anyone ever thinks about. I think it is amazing how they portray the male models in this movie. With gasoline fights and fighting over what hair gel to wear this movie tops them all. If you can remember anything from this movie remember this: "Merman Pop, MER-MAN!". Will Ferrel is also so great in this movie. "Relax Don't Do It.". That song gets stuck in my head and I don't even know the words. If you are in a very silly mood and you want to laugh at something stupid, don't watch Borat or Jackass, watch the classic De-Rek Zoo-Lan-Derrr...Zoolander!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very funny film, that's really entertaining, a typical Ben Stiller Comedy, I absolutely loved it!. All the characters are great, and the story while ridiculous was quite hilarious, plus Ben Stiller is simply amazing in this!. Stiller had a really funny accent, and Ben and his father Jerry obviously had a hoot working together, plus the only thing I didn't like about this film was Will Ferrell's performance it just wasn't funny in my opinion, plus Stiller and his real life wife Christine Taylor worked very well together surprisingly. It's very well made and written, and the fashion suits Stiller and Owen Wilson wore cracked me up, plus it has so many cool cameo's as well!. The walk off between Stiller and Owen Wilson was especially funny, and all the characters were extremely likable (except for Ferrell's), plus the ending was very silly but still quite funny. This should be higher then 6.1 in my opinion, and the the mining segment with Stiller and Voight was also quite funny, plus it has some really awesome gags in it too. This is a very funny film, that's really entertaining, a typical Ben Stiller Comedy, I absolutely loved it, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Ben Stiller does a great! job here with solid camera work, fine angles and just keeping the film hilarious and at a very fast pace. The Acting is lots of fun!. Ben Stiller is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely hilarious, had a cool wacky accent, obviously had a blast playing the part, had some wacky costumes, and had some really funny scenes with Owen Wilson,He is one of the best Comedy guys out there! (Stiller Rules!!!!!!!). Owen Wilson is really funny here, he works so well with Stiller, and was rather unlikable at 1st, but became really funny near the end, I loved him!. Christine Taylor is incredibly gorgeous and does excellent in her role here as the reporter,she played it straight, and had good chemistry with Stiller,I really liked her. Will Ferrell is OK but rather unfunny, for me sometimes he's on, but a lot of the time he's off, here he was off, as I actually didn't laugh at all, he just over does it. Milla Jovovich was OK, but was too serious for me to enjoy,she's good looking though. Jerry Stiller is hilarious in his role, he had some great scenes with Stiller. David Duchovny and Jon Voight are funny in there small roles. Donald Trump,Christian Slater,Cuba Gooding Jr.,Tommy Hilfiger,Natalie Portman,Fabio,Lenny Kravitz,Gwen Stefani,Heidi Klum,Paris Hilton,David Bowie,Fred Durst,Lance Bass,Kimberly 'Lil' Kim' ,Claudia Schiffer,Vince Vaughn,Billy Zane and Winona Ryder all do great in there Cameo's.

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Zoolander</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am five years late. Just as I was so prepared to watch a Ben Stiller caper, with the posters all up at local theaters, the movie disappeared from the radar, and was banned in Singapore. Why? Because the plot was about a fashion model being brainwashed ala The Manchurian Candidate to assassinate the Malaysian Prime Minister.Why? Because Malaysia was being used as a sweatshop that hires child labor to manufacture cheap garments created by the western fashion houses, and they are not happy that the PM has outlawed working children. Hence the insane sounding plot right in the beginning. However, someone forgot to tell Ben that the Malaysian footage didn't look like Malaysia, but more like Tiananmen Square. Where got wave banners like that? Got space meh? But since we're friendly neighbors of Malaysia, when they banned it, we banned it too, to show solidarity.Anyway, for refusing to watch illegal downloaded copies, I was finally rewarded when GV decided to screen it here (no more ban? why now?) for a limited period, even though I suspect since it's a Village Roadshow production, why let it collect dust in the archives? Ben Stiller co-created and plays Derek Zoolander, male model of the year 3 times in a row, with that killer Blue Steel look - an anal retentive look which actually seduces and is popular with the crowd. As most would already know, this comedy parodies almost everything about the fashion industry, like how himbotic male models can be, and amplified that dumbness more than 100%. Zoolander loses his crown to up and coming male model Hansel (played by Owen Wilson with long flowing locks, surfer dude style), and decides to retire.But since the chief villain and fashion guru Mugatu (Will Ferrell) requires a dim-witted model to be his assassin (they have buff muscular bodies, and listen to instructions), his assistant Katinka (Milla Jovovich, yummy) brings Zoolander to a secret day spa to be brainwashed, and ready to be a killing machine during the opening of the Derelicte line of clothes.Real life Mrs Stiller Christine Taylor plays Matilda, a nosy journalist who tails Zoolander to try and get to Mugatu, and gets entangled in the assassination plot. But don't worry, the storyline isn't as complex as I've described. It's filled with plenty of insane subplots and scenes, like Zoolander's retirement decision to join his dad and brother (Jon Voight, and an uncredited Vince Vaughn, who doesn't speak a word), an orgy of sorts with dwarfs, and even a walk-off competition between Zoolander and Hansel, with closure that comes straight out of Stephen Chow's campy movies.The real scream actually comes from the dozens of cameo appearances of the who's-who in the fashion and entertainment industry. Just as a flavor, there's Karl Lagerfield, Donald Trump, Tom Ford, Natalie Portman (who declares her love for Zoolander), Winona Ryder (who tries to seduce Zoolander), Gwen Stefani, Heidi Klum, Fabio, Fred Durst, Paris Hilton (!), Victoria Beckham, and even Billy Zane. You can refer to IMDb to get the entire list of credited and uncredited appearances. But what's the icing on the cake is David Duchovny's role as an X-File-ish character straight from his Fox Mulder days. Simply brought back the memories, in a funny way, including the many 80s and 90s pop music injected into the movie.So for those who have held out to finally experience Zoolander's new Magnum look, this is your chance. The movie might be dated, but it sure doesn't feel that way. Great fun.</fullReview>

To top that off, his best friends die in a freak gasoline fight accident, reporter Matilda Jeffries(Taylor) is writing mean articles about Derek and he is being brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia by fashion guru Jacobim Mugatu(Ferrell) and his assistant Katinka Ogoboginaghahada(Jovovich). Of course, Derek is stupid beyond belief, so he can't figure out that he's being brainwashed, so Matilda and hand model J.P. Pruitt(Duchovny) help him along the way. There are over a hundred cameos in this film, which all add to the zaniness. This is one laugh after another, especially when his friends have the gasoline fight, which is a classic scene! my rating....90%. PG-13 for sexuality and dirty humor. 83 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone has seen a male model before whether it's on the side of a bus, in a magazine, or on TV. They are the icons of glamour, good looks, and power. They have the power to persuade a person to buy a product. But what really goes on in the life of a male model? Well, this movie probably gives the most ridiculous answer...but it doesn't matter.Zoolander is about a male model named Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), who is famous for his looks called Blue Steel, Ferrari, and his best kept secret...Magnum. All together they are the same look; sunken cheeks, puckered lips, and eyes that could look through walls. Derek is on top of the modeling world, winning awards, getting the best designers, and not knowing what is going on. His world and the entire modeling scene are about to be rocked by the rising star Hansel (Owen Wilson) who is now considered the top model over Derek. Derek doesn't realize this until it's much too late.Behind these heroes of the runway are the designers like Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) and Mugatu (Will Ferrell). In wake of Derek's model friend's dreadful gasoline fight that went wrong, Derek has retired. Mugatu's plan is to trick Derek into modeling for his new line of clothing and at the same time be brainwashed into killing the Malaysian Prime Minister because he has closed down Mugatu's child labor factory. Derek is torn between modeling and helping a beautiful reporter named Matilda (Christine Taylor) get her story on Mugatu and working for Mugatu to get back at Hansel.The movie is very entertaining with all of it's characters and storyline. Stiller is priceless as the 'no so bright' Zoolander and his performance is complimented by Wilson and Ferrell. Of course Ben brings all of his friends into the movie. Wilson and Ferrell have parts and as does buddy Vince Vaughn as his brother. This group of comedy kings have been making movies together for a while now and the hits just keep on coming. With other members of the "Laugh Pack" here and there (like Luke Wilson), their movies will always keep the laughs coming.Zoolander is a great movie to watch anytime. It really does make you laugh. Watching Stiller, Willson, and Ferrell work their magic is a wonderful thing. Just like his father, Ben is a laugh riot. His father Jerry also holds his own in this film. Stiller delivers once again. All together, Zoolander walks the walk and talks the talk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I'll ever understand why this movie got such bad reviews. Too stupid for most critics? Whatever. Zoolander is a consistently hilarious movie.Ben Stiller should have more parts like this. It reminded me of some of the hilarious stuff he did on his show (no, I didn't watch it when it was first on, but I did buy the DVD when it came out). I was so glad to see him break the "There's Something About Mary" mold of nice, regular schlub who keeps having hilariously bad luck. Derek Zoolander was miles away from this stock character. He was a brazenly stupid man who got the good fortune of having ridiculously good looks, but he couldn't even turn left! One of the funniest things I've ever seen was the scene early on when he was beaten for best male model by Hansel (He's so hot right now), but just walks up to the stage anyway, completely clueless about his loss (despite the fact that the loudspeaker keeps booming "Hansel" over and over again as he's walking up. That electronic billboard he passed by with the words "Confused Loser Zoolander Tries To Steal Award" was classic. I thought that the movie actually had a lot of smartly written jokes.The supporting cast was great too, particularly Will Ferrell as Mugatu, who almost stole the movie (like he usually does). And Owen Wilson was great as Hansel, and so was Ben's dad Jerry Stiller. Christine Taylor was fine as the love interest, but she didn't really have much to do except react to the idiocy that was going on around her. I also liked the smaller parts, like Milla Jovovich as Katinka, and Jon Voigt as Derek's not-too-proud dad (his reaction to Derek's merman commercial, and Derek's subsequent reaction, was priceless), and David Duchovny, spoofing his character on "X-Files" and in the bargain doing the funniest spoof of the show I've ever seen. The cast was good all around, and even though I thought the movie fell apart a bit toward the end (I think it was the orgy at Hansel's place that started to lose me... I couldn't see Christine Taylor's character changing so abruptly), the laughs kept going to the end, and as a comedy, as well as a satire of the modeling business, I thought it performed admirably on the whole. Like I said, I think Ben Stiller should do more movies like this; for the first time in a while, I think we saw in this how much of a comedic genius he truly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dumb comedies, are proving to produce quite some cluttered genre. Some, like Dumb And Dumber, hit the mark. Others, such as Dude, Where's My Car?, miss by a mile. Ben Stiller's pet project falls somewhere between the two. That said, the performances from the billed leads are very good. Stiller is effectively amusing as the self-obsessed Derek. Owen Wilson is absolutely outstanding as scooter-sporting stoner Hansel in a role that was written specifically for him. Sure, he's playing a version of himself and you'll probably have seen him do a very similar turn in Shanghai Noon. Milla Jovovich is woefully underused as the Rosa Klebb-like Hench-woman but the epitome of unfunny badness here is Will Ferrell. With an villain that somehow crosses Diamonds Are Forever's gay hit-man Mr Kint with Dr Evil.Okay, so it's not the most sophisticated or consistently funny film you're likely to see but Zoolander will tickle your ribs on many occasions and as one man shows go, it's all to Ben Stiller's credit after the mauling he received for Cable Guy. If you like "A night at the Roxbury" "Dodgeball" and "Old School" than you will like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***may contain spoilers*** I am a huge Ben Stiller fan. I love pretty much all of his movies with the exception of Envy. I had never seen this movie in theaters and had never watched it on television until one nite my cousin told me how funny it was. So we watched it and we could not stop laughing our asses off. I mean this movie is so incredibly stupid it just makes it hilarious. I think that what really makes it funny is the fact that everyone in this movie remained serious. Dry Humor is just the best. Owen Wilson really stepped it up a notch, and I was glad that they managed to team up with each other at the end. The entire movie was just ridiculous and funny. I suggest you watch it...but please, don't look for a story line, your probably not gonna find one. 10/10</fullReview>

I'm not sure where to begin with the laughs, but there are all kinds of good insider jokes along with the blatantly obvious laughs that it sets out to do. The runway showdown is priceless and Will Ferrell once again quietly steals the show with his over the top character Mugatu. The plot is weak and the story almost has a point but it's only a vehicle to get the jokes. Overall, this movie is a great parody of the modeling world and will make you laugh. You have to look past the stupidity but if you are watching this and expecting some type of Oscar winner you will be sadly disappointed. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say first that this is probably my most favorite Ben Stiller movie to date. It of course has limited appeal due to its someone weird sense of humor, lots of stupid jokes, etc... etc...Basically, it is about Derek Zoolander, a male model, who has lost everything that he had (which is pretty much one award) and is then brainwashed to kill the Malaysian prime minister. In the end, he doesn't due to a odd twist of event, and if has VERY stupid ending. He pulls oh his "super" look called Magnum which magically stops a throwing star from kill the prime minister.Over all, the plot kinda... sucks, but the humor is good for those who like it.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander is a fading male model. When beaten by rival Hansel for VH1's male model of the year award - he quits the business to find his roots. Meanwhile - the Malaysian PM is crusading to end sweat shops. Mugatu, an evil fashion designer, decides to brainwash Zoolander to make him assassinate the PM. Logicial... isn't it!This movie is dumb fun. You won't be using more than 3% brain activity watching this. Both the leads are likable and charismatic. I love the orange mocha frappichino fight scene! There are some classic lines in this film and some great cameos.The movie tends to drag (towards the end) - and the love interest is unnecessary. But this seems to be the symptom of most 90 minute American comedies! They all seem to get bogged down in morals and trying to put forward a message...Anyhows - this is dumb, non-offensive fun (for the most part).</fullReview>

How can you not like a movie about male models that owes more to The Manchurian Candidate than Ready to Wear? Pitting 5'2" Owen Wilson against 4'11" Ben Stiller for the title of Male Model of the Year? Tyson Beckford holding Zoolander's spittoon during the Walk-Off? Billy Zane in one of the best self-referential cameos of all time? This is a surprisingly amusing and thoroughly funny film. Most movies hit an early stride and die at the end, while this one finds ways to amuse all the way through. Just when you think it's all over (the "2001" reference does not bode well late in the movie), you get break dance fighting and Mugatu's desperate monologue about crazy pills and the piano key necktie. Get some popcorn, a six pack and a good ounce and relax in front of a funny, funny film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wonder what that 'six' rating is all about ...This is a movie I have watched several times, and every time the overall silliness gets to me. The wonderfully goofy mock-intellectual conversations among the models, the recurring misunderstandings caused by differences in a model's skewed grasp on things and the actual reality surrounding them, microscopic cell phones .. it's just funny as hell. Owen Wilson, whose life consists of a series of gadgets, fads, drugs and leisure time only, Ben Stiller taking a trophy he did not actually win (Michael Jackson should have been hosting that ceremony ..). It's all good enough for me.What I appreciate even more about this movie is the visual perfection. So much work has been invested into creating interesting sets and locations, great lighting and camera work, with the weird 'indoctrination sequence' in the day spa taking the cake. The great number of cameos adds to the mix - "Put a cork in it, Zane!".Anyway, always enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. You can delve for deeper layers, like Ben tries to do for a day with the equally spike-haired relatives ("I'm not a professional television or movie actor!" - Jon Voight), but that's probably not what this movie was made for.For entertainment, comedy and production values, I will happily concede an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched Zoolander, I was a little immature. So I did not like it. Zoolander is not a movie for the immature. It is a movie for people with a wonderful sense of humor and a great knowledge of current events. It is for those who like stupid humor, however you have to be pretty witty to understand many of the jokes. A few months ago, and a few years after seeing it for the first time, I watched Zoolander again. And I was stumped as to how I did not enjoy it the first time I watched it. I do not think that I have ever watched a movie where I have laughed throughout the entire film, and Zoolander did this to me. There are so many hidden jokes, and it is absolutely hilarious. My stomache hurt from laughter while I was watching it. And even though I have seen the movie about a million times more, I still laugh just as hard every time. Everyone in my school quotes Zoolander. I have never met anyone that is smart and witty that has said that Zoolander is a bad movie. It is a new culture! Zoolander will truly become a piece of cinematic history. The acting is wonderful and the actors were chosen brilliantly. No one could have made a better stupid male model than Ben Stiller. And his long time movie partner, Owen Wilson, made the movie perfect.The movie is so wonderful and I recommend it to anyone who has a good sense of humor, otherwise, do not watch it, because you will think it is lame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have noticed this movie divides people as much as anything as. Love it or loath it; there is no middle-ground. Zoolander offers a much-needed dose of self-deprecation and absurdity that Hollywood so often lacks. Even comedy nowadays exits only in a self contained world that takes itself too serious. If you're not into Monty Python (or ever could be), you're likely to hate this film. However if you can stand a movie mocking its subject matter (fashion-world) as much as it does it self, you're gonna love it. All this besides; this is the most quotable movie since the Big Lebowski. If that doesn't flick your switch, we're not from the same planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT!!Rated PG-13 for Sexual Content and Drug ReferencesGenre: ComedyStar Rating: ****1/2 out of 5Zoolander is one of the most wackiest Ben Stiller comedy I have ever seen! In this movie Ben Stiller plays a male model named Derek Zoolander who has a big competition with another male model named Hansel (Owen Wilson). After Derek Zoolander lost the male model award at the VH1 Awards and then his three best friends die in a gas fight accident he decides to retire. But after when Derek retires his boss Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) offers him to join Jacobin Mugatu (Will Ferrell) agency. So when Derek joins Mugatu's campaign he gets brainwashed after being in a day spa and getting brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia! By brainwashing Zoolander, Mugatu and his evil associate Katinka (Milla Jovovich) create a dumb and willing killer to do the job. Only in Time Magazine journalist Matilda (Christine Taylor) suspicion arises slowly, and she tries to stop Derek. Later in the movie Derek and Hansel start having a friendship between each other. One of my favorite parts was when Derek was working down in the mines and when he was about to make another strike with a pick ax he accidentally lets go and throws at. Another part I liked was they were showing Derek at the day spa and he was listening to relax and they were showing this crazy video at the same time! I thought this movie was hilarious!BOTTOM LINE: THERE ARE MORE THINGS IN LIFE THAN BEING REALLY REALLY GOOD LOOKING!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is not comedy perfection, nor is it a total waste of space. In fact it comes in just above average because when it is funny, it is laugh out loud funny. Not surprisingly, when you have Ben Stiller turning in another great performance! He is a bit of a master at this type of role though and some may say that it gets tiring seeing the same kind of humour being churned out again and again. People were turning against Jim Carrey and Robin WIlliams for the same comedy showcases again and again before they defied expectations and went against the grain. It shows that they can do more than just comedy and gain a betetr critical reception for it!! Anyway back to the subject - Zoolander is a little reminiscent of the Austin POwers movies with its over the top set pieces and pantomimic villains however it works when the storyline is just as ridiculous!Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male model who's star is falling whilst OWen Wilson (Stiller's regular sidekick) rises to international fame as Hansel, the stealer of Zoolander's Male MOdel OF The Year crown. They are both portrayed as stupid himbos who have to rely on the brains of a female Time Magazine reporter when Zoolander is brainwashed to kill the Malaysian prime minister by a villainous fashion designer (Will Ferrell, deliciously camp). Part of the joy of this film is watching out for the cameo appearances..Jon Voight, Winona Ryder and Builly Zane have larger roles whilst you can also see Victoria BEckham, Paris HIlton on the down side!! The scene when Zoolanders mermaid advert is screened in a miners village with his dad and brothers [present is priceless and probably my favourite part of the film but also look out for the calendar and the MAgnum...You will be trying hard not to laugh..Give it a go. Great performances, lively show pieces, a good soundtrack and it aint exactly a long film film - 80 minutes! whats wrong with a bit of familiarity now and again anyway?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps this movie doesn't quite work for Americans or people who lack an appreciation of dry humour. Personally, I loved it, as I have loved all of Ben Stiller's movies. It seems that most people who dislike prefer movies such as Meet the Parents, which is very watchable, but has none of the freshness of impact that Mystery Men had. I have watched this several times now, and am always delighted with the construction of an alternative reality for this discrete group of fashion bods. What makes it so clever is that it is seamless - it depicts a world view that is ludicrous, but hangs together very well, and from the outside looking in, we can get the same feeling as anthropologists examining an early culture. We are fascinated, repelled, amused. Enough of the high faluting mumbo jumbo - it is just fun! I don't expect everyone to 'get it' or like it - I am just damn well happy it was made so that I could appreciate it.</fullReview>

Furthermore, there's Owen Wilson, a terrible actor. He screwed up Eddie Murphy's comeback "I SPY", did such a bad work on The Royal Tenenbaums (which I hated also).But I was disappointed with Ben Stiller. He's a really good actor, how could he accept such a job?! Was he needing money? He was terrific in "There's Something About Mary", "Meet the Parents" and so on, and the was good in Zoolander also, but the movie was too dumn. I even felt that I got a little dummer after I watched it. Don't waist your time watching it: grab a Simpsons DVD or go read a book that you'll feel much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zoolander" is a hysterical movie that has non-stop laughs and endless memorable quotes. I'm not kidding when everyone had told me that "Zoolander" was one of the funniest movies they'd ever seen, so I had to give it a chance. I'm really glad I did.Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson give a parody on male super models that is beyond tears of laughter. Ben Stiller plays "Derek Zoolander", a 3 time "Male Model of the Year" award winner, when his streak of wins is stopped by Owen's character, Hansel, he starts to doubt his career and wants to go back home with his father and brothers as a mine worker. He pretty much fails due to the lack of his being used to high maintenance type of environment with clear air and less, well, work. When his father tells him that he's no longer part of the family, Ben gets the offer of his career or so he thinks. Will Ferrel plays Mogotu, an evil model agency owner who is trying to kill the prime minister of Molesia so he can continue to have children make his clothes. He figures people would assume that Derrek has lost it with his career so he can easily frame him and brainwash him into killing the prime minister for him. When a journalist played by Ben Stiller's wife, Christine Taylor, Matilda finds out about this, she tries to save Derrek by hiding him "where no one would know he's there", hence at Hansel's house. Hansel is very forgiving and confesses that he was wack and Derrek was his inspiration to be a model and Derrek claims his wack of being jealous. There they have strong tea and learn of the lacking in Matilda's love life and why she hates models. Hansel playfully says "I think we should get naked... don't talk, just give into the power of the tea". Followed by a very strange but amusing orgy where Derrek just happens to fall for Matilda. But Derrek will NOT miss a show and there is a certain "relax"ing music that will cause him to kill the prime minister of Molesia! Can he make it past the beautiful celebrities and save the day? Ben, Owen, Will, and Christine work perfectly together in this great comedy about male super models. This movie has non stop laughs and you'll immediately buy it when you see it. If you can't laugh at this movie and it's amazing rounds of cameo's, I don't know what's wrong, because this movie doesn't deserve to be under a 7.0. Trust me, this is a great movie!9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A full-length movie based on a character for a five minute spoof film Ben Stiller created for a fashion awards show several years ago. Does that sound like something you want to watch all the way through? Didn't think so. There are some occasional laughs (or were they smirks?) with the "cameo recognitions", like Farrell's character, Vince Vaughn still stuck in the hometown mines, or Duchovny spoofing his old series as a "spooked, washed up hand model", but the humor just doesn't hold up over an hour and 40 minutes. Hell, it doesn't even hold up for 15 minutes.Recommended only for Ben Stiller fanatics and/or Victoria's Secret models looking to unwind after a tough day of walking around with 45 pound angel wings strapped to your back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small, perfectly formed satire on the fashion industry... and movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, because Derek Zoolander, Hansel and the other male models are characterised as being people of very little brain, the whole movie has been characterised as "mindless humour" or "stupidity humour" or "teenage fratboy humour". Well, I'm sorry but I just don't see it. I do, however, see a witty, sharply written and very funny movie so jam packed with visual jokes that you don't dare take your eyes off the screen. (I liked for example the calendar in which Zoolander demonstrated his "versatility".)Wilson plays Hansel very well but Stiller as Zoolander is absolutely pitch perfect, with not a single facial muscle out of place for the maximal comic effect.In fact it's less a satire on the fashion industry than it is a satire of high concept movies. Apart from the obvious hommage to 2001: A Space Odyssey at one point, certain elements are included so you can laugh about how they would appear an a serious film - such as Jon Voight cheering his son on as he watches him on TV. Some great cameos, some of them you are surprised don't take themselves as seriously as you think. (Winona Ryder talking to Zoolander about what it's like to make a complete fool of yourself in public was just, well, weird, in retrospect.)One of the very few films nowadays not to outstay its welcome, at less than ninety minutes it does what it has to do and then gets out.A superb soundtrack adds to the atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zoolander too hard!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many scenes in "Zoolander" that try so hard to capture the American Pie "dirty funny" thing, when the writers should have just forgotten that and let it be. Zoolander is a very funny movie, but it's hidden under all of the sex jokes that don't work as well.Stiller does comedy well, but he did better in Meet the Parents, and Owen Wilson was funnier (and more interesting) in The Royal Tenenbaums.And what's with all the star cameos? There are so many cameos from the likes of Cuba Gooding Jr., Natalie Portman and Billy Zane, and they're really out of place.Funny movie, 6/10, I'd have given it a higher rating, but there are so many out of place scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilariously funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest comedies I've seen. A true spoof of the male modeling industry and how models behave humorously in the world around them. Ben Stiller was funny-weird but not funny-ha hah as the clothing and catalog model zoolander. The real reason I loved this movie was for Will Farrel's hilarious performance as the villain. I only remember laughing this hard seeing this as I did on "My Cousin Vinny". Half of the friends and relatives I know who saw this liked it. Zoolander is a well written spoof on modeling and fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly solid comedy with inspired moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty smart film that masquerades as a spoof of male fashion (who needed to spoof that, anyway) but is really a satire of Western culture on some levels. On other levels, it's mostly straightforward physical comedy, but there is enough visual quality and the actors are also good, so this is well pulled off. Stiller is over the top as the model who uncovers an international cartel who use male models to assassinate world leaders (this is all in the first 30 minutes, folks). He appears in many scenes with his father, and their chemistry is excellent. Ferrell is excellent and also way over the top as the cartel's lead muscle man/world famous designer. There were 2 really funny scenes I don't want to give away, but what really cracked me up here was how straight Jon Voight played his character, and it is his character if you know what I mean. The movie never took a blink from a straight approach to his "I'm a rugged coal miner whose son is a flamboyant male model" role, and I applaud it for its judgement.Not a great movie that it perhaps aimed to be, but easily the best mainstream American comedy I've seen since "Austin Powers".</fullReview>

I hope that Ben continues to make, star in and direct movies HIS way - because the talent is obvious to those who see beyond traditional "comedic acting" and understand his zany sense of humor. Duchovny's part was genius! Owen Wilson - hilarious! And as for slamming Will Farrel - get a life ! How silly and funny is he in this movie? Look at his hairdo!

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller is laugh out loud hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is laugh out loud hilarious in "Zoolander". Its a story about a male model, when he fails to win the "Male Model of the Year" award for the forth straight time, he ventures out to find out who he is. The winner of the award, Hansel (Owen Wilson), starts to become extremely famous, while Derek Zoolander, is becoming a nothing. When Magatu (Will Ferrell), discovers how stupid Derek is, he brainwashes him to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. There are many parts that make you laugh so hard your about to cry. One for example, when Derek's friends are fighting Derek yells "Stop it!" " Don't you think there is more to life than being really, really, really ridicuolusly good looking. I mean, maybe we should do something more meaningful with our lives, like helping people" His friend replies "Uh, Derek, what people?" Derek then throws up his hands in disguist saying, "I don't know, people who need help!" This is one of the many laugh out loud lines in this movie. Another one, when his friends die in a freak gasoline fight accident, Derek gives a speech at their funeral, his starting line is "Brint, Meekus, and Prince were like brothers to me. And when I say brother, I don't mean like an actual brother, but I mean it in the way black people use it, it's just more meaningful I think" The funniest scene in this movie is the "Walkoff" scene, when Hansel and Derek go head to head in a walkoff.There are many star cameos in this movie, such as Wionna Ryder, David Duchovney, Natalie Portman, and Cuba Gooding Jr. The whole Stiller family is in this movie as well. Ben Stiller's dad, Jerry Stiller, plays his good friend and proud owner of "Ball's Models", Morrie Ballsteen. Also, you can spot Ben Stiller's mother as the woman throwing an egg at Magatu in the third scene.This movie is a must see. Each scene has atleast five laugh out loud laughs and the fun never stops. If you read Roger Ebert's review on this movie, don't trust him, he is definetely 100% wrong. I saw "Mr. Deeds" a week ago. I liked it, but Ben Stiller is ten times as funny as Adam Sandler could ever be. This movie is non-stop fun, you must see it. Now I usually don't give many movies, especially comedies, four stars but "Zoolander" deserves it. A blast!**** out of **** </fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first went to see this movie in the theater, I didn't think it was that great at all, sure it had it's funny moments, but the plot wasn't all that great and I just wasn't into it. I saw it a second time with some different friends and liked it much more, I caught a few more lines, and it really hit me how ridiculously outrageous the movie really is. I then saw it a third, fourth, fifteenth, etc time :) I will now have to say this is probably my favorite comedy of all time. I love Ben Stiller's humor, his expressions, and his reactions during the movie. I also love Owen Wilson's part as Hansel, I think the carelessness of both actor's in this movie make it a great movie to veg out to after a hard day's work. If you didn't like this movie the first time, see once or twice more, until it hits you how crazy some of their stunts are, and how ridiculously funny the movie really is!</fullReview>

There's not even a low point in the film for me. Great use of a soundtrack, awesome cameos from Bowie to Billy Zane to Andy Dick.

Good quality humor is hard to come across these days (or D-E-A-Y-E-S as Derek Zoolander would put it) and films like this one are simply godsend. Don't expect "Meet the parents" or "There's someting about Mary". Zoolander goes waaay beyond those in stupidity and yet it manages to be every bit as funny.

Ben Stiller really made something worthy here, that deserves at least one sequel.The first 10 minutes of the movie are absolutely hilarious and very original. I mean this is a comedy about a male supermodel. You cannot fail, especially with Ben Stiller on board.Of course Owen Wilson is the crazy person he always is and his part works great. Also the whole Stiller family are fantastic.But even if you don't like this movie, you have to acknowledge the genius of Will Ferrell who plays Mugattu, an evil Isaac Mizrahi. This guy is definitely one of the best comedians ever and he certainly helps a lot in this movie. He came up with the ultra funny line "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills" and that says it all.Also Stiller's direction is excellent. Tight, cinematic and interesting."Audy whaty?"9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>let me first say that i love almost everything ben stiller has ever done, so i'm a little biased. i don't think the movie warrants extensive analysis, but i watched it 3 times in the first week of it's release, and with many different people, with different tastes, and levels of humor/intelligence. i noticed something while watching this with my different groups of friends. now i love all my bestest pals, but not everyone of them is exactly what i'd call a supergenius. in fact some of my friends range from flakey, to downright morons! anyway, what i noticed is this: my friends which i would classify as more on the "intelligent" side were laughing their guts out through the duration of the film, while my "dimmer" friends were stone cold. hmmmmm...it was almost as though they didn't get the jokes! weird, huh? the jokes that they thought were "stupid" or "gay", as they would put it, were often the ones that had me, and some others in tears! i'm not sure exactly how i want to put it, but it's like many of the jokes were some new form of "smart-stupid". i don't know, they were just jokes of the broadest kind, the kind that almost stop the movie to say "do you get who i'm making fun of right now"? you could make the criticism that the jokes were often forced, but i for one felt relieved that i wasn't the only person who feels surrounded by idiots now and then. that may sound snobbish, but i don't care. i'm sick of peolpe who are willing to accept anything the entertainment industry throws at them. to quote ben stillers pal, jeanenne garafolo, "there's a part of me that's envious of people who don't care what's put in there eye hole, ear hole, mouth hole, nose hole, etc. acid washed jeans? sure. lion king? yes. lion king soundtrack? i'll take one." well, i best not get too riled up, i'll go on like this for far too long. (i may have already) basically what i'm saying is , i think ben stiller has succeeded in making a damn funny film, that is , i think, a little more subversive than given credit for. he's not just picking at fashion, i think he's testing the audience a little too. i think the movie is more personal for him than most people would guess. i loved it.p.s--the dvd has a hilarious narration by ben stiller for each section of the menu! if anyone cares.p.s.s---i hated supertroopers by comparison, if it helps put this rant into perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>6 months makes a difference-- Zoolander is now hilarious satire!!! Huge talents=Huge joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DVD edition of this movie is quite a different experience than the theater experience. It was released just after 9/11, and does feature some New York City locations, and goofy, loopy plots involving the 3rd world. Remember how the critics savaged the film at that time? They called it everything insensitive to tasteless. I admitted then that it WAS a bit hard to watch, with the recent violence so fresh in the world's consciousness.But hey! Time passes, wounds heal, we all get stronger and move on. Watching "Zoolander" now, it is clear that it is a brilliant satire, and sheer comic genius. Or at least comic really, really, goodness. Please do yourself, and the world, a favor and watch "Zoolander" on DVD. It may be a totally lame and stupid gesture, but it will show those who would injure us all that we CAN laugh at ourselves, and them.It's a shame such talent (just check out the cameos and cast list, for goodness' sake!) and such potential for audience joy had to be put on hold. Uncontrollable events might have postponed "Zoolander's" acceptance--- but now, perhaps, and in the coming months, folks will be able to see the satire and the humor without cringing. In a few years, I bet "Zoolander" will be a comedy classic, and nobody will even be able to remember that there ever even WAS a fuss over it. They'll simply watch it on cable or DVD (or whatever we'll be watching then) and laugh--- and think what fine talents Owen Wilson, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, et al. really are.</fullReview>

It is fun to search for all these tidbits, see all the cameos of people like Stephen Dorff or David Bowie and my absolute favorites were Zoolanders quote of "The Godfather" and the surprisingly intelligent side blow to "2001 - A space odyssey"!Furthermore, as a child of the 80s I really enjoyed the homage which was shown to this decade in the movie, especially the music.So all in all a really enjoyable film with many little things to watch out for. There is so much to find that I probably have missed quite a few further innuendos...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so it may not be winning too many professional nods from industry big-wigs (Oscars, Golden Globes, Cannes), but that is not "Zoolanders" objective. These sorts of comedy movie characters can usually be traced back to a comedy sketch routine done on a comedy show, so making a movie-lengthed sketch can't prove fatal. The plotline basically entails a plot to brainwash Derek to kill the president of Malaysia (something to do with child labor laws) but the film is so funny, who need a plot! Ben Stiller plays top male model Derek Zoolander, the most desired and popular male model in the world. With expertise and an ironic charm, Ben Stiller sucks in the cheeks and bungs on the accent to get that hilarious Derek Zoolander attitude that only he can pull off! "Zoolander" is an acidic look at the fashion world, employing many model stereotypes into the movie as humour (such as eating habits and tantrums)......and believe me, it does get the laughs! Without being overly cheesy and spoofish, "Zoolander" is able to cleverly poke fun at the little seen world of male modelling. Owen Wilson is fabulous as Derek's rival, Hansel, and Stillers real life wife Christine Taylor plays a reporter whose story on Derek gains some attention.Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece here. What you'll get is a hilarious, funky and cameo filled to the brim flick which is a fun option when you can't be stuffed sitting through films like "Traffic".***/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller is Zoolander. This is a clever, original and a just simply great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander is a top male super-model, who has won the VH1 'Male Model of the Year' award three times. On his fourth year of being nominated Derek expects to win, but unfortunately he doesn't. Instead new model on the block, Hansel, is the one who gets the award. After his fall, Derek then decides to quit the world of modelling and decides to go and find his family, his father and two brothers who all work at a cole-mine. Things aren't going well for a while, until things begin to look up when strange designer Mugatu offers Zoolander a chance to make a comeback in the model world with his new 'Derelicte' Line. What Zoolander and nobody else realise at first is that Mugatu plans to use Zoolander in his plan to assassinate the new Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit to New York, by brainwashing him with the help of his horrible assistant Katinka. Time Magazine journalist Matilda is the one who finds out about the planned assassination and is the one, with the help of Hansel, who helps Zoolander to stop Mugatu from doing this awful thing.As well as starring in the movie, Ben Stiller also directs and writes the screenplay. Real life father Jerry Stiller also stars here and he's great as usual. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor also has a part in here too. Owen Wilson gives quite a good performance too. There are LOADS of cool cameos in the movie too from the likes of Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, David Duchovny and Jon Voight. Zoolander is definitely different to many of Ben Stiller's other movies, but with Stiller anything is enjoyable. He's simply one of the best comedy actors, writers, etc. around. There are some really funny moments here in the movie too, most with Stiller and the movie is very clever. I think it would be great if they made a sequel to this cool, original movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the night it came out, and I thought it was hilarious. Even in the first few minutes I started laughing, I loved Will Ferrel's part, I don't know why, but it was just so funny! I kind of thought though, that Zoolander's accent was a lot like Dr. Evil from Austin Powers. I like the way he pronounces Matilda's name. By the way she is not Maureen McCormick, she is actually Ben Stiller's wife, his mom had a small role in the movie too, but the dad had a larger one. I liked the music they had in there too, especially the Relax song. Overall I think everyone should enjoy this movie, it's funny for just about every age. I laughed so hard, and couldn't stop, somebody actually told me to shut up. That's how funny this movie is.</fullReview>

Don't blame the movie on you own inability to pick a movie (based on the trailers) that suits your tastes.If you like Saturday Night Live and the kind of humor presented on that show, then you will like this movie. If you like movies like the "Other Sister" a lot and this is all you watch, then stay away. PLEASE?!Thats all I have to say about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny "Dumb Movie".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And that's exactly what it is: dumb. But not in the sighing, rolling your eyes, praying to higher powers that the movie would end kind of way. It was dumb in that overly cheesy "Austin Powers" sort of way. In other words, you have to be pretty clever to write a character that utterly dim.Some of the comments were just so implausible, so ludicrous, that you couldn't help but laugh. And I don't mean that in a negative way. Can Derek Zoolander really be that dense? In this movie, he can and he is. Ben Stiller as the overly mugging model was hilarious, but Owen Wilson as his arch-nemesis Hansel really stole the show. I'm not even that big of a Will Ferrell fan, but he's so over-the-top bizarre, you can't help but laugh. To paraphrase a quote I've heard before, "he can make you laugh the way a drunken clown can make you scared."True, the plot's a little thin with Zoolander brainwashed into killing the "Prime Rib of Propecia" (watch the movie to understand), but the great majority of the gags and the one-liners are the fun in getting there. And it also has a lot of great '80's songs bounding throughout the movie.It's funny. One of the funnier films I've seen for this year, so that adds a point to it, but at the same time, it loses a point for removing the World Trade Center buildings from the movie. A sign of the times, I'm afraid. Seeing them not there was not something I cared to be reminded of, however well-meaning the intent was.But I was glad to see another smart man's "idiot comedy" come out. It was high time for one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander (2001)A preposterous and often hilarious (and often very goofy) comedy set in the world of high fashion. And international politics, kind of.Ben Stiller is the title character, and he's so affected and "stupid" he's perfectly funny. Even when he makes the same move with his head, pursing his lips and looking blankly across the room, over and over, it's funny. Every time. He has to deal with being exceedingly stupid, vain, good looking, and now, suddenly, unsuccessful.He loses his "crown" as best model to Hansel, played by Owen Wilson. He also manages to very be funny, though less by acting and more by having an absurd role ?new hippie hedonist. As supermodel. Okay, whatever!There is an extremely dull if pretty reporter who is looking into this fashion world, especially a bizarre Mugatu character played by Will Ferrell. Evil ensues. David Bowie shows up for a contest. A whole slew of actual fashion names lend themselves for cameos. It's a rollicking movie. It even makes a little sense, which is good because it doesn't need to, and we want the resolution to happen.And oh yeah?you get to relax to Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the perfect empty hyped up pre-techno dance studio bland band, which has a key role, via vinyl. Milla Jovovich has a small role that's a little like Uma in "Kill Bill" and her name is worth the ride: Katinka Ingabogovinanana. Look for little appearances by big names: Christian SLater, Donald Trump, Jon Voight, Natalie Portman, Paris Hilton (duh, yeah!) and Heidi Klum (her too), Fabio, Lenny Kravitz, K-Roc, Richie Rich, Billy Zane, Vince Vaughn, and so on! Is this any good? I suppose not. But what are comedies for? To make you laugh. And this does that enough times to make it worth the suffering elsewhere if you hunker down and don't worry too much. And there's even a sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is a uneven comedian: Most of his films are just average (Like "Dodgeball" or "Madagascar") but some of them are pretty funny and quite enjoyable to watch, like "Tropic Thunder" and this one.I can't believe how stupid this movie is, yet somehow it's pretty darned funny. Ben Stiller can be quite funny...or not, and Owen Wilson I tend to dislike, but he's quite good in this. The two play moronic supermodels who are dueling with their male beauty. Not only are there tons of poses and some great lines but there is also a brainwashing plot about killing the Prime Minister of Malaysia(!)If you are looking for something that is beyond easy to follow and dumbly amusing than this is probably one of the better examples of both. I've seen it more than once and heck I'm sure I'll see it again before I die.</fullReview>

But the picture is creates is so over the top, and the plot so exaggeratedly stupid, that it fails to hit any real targets: there's also an extremely large quantity of product placement to endure. However, while it might not be satire, it is full of a great string of gags about stupid people. The truth is that many of these are just damn funny, and in a comedy, that's arguably the most important thing. As a director, Stiller is no genius, and there are some clunky moments with the camera-work and music; and the acting (of Stiller and others) is also pretty basic. This doesn't mean you won't laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am generally of fan of old movies, ranging from Gone With the Wind to The Godfather. That said, I feel that Zoolander is a very funny, entertaining film, especially considering that it's a relatively current film.When I first saw it on TV (I rarely go to the movies anymore - too many bad ones are getting good reviews) I thought I would only watch it for a few minutes. I assumed it would be dumb - and it is - but it a way that's genuinely funny. Ben Stiller, his dad, and his mother in a cameo are all great.But it's Owen Wilson who caught my eye. This is a guy that has the same kind of good looks, intelligence and charm that some of the best comedic actors of years gone by had. His broken nose only adds to his persona. He writes, too. I hope he continues both his acting and writing career. I've read that he does a lot of improvising, and that some of his best lines are off the cuff. This is a hallmark of someone who is truly funny, with great timing.The scenes where he prances &amp; struts (on his skateboard &amp; off) are perfect. He plays the fool, who is actually not a fool, to perfection.The many cameos in this movies are fun. I recognized several of them, and so will you. I rated this movies a 7 instead of higher only because the theme gets pretty trivial and silly at times.</fullReview>

"Zoolander" is a HOOT and one of my favorite Stiller's (of course, I have yet to see a Stiller that ISN'T a hoot).Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the epitome of the stereotypical 80's male model ? he's "really really really good looking" but just can't see past the end of his perfectly formed nose. Hansel (Wilson), like all the 90's up and coming male models, is known only by 1 name (because it is vain to have more than one name) and is so totally centered from navel gazing that his navel is ALL he can see. When the two worlds meet at the "Male Model of the Year" awards, Zoolander is left wondering if there is more to life than being "really really really good looking" and tells his manager he wants to start a "school for kids who can't read?.good". The irony and satire are gorgeous, and so are Stiller and Wilson! How CAN it miss? Signed, Patiently Awaiting A New Stiller</fullReview>

You can have a lot to laugh about at the end of the day and sometimes this is we really want, isn`t it? Very precise observations of the modelling world lead to an intelligent screenplay and good, ironic performances.

It perfectly portrays socio-economic trends and, despite offering a wide variety of parody within the male model characteristic, breaks the stereotypical views of male modelling, by showing even they are imperfect by, for example, having the inability to turn left. The film also features several quasi-religious connotations in the form of a spiritual awakening within the character and his inner strength showing through as a force for good in the universe.</fullReview>

The really sad thing is that it COULD have been good. Stiller Sr., Stiller Jr., Wilson, and Ferrell are quite capable of being funny, and a spoof of the fashion industry is a good idea, but the movie is ruined by a terrible script. They were obviously going for the so-stupid-it's-funny brand of humor, but they overdid it in the stupidness department, and it resulted in a movie that's so-stupid-it's-unwatchable. I couldn't believe it when they actually had a wedgie joke. You know a comedy is getting desperate for laughs when it throws in a wedgie joke. I admit there are a few good jokes in here (the "Space Odyssey" parody was great), but not nearly enough to save it. I give "Zoolander" 3 stars, which also happens to be the same amount of times I laughed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zoolander: the film and the character are not so different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller directs and stars as Derek Zoolander, a supermodel failing to come to grips with a career in decline. He has only one pose, is unable to turn left and sports a pout throughout. Most importantly, he is completely stupid, just like the whole movie, but that does not limit either from being amusing at times and harmlessly fun. Zoolander's satire on the fashion industry is hardly subtle and as this tires, the wafer thin plot is barely able to keep proceedings together. Inevitably the laughs dry up but moviegoers are more likely to be kept on their toes by an amiable supporting cast that includes the likes of Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell as well as a very, very long list of celebrity cameos. This is not Stiller's strongest but look more closely and you can see the seeds of the brilliant Tropic Thunder being planted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few big laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a new Prime Minister in Malaysia and the fashion industry wants to fight back against his humane minimum wage. They tell fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) to take care of him during fashion week in NYC. He just needs to brainwash an empty-headed male model idiot into killing the Prime Minister. After an embarrassing defeat to Hansel (Owen Wilson), Mugatu tells manager Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) that Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) needs to be that idiot. Meanwhile Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) tries to write a story on Zoolander.It is the stupidest of stupid and silliest of silly. It definitely has its insane laughs. The best has to be the self wedgie in the walk off. However it doesn't all work. The jokes don't all pay off. The obvious comparison is to 'Dumb and Dumber'. What's missing from this movie is a comedy partner for Ben Stiller. This would be much funnier if Zoolander has a partner that is just as dumb. Quite frankly, Owen Wilson isn't dumb enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satire about Male Models</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is given at the opening sequence with Mugatu played by Will Ferrell planning an assassination on the new prime minister of Malaysia because he would raise the minimum wage and get rid of child labor laws. Ben Stiller's character Derek Zoolander is a three time model of the year but for some reason can not turn left. Hansel a role written for Owen Wilson by Ben Stiller is a hippie like model whose career is rising. After losing the model of the year to Hansel he reconsider if there anything besides being really really good looking and retire. Looking for a model to assassinated the prime minister Magatu hires Derek Zoolander for a new fashion line and brainwashing to the song "Relax".Ben Stiller's movie about stereotypical male model with a ridiculous story makes an entertaining comedy making fun of the male model industry. A stupid plot with good supporting cast combine with good soundtrack. Throughout the movie each actors have funny lines are easily quotable and the best scenes is combined with well placed songs like the gas station and the runaway battle. Not a great or amazing movie but not bad an enjoyable satire directed and written by Ben Stiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A firm type of pretty good comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating-7/10Zoolander is a funny comedy with jokes that can truly make you chuckle, but they and the film are very silly. The film bumps along nicely and with some great cast members you feel maybe it could have been better, but it definitely not a poor film at all. I personally felt it was a Firmly Kind of Good film and would recommend it to anyone, here below is why I feel you should watch it, even if it isn't an awesome comedy.The story is a fun one and with all the fashion spoofing going on I could say this was made for those who like fashion, or maybe the film takes the mick, well in any case the story is funny and fits jokes in here and there among a plot that is absurd but fun of course. It can have it's less than funny parts which could be said ruin the film seeing as it is a comedy but I will overlook them and just say it is pretty good.Ben Stiller in the lead is dumb, which is good of course as his character is insanely stupid, and with Owen Wilson backing up in a funny role too, they both together can be great rivals. I did feel that Will Ferrell was underused in this film and was made to be an unfunny character that had a lot more potential for laughs. One last thing on the cast is with Milla Jovovich who although isn't so much funny in this, she creates a superbly sinister villain who can be stupid too but when is serious is kind of scary.The script actually isn't the most funny part of the film with a lot of physical humour used throughout, so I guess praise has to be given Ben Stiller again who as star, director and writer does a fantastic job considering he was on his own for most of this. I enjoyed the sets which are big and vibrant and make for a nice looking film with interesting things going on, the entire production looks great though, and of course the crazy outfits are probably the most defining thing about this piece.Negativity comes in the shape of missed jokes which of course are annoying because they are just not funny, now although I believe the majority of jokes were good some missed the mark a lot and maybe pushed this down just ever so slightly. I felt although the only criticism from me was missed jokes, some others will hate the more slower parts of the film that slow down the pace of the movie which for the most is fast.People who like Ben Stiller will like this as well, this is his flagship movie maybe and his traits of humour used in others is plainly seen in this. Comedy lovers will maybe like this, its maybe not the crudest film ever but contains some nonetheless. This is isn't for those who consider themselves more classy comedy fans as the film is silly, funny, but silly also but I do think it can be enjoyed even if you don't laugh once at it.Overall I give this a 7/10 as I felt it was Firmly Good, although definitely not a GOOD film, it isn't just OK and you can truly and really enjoy this. Maybe be in the right mood to watch it as it can be annoying I would bet if you were in a sad or angry mood but same goes for so many others. Just enjoy it though as I say, it is silly as I also said but maybe you will like it, and if you like this movie, there are many movies like this too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always been a Ben Stiller fan. Couldn't resist Zoolander when it first came out. It truly is a fun joy ride. The best part of the movie is the script itself. Some of the lines remain tirelessly funny. True that the movie makes fun of models, but we must remember it is a parody aimed at the fashion world. I won't give out the story. But yes, the first half is the best. The ending was a bit disappointing. I thought they could do it in a different way instead of speeding up with that senseless end. The movie has guest appearance from several stars. I guess they are added to make the fictional fashion world look more credible. But overall, it is one of the most enjoyable movies for people of all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the first film to really introduce me to Will Ferrell back in the day, its hard to think when this film came out he wasn't a big name star. Twas also the first time I saw Ben Stiller's dad on the big screen, or anywhere really, I hadn't yet discovered the joys of 'The King of Queens'.This entire film plays out like an early Sacha Baron Cohen flick ('Bruno') but much much tamer. A very deliberate spoof and parody of the fashion/model world that is grotesque, bloated, narcissistic and embarrassing. Alongside Stiller and Owen Wilson is fellow frat pack member Vince Vaughn in an early cameo role and many many other big name stars hamming it up...or so we're led to believe.Of course this being a film about modelling and fashion there has to be real patriots of this exclusive world involved, and there are plenty. All the big glamorous names you can think of that are connected to this vomit inducing scene are hauled out in front of the camera to show us their parody acting chops. Thing is I'm not entirely sure some of them understood they were being put in a film, I highly doubt they caught on that their lives were being poked fun at (mocked) and they were contributing towards the laughs. Just another day in the glitzy limelight for them.I wouldn't say the humour was particularly clever, witty or sharp. Its most definitely amusing seeing Stiller and Wilson going overboard as two self obsessed male models, the clip montages at the award ceremony, their own unique dialect and visual expressions plus the 'walk off'...some great mockery going on there. Unfortunately it doesn't quite hold up for the run time in my opinion, the early golden moments dry up quickly as do the ideas.The plot is daft of course but that doesn't matter really, its just a chance to have a pop at this ridiculous industry, maybe open some insider eyes perhaps. It all feels like your typical SNL sketch that has been stretched out but a little better than their usual fare. Its all very predictable childish and silly but that's the idea so there's no need to think into it. The only good thing about the film for me was the main lead duo and their excellent self indulgent portrayals, everything else is so so.I totally forgot how hot Jovovich is in this film with her strict dominatrix attire, plus talk about a desperate attempt to kick start your career Billy Zane!. Why exactly are you in this?.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a masterful parody on the shallow culture that has become so ingrained in modern society. While it is about male models, it could be about anything regularly adorning the cover of popular media.Derek Zoolander, our protagonist and the world's leading male model, bumbles his way through life trading purely on his limited male modelling skills. When he is knocked off his perch by Hansel - so hot right now - Zoolander is stranded in a world that he doesn't understand and is easily manipulated.The movie is full of comedy genius and takes celebrity culture through the proverbial shredder. Will Ferrell's character, Mugatu is a particular highlight. I am stunned that it (at time of writing) only achieves a 6.4 on IMDb. It is consistently funnier and far more clever than the likes of Old School (7.1) or Tropic Thunder (7.0). That Night at the Museum gets a similar rating (6.3) is an absolute travesty.Zoolander is a Stiller classic, is ageing well, and will get watched again and again years into the future when most IMDb "6" rated movies will be long forgotten. I suspect that the "6" is a typo - 8.4 is more realistic.</fullReview>

It was painful to not be able to stop laughing, and the laughing was infectious and almost non stop. For months after my buddies and I would quote the movie to each other, strangers, and imitate the voices. Instant classic, and I have no idea how it could be rated this low, other than some people perhaps just didn't 'get it'.It isn't a serious movie to be taken seriously on any level, it is the silliest of silly comedies, but one of the best ones ever made in my opinion.

The film is supposed to be stupid, it's supposed to have serious plot holes, and it's supposed to be just all in all a stupid movie. In terms of its stupidity, Ben Stiller is hilarious. Zoolander's deadpan, humorless take on the importance of male modeling is uproarious. Will Ferrell's crass, troll doll-looking Mugatu is ridiculous to be a fashion icon, but is. Milla Jovovich is very funny as the aggressive and out-of-control henchwoman. Watch this for the Relax scene though, it is the perfect combination of creepy and hilariously dumb that you'll be wanting to purchase the actual song again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller stars, directs and co writes the movie. Zoolander is a dim witted supermodel that becomes a pawn in a plot to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia by corrupt fashion executives one of them played by Will Ferrell, who want to retain cheap labour.At the beginning of the film we see Derek Zoolander being ousted as the top male fashion model by the rising star, Hansel McDonald played by Owen Wilson. His reputation is further diminished by a critical article from journalist Matilda Jeffries played by Christine Taylor.Zoolander retires from modelling rejoins his family in the coal mines but Derek is not cut out to be a miner and he later accepts Ferrell's offer to appear in his next fashion show.The film is silly but the genial good nature of both Stiller and Wilson carry it through and the absurdity of the plot sort of keeps things ticking over. The film was not a big office success but seemed to have found an audience in later years via TV and DVD.It may not be laugh out funny, supermodels are of course an easy target but it does make consistently chuckle and there is a good soundtrack as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great things about Ben Stiller films is that he doesn't take himself seriously, he mocks himself and whatever industry or story he's telling. Here Stiller is Derek Zoolander, male model, and supposedly really really ridiculously good looking, unlikely premise right there, but stick with it as it's all ironic, and comedy, and whilst it's all tongue in cheek there are a few messages in there. Owen Wilson is great in Zoolander as Hansel, Derek's main modelling rival, and just a lot of fun, and there's so many familiar faces and big names Will Ferrel, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Billy Zane and David "old school rules" Bowie etc and Stiler-film regular Christine Taylor as the Journalist and also Ben's father Jerry as Maury Ballstein, Zoolander's agent. Lovely little role for gorgeous David Duchovny as JP Prewitt, hand model.It's like a fairytale, or morality tale, and whilst it's not rocket science it's witty and smart and gains on duplicate viewing with plenty of other jokes you might have missed. One of Ben Stiller's better films, probably my favourite. A funny film, feel good film. Can't imagine what they are going to do with the sequel, which I believe is due out next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Comedy with a Great Cast, though it's far too Flamboyant,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zoolander is a good movie with a well written storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's jam packed with a stellar cast, memorable quotes and some terrific celebrity cameos, Ben Stiller is the highlight as he throws away that awkward guy persona we are use to seeing him playing and becomes a cocky fashion model who struggles with a loss of fame, he also has terrific chemistry with his real life friends Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell. As a comedy, it tries a bit too hard to be weird, flamboyant and stand out, I feel like Stiller geared towards the Austin Powers movies when making this, but the craziness is not half as classy, it felt like they were trying too hard, especially the scenes where Mugatu brainwashes Zoolander, the car wash and the battle at the end. I also found that it focused too much on Derek, I understand that he's the protagonist, but it is so dedicated to this character that the rest feel underdeveloped, we learn very little about Hansel, Matilda is a very two dimensional love interest and Mugatu's intentions are never made entirely clear. It's not my favourite comedy that the Frat Pack has brought us, but Zoolander is still a lot of innocent fun, worth the watch if you're looking for a good comedy and see it on television or Netflix. As a fashion model enters the end of his career, he is brainwashed to kill the governor of Malaysia by the head of a rival fashion company. Best Performance: Ben Stiller</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stiller Family Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see that another Zoolander film is in the works right now with Ben Stiller repeating his character of the brain dead male model. As it's been over a decade I hope that his character ages properly with the time. His career as the 'it' boy of the fashion industry should be over by now, but no reason he can't have a son breaking into the business.And what a business it is. Zoolander is a film with the premise that male models as a rule are so impossibly dumb and so vain about their looks that they are the most manipulatable people on the planet. And when you've got them being trained as assassins as fashion mogul Will Ferrell is doing, you've got the basis of some pretty good comedy.The lines in Zoolander aren't really that important, this is a character driven comedy and you'll take away Ben Stiller's character of Derek Zoolander, kid from the coal mining area of South Jersey who got out of that environment and made it to the top of his profession. But a new, equally gorgeous and equally dumb Owen Wilson starts threatening the king and beats him as he goes for a fourth crown as male model of the year.Ty Cobb when he went for tenth straight batting championship and lost to Tris Speaker never went through such soul searching as Ben Stiller does her. If he can't be the prettiest face, time to agonizingly reappraise your life. It's then when he gets signed by Will Ferrell and tricked into his brainwashed assassin's school.Now why do you think they want the Prime Minister of Malaysia killed. It's because he's standing up for the workers in the Asian sweatshops that turn out all the designer clothes that the beautiful people wear, actually wanting them to be paid a living wage. Got a kill a radical like that.And speaking of beautiful people an array of celebrities both play themselves and have small bit roles in the film. That includes Ben Stiller's mother Anne Meara on in the blink of an eye as an animal rights protester. Milla Jovavich has a nice turn as a beautiful assassin and Ferrell's chief killing aide. So does Christine Taylor as both investigative reporter and good girl who get 'sandwiched' between hunks Stiller and Wilson. Although Zoolander's gags occasionally fall flat i think most people will get a portion of laughs of all kinds at Ben Stiller's and Owen Wilson marvelous characters.</fullReview>

I heard so many good things about it and I'm a big fan of both Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller, but in a way I was disappointed. I thought that I would be giving this movie a ten but I deserves a seven at max.This is about a fashion mogul Derek Zoolander who is being brainwashed so he could assassinate the President of Malaysia.The acting is good but not great. I was kind of annoyed at Ben Stiller's accent in the movie. I did enjoy the performances by Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell though.I thought this movie would have me cracking up during the whole movie but it did not. It still had plenty of big laughs though. I just loved the whole beginning at the awards show.Overall, this is a decent but flawed movie. I'm skeptical over the upcoming Zoolander sequel(if it's ever made).

Stiller wrote, directed, and starred in this hilarious and ridiculous comedy.Zoolander is a dumb, but hilarious character. He is naive and full of himself. Stiller plays it a little over the top, but it works. Stiller makes us feel what Derek Zoolander feels even though we as audience are much smarter than Zoolander.Owen Wilson plays Hansel, a new up and coming model who becomes a rival of Zoolander's but then they become best friends. Stiller's wife Christine Taylor plays Matilda Jeffries, a news reporter who feels that she needs to help Zoolander get out his slump.Will Ferrell and Milla Jovovich are great supporting players. Ferell plays Mugatu, a costume designer who wants to end Zoolander's career. Jovovich plays an employee of Mugatu's who does some of Mugatu's dirty work.Ben Stiller's dad Jerry does some funny work as Maury Ballstein, Zoolander's agent. He is caught in the middle between Zoolander and Mugatu.Stiller makes a ridiculous idea and makes it over the top and it works. This is a fun movie and one of the starting points of the frat pack.

		<shortDescription>Stiller provides a perfect model for comedy gold . . . . or even blue steel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zoolander is directed by Ben Stiller and based on a character he created, a vain and extremely dim male model who just happens to be THE top male model in the world.The movie shows us that some pesky people are trying to stop the poor child workers of the world being allowed to do what the love doing, make ridiculously expensive clothes for ridiculously meagre wages, and so top designer Mugatu (played by Will Ferrell) comes up with a brilliant, diabolical scheme. It involves Derek Zoolander (Stiller on hilarious form), a tune from Frankie Goes To Hollywood and someone very, very important who is cramping the style of certain fashion designers (pun intended). Then there's Zoolander's public, ongoing feud with main rival Hansel (Owen Wilson, also hilarious) and his rather public ribbing by journalist Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) in TIME magazine. How can all this happen at once to someone so obviously really, really good looking? With a hilariously stupid script, numerous fun cameos and a great supporting cast including the likes of Milla Jovovich, Jerry Stiller, Jon Voight and David Duchovny this movie should please fans of dumb comedy. Yes, models are an easy target but that doesn't matter when the jokes come as thick and fast as this lot do. Whether it's Zoolander's anger as he misunderstands the concept of a scale model or his attempt at re-bonding with his estranged father, no scene is far away from a real laugh out loud moment.Stiller as a director is just as competent as Stiller as an actor and perfectly matches the flashy, shallow lifestyle to the flashy, shallow characters portrayed. He also gets a decent soundtrack throughout and there's a great David Bowie appearance (though, shock, horror, that may be pipped to the post by the great Billy Zane moment).Great fun. If you don't like Stiller then this is unlikely to win you round but if you do enjoy his comedy style then this is up there with the best of his laugh-inducing stuff.See this if you like: Dodgeball, Showgirls, The Heartbreak Kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller (Meet the parents) stars as Derek Zoolander, a confident but stupid male model who loses his crown to Hansel (Wilson) and decides to take time off to search for something else, only fashion mastermind Mugatu (Ferrell) has his own plans for Derek.This 2001 comedy directed by Stiller is sharp, funny and bizarre, a very good combination and one of the most delightful surprises of the noughties.Having portrayed many weird yet wonderful characters in his career, Stiller again dives deep into his best quality, that daft and humorous side that his fans love and he does so in such a way to make the film very enjoyable. Many performances of his have always been fairly repetitive, however with the type of jokes encoded and his direction does it come off and with the support, can we see a true energetic performance. The quality of direction is good, using a variety of shots and techniques to get the weird and wonderful messages across.Successful support is given by Owen Wilson (Wedding crashers) and Will Ferrell (Blades of Glory) all comedians with a similar style and combining recognized comedy actors justifies the genre and gives a clear message to audience about the life of these characters.Though the plot is predictable, daft and utterly a bizarre portrayal of what really happens in the fashion industry, you just have to sit back and enjoy it anyway. Too many films these days, particularly comedies, are made with no depth and hardly any funny jokes and predictable written underneath the title, for example The Heartbreak Kid. But sometimes they work, this script is sharp, and actually is funny with physical and other types of humour used to justify the needs of the viewing public, bring back this style of comedy.There will be shaking of the head moments and turning to look at the wall when one of the clichs appear but for the most part, Zoolander is sharply written, a completely daft yet enjoyable comedy that does work and is perhaps the best performance by Stiller in his long and established career.</fullReview>

In the midst of his midlife crisis, the dim-witted Zoolander is brainwashed at a day spa by the mysterious Katinka (Jovovich) into assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia.This movie wasn't the greatest neither was it bad. It's sandwiched in between both of those feelings:Average. Pro: it's another Stiller/Wilson collaboration which makes it great. Con: the script is very poor. No meaning, just a random movie. My advice: go see it but it's hard to follow. Zoolander 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller has a sure winner with Zoolander, one of the funniest movies of 2001. He plays Derek Zoolander, a male supermodel who has a crushing blow at the beginning of the film due to Hansel's win, played by Owen Wilson. But Derek is put on course to kill the Maylasian Prime Minister by Mugatu.Definitely a movie that Frat Pack fans should not miss. Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Jerry Stiller and Christine Taylor also star in this comedic relic. At one point in the film when Hansel and Derek have a 'walk-off', many other Hollywood celebs guest star.A 7 seems like a low rating, but this was the beginnings of the Frat Pack. So after careful consideration, this film still receives a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander (2001, Dir. Ben Stiller) Derek Zoolander is VH1's three time male model of the year, but when Hansel wins the award instead, Zoolander's world becomes upside down. His friends disappear, his father is disappointed in him, and he feels that he's not good as a model anymore. But when evil fashion guru Mugato hires Zoolander, he thinks his life has turned back round again, that is until he finds out that Mugato has actually brainwashed him to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Can Zoolander and his new friends find out how to prevent the incident, before it's too late? Ben Stiller has done fairly well with the movies in which he has directed or produced, so you should know what to expect. The movie contains a well written script. It has a few sexual references but do not go over the top. The jokes are hilarious and the choreography is incredible. The list of cast is huge, with amazing performances by stars such as Will Ferrell and Jon Voight, mixed with interesting cameos by the likes of Paris Hilton and Billy Zane. It's not the best comedy out there, but definitely one which everyone would enjoy."You freakin' idiot!" - J.P. Prewitt (David Duchovny)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suggested for Immature Audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the only reason I watched this film was because my dad thought it would be really funny, and he rented it, and I thought "What the heck, I love movies, might as well watch it." Of course I didn't expect much; in fact, I expected very little.The movie wasn't worse than I expected. But it definitely wasn't any better, either. This is a storyline--about a male model brainwashed to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia--completely out of touch with reality. It was hard to pick out any real-life emotion in this thing, and what little was there was obscured by the over-attempts at slapstick and comedy, patched together only passably by director Ben Stiller.What about the comedy? As I said, it tries too hard most of the time. But there are some good lines and some really laugh-out-loud moments. What I liked most of all, however, were the moments of extremely irreverent humor (though perhaps the joke involving Abe Lincoln and JFK was going too far). I just like that sort of thing, and if you like it, then you might find something in this movie.My dad loved this movie about 100%. But he's like that. He prefers movies that ARE out-of-touch with reality, that have lots of slapstick humor, and that don't really tap human emotions. He'll sit through a bunch of immaturity to experience complete escapism. If you fit that description, then you will like this movie, too. In fact, I'll go as far as to suggest you watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zoolander" is probably Ben Stiller's silliest endeavor. I found it quite amusing, but its silliness did get to me at times. It's an enjoyable movie in a juvenile, sophomoric kind of way. You obviously can't take Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), or any of his male model friends, seriously. And you especially can't take Hansel (Owen Wilson) seriously when you're staring at that huge sniffer on his face.It is a fun movie with a fair amount of laughable parts. Will Farrell does an excellent job as Mugato and David Duchovny's cameo is very amusing. Don't expect much from this movie in terms of plot or logic and you can have yourself a good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is the type of movie that you dream of seeing it has everything a comedy need to has and it is so damn funny! I mean I must have laughed around 35 times during the movie and Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller just raise that bar of comedy in this one. They were good in other movies, but this one is by far their absolute best. Now this movie is about stuck up male model Derek Zoolander(Ben Stiller) who is a stupid person who's won the best Male Model award 3 times in a row before coming second in a run for the fourth by Hansel(Owen Wilson), another Stupid guy. This movie has got probably the biggest laughs out of any movie I've seen in a long time, so overall I rate this movie 94% and I recommend that everybody sane watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cult classic of the stupid comedy genre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2001, the stupid-comedy sub genre of film was changed forever by one film. That film was Zoolander, which has since become one of the most commonly quoted/referenced films among the growing number of people that have been affected by it. Never before had a comedy at this level of stupidity been attempted. In its dumbest moments, Zoolander is second to none. Where Zoolander lags is in its attempts to develop a meaningful plot and moral to the story. Luckily, this is not often and the result is a classic with countless unforgettable moments.I think Zoolander owes the majority of its greatness to its actors as opposed to the writing or directing for example, which are quite inventive at times but otherwise nothing special. Owen Wilson is arguably the heart of the film although Will Ferrel, Jerry Stiller and of course Ben Stiller have their moments. The numerous cameo appearances (most notably David Duchovny and David Bowie) also turn out to be well executed opportunities for hilarity.Now, I don't think there's much more I can really say about Zoolander. Some people might not like it but then they obviously just don't get it. Perhaps they just need to carefully consider the question "But why male models?" one more time and then finally they will appreciate the inevitably apparent fact that "Dear God ... it's beautiful."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is a satire film, but unlike other films, this one touches a new territory, male modelling. This was an interesting experience for me because I have no real interest in male modelling and know very little about the subject.Despite this, I enjoyed it. The plot goes somewhat like this. Derek Zoolander, famous male model, is humiliated when his enemy, Hansel, wins the award he was aiming for. When his friends try to cheer him up, they all die in an explosion. Meenwhile, evil fashion designer Mugatu, is plotting to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia for his new policy against sweatshops, and he needs, Derek Zoolaner, the single stupidest male model in existence, to do it for him.Zoolander, Hansel and Mugatu are two of the funniest characters I have ever seen. The other characters though, are a little bland. I don't hate them, I just think they're a little bit boring.All in all, a good movie with a funny main lead, original premise, but some slightly boring support characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The start of the frat pack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Zoolander was released before anyone really understood it's humour. I recall listening to the director's commentary on the DVD and Stiller commented that there really weren't that many people who saw this at the theater and he was thankful for those that were listening to him now. Little did he know that Zoolanderer would go on to develop one of the biggest cult followings in history. The humour and perhaps first unofficial grouping of the "frat pack" contributes to the quality and the hilarity in the film. We all know that Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrel appear in the film but even Vince Vaughn has a non-speaking role as one of Derek Zoolander's mining brothers.Zoolander's strength is the absurd comedy, unbelievably stupid characters and more funny that it should be script. All three provide us with so much to enjoy and it succeeds because of this.Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, the fashion industry's biggest model. He has won the VH1's model of the year 4 years in a row, he is "really, really, really good looking" and he has not equal. But this year up and coming hippie model "Hansel" played for pure laughs by frat pack member and Stiller crony Owen Wilson, has just taken his crown. He is the complete antithesis to Zoolander as he snowboards, eats junk food and enjoys life in a Zen like fashion. He and Zoolander are complete opposites and obviously don't like each other because of competition.Will Ferrel plays Mugatu, a flamboyant and meterosexual like fashion designer who has ideas of brainwashing Zoolander so he can kill the Malaysian Prime Minister so that they can keep their sweat shops open and produce clothing for pennies. His genius plan is to hypnotize Zoolander, and trigger him by using Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Relax, to get him to kill The Prime Minsister. It's funnier than it sounds.Zoolander, when you describe it is not as funny as when you see it. Zoolander is one of the dimmest characters ever created. He can't turn left, he is working on developing Blue Steel, his new "look" that is really just the same as every other vapid, moronic look he has. He doesn't understand that building models to 1/10th the scale of something is not the real thing. Hence you get the line in the movie, "What is this? A school for ants?" He and Hansel have a walk off, where Billy Zane and David Bowie appear for no reason other than they can. Here they do various model cat walk moves to the sounds of Beat It by Michael Jackson. Stiller has so many ideas in here and he tries to fit them all in the movie. And more times that not they succeed. Even the mistakes in the film are funny.Zoolander is one of the funniest film of the decade. And it's one of my favourites.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the "Fashionatas"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a true laugh and chuckle fest. No big meaning, quite the slap to male models, high fashion, fashion houses, folks in fashion and those who have opinions against the industry as well. It comes together interestingly enough, and that is what makes it fun.Basically the story is you have a dense, clueless, top of his game male model named Zoolander (played by Stiller) who is as egotistical as they come and thinks he's going to win his 4th time as top male model. His life is all faux clothing artistic and design and that was fine - as long as he was on top. Then comes competition, another semi clueless model (played by Owen Wilson) who takes Zoolander's number one spot and his 4th win for top male model. After loosing, Zoolander realizes he must do something 'more positive for the world' besides looking good. With his fellow dense male model roomies, Zoolander decides to find out what that is. But tragedy strikes, and his roomie models are killed in one of the funniest scenes ever. Zoolander decides to go back to his roots and his male family members which is in a small mining town that doesn't take too kindly too male modeling. Not being able to find a place for himself, he returns to modeling to really find out who he is and what he can do to make a difference in the world. ANd that's the story.Well..ummm...sorta. There are funny twists and turns in this, plenty of cameos by folks who can poke fun of themselves, a good Stiller family affair and the best over-the-top performance by Will Farrell who had to study every high and overly ego-ed male fashionata designer of the past 30 years.Nothing to take too seriously here, just a lot of fun and silliness. And every now and then, that's all you need to make you feel a bit better about an industry and people who think way too much of themselves. Maybe ...they laughed as they watched this too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the Prime Minister of Malaysia has announced that child labor will be no more in his country. Mugatu(an evil clothing model leader) was outraged about that news, because it'll lower sales on clothing for child workers. So he plans to set up an assassination on the prime minister when he visits the world famous fashion show put up in New York.And Mugatu will brainwash Derek Zoolander into killing the prime minister. Derek Zoolander was the most over rated and most popular male model in New York. Right until his competitor Hansel, out won him at the best looking male model awards. Which made Zoolander down on his luck. Because modeling for clothes and being good looking is his life. And is yet to come up with a new look that'll be called the Magnum. Will Zoolander find something else in life besides Male Modeling? And will Mugatsu successfully succeed in his conspiracy plan? I was never a fan of Ben Stiller. But I gotta admit that this one is a little better than his other movies. Owen Wilson is good and also teamed up with Stiller in "Starsky Hutch"(which wasn't all that great). And Will Ferrel's role as a villain is rather different than his other appearances. But I'm not a fan of him either.Zoolander is one of those average comedies with some slapstick to it. If you're a Ben Stiller fan, you might like this one. But it's something to rent before buying.</fullReview>

Brilliant Vince Vaughn with his perfect sense of comedy rhythm, in his short appearance. But this movie has something that no movie before it. Amazing Will Ferrel as fashion magnate Mugatu, so great, with his unbelievable hair, pet, clothes, job. Makin fun of male models is something he can do just fine, along with his colleges.

		<fullReview>Obviously it does not take much to make me laugh. This is actually the only movie DVD that I own, purchased for therapy reasons. Although Ben Stiller really puts it all out (esp. in the stretching and underwear scenes during the walk-off), I think Will Ferrell is the one that gets me the most. My newest, greatest favorite line is, "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!," considering that I do have a history of taking anti-depressant medication that really just worsened my life. His little run across the room to the "Center for Kids. .." model in high heels is the greatest. And the "foamy latte" scene is not only funny for the use of the words "bloated" and "farty" but because his assistant, Todd, is a real scream too. Christine Taylor has got to be the most non-egoistic actress I've ever seen on screen. She manages to basically just play herself, which I don't think I see very often in films (or maybe I don't know a lot of actors well enough). They do beautiful makeup jobs on her, too. In all, she is beautiful and clean and all-American. Some of her expressions/reactions to things that Derek says are really funny. Is Billy Zane the same guy who was in "Titanic?" He looks awesome with his head shaved- great physique. I love and respect movies that involve a tremendous amount of creative collaboration, and if you just look at the number of celebrities on the full cast list, it is quite impressive. Funny how Winona Ryder just got kind of stuck in there. Maybe this is also a feel-good movie for me because it was basically a family collaboration (Ben and Jerry Stiller, Christine Taylor)--I can't imagine my father-in-law telling me that I would have "a nice rack of lamb" if I used a push-up bra, on or off-screen.</fullReview>

This is a great comedy and it had me laughing from start to finish. Ben Stiller did a great job on acting in this movie and also directing it. He has found the perfect balance between silly and smart. He satirizes male models that they are all stupid and need someone to tell them what to do. They pay out on models so much that some may take offense at the movie, but for everyone else it is absolutely hilarious. Lines like Derek's eulogy or "elgoogly" at Rufus, Meekus and Brint's funeral really is some great script writing. They use Binary opposition as well, in genders. Derek and Hansel are males but they are like big softies and Matilda the reporter is a female but she is really strong willed and powerful in the movie. This film is Hilariously funny and easily 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time at camp last summer, and I thought it was going to be really stupid. I was pleasantly surprised on how funny and mindless it is. Ben Stiller is a great comedic actor, and should keep up the good work. Here he scores some laughs as dim-witted male model Derek Zoolander, who loses his 4th straight Male Model of the Year award to up-and-coming model Hansel (Owen Wilson, Stiller's co-star in "Starsky and Hutch"). Derek retires from the modeling business, but is brought back when haute couture king Mugatu (Will Ferrell), offers Derek a job modeling his new Derelicte line of clothes, and then brainwashes Derek into killing the prime minister of Malaysia. Derek doesn't see any harm, but Time Magazine reporter Matilda Jefferies (Christine Taylor) sees some suspicion and tries to pull Derek out of it before it's too late. You'll have to see the movie to find out if there's a happy ending! This movie is mindless fun, and I have been trying to track down a copy for myself, but I cannot find it anywhere. So I think I am going to go rent it tonight so I can have a little evening of mindless fun. **** out of *****.</fullReview>

Derek is brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. The story in between is the good part, however. Full of wittier humor than the very blunt lines of Dodgeball.

		<fullReview>Zoolander is a film that stars almost always funny Ben Stiller portraying Derek Zoolander, a male model nearing the end of his career when he is replaced by new model Hansel (portraying by a very funny Owen Wilson - just watch Wedding Crashers to see this guy's great comedic acting). When the overly clueless Derek is offered a "comeback", he is brainwashed to attempt to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. In fact, I consider this film sort of a sequel to Mystery Men, in which both are over-the-top comedies, with the production design pretty much in the same "styles" in both films (of course both also star Ben Stiller in exaggerated and hilarious performances). A comedic example of a film, 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

Airhead male model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller, who also wrote and directed the movie) is brainwashed to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. Yes, that's the plot; and they do a great job with it.One of the best things about this movie is that it shows how not only are these models dumb as rocks, but they're often not that good-looking. I think that no one else could have done it as well as Ben Stiller and the ensemble cast that he assembled (Christine Taylor, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell, Milla Jovovich, David Duchovny, and a WHOLE BUNCH of other people).

		<fullReview>Zoolander is stupidly funny, with stars such as Ben Stiller, Will Ferell, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, with numerous cameos by big celebrities. Before there was 'Old School', 'Dodgeball', 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' and 'Wedding Crashers', there was Zoolander. I like to say it kick started the dumb-hilarious-pee your pants-comedies of the 21st century.Our hero, the misunderstood and um, lacking in brain cells, male model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is at the height of his career, when things suddenly start to go downhill. There's a hot new male model with a very different look, the hippie-chick Hansel (Owen Wilson) and a pretty, but stuck up journalist, Matilda(Christine Taylor) has just written and unflattering article about him. Then Hansel wins the 'Male Model of the Year' award. And his best friends die in a, um, tragic gasoline accident. Poor, Poor Derek.Little does he know, things are about to get worse. Evil Mugato (Will Ferell with a hilarious white fluffy wig and matching poodle), fashion god of the city, has an evil plan. He proceeds to hypnotise Derek and persuade him to- gasp- assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia!! By the time Matilda gets to the scene of the crime, it's too late. So here's the plot- she must STOP him from killing the poor old Malaysian dude at a big fashion event. Da-du-daaaaaw.Along the way, Derek pays an unwelcome visit to his (literally) golddiggin' hometown (featuring a cameo by Vince Vaughn), parties with celebs (Cameos by Paris Hilton, Billy Zane and David Bowie), befriends the enemy and even falls in love along the way. Totally worth a watch.</fullReview>

The only problem is that every major assassination of the past two centuries has been initiated by the modeling industry and Derek is brainwashed to be the assassin in the next murder. With the help of Hansel and a reporter named Matilda(Christine Taylor), Derek tries to escape the evil scheme that he is capable of committing.The movie, as you can probably guess, is just hilarious. Ben Stiller is absolutely fantastic and this is the first appearance of his wife, Christine Taylor and did a great job also. Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson just add on the greatness of the movie. Overall, the movie is one of the funniest movies of the decade.I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is quite simply the finest comedy to come out of the US this century. That's why it flopped there. Tut tut. Stiller and Wilson do the original buddy stuff, playing out their ridiculous male models to perfection, whilst the supporting cast are sensational. Jon Voight as Derek's New Jersey coal mining father (you're dead to me boy, more dead to me than your dead mother), Will Ferrel's bizarre but hilarious fashion designer Jacobin Mugatu, creator of the piano key neck tie (obey my dog!) and Jerry Stiller's track-suited, dwarfish agent lothario with serious renal problems (ah, my prostate's flared up like a honeydew) all combine to make a film with barely a laugh-free second. Oh, and David Bowie's in it. I think, in all fairness, it's a case of either getting it or not. Personally, I find a poodle in a wig, pointless celebrity cameos and the phrase orange-mocha-frappucino pant-wettingly funny. If you don't then please leave now and go watch Starsky and Hutch like all the other cool kids. But know this: you are a big fat faker. Put a cork in it Zane!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really, really, ridiculously good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(spoilers herein)I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie as when I saw Zoolander. I say that in all fairness - I've been to many funny movies since, expecting to have to revise that statement, but Zoolander remains on top for the sheer volume of belly laughs it provides.For a movie about male models (this has to be the first of it's kind), Zoolander was surprisingly creative and original. The plot is absurd, but it's the same for most comedies. Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is VH1's 3 time winner of the male model of the year award, and he's running for his fourth. True to form, Zoolander will never be winning any intelligence contests, but he models well enough, despite not being able to spell the word. He's famous for his trademark look which he calls 'Blue Steel', but he has been working on a different look, 'Magnum' for the last 8 or 9 years, but sadly, it is still nowhere near ready. His rival for the title is laid back, stoner hippie boy Hansel (Owen Wilson). Zoolander is taken completely by surprise when Hansel unexpectedly wins the award, and he starts pondering that perhaps his purpose in life is to be something other than 'really really ridiculously good looking.' Confused and overwhelmed, he retires from the male modeling profession, much to the chagrin of his agent Maury Ballstein. (Jerry Stiller, Ben's real life dad, in one of the funniest performances in the movie) Derek attempts to return to his roots at the coal mining town in New Jersey, in hopes of figuring out his ultimate purpose in life. But after a less than welcome reception from his two brothers (Vince Vaughn has a cameo as one) and father, (Jon Voight) and a phone call from Maury telling him that legendary fashion designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) wants Zoolander for his new campaign, Derek decides to return to what he knows best.Mugatu, it turns out, has a ulterior motive for having Zoolander join his campaign. The prime minister of Malaysia is attempting to put a stop to child labor, which Mugatu will not tolerate, since most of his designs are made in poorer countries. So Mugatu and his freaky 'she-male' Russian bodyguard Katinka Ingobovinana (Milla Jovovich, who claimed she was playing her mother) brainwash Derek, so that whenever he hears the 80's classic song 'Relax', he will turn into a homicidal master of martial arts, and murder the Malaysian Prime Minister.Only journalist Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) really knows what is going on. She tries to keep Derek from Mugatu and Katinka by hiding out in the last place they would ever expect to look: Hansel's hangout. Surprisingly, Zoolander and Hansel patch up their differences remarkably quickly, and after the two of them and Matilda share some 'seriously strong tea' and an orgy with some Finnish dwarfs and a Maori tribesman, the three of them are the best of friends. (Zoolander not so secretly begins to fall for Matilda as well)Between the three of them, they manage to stop Derek from assassinating the Malaysian Prime Minister, exposing Mugatu for the fiend that he is, and meanwhile releasing 'Magnum' to the public. Bottom line, everyone lives happily ever after. The costumes sported by all fashion related characters are ridiculously creative, going way over the top in terms of reality, but it's a nice play on how the really famous fashion designers can get away with pretty much anything they want once they're a big enough name. (I still don't think Mugatu would have gotten away with his 'Derelique' show, that might have been a step too far) The film is packed with great cameos from real-life models and fashion designers, actors playing themselves, and they even managed to fit in David Bowie somehow. These were cute and effective, but it's in the main characters that we get the majority of our laughs. Ben Stiller really made the movie by playing clueless model Derek Zoolander, a character he and Drake Sather created for the 1996 fashion awards. I have seen many of Ben Stiller's movies, and I personally think that this is his funniest performance yet. (a close second being his fitness trainer White Goodman from 'Dodgeball') Stiller and Owen Wilson collaborate magnificently as usual, and are very downright funny as their warring male models Derek Zoolander and Hansel. Most of the films best moments are the interactions between their characters.(there's a great take off on 2001: A space odyssey as Derek and Hansel make monkey noises trying to turn on a computer) The duo are also blessed with the ingenious addition of comic genius Will Ferrell as evil fashion designer Jacobim Mugatu. Ferrell, true to form, improvised and changed most of his lines to better suit his interpretation of the character, and the result is nothing less than comedic magic. Ben Stiller's real-life wife Christine Taylor was rather bland, but funny nonetheless as 'investigatory journalist' Matilda Jeffries.Stiller also directed the film to great effect. Many people questioned the decision to direct himself, but I thought it worked out fine. Stiller had directed films in the past, and this isn't his first time directing himself, so he's not likely to make a complete mess of things. Quite the opposite in fact: Stiller proved a perfect choice to direct, injecting his personal, wacky sense of humour into the film. Zoolander is riddled with funny touches, such as when someone makes a funny facial expression, the camera will just freeze on it, so the audiences are more likely to notice it. As well, all the main characters (and David Bowie) are introduced&nbsp;by introductory captions which appear spontaneously throughout the film. This was a brilliant touch, and it worked very well.This is Stiller at his best, in both acting and directing. Zoolander is a much overlooked and under-appreciated comedy -definitely worth seeing. Just be ready to laugh...a lot.-9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I typically don't comment on movies, but after reading the last review, I feel obligated to defend my dearest Derek. Every moment of this film is hysterical, and it is the single most quotable movie of all time. Stiller and Wilson play off of each other brilliantly, and Will Ferrell steals every scene he's in. If you want to watch a stupid comedy a la Dumb and Dumber or Old School, this is THE PERFECT movie. It isn't as intellectual as a Wes Anderson or Christopher Guest movie, but as someone who normally dislikes stupid gross-out Ben Stiller comedies, I can vouch for this one. If I could, I would watch Zoolander all daiye. D-A-I-Y-E. Daiye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Featuring 4 Frat Packers - Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn -this is the most underrated and under-appreciated movie ever.The fact that this movie did not garner every major award - in acting, writing, direction or cinematography - makes me seriously question the integrity of the "Academy". The fact that some people hate this movie makes me question their judgment.Some people just don't know what's good for them. Funny = always good. Foreign films and period pieces = almost always bad. If you're super serious about "film" and like watching pretentious, complex, high-brow "films", then move on. For those who know that watching complex films doesn't actually make someone complex, rent Zoolander.SPOILER ALERT ----- OK, this has nothing to do with the actual premise but pop in the DVD. Fast forward to the Fashion Show. Look for Mugatu conspiring with Ballstein at the Fashion Awards show. Mugatu is hunched over Ballstein's left shoulder. Mugatu's dog is perched over the right. Now PAUSE. Greatest single shot in movie history. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!!!</fullReview>

Anybody doesn't think this movie is funny well well there isn't much to say to you. God bless you. That means you aren't very sharp person after all...I mean just listening to the accent, Ben Stiller developed for this movie is worth the admission.Jokes will come so fast and they are so stupid. So stupid is the hardest to create kind of humors. Because very very often "supposed to be too stupid" jokes become "stupid jokes" And we've seen that too many times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. Yes it was a bit out of whack and crazy, but it was truly hilarious. Ben Stiller is a great comedic actor, and I think this movie compliments his acting skills. The characters are great, the lines are great, and the idea is creative and great. Will Ferrell also did an amazing job with his character. Making him funny, but at the same time evil can sometimes be difficult. Difficulty didn't stop him in creating his character. Owen Wilson is no exception. His character had power as well. The storyline was a bit weird, but that's alright by me! I'm crazy about this movie, even if it was one of the most random ones that I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zoolander" is the type of movie where everyone shakes their head in disbelief wondering why the movie was made. Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Christine Taylor star as the leads along with many talented actor making cameos in a film that makes no sense. The director of "Zoolander" failed to make a connection between the audience to watch and the reason he made the movie. Furthermore, the writers did a dismal job at convincing everyone that their was a reason to watch as they utilized stupid jokes, bad physical comedy and awful writing in the script. It is unfortunate that "Zoolander" turned out to the way it did because Stiller and Wilson are both excellent talents. The chemistry between both actors are excellent but it was not enough to sway my opinion of the movie.</fullReview>

Also Will Ferell as Mugatu steals the show with the best comedy performance by him in a while and his stupid haircut.I do not think this film was better than Meet the Parents or the Cable guy that Stiller directed but it does have its moments 7/10 see this if you liked Meet the Parents, Cable guy (any other Ben Stiller film) cya</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**I've seen this film a few times now, and whilst it doesn't floor me each time like it did the first, it's still hilarious. Stiller and Wilson seem to really work well together - actually, what's the thing there - are they best friends or something?Zoolander is an hour and a half of satirical silliness, poking fun at the stereotypes of a business that doesn't actually need satire to be funny. Derek and Hansel are 'brainless pretty boys without enough brains to fill a teaspoon' (Thanks JKR!) but their hearts are in the right place. I've always had a bit of a thing for Stiller, but even I have to admit that it's pushing it a bit to accept him as a male model - ditto Wilson. But that's one of the things that makes this film so great. I could go on - there's the cameos, the 'walk-off' the gasoline fight . . . . dammit, just go and see it yourself! You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say I finished watching this film thinking it was brilliant. My first reaction was that it was both funnier and more intelligent that I expected, but that's not giving it a huge amount of credit in either regard. Actually it was quite a bit funnier than I expected, with many moments that I couldn't help laugh out loud. Still, it does bring out many of the cliches in getting a laugh out of the audience, and while some of these were done very well it wasn't so consistently brilliant that I would want to watch it again and again.Slightly better than disposable this fun and funny movie was better than your average Hollywood comedy, much better, but it still left me feeling for a lack of depth that no great lines can redeem. 7 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I want to say that "Zoolander" isn't a good movie and yes, it is stupid. But that's what it's supposed to be! Do you actually think that Ben thought this would win an Oscar? Hell no! His intention was to make people laugh and he succeeded! This movie is hilarious! I laughed all the way through and I was crying I was laughing so hard. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson were great in their roles as totally clueless male models. I loved how they acted so stupid. I also loved how they acted like they hated each other because Hansel (Wilson) had become famous and stole Derek's (Stiller) popularity. It was cute to see them walk past each other and give dirty looks. And the walk off scene was so funny. How could you not laugh? What made those scenes even more funny was that Stiller and Wilson are really friends and they're trying to act like they hate each other. That's some funny stuff! Will Ferrell was his usual funny, talented, and absolutely great self. He's one of my favorite Saturday Night Live alumnis. He seems to make every role he plays funnier than he's actually supposed to be. He's awesome. Ben's wife Christine Taylor was also great as Matilda and his father Jerry Stiller brought much humor to his role as well. This movie is stupid, yes, but it is definitely not the worst film ever made. It had some great hilarious scenes and Derek and Hansel's stupidity was the funniest bit of the movie. Ben wanted to make people laugh and he succeeded. But anyways. I thought this movie was laugh out loud funny and thanks for reading my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is perhaps the finest cinematic achievement of all time. Wilson's performance is stellar and Stiller's makes you pee your pants with laughter (even if you don't have a pre-existing condition). Wonderful, wonderful movie. So great, I've actually changed my name to Derek Hansel Zoolander to celebrate this triumph of a movie! One particular excellent scene is when the three models die in a "freak gasoline fight accident." The look of terror on Stiller's face when his friends are about to be blown to smitherines is priceless. You can't learn that kind of acting at a school. That's natural born talent right there. Bottom line: This movie is Stiller's, Wilson's, and Ferrel's finest hours and should have been nominated for the academy awards. It's a pure crime is wasn't. Death to Oscar!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Zoolander the second time a few nights ago and wondered why I had initially awarded this movie merely a six. If we regard this movie seriously, yeah, sure, a six would be enough. But it's not about serious or not, it's about fun and laughing. It exceeded my expectations in these regards. Ben Stiller has always been one of my favorite comedy actors because he's got that look on his face, a warm and friendly look, that can easily make you laugh. This certainly isn't one of his best movies, but it's a good one.minor SPOILERSIt's the world of fashion, the world of "male modeling"(not something I look to with much interest), the world of brainless hunks of muscles. It's our world with some tiny, tiny exaggerations. Ok...maybe not so tiny. The story is stupidly funny, this affirmation being valid for the whole movie. It's so stupid and yet so funny. I don't usually love stupid comedies, but this one is an exception, maybe because it seems to be a small universe within our world, a serious and always changing world. You can't really say that Derek's looks change too often, do they? The fact that Derek is searching to find out other things to do beside modeling, something with which he can help humanity, is hilarious through the fact that his desires are of such infantile and sincere stupidity. It's no wonder in the end that his center for children who can't read too well actually transforms into a center for the "to be" models. The movie is stupid, but fun. I can say that the modeling world is a world within our world and this is vividly shown in the movie. Owen Wilson plays the a little bit brighter "enemy" of Derek, concerning the modeling stage. Milla Jovovich plays the ferocious woman with a...remarkable name, who has to take control over Derek. She could've been a little more impressive though. This being the debut for Stiller in the directing world, it's good. If you ever get the chance to see it, don't avoid it. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, as we know, did not do so well in theatres. Yet it was hilarious--to list all the funny bits in this film would take longer than just watching it (and you may even need additional viewings to catch stuff you missed the first time). My favourite celebrity cameo was David Bowie, who adjudicated the Walk-Off--there are numerous celebrities that make tiny appearances especially at the beginning of the movie, but Bowie is the only one who gets his own subtitle while "Let's Dance" is excerpted. There are so many laughs in this movie that the obvious one about Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as male supermodels stops being obvious--I found I started thinking it was normal. I was encouraged to watch this movie when someone (I apologise for forgetting exactly who) wrote that it stood alone in the sense that it was a movie wherein the female lead engages in an orgy, but is not punished for her sexuality but instead rewarded by marrying the title character and having a baby (admittedly, some of us may not think of marriage as a reward--quite the opposite--but let's admit that's usually the happy fairy tale ending for a heroine). It's eerie how Winona Ryder's character in the movie tells Zoolander that he's so smart to lie low after a public humiliation...was she anticipating her shoplifting arrest? When Zoolander is being brainwashed (apparently this took a week rather than 10 minutes), the imagery is trippy: it's the most visually odd part of the movie, including the mermaid commerical ("Mer-MAN!"). Some typecasting occurs: David Duchovny plays a secretive conspiracy busting hand model. My sweetheart &amp; I occasionally quote some line from the movie to each other to elicit a smile.</fullReview>

Even the cameo's are hilarious, Bowie, Duchovny, voight.......good stuff, good DVD extras too.</fullReview>

Though , not all of her works are my types. This one is quite special for her , ?cause I??ve never seen her played such a role before, (Whao!

		<fullReview>That is to say Stiller sr. has more comic pop than his son. It's too bad, really, because it goes to show you that comic genius isn't in the genes.Looking at films over the past decade and a half one clearly sees an appeasement to grab teenage dollars. Hence the making of films that appeal to teenage sensibilities. Specifically American-Teenage sensibilities. I've yet to see the French remake of "Porky's," or the Japanese remake of "Bachelor Party," or even the Brazillian or British versions of Teenage-Movie-X. Years ago I saw one of several British "sex" farses (a popular genre at the time), as well as other foreign films that integrate sex and comedy successfully, including some classic American films. But they were different. They were funny. Zoolander isn't.Why? Answer; when market share drives an industry based on "art," and the market is teenage boys, and specifically American teenage boys, one can't have much hope for anything beyond groin and body-function jokes. Now, if you find that funny, then Zoolander may be the film for you.And so it is with Zoolander. Oh sure, there's a sophisticated gag tossed in here and there, but the comedy is so poorly timed (jokes seemed to be telegraphed an hour ahead of time) that one wonders who would back this film? A male fashion model spoof probably sounded good on paper, and when told with the upbeat silly delivery of Stiller Jr. what studio exec. could resist backing the project? Answer; one with a keen market sense on how to grab adolescent dollars.Which begs one to ask why Stiller Jr., for a man of his maturity, would think that his comedy is good? Well, answer; because lots of teenage and teenage-like males think it is. Now why is that? Without going into a large dissertation on what I see as a market driven depravity in popular American cinema, I think the answer simple; poor taste.SPOILER ALERT; Example: The notion of a fashion-runway-off sounds funny, and probably got laughs as people read the script, but seeing it on screen one barely cracks a grin. Acting silly isn't the same as being funny. To be funny, one may act silly. But acting silly doesn't make one funny. SPOILER ALERT OFF.I've said it many times before; I love Big Macs. I love Whoppers. To me there's nothing like a good old fashioned American hamburger with "French/Freedom"-fries and a shake. But that doesn't make 'em five-star cuisine! Similarly seeing someone behave like the most outrageous clown in the world on screen doesn't make him funny, much less put him in the class of Eddy Murphy, Jay Lenno, Jackie Gleason, Stiller Sr. and whoever else you want to add to that list (provided your choice has merit).The film's plot tries to hit upon sweat-shop labor, but the humor and story are so labored themselves that one wonders what made Stiller Jr. think any of this was the least bit humorous? To laugh at the jokes in this film one needs to completely shut down their brain. Even then I don't think paradoying group sex could solicit the smallest chuckle.It's almost as if this film were a giant experiment. Usually test-market films are low budgeted projects to try and showcase an upcoming actor that a studio wants to make a star, or an actor trying to make the transition from one medium (stage, TV or somesuch) to the screen. But this one, to me at least, seems to be testing the market as to how dumb the humor can be made in a film and still be sellable.Well, judgeing by the dollars this turkey made (with apologies to turkeys everywhere) I would guess American teenage boys (and those with like taste) have a low threshold of humor. For all it's worth Stiller Jr. could've just stood in front of an Arriflex or Panavision camera and make silly faces for 90 minutes (provided he inserted a knock-knock joke here and there), because that's essentially what this film amounts to.Outrageous comedy doesn't need to be outrageous. It needs to be comedy. Well, Mr. Stiller, you got me. I spent the money to rent this thing. But rest assured I'll be avoiding your future films. And to anyone else who reads this, don't say I didn't warn you.If you want a comedy that's outrageous, but makes sense, is funny, and tackles a socially sensitive issue, go rent or buy "Undercover Brother." Same humor styleings, only it's funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly &amp; lacking in variety but if the trailer is laugh out loud, then go for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The is a very silly comedy about the world of male models. In essence male models are portrayed as very dumb such as not knowing to not play with gasoline while smoking. All the humor seems to center around male models who are dumb as dirt as well as vain. I have read other reviews and to my surprise it was considered funny. My advice is to look at the movie trailer for this film. If you laugh out loud and think it is worth the while then look at the movie to catch the detailed skits. My own opinion is that Zoolander is a nightmare Saturday Night Live Skit that has gone an hour and a half too long. This movie suffers from it's lacks of variety. For example, I admits to putting off seeing the first Austin Powers movie, because it was difficult to imagine getting more than a fifteen minute skit around a super spy that is lost in the sixties. However, the Powers film did vary the skits in that it made fun of a variety topics and the sixties throw back was only part of the entertainment. However, back to the purpose of that digression, the failure of Zoolander is that is stayed on a topic that does not have over fifteen minutes worth of material. It keeps showing us over and over again that male models are dumb and dumber. In fact, Dumb and Dumber is also a better movie than this one. I say pass it up with a rating of about 4.2, but if you love the trailer then you will likely have a good time with this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always liked Ben Stiller. He is simply hilarious. And in this movie, he is at his best. Playing the male-model Derek Zoolander who is 100% he is going to win the Male Model of the year award again (for the 4th time in a row) he is taken by suprise when another model, Hansel, takes the price. Zoolander decides to quit the male modeling business, and go do... other stuff. (as Zooland probably would have put it). But since his career is fading, a rich dude called Mugatu wants to hire him for one last job... To kill the president of Malaysia. After being brainwashed, and some other stuff, he slowly begins to understand what the male modeling business is all about. Corruption!Definetly funny! This movie is packed with hilarious jokes and spoofs (the lemonade commercial, with gasoline, had me rolling on the floor! And so did the 2001 spoof!), this is a movie you must not miss out on! As usual, in Ben Stiller movies, Owen Wilson has a pretty big part in it as well, as Hansel, the arch-enemy of Derek Zoolander. Owen Wilson is definetly too hilarious... "The files are in the computer? Of course! its so simple!".Watch this movie, and watch it with an open mind! Its hilarious! 8 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best advice I can give anyone is to anyone is give this movie a chance. Don't go into it expecting your run of the mill Jim Carrey slapstick routine, although if that is all you want you will not be disappointed. Much of this movie relies on how (un)smart the character dialogue is. In my opinion it is the small details that raises this movie above other slapstick comedy's. Pay special attention to facial expressions other than "magnum" etc. Stiller's face after he has stumbled through a sentence is priceless. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Ferrell as Mugatu and Wilson as Hansel are priceless. One warning it will be impossible to take Owen Wilson seriously in any other movie after seeing Zoolander. Great film for all ages, silly and smart at the same time and definitely underrated. And don't forget the DVD outakes, Mugatu especially.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking docu-drama of modeling industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay even I'm not that dumb. Ben Stiller is Derek Zoolander, reigning international male model until Owen Wilson comes on the scene. Subplot involves scheme by fashion mogul Will Farrell to use Derek to kill third world leader, but the most fun is in the spoof of modeling by Stiller and Wilson. Hard to understand the spread of IMDb reviews on this movie, I would say it's definitely a notch above the typical SNL-type theme comedy movie (Strange Brew, etc) but falls a little short of a comedy classic. Farrell is a lot of fun in his role, David Bowie has an inspired appearance and Stiller and Wilson almost always play well together. Taylor's many reaction shots are also priceless. For what it's worth, the first time I saw this I started halfway through and thought it was even more hilarious than when I saw it again from the start, but just the same I will tune in often when it's on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but only managed a couple of giggles. I loved Ben Stiller's previous movie, Meet the Parents. I laughed so hard during that movie, so I had high expectations for Zoolander. But, I just didn't find much that was funny about this film. This movie mocks models. Maybe if I was a model, I would have found this more humorous. I did like the walk off and when the male models are slinging gas everywhere to an 80s tune. But, Will Ferrell was stupid in this and not funny.FINAL VERDICT: This was more of a satire than a slap-stick funny comedy, which is what I was expecting. I don't recommend it because there just aren't enough funny scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander satisfies all the requirements of a complete story: A beginning, a middle, and a satisfying end... all presented in the regulation three-act format to which we have all become accustomed. Heck, there's even a good back-story, and that's more than can be said for much of what we're exposed to these days. When a director manages to get all of that onto the screen then he or she has accomplished something noteworthy.When a film touches its audience in exactly the way the director intended then that film is a success. There is no doubt that Ben Stiller intended Zoolander to be a farce... nothing more and nothing less... give the audience a good dose of the giggles and leave it at that. From where I sit Zoolander is an excellent example of the modern-day farce.Like most of us, I have a higher than warranted opinion of myself and I like to think that I'm predisposed to preferring *intellectual* comedy as opposed to slapstick. (Just when did society officially decide to demean slapstick?) So the first time I saw Zoolander I just sort of chuckled at all the right places. But afterwards I thought about the film a bit and realized that it was indeed a complete story and not just a collection of gags. So off to the rental house I went...I'm not sure how many times I've seen Zoolander to date, but I do know that in order for me to watch a film so often that there has got to be something to it. Whatever that something is, Zoolander has got it. And director Ben Stiller knew how to put it there.This film is worth seeing several times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. I put off seeing this for almost 2 years but agreed to watch when my son rented it. Surprisingly, there were plenty of laughs to keep me watching. However, I must say that Mr. Stiller's talents appear to be writing and acting - not directing. 5 years since "The Cable Guy" and he still just doesn't have the feel of a big time director. Always enjoyable to see father and son work together (Ben &amp; Jerry) and Owen Wilson pulls off the male model role thanks to his natural quirkiness. Most enjoyed watching Christine Taylor ("the Wedding Singer"), but thought Wil Ferrell had WAY too much screen time. An almost unrecognizable Milla Jovovich was interesting, and Vince Vaughn in a non-speaking role had me cracking up. Jon Voight proved again why he doesn't work much these days, and David Duchovny sheds all pride for a funny turn as a hand model informant. Comedy is tough, so I will tip my cap to Ben for keeping me for the entire movie, so I say "Relax" and enjoy this for what it is.</fullReview>

On many, it works, but not on some others. It is like a campy B-movie, but instead of under-writing and under-playing, it goes the other way, with the jokes outlandish and the acting so over the top. In some ways, it is like a long Saturday Night Live skit, where you try to get the maximum impact in the alloted time, but this goes on for much longer than a few minutes, although it does not fail in the way of some of the SNL spinoffs.But taken for what it is, you would get a good laugh out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hilarious movie with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. The two together, like in Meet the Parents, fit very well with each other. The concept of the movie on the whole is entertaining. It kind of gives a glimpse into the seedy underworld of fashion, much like Death to Smoochy did for children's shows. So anyway, you really need to have an appreciation for subtleness and irony, otherwise you should not really watch it, because you most likely not enjoy it. Most characters in the movie are based on their previous acting careers, so you sort of need to be up on pop-culture or have watched a large amount of movies and TV. Some funny scenes are the gasoline fight and the walk-off. There are numerous gags within the movie, some recurring which are subtle: the small cellphone, the derelict(e) campaign, Zoolander's "one look", crazy hippie stylings of Owen Wilson, the inability for the models to understand the computer, and the breakdance fight. I rate it a 10 because I can understand it.</fullReview>

Hell, I watched Ace Ventura 2 when I was drunk and thought it was hilarious.With Zoolander, you can expect too much and feel let down. I went to the cinema to see it expecting a bellyacher of a movie. I walked away feeling it was an ok movie, with a few laughs. BUT:a couple of months later, I watched it again TWICE. You pick up on stuff you missed in the first watching. The jokes seem funnier. The scenes are funnier. Its one of those movies that in the beginning you think is average. But the more you watch it, the more you enjoy it till it turns out to be one of your favourite movies.The movie is STUPID. The movie is OUTRAGEOUS. But if you are willing to take your brain out for an hour and half and just laugh at the absurdity, the fake cameos, the dumb jokes but most of the STUPIDness, you'll love it and you'll repeat the lines over and over again.I can help being really really really ridiculously good looking!!There's Hansel, he so hot!!I give you, the Derek Zoolander School for Kids who can't read good!!---------------------------------------------------------------------Plus, the walkoff between Derek and Hansel is brilliant. That should be remembered in comedy history.</fullReview>

The whole point of the film, which everybody knows already anyway, is revealed early on, and it's ?models are dumb'. The same point is being relentlessly hammered home over an hour later after the braindead plot, which isn't even worth repeating, unfolds. Granted, it's intended to be a very silly comedy, and that's what it is; just not a funny one. Mercifully the running time is brief. If you laugh at it, consider a career as a model.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some Godforsaken reason I rented this film recently and have to tell you, it is the biggest piece-O'-dung (other than Popeye) that I have ever seen. I was shocked because I have been a great fan of Ben Stiller since the days of his TV show. This film was SOOO bad that, had I not been home, I would have walked out on it. This is yet another clear example that when you try to take a dumb bit from a show?maybe something that was funny for three minutes, ONCE?and then you try to make a feature film out of it, you are doomed to fail.</fullReview>

I've seen the VH-1 spots and I think that the film doesn't have enough ideas like the spots have. Zoolander is quite entertaining, because of the good performances. Stiller is good as Zoolander and Wilson is excellent as Hansel. Will Ferrell is good also, but doesn't have enough screen time. Too bad that the movie isn't quite funny... ** out of *****</fullReview>

Sure some of the lines were funny and the refrences to 2001 and the godfather part 2 made me chuckle but apart from that the only over memroble part was the school for chilldren how can't read and that was in the trailer. It reminded me of a poor-man austin powers and the hummor is to forced(ben stiller dosen't quite come across as a bumbling idiot he seem's to much of an intelligent person in real life)this film may be rated at 6.1 but it seems to have a large amount of negitive comments on hear so isn't about time it was brought down to a 5.?5/10(watch mystery men instead it's much funnier)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film reminded me of Mystery Men - another Stiller film. It was a clever concept and had some very funny and intelligent parts in it - but the whole thing didn't quite convert a clever idea into a killer movie.

I think it is a light-hearted movie that just about achieves its aims - silly fun for just under 1 1/2 hours. My vote a solid 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller)is the dumbest male model around. He has just failed to win "male model of the year" for the 4th straight year and is picked as the perfect one to be brainwashed into assassinating the Prime Minister of Malaysia who will be a guest at the big show in 14 days.This is a Ben Stiller movie. Star, director, probably had a hand in writing and producing. There are many genuinely funny parts in this film. However all put together it doesn't quite work as a movie. I enjoyed it, but as an attempt at a good, silly parody of the fashion industry, it falls flat. Perhaps the most interesting feature is all the cameos -- his mom and dad, and a whole host of famous people playing themselves, mainly in very short "interviews" where they explain their high regard for Derek Zoolander.The DVD is good, some of the outtakes and some of the deleted scenes are interesting. Not one to own, just a quick viewing and return to the rental store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falls short of a classic, still a worthwhile watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once the viewer can get over Ben Stiller's mildly irritating on-screen persona as Derek Zoolander, the film actually becomes a somewhat amusing show. The concept of Zoolander similarly mirrors the Farley Brothers (Kingpin, Shallow Hal) standard comedic formula where a spoofy, goofy, dim-witted martyr ends up becoming a hero. And in the end, our hero ends up saving the day while doing the right thing, and eventually is rewarded with love. However, the similarities between the films stop there. Zoolander's obvious strengths are its Austin Powers-like costume and set design where a lot of flamboyant colors, outfits, and hairdos help keep the movie visually interesting, while giving it an almost post modern feel. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is somewhat exacerbated by the gimmicky post-production and editing techniques employed. As expected, the acting is reliable and sound, especially Owen Wilson, who has a natural on-screen presence and is humorous, yet believable in just about every movie he co-stars in.The script has both an upside and several drawbacks. The male model concept of the film is quite original, yet as previously mentioned the movie is formulaic. Also, many of the one-liners and other jokes miss, so although the movie is entertaining it is not incredibly funny. Furthermore, Zoolander fails to succeed in delivering one of its primary social commentaries - the fact that there is more to life than just looks and image. While it does make the film more entertaining, every back-up in the movie is beautiful and the film is highly stylized thus adding to the hypocrisy of its message. (In its defense, the parallel message of sweat shop labor exploitation in 3rd world countries definitely hits the mark.) The best thing about Zoolander is the last 30 minutes where the majority of the comic relief appears. It comes primarily from the supporting cast, especially Wilson and Jerry Stiller and it really does make the movie a worthwhile viewing, at least for a weekday night. Overall, Zoolander is an attention-grabbing and unique film that has its moments, but its too frequent clichs and unfunny scenes make it a no-better than a slightly above average comedy. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>clever does not equal funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>let me say this up front: zoolander is a clever movie. there is a lot of satire in this movie, and it looked like ben stiller and his friends had a lot of fun making it. if you were one of ben stiller's friends, this movie would be hilarious to watch. you'd get to say things like "oh, man! remember how many burritos i ate that night? you can TOTALLY tell i have to take a dump in this scene!" and you'd laugh and smile at each other.HOWEVER, for the rest of us, zoolander is a bad, bad, bad, bad movie (and world). while cleverly written, this is so unfunny, it hurts my teeth. and they are not terribly sensitive, so it had to be an incredible shock of unfunny to get any reaction at all. first off, who decided that ben stiller should carry a movie? was i asleep during that meeting? the man served his purpose in "there's something about mary." he should have retired then. i know, some of you are saying "but what about 'meet the parents,' or 'zero effect' or 'mystery men'? they were all right." and to you i say this: i stand by my original statement. as far as attempted jokes to jokes i laughed at goes, zoolander's batting average isn't high enough to legally drink in the U.S.the other major problem with this movie was the number of celebrity bit roles. now, i am not against cameos, especially in a film about the modeling industry. but can't you get some talented cameos? david bowie, alright, i'll admit that he's cool. but milla jovich, stephen dorff, jon voight, vince vaughn, david duchovny, jerry stiller, and others? they would have been better off buying a dannon talent-on-the-bottom yogurt.i need to go to a confessional and beg for forgiveness because i actually paid to see this. and i'm not even catholic. overall, i would have to say that my hatred for this movie is equal to that of "the doom generation" and "battlefield earth," illustrious company, indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occasionally, Zoolander is painfully hilarious, but even that does not overshadow the pre-production goals of lucrative cheeseball comedy and the tasteless subject matter that resulted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zoolander is the story of the hottest but dumbest male model in the world, Derek Zoolander (who happens to be living the skinny American Dream of getting paid vast amounts of money to have his picture taken and become famous), who grows disillusioned with the modeling industry after he is suddenly overshadowed by another male model at an awards show, and is then targeted and effortlessly brainwashed to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia in order to perpetuate the male modeling industry. Evidently, that Prime Minister is just too set in his efforts to eradicate child labor in Malaysia, which would just be an unacceptable blow to the fashion industry, which relies too much on the efforts of such child labor. The first thing that strikes me about this plotline is that, with the astronomical amount of money that circulates in the fashion industry, most of which goes into the sickening paychecks of the powerful people involved in that industry, I would think that they could finally start paying regular prices for the manufacturing of the clothing that they use in their business.Why is it that the hugest and richest corporations always seem to be the ones involved in child labor? One of the great ironies of capitalism (and, indeed one of the more disturbing ones) is that the more money people have, the less they want to spend. So we get these dirt-poor kids in foreign countries who spend long days in sweatshops making these products for next to nothing, and then the products are shipped here where they're modeled and then sold at astronomical prices.Besides that, I was truly shocked that they portrayed the Prime Minister of Malaysia, who is a real person, as the "antagonist" who wants to eradicate child labor laws, and they make him the target of this ludicrous assassination. As Roger Ebert mentioned, did NOBODY involved with the movie think that maybe that was in bad taste? I'm sure that nobody who was involved in the overlooking of this massive point meant any harm by this, but Derek Zoolander also meant no harm in being brainwashed, but that doesn't make him very intelligent. It seems strange that the film is structured entirely around this plot to have Derek Zoolander assassinate the Prime Minister, and yet the comedy in the film comes entirely from his tiny intellect. The fact that we laugh at the hilarious extent of Derek's stupidity and the similar allusion to an alleged lack of cognitive activity in the fashion industry as a whole (`Derek, me help you did!'), and not Derek's working over by Mugatu, the real antagonist in the film, completely eliminates the need for any subplot, especially one that involves a plot to murder a real and highly respected world leader.While I was overall less than impressed by the film, I can't say that I didn't just about lose consciousness laughing so hard at Zoolander's response when J.P. Prewitt (David Duchovny) told him that Mugatu will most likely use some kind of auditory or visual Pavlovian response mechanism to get him to kill the Prime Minister (`An after party?'), and then again at Prewitt's response after having been shot when Zoolander takes off on his mission and steps on his glass-encased hand (`AAAHHHhhh you freakin' idiot!'). THAT was some great stuff, and there are at least three or four other moments of quality laughs, but it's just too bad that there was so much tasteless content in the movie, especially since it went far beyond the childish and disgusting humor that usually plagues bad comedies these days (American Pie, the Scary Movies, Road Trip, Sorority Boys, etc.). Watch the movie for the great interactions between Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, but be advised that there is some truly tasteless and often offensive content in the movie, and it can't all be dismissed just by acknowledging the fact that it's just some goofball comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets mighty tedious after a while.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ZOOLANDER (2001) Rating: 3/10Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), he of the famed "Blue Steel" pose, has been the biggest thing in male modeling for the past few years, gracing magazine covers and billboards with his "really really really good looks", walking down the runways around the world and attending the trendiest parties with the hippest celebrities. Yet now trouble is nigh, with not only the hot new kid on the block Hansel (Owen Wilson) threatening to steal his thunder and a Time reporter (Christine Taylor) making him look like an idiot in an article but also evil designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) who brainwashes him into assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia to stop him from stopping child labor and henceforth putting clothes factories into jeopardy.Written like that, it sounds as if ZOOLANDER is quite a complex story, but all these plot-lines merely feel like afterthoughts. The spin on the "Manchurian Candidate" premise, for instance, is little more than an excuse to move from a more-or-less-comic set piece to another. It's based on a 5 minute bit Ben Stiller did for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards which satirically confirmed the general impression that models are "vain, stupid and incredibly self-centered". The character of Derek Zoolander epitomizes these traits, and it's funny enough... for a while. But when that single joke is stretched to 90 minutes, it gets mighty tedious. Less than halfway though I was checking my watch in boredom and wondering how if there was much more to go.Stiller, who co-wrote the screenplay and directed, is no hack (I thought his previous THE CABLE GUY was a vastly underrated dark comedy), but his film is nonetheless generic, uneven and self-indulgent. Stiller gives way too much screen time to his wife Christine Taylor, who has the thankless role of the "serious" chick reporter always conveniently around to handle the plot exposition and serve as a love interest out of the blue. Ben also cast his dad Jerry Stiller to more success, as the old guy scores a couple of big laughs with some dubious material. Also shining through is Will Ferrell, who always manages to make me laugh. He's been the best thing about "Saturday Night Life" for the past decade, and he's hilarious here as a maniacal Bond villain of a designer with goofy white curls akin to his pet poodle's. Owen Wilson also has his moments as another variation on the neo-hippie/surfer dude he's been playing in every movie lately. As for Stiller himself, he's not bad, but this is just such a one note performance... Derek's vain, stupid and incredibly self-centered, all right, we get it, enough already!All in all, I can't recommend ZOOLANDER. I enjoyed a few parts of it, but they're lost in an endless string of dumb &amp; dumber jokes, pointless cameos (I don't think Vince Vaughn has a single line), 80s pop montages and half-clever spoofs (2001, The Godfather...). There really isn't much to the film which couldn't fit in a 2 minute trailer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller's act of Derek Zoolander has always been funny on TV but unfortunately only so-so on the big screen.Spoofing models was a good idea but I'd like to have seen this shot like a mock-u-mentary. Instead of being about some kind of child labor assassination plot thing.The movie does do a good job by not really making that the focus and instead allowing the movie to be a spoof. There are some great moments like at the end when Zoolander turns left. Will Ferrell is one of my favorites and shows why here (although he has done better). Owen Wilson is good but his character seems to change. At first he seems much smarter than Zoolander and then appears to be just as stupid. The "walk off" was brilliant but took too long. A mistake most spoofs make.Ben Stiller's wife plays the reporter/straight person of the movie, outside of being a vehicle to push the movie along and to set up a couple jokes, she's useless. Jerry Stiller's character is even more useless but he helps the move close with a scooby-doo ending.Overall the movies just seems hollow and never really grabbed my interest. Instead I was looking at a movie that I felt I should've laughed at more but it failed to make any connection. Good fun but I'll never see it again 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Dumb &amp; Dumber" Meets "Pret-A-Porter" In A One-Joke Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller can be very funny, and has a natural flair for comedy, both in terms of acting and directing, but this attempt at spoofing the fashion industry doesn't achieve the level of irony and humour it could have. The main weakness? The script could have been richer and, well, much funnier. In 'Derek Zoolander', Stiller creates a loveably dumb character, a top male model who is all beauty and no brains. But it works out as little more than a one-joke movie, and even that one joke (that models are dumb) is stretched too thin to be really funny. Mike Myers did the whole male vanity-cum-dumbness routine much more richly with Austin Powers. Having said all that, however, the movie is almost worth watching for the plot device in the climax alone. OK, so it's Stiller, and thus watchable, but with all that talent there (I mean, even Stiller's dad is played by Jon Voight), it could have been much better. Owen Wilson is good, though, as the blonde supermodel Hansel, and the movie is an amiable way to pass an evening. But it isn't Stiller's best work.</fullReview>

Ben Stiller is a fine actor but this makes me wonder about his directorial talent. He took a fine cast and made a movie without much of a script. There are very few yuks in this. How he can squander his father's great comedic talent is a mystery. Even more mysterious is his skill at wasting the talents of Milla Jovovich. One can go the entire movie and not realize that she's even there. What a waste. If they only had a script and a few jokes. I expect to see something of Owen Wilson in the not too distant future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I've seen in 2001.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry to say, but this movie was the worst I have ever seen. I truly laughed about once or twice in the first 30min, after that I didn't even laugh once, the acting was pathetic, the plot was not that great. I mean I had a better time watching previews. It was so bad that I had to leave for a cigarette break for like 25 minutes, and when I came back, my 2 friends said that I should of stayed there longer. So my suggestion is don't rent this movie, or buy it, because it's a waste of money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is honestly one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long long time. Yes it is stupid, pointless and at times crude, but the quality and depth it is produced with makes these negative qualities into good ones. The writing was wonderful--full of those great little nuggets of comedy--and Zoolander is one of the most quoteable movies I have ever seen! People pan this movie for being stupid--that it is "made by idiots, for idiots." Zoolander is a clever and refreshing comedy. I love the fact that there is a model named Hansel--I mean, that is hilarious!! And then Will Ferrel's Mugatu was just fantastic (but then when is Ferrel anything other than hilarious). I think that anyone who wants to see this movie needs to give it a solid chance--you'll probably love it! "I'm sorry, did my pin get in the way of your a**? Do me a favor and lose five pounds immediately or get out of my building like now!!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I had a comment on this movie before, I have to say again, that it was a disappointment and I would recommend this if you don't want to look into the world of stupidity. The only good thing really about the movie was that it had extremely good potential, but it really blew it. It's one of those movies where your phsyced about it, but when you it's blah... A lot of talent was wasted in the movie. It had a pretty good cast, not great, and a good modern comedian, Ben Stiller. Ben Stiller has done much better in his career. He was great in Keeping the Faith and Meet the Parents. I didn't see Something About Mary, but it sounds hilarious from what I here on this site. I'm guessing it is, because it's done by the Farrely Brothers who created the comedy which is destined or already is a comedy classic Dumb &amp; Dumber. But anyways with Zoolander, it's disappointing. If you want to see a good comedy brought to you in 2001 see Rat Race. That was one of the most pleasantly surprising movies I've seen in a while too. Another pleasant surprise from 2001 was Legally Blonde. Zoolander is a disappointing surprise. Zoolander's rating which has lowered from my last review is now 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice directing and performance by Ben Stiller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I became a fan of Ben Stiller only recently, after watching him as a guest in the program called `Inside The Actor's Studio' produced by James Lipton. He was so likeable and naturally? funny. When asked if being funny was a skill or a gift, he replied that he didn't know how you could teach somebody to be funny. Before that, I had seen him in: There's Something About Mary and Meet The Parents. At that time, I was more interested in watching Cameron Diaz or Robert De Niro's performances.In his previous movies, Ben Stiller would portray a nice but unlucky guy, so incredibly unlucky that it was unnerving. With Zoolander, he remains a nice guy, but instead of being incredibly unlucky, he becomes a victim. He is no longer the hero - lacking super human powers though - who has to face adverse circumstances to achieve his goal (conquer the woman that he loves, or her family for that matter). In Zoolander, he is a kind of anti-hero who had no goal whatsoever (apart from having absolute FUN ? even at the cost of human lives), until his fame shakes and he becomes a target of a dreadful manipulation...I'd say, if you are NOT a fan of Ben Stiller; or if you are a fan of the Ben Stiller of his previous movies; or if you expect the comedy genre to be witty and high-brow, stay home and wait until it's available on video to rent Zoolander. You'll have a good time if you keep your mind open and want to relax one evening.Derek Zoolander has only the look for him, and a big heart ? but other than that, he is VERY stupid. In fact, he is a caricature, meaning that his character is based on real life traits. But those real traits are found in various persons. For the purpose of the caricature, they are mixed together in one character and distorted with great exaggeration. As a result, people are fooled: they think that someone like Derek Zoolander cannot be found out there in the real world, nor either of the other characters in the movie.I especially liked the opening scene in the warehouse, where they plan to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister and state the reasons why he is a threat to the industry. I also liked the shots for Derek Zoolander's first appearance, through the journalist Matilda Jeffries. There is a suspense that was nicely built up: what is he going to look like?! Another of my favorite scenes was the brainwashing scene, where he is made to believe that the children themselves claim for their rights to be able to work in the factories. And I found the new historical perspective on Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations very funny.Because the whole thing is a true FARCE ? nobody feels threatened, very rare are the people who will gain a new insight, a fresh outlook on what our everyday world is made of, how we contribute to model it by the choices or non-choices that we make. So all is well, we are safe and we still have fun!I found the theme of the movie very enticing: the modeling/fashion industry, and featuring a male model in a ridiculous manner is a great idea. The directing by Ben Stiller was good. There was a good pace and the movie moved along smoothly. The only thing I missed was more `insights' on the modeling industry, such as the flashback Derek Zoolander had on pretending to be a monkey during a photo shoot. The David Bowie cameo appearance was very nicely done.Some people didn't like the fact that Zoolander appeared as a kind of `family movie', with Ben Stiller's Dad (Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein) and his wife (Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries) play supporting roles. Jerry Stiller was perfect for the role and great in this movie. Christine Taylor was OK, but to me, she failed to inspire a special feeling for this female journalist (good girl/bad girl?). Maybe the script was at fault, but as a talented actress, she should have been able to carve an unforgettable character for Matilda Jeffries. Think about Milla Jovovich's performance as Katinka. She was absolutely fantastic. We need more striking performances for female leads ? which are unfortunately still too rare on the screen.I gave it 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit better than Mystery Men, at least it moves along at a faster clip and the jokes come at you quickly enough that when 3 or 4 fall flat, the next one might hit you. Overall, I think it should have been funnier than it was, but perhaps it's a bit hard to send up something (male fashion modeling) that's already something of a send-up on its own. Most of the fun comes from the cameo appearances, Jon Voight as Zoolander's father, David Bowie refereeing the "walk off", even the bizarre cameo by Andy Dick.I'll ask the same question that Roger Ebert did. Why did they have to pick on Malaysia for this? Why not use a fictitious country (as the Marx Bros. did in Duck Soup, Peter Sellers in Mouse That Roared, dozens of other references)?And then, once having chosen Malaysia, why is everything about it completely inaccurate? Never mind the fact that the "news shots" in Malaysia show signs in English and Arabic, which is completely wrong. What about the fact that at the end, when Zoolander addresses the Malaysian PM in what the audience will assume to be Malaysian, he's actually speaking Bahasa Indonesia? Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one's going to give Zoolander awards for cinematic achievement. The plot is Austin Powers light, and saying the acting is hammy is like saying the sky is kind of above the ground. Still, there are a lot of goofy laughs, most of them pretty clever, so it makes for a good rental or tv movie.Ben Stiller pulls an Orson Welles, or perhaps more accurately a Woody Allen as Derek Zoolander; aside from starring, he also directed, co-wrote, and co-produced the film. Zoolander is the world's top male model, a vacuous pretty boy (Who isn't all that good looking since it is, after all, Ben Stiller) who finds his world crashing down around him. His hated rival, Hansel (The hilarious Owen Wilson) is "hot" and wins Zoolander's award, Time magazine has just named him a "model idiot" and, to top it all off, an international cartel of fashion designers are plotting to use him as a disposable assassin in a scheme to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. It's just that simple!Stiller gets plenty of mileage out of dumb model jokes, and his performance is the ultimate innocuous idiot good guy. It's also nice to see the blonde female (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor) break stereotype and far outhink her male counterparts. But the plot starts to fall apart at the end, with a bizarre alliance between Hansel and Zoolander that feels wrong, and a clunky and unexciting finale. And for all his weirdness as evil designer Mugatu, Will Ferrell doesn't seem too funny, just weird. The movie is so slight, on a bad day I might have said avoid it. But in the right mood for the right price you can probably enjoy the movie on a certain level; goofy laughs and some good comedic acting. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How stupid does Ben Stiller think we are?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BEWARE! GREAT BIG SPOILER! (Especially for Stiller fans)Indeed. How stupid does Ben Stiller actually think his paying audience is? 'Zoolander' is THE worst film I have seen in a very long time. Considering that Mr. Stiller has done some really good comedy, one might like to think that the film could have been extremely funny, since the idea of using the fashion industry as a frame for a comedy does indeed have a lot of potential. However, what was a good concept turned into a film full of unoriginal slapstick, clichs, one-dimensional characters and dialogues bordering on cretinism. Who ever told Mr. Stiller that outright stupidity was funny? Isn't it the very essence of comedy to present us with more-or-less normal, everyday characters - people one can identify with - who find themselves in situations which, once again, one might be likely to experience onesself? In short, isn't it just about caring for the characters and feeling with them? Mr. Stiller, however, preferred to exaggerate a potentially lovable and dim yet good-hearted character, thereby turning him into a more- than-anything-else stupid, stupid, stupid character hardly anyone could care less about. And a character I couldn't care less about is just plain boring. And bored I was. I waited in vain for something resembling a catharsis at the end, just to make me feel the film hadn't been an utter waste of time and money, but any hint of character development obviously was not the prerogative of 'Zoolander'. (A comparison with 'Legally Blonde' might be appropriate at this point, as the main characters could be seen as being similar. However the "dumb blonde" played by Reese Witherspoon sets out to achieve something, learns and matures through the course of the film, and turns out to be not quite the dim-wit she seemed. Derek Zoolander on the other hand constantly confirms our hunch that he might possibly be a complete and utter moron.) So, add to all this a weak plot, lack of suspense, overacted and stereotypical characters and a kind of banal humour which can only be seen as an insult to any adult and you have 'Zoolander', a film I would not even bother watching on TV. Not even if I were bed-ridden for a month, with 39 fever, no good books around and nothing better to do. Sorry, but not even in such a situation would I want to be taken for a fool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing that Ben Stiller directed, co-wrote, co-produced and starred in this film, one would think there'd be some "personal vision" in evidence, but alas, Stiller seems to be no auteur. This is a light, insubstantial sprinkling of dressing, lacking a main course. As the venerable John says below, the film is much like a few episodes loosely put together by a bunch of friends. Stiller really does impose no proper structure upon this film; it does seem more like a half-baked "TV special" than a film.Most tellingly perhaps, Stiller's main character is a truly unsubtle stereotype, far from funny himself, or even when used as comic fall guy. The character is plain irritating; Stiller seems to think a few gormless mannerisms and a silly voice are enough; frankly, they are not. Tellingly, one can never quite sympathize with this "character".Overall, a bad film, which was watchable, just about, if cringeworthily cliched a lot of the time. There were a few half-laughs, but a mere few do not a comedy make. Rating:- **/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5 out of 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came out of the film declaring it to be worth no more than four out of 10. I can't fully explain why I have given it such a poor mark even after upping it to a 5. It was not that bad, it contained funny moments, it contained some good ideas, and it had good actors in. However, it was a big disappointment.It just wasn't funny enough. Zoolander was over acted and poorly portrayed by Stiller. The character smacked not of idiocy but of insincerity. He was annoying, predictable and ill thought out. It would have been so much better if Stiller had not affected that dumb accent. The accent didn't really work for me and it would have been better to show Zoolander's stupidity entirely through his dialogue and actions. It was stupid and ridiculous. It did contain good ideas with a great deal of potential humour but... it just didn't work. To me it seemed ill thought out, like the first draft of a film, nor really ready for publication. It reminds me strongly of another Stiller vehicle, Mystery Men. Bags of potential but ultimately disappointing. It's like the whole thing was just the product of a bunch of mates having a laugh together. It needed a lot more work put into it at the writing stage, and basically a lot more planning prior to production.The characters were weak. The models were write offs as main characters almost immediately - they would have been excellent props and quite useful as sub characters. The humour was generally one level humour and without any shade of subtlety. There were far too few laughs and at the audience could be seen cringing on more than one occasion during the film. That said, it was well produced and there were funny moments, such as David Bowie's cameo. Still the funny moments were not developed enough and surely, with further work in pre production flaws such as these could have been reduced. This was not an unwatchable film. It was entertaining but sadly not awfully funny, and surely, that is what a comedy is supposed to be?</fullReview>

It means that if you think EXTREME STUPIDITY is funny then go see it, otherwise stay away. Also, the actor didn't look like a male model which made the movie even less believable (like if that is possible! LOL). Anyways, to me the movie wasn't funny at all and I don't understand how someone could find it funny. But just like I said, my friend liked it so I guess it depends on the person. I remember that I didn't find the trailer funny, so that could be a hint. If you enjoyed the trailer go see it, if you didn't find the trailer interesting then stay away. Also, the movie hurts the reputation of male models. I'm sure they are normal intelligent people and it's sad that they are portrayed and seen like this in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After sitting through 'Zoolander' I couldn't help but wonder, "Why would a comic genius like Ben Stiller make such a lousy movie?" I know, it was intended as a satyre of the modeling industry or what ever. Also, I enjoy eye candy as much as the next gen-x'er. But this was just out and out stupid. Imagine an hour and a half of the screaming scene in 'Dumb and Dumber' (an excellent movie) and you'll start to get a picture of 'Zoolander'. The only couple of somewhat funny scenes were already fully shown, in context none the less, in the previews.After such genius films as 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Meet the Parents', I would expect Ben Stiller to make something much better. This is like Tom Hanks making 'Forrest Gump' and THEN 'The Burbs'. It's all backwards. Let's all sit in a big circle, light our lighters, and pray that the sequel of 'Meet the Parents' is of the quality Stiller is capable of and had shown prior to 'Zoolander'.</fullReview>

Admittedly, this picture does contain a handful of genuinely funny moments but they are too few and far between to cause much of a rumpus. Brought out amid the foray of media of the September 11th atrocities, it has generally been well received by the critics with its efforts to make the people of New York smile again. That in itself is a very good point, but it still does not save what, when released under normal circumstances, is a very lacklustre event. Very forgettable if it wasn't for the very brave Producers to release this at a time when public reaction could easily have gone the wrong way, but didn't.(4/10)</fullReview>

And by trying to hang some MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE plotline around such a flimsy movie idea to begin with, well it sunk fast. Yes, there are some laughs and even some clever scenes, but Derek Zoolander is such a dim, sullen lead character all it does is remind you whatan amazing feat AUSTIN POWERS really was. Thismovie wanted to try and pull off a satricial bullseye like that film but I feel it really missed it's mark and one of thebig problems was that Stiller decided to direct it himself. The man is not a director. He is a fine actor, a good writer, but his three movies (REALITY BITES, CABLE GUY and now this) well they are patchy messes with no real rhythm or sense of honesty to them. As an actor, Stiller has never been better than in FLIRTING WITH DISASTER. But, Zoolander is like the lead - all one look, nothing else. BLAH!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is so funny you can't help wanting to push this movie along, but it's no use. Zoolander is often amusing, but never quite makes it to funny. Maybe another rewrite was needed? The fact is there are a few laughable moments here and there, but for the most part they are few and far between or the punch-line has already been shown to you a hundred times in the commercials ? oh when will they learn that they spoil the movie that way? But the whole movie is spoiled anyway with it's way too predictable plot international intrigue and silly facial contortions. Derek Zoolander is based on a character Stiller created for the VH1 fashion awards and perhaps that's where he should've stayed. I like Stiller a lot better when he plays mild-mannered characters who get into hilarious trouble like in `Something About Mary' or `Meet the Parents.' And I liked `Zoolander' better the first time around, when it was called `Austin Powers.' Much to my disappointment, this one gets 4/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller created the `Derek Zoolander' character for a five minute sketch on the VH1 Fashion Awards. The antics of the incredibly stupid male model was a big hit, and so they decided to greenlight a full length movie about the character. But the producer's overlooked one thing. Derek Zoolander is a one-joke character. And so its no surprise that the full length movie built around him falls flatter than a bad perm.I was amazed by how few laughs this movie had. And the few jokes that were in `Zoolander,' have already been revealed in the trailer! Now `Zoolander' does have its moments, the celebrity cameos for example, are funny. But they are the exception. So if someone asks you to go see `Zoolander,' runway. I mean, run away! 2 stars out of 5. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb And Dumber On The Catwalk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: The Prime Minister of Malaysia has made a change in the state that greatly affects the Fashion Industry's economy so Mugatu, a very important fashion designer brainwashes the extremely stupid male model Zoolander to kill him.You'll love Zoolander if: You like insanely dumb comedies. The characters lack depth and are unrealistically stupid and the plot is lame? but so what??? That's exactly what the movie is supposed to be, just a simple stupid comedy. While not the cleverest parody it makes fun of the Fashion industry in a nice way, with models being very self-centered and having the IQ of a lipstick, designers that are extremely eccentric, (Will Ferrell kicks ass as Mugatu), and generally things in this movie are stupid but funny. The movie is full of some quite funny quotes and slapstick humor, dumb characters and crazy situations? if you like these stuff you're gonna love Zoolander.You'll hate Zoolander if: You expect an above average parody, something with more depth or if you hate stupid comedies. Don't expect an extremely clever movie? Zoolander is a one of them stupidly wacky ones, full of cheap laughs and very crazy situations. The characters are flat as a wall, logic is non-existent and stupidity defines the word limitless. Example: The 2 main protagonists search for clues and find a computer? they don't know how to use it so they start jumping around and hitting the computer like Chimps and when someone tells them that the files are inside the computer one of them destroys it and upon seeing the computer broke into pieces he says: "Hey, where are the files?". Also too much useless and irritating use of famous people portraying themselves? I don't know about you but I hate that especially when it isn't even funny. Finally the movie is quite fun the first time you see it but gets 10 times more boring the second time.FINAL VERDICT: Enjoyably Stupid (5.7/10)[+] Lots of funny and stupid scenes and quotes. Nice parody of the fashion industry.[-] Not a "clever" comedy. Could be better as a parody. Only for renting.Also Check: Austin Powers (1997) - Dumb And Dumber (1994) ? Meet The Parents (2000) - Scary Movie (2000)P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say "I like\don't like this movie" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...</fullReview>

Blatantly borrowing Mike Myers' "Austin Powers" formula Ben brings us Derek Zoolander, a character as unfunny as he is forgettable. (Note to Benji: Furrowing your brow does not make you a different person.) What was the most-offensive moment in this abortion of a movie...? Hmmm....- Director Ben's treating the audience like slow children, even going so far as to provide an on screen TITLE CARD to identify David Bowie in his cameo. BO-WIE... Bowie!- The film's opening sequence in which C-level celeb scuzz (as themselves from footage filmed at an actual awards show) talk about Derek Zoolander as if he were a real person. No better way to kill a concept than to show us it's already a showbiz in-joke.- The idea of satirizing Fashion, an industry so vapid it needs no satirizing.- Will Ferrel cementing his reputation as bafflingly unfunny hack.Take your pick- there's lots of Fail to go around here. I saw this movie in the theater, days after the 9/11 attacks. I was in such a state of shock I needed SOME kind of relief... I was ready to laugh at ANYTHING even remotely funny. The crap that is Zoolander only further depressed me. Don't waste your sight.GRADE: D-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Ben Stiller, which is a difficult occupation because he has a tendency to disappoint. Not so in this satire-comedy on the fashion industry which gives him and his friends a chance to dress up and muck about safe in the knowledge that almost anything they seem to do on the screen it won't be half as preposterous as what occurs on real catwalks.Central to the self-perpetuating industrial gags is Stiller's 'look', 'Blue Steel', a sort of calling-card pout, which also serves (alongside stylised editing) as a sort of wink at the audience, 'OK, I'm actually being a model now'. Stiller has to deal with real life (temporary retirement after the hilarious demise of a colleague, lampooning the world of Herb Ritts photography in a mineshaft) and then competition on resumption of his modelling with the equally game Owen Wilson. David Bowie has a cameo which is reason enough to go alone. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zoolander is one of the greatest film i have seen in a long time. It has a cunning mix of both humour and satirical stupidity that merges into a well developed film that appeals to a wide ranged audience. Characters are brilliantly played by both Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson who go on personal journeys from being the worst of rivals to becoming the best of friends. Ben Stiller also hads to the film with his brilliant directing and writing skills to add his twist to humour that extends the films appeal. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys to relax with both friends and family alike and have a good laugh whilst enjoying the wide variety of cameo appearances including Paris Hilton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has one big problem: the main actor(s). Whereas the idea of making fun of the fashion industry isn't bad, and some parts are quite nice, the film suffers from too many actors who only *think* they are funny. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have worked together on a number of films that I can only remember because they irritated me enough to be noteworthy.Now, some people may think it really is funny to see Ben Stiller act like a fool. Personally, I started focusing my attention on any of the other actors (who were simply doing their job) whenever Ben Stiller got screen time (which is about 99% of the movie). I did this unintentionally for a while, until I noticed that I was hoping Zoolander would somehow disappear. That's when I used the remote.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie had great potential as a spoof of the modeling industry, but the makers threw much of that away by turning it into a rather absurd, and fairly predictable conspiracy movie.It still ended up being somewhat entertaining and many of the characters were great, particularly the two main models. The whole discussion between Zoolander and his friends about how meaningful it is to be a model is alone wonderful and hilarious.However, the decision to focus the plot on foiling an evil conspiracy, while providing some entertaining elements itself, overall adding nothing and instead distracted from the promising model-spoof theme. Almost all the humor in this film came from the portrayal of the modeling industry and they could have done so much more that was fresh and funny with that had they stuck with it. The conspiracy theme, on the other hand, took the film onto well-worn path that proved to be bland, tired, and predictable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller not only stars but directs and writes this send-up of the fashion world, playing a character named Derek Zoolander whom he invented for a running bit on VH1's annual fashion show. Though there's intermittent laughs, the padding really shows in a story annoyingly full of itself.That goes double for Stiller, who thinks that playing his character as vain and narcissistic will keep us from noticing how vain and narcissistic Stiller himself can be. First, the whole movie exists to serve his image, which has him done up in all sorts of costumes and hair styles that show off his fine cheekbones and lean torso. Then he casts his family in key roles. His wife, the attractive if lightweight Christine Taylor, is the female lead and Derek's romantic interest. His father Jerry has the plum role of Derek's agent. Even his mother, Anne Meara, gets a quick, pointless cameo. Then there's his regular posse of friends who all seem to show up in each other's movies, like Owen Wilson as a rival model named Hansel and Will Ferrell as the villain Mugatu, who wears eyeliner and blonde ringlets which form the shape of a letter M.That's what's funny about this movie, the weird fashion. It serves the comedy well. The problem is that there are long sections where the fashion is the comedy, like Mugatu's odd sweaters and Derek wearing an all-white outfit to a funeral.Male models are dumb. That's the main joke, and while I'm happy to unfairly categorize any group of people I am insanely jealous of, it doesn't sustain 90 minutes of movie time. Nor does a strange espionage subplot where Derek is brainwashed to murder the prime minister of Malaysia. Some people like Roger Ebert attacked the film for trying to mine comedy from such a thing as the cruel reality of child labor, but the film's heart is in the right place. If it only had a brain...Watching this film once was amusing, but seeing it again reveals holes. Take Derek's brief trip back to his New Jersey hometown where his working class father and brothers are ashamed of Derek. This is hurt by the fact Jon Voight as the father has zero comedy presence in his scenes. Then there's a bit where Derek is consoled by Winona Ryder as Winona Ryder, which serves only to ring up another of the many cameos in this film, most ranging in character from obnoxious to repulsively inside. Even Paris Hilton says hello. I guess Stiller had a fun premiere night, and that may have been the point.Only two sequences hold up with repeat viewing, one a short bit where we meet and see off Derek's roommates, and another, shorter sequence where Hansel has a breakdance fight with an evil DJ. Ferrell's funny, too, but the film doesn't give him much of anything to do except bulge his eyes and say lines like "That Hansel's so hot right now" in a dry femmy voice. Because it's Ferrell, you laugh, but it's not a role of his worth remembering.The first time I saw it, I was about to go to a funeral, and I needed some dumb comedy. This fit the bill. Still, it was hard to understand why it was so popular when it came out. Then I checked its initial reviews and realized it was released in late September, 2001. I guess we all needed some dumb comedy then.The world has changed, but not "Zoolander." It's still dumb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Occasions have been rare when I've seen so many actors trying so hard, to act as badly as they could in order to be funny. I mean with Ben Stiller it usually is nothing ordinary when he acts badly, but even he 'outperforms' himself on this one. I mean usually he's pretty bad, but in this one you wonder if his skill to act so badly isn't actually some form of acting skill!!! Granted, there are some cheese parts in here and there are lots of scenes where you think: 'That's just not funny guys.' but it is because everybody who's in this doesn't seem to take any of it seriously, the viewer doesn't either. This in fact helps the film and keeps it from being complete crap and instead turning it into a pretty passable flick.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film had some promise, owing to the original premise of its plot. However, Ben has decided to ditch the idea of having a straight spoof of the fashion industry and fill the movie with 'off the wall' nonsense. Also, unfortunately Ben Stiller has decided to put himself in it which ultimately dooms any hope of greatness. He has also chosen to lace it with a banal script, tedious characters, and droning soulless techno music. I wont bother explaining the wacky plot, as it only - temporarily -distracts us from how badly produced the rest of the movie is. Basically though, Ben Stiller(Derek) is an Adam Sandler type character, but he fails to emulate even above the direness of 'Going Overboard', which is the worst movie I have ever seen next to this. Co-star Owen Wilson(Hansel), a rival model continues his trade mark one-dimension characters in this bout of shoddiness. Also, how could someone(Wilson) with a fractured nose get the position for a male model? Ben Stiller has to go back to Kindergarten and learn how to act, and develop funniness, although I am a little pessimistic about his chances.</fullReview>

Also Stiller and Wilson are hilarious--but seeing them as top male models is a stretch (then again, that might be part of the joke). Also Milla Jovovich is VERY weird--and funny.But Ferrell is annoying and not funny at all; Christine Taylor (Stillers real life wife) is beautiful but bland; Jerry Stiller and Jon Voight act like they're drugged and there just isn't enough material for a full length movie.Still, there are enough funny moments to make this worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a fair amount of giggles--but nothing more than giggles--in Ben Stiller's spoof of modeling and spy movies. Oddly enough, the film seems to have dated immediately and the farce feels distant due to viewer overexposure from the E! Entertainment Channel and VH-1 (which has its imprint all over it). Stiller as a writer and director comes off as snippy and itching to degrade the modeling profession for no apparent reason other than its availability as a target; he wants us to share his hostility but there's nothing compelling as to why we should. As the star, he's almost acceptable as a vain, dumb supermodel (let's not fool ourselves about his looks) but his co-star Owen Wilson has the image down pat and subtly provides most of the humor here, though the real-life cameos (which have become de rigueur for this kind of picture) are also a lot of fun. Stiller continues to mine familiar terrain, but this time, rather than dwelling on the Farrelly Brothers' turf, he invades `Austin Powers' territory and the result is inconsequential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the More Tolerable Ben Stiller Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander is an international model-slash-actor. But his life has taken a tragic turn: he loses an award to new superstar Hansel, his friends die in a horrible gasoline accident and he is ready to quit the business. Things seemingly turn around when he is offered a job as the face of the new Derelicte clothing line, but his handler has more sinister intentions.I'm not particularly a fan of Ben Stiller or his films. He's often annoying and not very funny... and not even particularly handsome. He is a better background figure ("Happy Gilmore") than a lead ("Something About Mary"). So why does this film entertain me? I'll tell you: the celebrity cameos. We have some great co-stars (Christine Taylor is awesome and sexy, and Will Ferrell has one of the best roles of his career here).What sold it for me (besides Farrell) was the Billy Zane cameo. Sure, Lance Bass and Fred Durst were funny. Natalie Portman is hot. And David Bowie does the best David Bowie impression on earth. But Zane sold the film when Owen Wilson said, "You should listen to your friend Billy Zane. He's a cool dude." That was the funniest line in the film (but so true).In all fairness, Stiller is better here than in other films. And there are plenty of memorable scenes -- the gasoline accident scene takes the cake, with perfect music playing (Wham!) and everything looking just right. I also really enjoy the trance sequence -- one of Ferrell's best scenes ever filmed.As far as Ferrell-Stiller-Wilson movies go, this one isn't at the top of the pile, but it's clearly above the halfway mark. Even non-fans will find something they like and I guarantee a few laughs along the way. My second viewing was more enjoyable than my first and I suspect this is a trend that grows with subsequent viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I'm not the biggest of Ben Stiller fans, I've enjoyed some of his movies (The last one that I saw was 'Meet the Fockers', which wasn't bad). And some of my friends, even though we don't exactly have the same kind of humor all the time, recommended it to me... I gave it a try and the only thing I can say about it is that I was very disappointed...'Zoolander' gives us a glimpse of the world of the male supermodels. Derek Zoolander is on his way down after three years of continuously winning the "Male Model of the Year" award. He has been beaten by the hot newcomer Hansel and starts searching for a new meaning in his life, because he wants to give up modeling. But exactly now, the biggest of all fashion tycoons, called Mugatu, wants him in his show... at least that's what they all think. In reality Zoolander will have to kill the new Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit to New York, so that cheap child labor is still available for Mugatu's fashion producing. But a smart and beautiful journalist finds out the truth and will try to stop Zoolander...It's probably me, but in this entire movie there was only one moment that made me laugh out loud. For the rest of the time this movie only annoyed me. There really wasn't much that appealed to me in this movie and I had the feeling that they only wanted to make this movie more interesting by adding some stars or famous people like David Bowie, Lenny Kravitz, Donald Trump, Tommy Hilfiger, Paris Hilton, Heidi Klum and many many more. The acting from Stiller is the same as always, so you exactly know what to expect, but the story of the movie doesn't make too much sense and didn't do it for me. I give this movie only a 2/10. I'm sure many will love it, but I certainly didn't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What to say about a movie like this? Zoolander definitely did not live up to the hype of being fall down in your seat funny but it wasn't awful either. I must admit there actually were a few laugh out loud funny lines. But by and large this movie is disjointed and somewhat obnoxious at times. This isn't really the type of comedy that I enjoy and it seems like Stiller is ALWAYS playing these types of roles(granted he plays them well but still....)The main positive was the movie's spoofs of the fashion industry and the people involved in it. I have actually known a few people with personalities like this. Even though the movie by and large wasn't an extremely cohesive effort it was funny to see the fashion industry being spoofed- and some of the jokes WERE funny, in fact there are moments where just as your getting ready to turn it off because your thinking how lame it is, something happens to make you laugh and keep it on.I'd recommend this movie only as a late night or if there isn't anything else on or if you want a really off the wall comedy with uneven but occasionally wacky humor. This is the type of movie that you almost feel guilty for defending because all the negatives mentioned are there but it's not all bad for the reasons listed above. I'd rate it somewhere between a 5.5 and 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny but lacking...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend of mine called this the funniest movie that he has ever seen. I remained doubtful and after seeing it I concluded that my friend either hasn't seen many movies or has a rather odd taste.It was quite funny in bits but I found myself sitting for long periods of time with my arms crossed not laughing. I found some of the characters annoying - especially Mugatu and Katinka. Katinka more than anything.Ben Stiller however was at his best with Zoolander, he's highly talented at comedic acting, writing and directing. I look forward to whatever he can come up with next.Overall, the film lacked a general cohesiveness and while having some incredibly funny one-liners and being a good spoof of the fashion industry just didn't hit the right chord with me. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bin Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, the world's premier male model and Owen Wilson plays Hansel, the up and coming star threatening Zoolanders status. However, when Zoolander is brainwashed into killing the Malaysian Prime Minster, Hansel and a reporter team up to help Zoolander and save the Prime Minister.There were a couple of very stupid moments that were quite funny, but overall most of the jokes were just stupid. Some of the fashion clothing and background jokes were quite cleaver but the blatant stupidity was too annoying to make the movie worth watching again. (Maybe I just wasn't in the mood?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can anyone think that "Zoolander" is a good movie. If anyone thinks "Zoolander" is a good movie; they would be wrong. "Zoolander" is the type of movie where everyone shakes their head in disbelief wondering why the movie was made. Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Christine Taylor star as the leads along with many talented actor making cameos in a film that makes no sense.The director of "Zoolander" failed to make a connection between the audience to watch and the reason he made the movie. Furthermore, the writers did a dismal job at convincing everyone that their was a reason to watch as they utilized stupid jokes, bad physical comedy and awful writing in the script. It is unfortunate that "Zoolander" turned out to the way it did because Stiller and Wilson are both excellent talents. The chemistry between both actors are excellent but it was not enough to sway my opinion of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's that smell?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some moveez emit a foul odor and leave a strange residue behind.Zoolander for instance.Granted, like smelling your own vapours, it's not without it's earthy delights. De Sade and other great philosophers were wise enough to never become too detached to enjoy the groveling and filthy part of life, for it is not without it's humbling charms.It would be a great day for this country if our duly elected officials admit they occasionally like to be tied up and humiliated by dominatrix. East out of the bowl, little doggy. Arf!I was reminded of a movie from the 70's - Faye Dunaway was in it? and it had an awfully slow pace. It was (to the best of my recollection) about the vacuous life of a model... and like many movies that portray characters in some sort of banal state, end up becoming banal itself... in that most awful sort of indulgent way (e.g. Lost in Translation). Poor baby, you're pretty, that's all that matters. kissZoolander, and this unnamed Dunaway pic, were nothing alike, aside from the subject matter. Dunaway's was a dramatic treatment of a woman losing her grip on reality... Zoolander, well, lost it's grip on reality too, but not as the makers must have intended, I suppose. It's very threadbare idea unwound before your very eyes like a tennis ball, and the core with all of the bouncy bouncy energy fell to the floor and splat: was revealed as putty. Not the silly kind.Where Zoolander went wrong was told the same gag told time after bleeding time... the preening, the preening, the preening. Could it have been so difficult to come up with, oh let's make it easy, two more gags? Then you could, like a punk band fueled with naught but testosterone and a modicum of talent, varied them enough to mine some gold in that great honking nose?Zoolander's pathos was worn on it's sleeve; there was nothing subtle about it. The makers had some passing affection for their mentally challenged characters, but instead of the Dunaway movie, which went for the melodrama of the pretty woman coming unglued (with all the accompanying self-importance of that generation of film-making), they went for the yucks. Hey, I can't deny there were one or two chuckles. I want to let these guys clown around. We must encourage the Stillers and (the other guy)s of the world to have them make more laughs for us, the adoring audience.But alas, it's wasted effort, and even this more than forgiving observer would have to recommend you give it a pass... ...unless your under 18 and have all the time in the world.1. I just looked it up cos the memory was starting to itch, and it's entitled Puzzle of a Downfall Child (imdb # tt0066262). Don't bother, unless... (see the last sentence).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At times very funny, at times too silly or a bit stretched ? but generally it is an enjoyably off-the-wall film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander is the top male model, a position he has held for many years but things look tight with the rising talents of Hansel McDonald. Faced with competition the likes of which he has never faced before, Derek becomes open to suggestion and willing to take actions beyond his normal realms. With the cracks showing in Zoolander's career, top designer Mugatu decides that the time is right to use Zoolander in a cunning plot to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia in order to stop the introduction of child labour laws.At the time of release I didn't bother with this film because I had suffered at the hands of SNL spin offs before and wasn't sure about this. However since then I have enjoyed many of the other films from the same group involved in this and decided (with the help of a girlfriend) that it was time to step back and give this one a try. With no previous knowledge of the character I was able to come to the film as a spoof set around the (admittedly easy) target of male modeling. With this one joke being the basis for the film it was important that they get at least a vague plot to prevent it being just a stretched sketch but also that they keep the laughs coming to cover any holes left by the former. In both regards the film pretty much succeeds, only occasionally appearing stretched or too silly to be really that funny. The plot is daft of course but it sets up enough structure to just about hold the silliness together. If the character is a simple spoof of a male model then the plot attacks wider issues such as the pompous nature of the people involved and the use of child labour (funny but also a valid point). It may be a bit silly but it works within the frame of this type of humour.Fans of the recent Dodgeball and Anchorman will enjoy this although those that disliked those will likely hate this because it is the same breed of silly humour that those have. I found it funny and it had enough going on to keep me amused as well as taking me by surprise several times and making me laugh out loud. The cast is a big part of this, although the overuse of cameos is a bit of a weakness because 'unusual' celebrities have a bigger impact if used sparingly and appearing from nowhere (eg Hasselhoff and Norris in Dodgeball). Stiller is good in his one-joke role and does enough to keep it interesting and funny. Wilson plays the usual character he plays but does it well ? he is a big part of padding out the plot and making another thread. Taylor has her usual straight role but gets some of the humour too. Ferrell is his usual wonderful self in a minor role but one has to wonder why regular Vaughn bothered. Jovovich is a smart bit of casting and is pretty good while Jerry Stiller will draw big laughs from all Seinfeld fans! The cameos are mixed ? Duchovny is hilarious, Voight is good, Bowie was a surprise and Zane sends himself up well. The rest of the cameos merely fill up the film and while most are interesting additions I really could have done without yet more self-promotion from the likes of Paris Hilton and Lil' Kim.Overall this is a silly but funny comedy that will appeal to those who have been won over by the silly laughs in other films from the same group. At times this is a bit too silly to be really funny but mostly it gets the pitch right and is funny and silly with good turns from the main cast members. The one-joke character may seem a bit stretched at times but generally it works well enough as a film ? just not a great one!</fullReview>

Having recently decided that Jeepers Creepers and The Animal were two of the worst films I've ever seen I was completely unprepared for what I was about to see. This is now only second to Showgirls for The Worst Movie Ever Made.How is it possible for the man who was hilarious in a five minute appearance in Friends and equally brilliant in There's Something About Mary, Mystery Men and Meet The Parents take a giant step backwards create such a disastrously bad film? It failed to even raise a faint smile on my face for the entire 90 minutes.What I can't believe are the ones who have given it good ratings. Are they mad? They're probably the same people who think Showgirls is a brilliant American satire. I was surrounding by people laughing out loud and (this is no lie) applauding some of the jokes. I'm disappointed that it's not possible to give a lower rating than 1.Easily the worst film I've seen in a cinema (I saw Showgirls on TV). Even though I didn't pay to see it, I still demanded my money back at the end. Don't watch it. Ever.

		<shortDescription>Funny comedy that perfectly mocks the fashion industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a slow-witted fashion model who is known for his 'Blue Steel' look, and has dominated the industry for years. When the new kid on the block, Hansel (Owen Wilson), starts taking the attention away from Zoolander, and journalist Matilda (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor) writes a mocking piece on him, Zoolander considers retirement. He travels back home to work in the coal pits with his father (Jon Voight) and brothers (Vince Vaughn and Judah Friedlander) but they reject him due to his fashion antics and general uselessness in the pits. Meanwhile, fashion giant Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) is coming up with a plan to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia, and feels that Zoolander is just stupid enough to be the hit- man.I've never really been a fan of the work of Stiller and his usual troupe. While his films are generally entertaining, I just don't find them that funny. Zoolander, though not exactly a classic, is possibly his best, being frequently funny, silly, and most important of all, fun. For all it's prat-falls and ridiculous costumes, it is actually a pretty damn accurate send-up of the fashion industry. Many a time I've been forced to sit through the likes of America's Next Top Model and whatever new s**t Gok Wan has come up with (I detest that man with every fabric of my being), and it is really this ridiculous.The cleverist moment of the film is when Mugatu announces his new fashion show, called Derelicte, spinning fashion out of the bums and hobo's that roam the streets. It's just the type of pretentious and shallow thing that happens in fashion all the time, taking its influences from the unfortunate and putting it's own naive and clueless fingers all over it. Anyway, that's enough about my hatred for the fashion industry, now for the actual film.Zoolander has the thing that seems to missing from Stiller's usual films, which is sweetness. As gay as that sounds, it helps elevate the likes of Judd Apatow's films above others, and helps you actually care about the film rather than it being played just for laughs. Tropic Thunder and Dogeball: A True Underdog Story certainly tried, and ultimately failed. Although Zoolander is a shallow idiot, he is certainly lovable. And as Hansel, the always-watchable Owen Wilson is just a dim-witted. When the two settle their rivalry and team up, there is plenty of chemistry. Watching them both giggle like children when talking about bulimia is a scene where if handled badly, could have been uncomfortable, but the scene is possibly the funniest in the film.Yes, it follows the same path as many other a comedy, and some of the jokes fail to hit the mark. But it's fun, entertaining, and features a handful of solid comedy performances. And, as ever, Will Ferrell steals the show as a manically over-the-top designer.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

I am definitely not a Ben Stiller fan, but thought he was not bad in this role.

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller's Zoolander is so stupid that it's funny. It's one of those movies. If you walked into the theater expecting something different, than you probably hated it. I'm not saying I love Zoolander, but I think it's pretty funny. I don't know what inspired Ben Stiller to direct this stupid film. I do truly like Zoolander, despite how stupid it is. There are many funny scenes in Zoolander and it has a great cast, I think you should see Zoolander. But if you're expecting something different, then beware. Because Zoolander is dumb at times, but I think it's a pretty funny film.The Plot: Derek Zoolander is a male model. He is convinced by Mugatu to assassinate the president of Mulasia through Brainwash.Though the plot is silly, I like Zoolander for what it is. The film has many cameos by Billy Zane, David Bowie, David Duchovney, and others. Just to name a few. Zoolander is also a weird film, but most of Ben Stiller's films are. Just look at The Cable Guy, it's about a cable guy who becomes obsessed with somebody and once this guy tells him to go away, he tries to make his life hell. The Cable Guy was an odd film also, but I really like that one. As weird as it was in the last ten minutes. The cast to Zoolander includes: Owen Wilson(Wedding Crashers, You, me, and Dupree) Chistine Taylor(The Brady Bunch films, Dodgeball) Jerry Stiller(Seinfeld) Jon Voigt(Tomb Raider, National Treasure) Despite Zoolander's stupidity at times, I like Zoolander. I think you should see it. But beware, some people may find it pretty retarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Take This Film Seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is known for making mediocre comedies that try to attain big Box-Office numbers this is the best one out of all of them. In this film vehicle Stiller adds another mentally deluded character to his resume of already mentally deluded characters namely seen in Heavyweights and Dodgeball. Lucky for Ben Stiller he's able to have his own screen vehicles which is rare in Hollywood he was also able to choose the cast he wanted. This is all because at a young age his parents helped him gain ties to big name producers in Hollywood and New York and since has been able to direct his own screen vehicles and get his way in casting. This film itself is solely based on two television specials lampooning the fashion industry shown at the 1996 and 1997 MTV Fashion Awards. Its about a shallow vain below average model. The film starts of with the once king of all models falling into obscurity and becoming the laughing stock of the whole fashion industry overthrown by the Acid Tripping free-spirited Hansel. Zoolander completely alienated by the fact that after so long he's no longer the industries top model and because of this rude awakening he goes to find himself which is hard to do considering that hes a shallow narcissist. He first does this by trying to bond with his remaining family who disown him. Being both emotionally and mentally confused easily falls into a Brain Washing conspiracy to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia who has gotten rid of sweatshops to get rid of child labor which would eventually bankrupt the fashion outlets. This is schemed by Mugatu who tricks Zoolander into believing that he's reviving his career assisted by his also vain assistant Katinka.One could dub this film National Lampoon Goes To The Fashion Show but that title is not genuinely as could as Zoolander the last name attributing to Stiller's vainness and soft spoken approach of moral understanding. This film is never to be token seriously and since being a flop in theaters has become a cult film. However I'm not to attracted to cult films.</fullReview>

Derek's not bright at all and it should come as no surprise. Will Ferrell has a supporting role as the man who is set to kill the prime minister of Malaysia using a brainwashed Zoolander. Anyway, it's reminiscent of the Manchurian Candidate. Christine Taylor from the Brady Bunch films and Wedding Singer, plays a reporter. She really is quite identical to Maureen McCormick and could be her daughter. Ben's dad, Jerry Stiller, is also in the film as manager Holstein and his mother, Anne Meara, has a cameo. It's quite hilarious at times and downright silly. Jon Voigt plays Derek's hard-working blue collar father who is ashamed of his son's chosen career.</fullReview>

Most of the jokes revolve around his stupidity. Wearing white to a funeral, murdering the word eulogy, and cleaning coal dust off his face with little moist towelettes. What works in small doses in MTV sketches, doesn't even come close at feature length. Zoolander is reminiscent of bad SNL movies. The few bright spots are Will Ferrel in his silly outfits, David Duchovny's scummy hand model, and Milla Jovovich's equally obscurely monikered henchwoman. Ben Stiller has a tendency to be lazy and to repeat himself. Sadly, Zoolander is a prime example of both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst movies ever. The acting is actually worse than the substandard writing. Christine Taylor, who rolls her eyes and sneers throughout, amazingly has the power to ruin every single scene she's in. Will Ferrel's disturbingly homely face and corseted physique come in a close second. The real problem is that Stiller is about as far from model prettiness as you can get. There's only so much the willing suspension of disbelief can go: He's not a good-looking man, and his one exaggerated facial expression (pouting lips, wrinkled brow) has worn out any comic value is had five minutes into the movie. The rest of the film limps along to its ridiculous conclusion, in which Zoolander's "new look" saves the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Owen Wilson and Milla Jovovich are the movie's only saving graces. A slow-motion orgy late in the film seems misplaced and a valid embarrassment for everyone except Stiller and Tyler.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The typically reliable Stiller (star of many hilarious films such as "Meet the Parents" and "There's Something About Mary") stumbles with this trip down the fashion runway, providing a zany, outr comedy that's only funny in fits and starts. He plays the title character, a male super-model (initially presented by Stiller in a few sketches during the VH1 Fashion Awards) whose self-involvement, immense shallowness and inherent idiocy become even more apparent than usual when he loses the top award in his field to rival Wilson. While he bickers with and tries to one-up Wilson, he is concurrently being targeted for use in an assassination plot masterminded by outlandish (and outlandishly affected) fashion guru Ferrell. Ferrell wants to brainwash Stiller into killing the Prime Minister of Malaysia due to his enforcement of child labor laws in his country. Also on hand is Stiller's real-life wife Taylor as a Time magazine reporter, sent to produce a feature article on the male mannequin. What was amusing enough in spurts during the Fashion Awards has great difficulty entertaining once stretched to (an albeit brief) feature length. Stiller adopts an even ore bizarre and off-putting way of speaking than he did in the original skits and it wears thin quickly. The admittedly eye-popping costumes and production design can only go so far in putting over a very lame and very routine story. Stiller is a whirlwind of creativity and had his hand in practically every aspect of this film but it just isn't very funny. Wilson (a very unlikely print model indeed!) tries hard as well to inject some flavor into the proceedings, but is mostly undone by the subject matter. Taylor is attractive, but displays a startling lack of screen charisma and does not boil over with chemistry in her scenes with Stiller either. Jovovich chews the scenery relentlessly and Ferrell is way, WAY out there. There are many star cameos, a lot of them pointless, but a few supporting performers stand out. Duchovney is amusing as an ex-hand model who's fallen on hard times and Voight is quite solid as Stiller's estranged father. There are a few set pieces that are very funny, including one that takes off on all those quasi-erotic car wash/garden hose fantasies and an interesting night of debauchery at Wilson's pad, but the bulk of the gags either fall flat or are labored. Everything looks like it's in place for this to be a laugh riot, but unfortunately it tends to be a trial and a test of the viewer's patience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I like comedy, I dislike the immature, stupid sex+bodily function jokes strung into a film written for 12 year old boys(Dumb/Dumber; Dude, Where....; American Pie; TomCats, etc.) So I resisted this film for a long time.However, it definitely had enough funny moments to make it worth viewing (at least once, for free). Not usually a fan of Owew Wilson or Will Ferrall, but I enjoyed their characters. Ferrall's Mugatu was the best character of the film.There were a few nice zings at our image obsessed culture, the ridiculous nature of "fashion" and at the clothing industry's use of child labor/sweatshops.My biggest disappointment was the dismissal of the reporters feelings. Her disgust with male models can all be explained away by the fact that she used to be fat? And the gang-bang was in seriously poor taste. (you can tell this film was written by guys).I thought the cameos were pointless, though having David Bowie judge a "walk off" fit nicely and David Duchovny's bit was funny.So if you're in the mood for something brainless, this isn't bad. I thought it was worth watching just for the parts about how to retrieve information from of a computer. ("The files are IN the computer") and for the new fashion trend "Derelicte".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked 'Zoolander.' Knowing what the industry is like, I enjoyed the different perspectives that Stiller enjoyed tearing into. It is pretty accurate and dead-on, but it never goes too far. Unfortunately, from an outside perspective, the movie is too stupid for its own good. You will feel your IQ dropping and you will not like it. Stiller played more for honesty and accuracy about modeling and believe me, that's too much of a stretch.Derek Zoolander is finished in the male model world. When he gets a new contract from an evil agent, he's unknowingly brainwashed into finding and assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia.The movie sucks really. Between the orgy scenes, the movie references of some classics, walk-offs(!), none of it makes sense. It's all a joke. If you can deposit your mind in a safe deposit box for a couple years, forget all the vestiges of your sanity and you finally watch this, there probably still will be enough spark there to ask yourself, "What the heck am I watching?" Despite my personal liking, Zoolander is still very much garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dumb, but stupid fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), an intellectually challenged but bone structure blessed male model who's despondent after being eclipsed in popularity by an equally vacuous rival, Hansel (Owen Wilson). Upon his reluctant retirement, Derek is invited to a day spa by previously standoffish fashion designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell), where the befuddled model is brainwashed by the mysterious Katinka (Milla Jovovich) into assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia. In addition to Stiller's real life (and very hot) wife Christine Taylor, Zoolander also co stars his dad Jerry Stiller, with Jon Voight, David Duchovny, Andy Dick, and Fabio among others. I found Zoolander dumb yet hilarious, the dumb jokes actually made me laugh. I admit one of the main reasons I watched this movie is because of Ben's wife Christine Taylor and she is one of my favorites and is looking very good in this goofy film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies you either get the sensibility of or you just don't. I was laughing out loud so that will tell you where I am. Zoolander is an elaborate skit peppered with music videos and it's hysterical. I love the against type casting of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as supermodels and all the cameos are fun. The premise is very funny, as is the total send-up of the modeling business. This is the kind of frothy, mind candy entertainment that we all need once in a while. Take it on that level and you won't be disappointed. The first part of the movie is the funniest; it falls apart later on and then just becomes stupid. Recommended if you're feeling silly and the thought of Ben Stiller as a model makes you laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blot on Stiller's comedy record!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly can't remember the last time I have been so disappointed by a comedy! I have spent countless hours defending Ben Stiller's last directorial effort, the misunderstood 'The Cable Guy'. I think it is one of the most inventive and original comedies of the 1990s. Hopefully as more people see the woeful 'Zoolander', 'The Cable Guy's reputation will soar. Because comparing the two movies makes it bloody OBVIOUS which one is the real turkey!Look, Stiller is a funny guy, but any comedian is only as good as his material, and 'Zoolander's lame jokes just aren't enough to sustain a whole movie. The initial premise (a brainless super-model is turned into a political assassin) is silly, but that wouldn't matter a jot if it was fleshed out with strong comic situations and witty one-liners. Sadly it just isn't. All we get are running gags about Derek's "range" of expressions, and his sheer stupidity which are repeated ad nauseam until the humour is lost and it simply becomes irritating.Owen Wilson almost steals the movie as rival model Hansel. Wilson has been an actor to watch ever since Wes Anderson's debut 'Bottle Rocket'. He has appeared in several movies where he out-classes the material. Once again it happens here. The rest of the supporting cast range from passable to poor. The latter especially regarding Will Ferrell, as arch-villain Mugatu, who is excruciatingly unfunny. He manages to drag down every scene he appears in. Milla Jovovich tries hard with a boring femme fatale role. Christine Taylor is lovely to look at, but is saddled with an under-written character, like most of the actors in this movie. Jerry Stiller who is usually fabulous in anything he does, has one or two funny bits of schtick, but once again you have to blame the mediocre script. And much has been made of the countless guest appearances, but very few are noteworthy. Billy Zane's cameo is one of the few that are worthwhile, and one of the rare genuinely inspired moments in this sorry mess. The most frustrating thing is that going by 'The Cable Guy', or Stiller's first rate comic appearances in movies like 'There's Something About Mary, 'Flirting With Disaster' or 'Mystery Men', or even watching old episodes of 'The Mr Show', (who's David Cross and Bob Odenkirk started as writers for Stiller), you realize that 'Zoolander' could have easily rivaled Mike Myers' Austin Powers for belly laughs. Something went badly wrong along the way. What a crying shame!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just when I think a movie can't get any worse, along comes Zoolander. This is absolutely one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. It isn't funny, it isn't clever, the script is awful, the direction awkward, the mixture of morality and lessons and feeble humor unbelievably lame and poorly done. It is awful from top to bottom and side to side.The only thing that I was looking forward to was maybe, maybe, Ben Stiller would take his shirt off or something, but we didn't even get that! In all seriousness, Ben Stiller is a good actor, and he had a concept which could conceivably have been hilarious, but it takes more than one single good actor to make a movie. There are many many funny movies, that I have laughed it, (most from the far past), so I am not without a sense of humor, you see. It is absolutely beyond my comprehension how so many critics can think this is a good movie. But then, for all I know this is better than much of what's out there these days.</fullReview>

Zoolander wasn't much better than it looked like the trailers.. An interesting plot, and mostly no product placements, unlike the ridiculous Josie and the Pussy cats. Zoolander was funny sometimes, but Ben's "look" got old pretty quick. The moral of the movie, which there is in every movie, was deep, yet had it been delivered in a different way, it would have been more convincing and, the lazy humor wouldn't have been so painful and disappointing, or wouldn't have SEEMED that way, had the producers ELABORATED upon that moral a little more. Then, I would have been more impressed. Please, spare me the bluish-gray lipstick thing and use that silent, jokes-fallen-flat-second a little wiser.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But still, I have a good feeling about Ben Stiller's Zoolander, even though I can't reccomend it as much as other Stiller comedies (Meet the Parents, Something About Mary, The Cable Guy which he directed). It has Stiller as a near brain dead male model named, you guessed it, Derek Zoolander. As he is trying to find his roots and try to find another outlet other than the male modeling world, he is unknowingly (of course) put into a plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia.There are some really funny scenes contained in the movie (the best is seeing a spoof of 2001 as Stiller and Wilson band away at a computer trying to trun it on) and while they don't add up to make a total funny comedy, it is stupid fun. Just make sure to go in the theater with a clear head (and don't follow Ebert's review). Many stars make various cameos including David Bowie, Jon Voight, Billy Zane and others, yet it is Jerry Stiller, Ben's father, who steals some scenes as a manager. B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moderately entertaining but ultimately too stupid and repetitive!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I try to think of just one line to start this review, the phrase: "Not Stiller's best" keeps turning up because this film is definitely not the best we've seen from him. Apparently the character of Zoolander was one that Stiller has given quite a lot of thought and has spent some time developing. I can't see how you could possibly spend time on a character as flat as Zoolander, however, because the character is only funny for about half an hour and then he just becomes annoying.Much of the comedy in the film is based on how stupid the male models are and while it is funny watching Stiller pose and making an ass of himself it grows thin quite quickly (I did find his three identical facial poses extremely funny). Stiller fills out the character and you can see that the character is important to him but the character was in my opinion probably better off as a sketch-character and not a character that would warrant an entire movie because he simply isn't interesting enough. Owen Wilson does a mediocre job at best and his character comes alive only in the scenes with Stiller because of their chemistry. Christine Taylor is in my opinion probably a below average actress and her performance in this film in particular is pretty stiff to say the least. She has no real presence. Milla Jovovich has a quite funny role in the film but unfortunately she is critically underused. Will Ferrel and Jerry Stiller are both decent and both of them never really become memorable. Jerry Stiller does his best but his character is just too limited.The trailer looked relatively funny but the actual film lacked spirit resulting in a very uneven comedy. There are a few funny scenes and only about one scene where I laughed hard and that was just not enough as I had expected more from it. The film also has another problem. Its too repetitive. Many of the jokes are recycled throughout the movie which would have been acceptable had the jokes been funny the first time but the problem as you have probably guessed is that they weren't.Zoolander is definitely a comedy you have to be in the right mood for because if you're expecting something witty and well scripted this probably isn't were you would want to place your money. You have to be in the mood for something that is stupid and at times lame but if you can settle with that you should give it a try. I, myself, did not enjoy the film particularly but I was probably also in the wrong mood for it and as always watching a film is a highly subjective matter.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zoolander" is a stupid, silly, ridiculous farce that has to be accepted for what it is. It's a harmless comedy with no hilarious moments, but it's funny to a degree. The problem is most of the time I found myself laughing AT the film, rather than with it. There's very little wit, and you simply have to laugh at Derek Zoolander's sheer stupidity. The plot is meandering, and seems to purposely set itself up for a million cameos. Don't get me wrong, the cameos are amusing, but it seems like Stiller was taking cheap shots by inserting big-time celebrities into every scene. And I'm not exaggerating when I say this film is jam-packed with cameos. Hell, if you made "It's a Mad Mad Mad World" into a 90-minute feature, you very well might get "Zoolander." Just to name a few, there's cameos by Cuba Gooding Jr., Christian Slater, Winona Ryder, Billy Zane, Vince Vaughn (in a disappointing, non-speaking role), Andy Dick, David Duchovny and Stiller's own parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. I'm surprised Stiller couldn't find screen time for his long-time buddy Janeane Garofolo. Stiller puts his best foot forward in his lively comic peformance, and seems to be having a lot of fun, but Zoolander is a bit of a one-joke caricature and he tries his best to salvage laughs despite that. Owen Wilson delivers a delightful comic performance as his arch rival, Hansel. The walk-off montage between the two of them, set to Michael Jackson's "Beat It" is my favorite moment--a very funny scene which is very well choreographed. Of course, Stiller has to give his wife Christine Taylor a significant role. All I gotta say is Ben--you're a lucky man! Christine is a very beautiful woman, and a charming actress to boot. Will Ferrell is one of today's best comic actors--capable of making almost scene work with his magical schtick. I just wish he could've had more screen time as the villain Mugato. He's one of those comic actors who can make an audience laugh with a simple facial expression. The soundtrack is great, including such great 80s hits as "Working for the Weekends" and "Wake Me Up Before You Go Go." "Zoolander" is not a great movie, nor a hysterically funny one, but it's worth renting and does have its moments. My score: 6 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so I watched this on television because i was bored. Zoolander is one of the most wackest Ben Stiller comedies I have ever seen! In this movie Ben Stiller plays a male model named Derek Zoolander who has a big competition with another male model named Hansel (Owen Wilson). After Derek Zoolander lost the male model award at the VH1 Awards and then his three best friends die in a gas fight accident he decides to retire. The acting is annoying and Ben Stiller's voice is real annoying and unfunny.But after when Derek retires his boss Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) offers him to join Jacobin Mugatu (Will Ferrell) agency. So when Derek joins Mugatu's campaign he gets brainwashed after being in a day spa and getting brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia! By brainwashing Zoolander, Mugatu and his evil associate Katinka (Milla Jovovich) create a dumb and willing killer to do the job. Only in Time Magazine journalist Matilda (Christine Taylor) suspicion arises slowly, and she tries to stop Derek.Later in the movie Derek and Hansel start having a friendship between each other. There were many weird parts but one that I liked was when they were showing Derek at the day spa and he was listening to relax and they were showing this crazy video at the same time! I thought this movie was unfunny and could have been much better done. I don't see why this movie got a lot of praise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dethrones 'Dumb and Dumber' as the most pointless comedy ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong, I love D&amp;D, but Zoolander just about surpasses this film in sheer pointlessness and brainless jokes. It has beyond wacky performances, escalating stupidity and it features some truly cringe-worthy moments. It is just completely and utterly insane, brainless to the core.Zoolander is based off some VH-1 spoof about male models and it takes this idea much further by bringing these stereotypically dumb characters to life in the form of Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson), competing against each other on the runway but having to team up eventually in order to stop the evil plans of the prime minister of Malaysia (Will Ferrell). I don't think I could give out spoilers if I wanted to, because the plot of the film is thinner than an Olsen twin. It all fits in the zany world of Zoolander.So this film would pretty much be the prototype of bad cinema, but sometimes comes a joke in Zoolander that is just so hysterical that it totally takes you by surprise. This is stuff like a bunch of male models hanging out and PLAYING WITH GASOLINE and one of them lighting a cigarette and KA-BOOM!. Or the "walk-off" on the runway between Zoolander and Hansel. Or best of all, the multitude of random cameos by famous actors like Billy Zane, David Duchovny, Donald Trump (ok, so not an actor, but still!), Paris Hilton, Natalie Portman and Christian Slater.Still, you have got to credit a film that has nothing to say, no statements to make, no messages to convey -- it doesn't pretend to be something it's not -- it's just a gloriously entertaining and colourful comedy. Remember, a 'Bad' movie can still be fun to watch.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever wondered what it was like to be a male model? Well, watching Zoolander probably isn't going to give you any accurate representation of what being a male model is really like but it's definitely a hilarious spoof on modeling and fashion industry. Zoolander relies heavily on the stereotypes of self-absorbed male models depicting them as airheads with their senses often limited to strictly fashion. I recommend you completely disregard Stiller's previous comedies Something About Mary, Meet the Parents, and Along Came Polly when approaching this film as it strays from his usual `boyfriend with bad luck who gets into hilariously embarrassing situations' style comedy. His role this film shows character diversity in Stiller not seen in his past films and it works.The sheer stupidity of the main characters Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and rival male model Hansel (Owen Wilson) are the primary sources of the genuine laughs found in Zoolander. Set in modern day New York City, the plot revolves around a sinister fashion designer named Mugatu (Will Ferrell) and his plot to brainwash male model Derek Zoolander to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. The Prime Minister harms Mugatu's clothing factories (run by children) by imposing child labor laws, angering Mugatu and other fashion designers. Although the plot is far-fetched it never tries to be taken any more seriously than a comic book. Once you see the remarks and reactions of the two main characters it's impossible to take seriously and often funny. One example of the hilarious stupidity in this movie: Early on in the movie there is a `Male Model of the Year' awards ceremony Zoolander, being accustomed to winning the award several years in a row runs to the stage despite the fact Hansel's name had been announced to accept the award. Zoolander proceeds to give his cocky award speech when he the host taps his shoulder and points to Hansel standing behind him. Zoolander is struck with disbelief and it makes for a truly funny scene. There isn't much romance in this film but there is a little between a reporter named Matilda (Christina Applegate) and Zoolander but it's never really explored in the film and most of its referred to with humor. Picture Zoolander as a feature-length Saturday Night Live skit and you should know what kind of humor to expect.As I said before to enjoy this movie you can't take it seriously because you will take it as it was not intended. This was a movie that caught me by surprise, I didn't think I'd like it and thought of myself as being `dragged' to see it but was very happy with after watching. I never thought I'd be interested in seeing something about a male model (because I have no interest on the subject) but modeling is just what it makes fun of. Zoolander definitely achieves what it sets out to do and doesn't try to take itself seriously at all. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are compliment each others roles very well and are extremely funny together.Bottom Line- 7.5 out of 10: Better than `fair' but not great, lots of laughs to be had but it relies on the same `stupid' humor the entire movie. Even though the humor can be repetitive at times, it still managed to be funny for the most part throughout the movie. I consider it a solid comedy worth renting for those seeking laughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspired silliness and some good jokes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The celebrated Roger Ebert, in his review of Zoolander ? written in 2001, just after 9/11 ? got rather sniffy about the assassination of 'the Prime Minister of Malaysia' being at the centre of the film's plot. He's right, of course, that it is in bad taste (and he also takes the producers to task for not even listing the name of the Asian actor who played the Prime Minister), I suggest he is being oversensitive. He makes the point that the producers might easily have simply invented an Asian country (the film involves a conspiracy by the world's leading fashion designers to sabotage a bid to outlaw child labour which the fashion industry relies to make fabulous profits), but in the grand scheme of things I really don't feel Zoolander disgraces itself by its lapse into poor taste. Jonathan Swift was guilty of even worse bad taste in his Modest Proposal in which he suggested famine in Ireland could be solved if the Irish ate their children, so Ben Stiller et al find themselves in luminous company. Not that Zoolander is great satire, but it takes a great many potshots at the fashion industry and scores a great many direct hits. Zoolander has some inspired silliness and straddles the divide between dumb comedy movies and outright satire rather well. It has nothing to be ashamed about and a lot of which to be proud. You could do a lot worse than Zoolander (and probably have done so, several times). Just sit back and enjoy some very silly jokes. NB I can think of no reason at all why Stiller called the main character 'Zoolander'. It seems to be in some way significant, but how I really don't know. Perhaps it is an in-joke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Ben Stiller but seriously he should stop directing movies. The directing is really the weakest element of the movie and almost kills the fun entirely. Stiller also seems to be seriously obsessed with getting as many pointless close-ups of his wife Christine Taylor as possible. I mean she sure is pretty and all but it just gets distracting and annoying after a while.This is one of those movies that has hits and misses and when it hits, it doesn't hit hard. The humor is kind of lame and too over-the-top to be funny. This humor works for, as for instance Austin Powers but not for Derek Zoolander unfortunately. The movie never really becomes really funny, this is also due to the totally ridicules story.Still the movie makes some good fun of the modeling world at times and the small cameo's by the many famous people also makes this movie still somewhat entertaining to watch.The acting of especially the main characters played by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson is good and is probably what prevents this movie from a completely unfunny and unwatchable one. All the characters are good and funny but unfortunately the script and directing is awful, so they don't get an awful lot to do in the movie.You are better of watching a different Ben Stiller movie, or an Austin Powers movie if you like silly modern humor.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horribly stupid time-passer has washed-up supermodel Ben Stiller being brainwashed by crazed fashion designer Will Farrell to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia so he can keep production costs down by using children as slave labor. Stiller knows that something is not quite right (well sort of) and he ends up joining forces with supermodel rival Owen Wilson and red hot Time Magazine journalist Christine Taylor. Together can they stop Farrell's devious plan? Pure comedic/parody-styled corn here as cameos and whacked situations try to entertain the audience, but ultimately nothing works. Ben Stiller just cannot act and he proves here he is no director either. Very slight. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zoolander Blows</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen thousands upon thousands of movies and I went into this movie expecting it to be like many of the other comedies starring Ben Stiller. However thirty minutes or so into the movie I contemplated actually leaving the theater. After the movie was done I contemplated pleading with the front counter for a refund. I sat through this movie hoping that eventually I would see the final credits and the hour and a half of suffering would be over...or maybe there would be some sort of character development or plot besides that of "Zoolander" trying to hone his modeling skills to outdo "Hansel" but it never happened...it went from bad to worse! I never would have expected to go to a Ben Stiller comedy and not laugh once...I would like to apologize to anyone who like me paid money to see this movie. Anyone who has been contemplating it...don't even rent it. Wait ten years when it is on Comedy Central and watch it then. It isn't worth the money or frankly the time it is an hour and a half of your life you will never get back!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking at some of the other reviews for this movie I can only come to the conclusion that these folks must have been watching a different movie, because I can't imagine anyone truly believing that this movie was anything but atrocious!!The plot was moronic and totally unbelievable, even by silly comedy movie standards. There were perhaps 2 or 3 scenes that were marginally funny, but for the major part (and when I say major I mean 99% of the movie), it was so bad as to be virtually unviewable!I think what spoke volumes about the quality of this movie was the fact that there were exactly 8 people, that's right 8, at a 7:50PM showing on a Friday night at a very popular theater. It appears the word has gotten out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It misses on every level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have tried to watch this movie about 4 times now. I thought maybe I didn't "get" it. I realise that I do get it though and I don't want it. I find that Ben Stiller is one of the most irritating "comic" actors . He is overrated to a ridiculous degree. He tried to blame the original failure at the box office on the fact it was released just before 9/11 but that is a cop-out. The script is painfully unfunny and stuffing a film with cameos only serves as a prop to hold up the weakness of the whole venture. I tried to concentrate on it but there was really nothing to watch. Kudos to the filmmakers for being able to get so many stars to appear in it but that is really not enough to save it. I managed to get through 30 minutes this time before I thought to myself, "Do you really want to waste minutes of your precious life watching this pile of faeces?" I came to the conclusion that I did not. As for Stiller-wake up people the Emperor has no clothes. Just because he has connections to "show biz" through his family was never any reason to laud him as a comic genius. Do NOT get me started with Will Ferrell either!! Owen Wilson has made lots of stinkers too but somehow I find him more appealing than Stiller on every level.There is not even a smile in this film let alone any laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of my time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, the main reason I rented this movie was that people quote it all the time, and I never understand what they're referring to (and usually, oft-quoted movies are very entertaining, such as Anchorman or Tommy Boy). Now having seen it, I still don't know why people quote this movie. I rented the movie knowing full well that I have never liked Ben Stiller in any movie I've seen him in. This movie was completely laugh-less for me, except for one part I can't quite recall (might've been the part where Zoolander and Hansel were trying to use the computer).The only bright point for this movie was the cast (except for Stiller and Wilson). I thought making Jerry Stiller Zoolander's agent was a great choice, and the tons of celebrity cameos I felt were wasted on such a bad movie (Paris Hilton, Natalie Portman, Fred Durst, Lance Bass, and ESPECIALLY David Bowie). In fact, 2 of the three stars I'm giving it are for all the cameos, because I love me some cameos.All in all, a terribly disappointing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am very sorry to all those out there who loved this movie, but it was ridiculous. Make no mistake, I am a HUGE Ben Stiller fan, but I'm sorry the characters were too stupid for me to take. I know that was the point of the whole film and all, but I couldn't take it. NOBODY is THAT dumb.The whole thing with 'Blue Steel' and the other four or five 'looks' that were ALL THE SAME was a bit much for me. It wasn't funny, just plain stupid. And the issue of the files being in the computer and their spending all that time trying to figure out how to PHYSICALLY REMOVE them...and then that guy dropping the computer to get them out? I mean COME ON!!! I'm not a stick-in-the-mud or anything, but I can't deal with such blatant stupidity. And the few things I chuckled at in this film were corny rather than funny; the only reason I did chuckle was that I'd never heard anything cornier.The best thing was the fact that so many celebrities had cameos in it, and then at the end their baby was really cute. Other than that, I'd prefer for Ben to stick to his normal humour...you know, the kind that's actually funny?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Zoolander" slampoons those people we all love to hate...fashion models. Especially, the male fashion model. Ben Stiller in the company of his parents and a whole bunch of miscellaneous celebs in bit parts, plays an empty-headed and narcissistic top male fashion model, Derek Zoolander, who is topped by an even topper male fashion model played by Owen (the nose) Wilson. Yeah, Stiller and Wilson playing fashion models: Funny premise, huh? With a kind of 007 (that's Zoolander's IQ) assassination plot thing going on, brainwashing Zoolander (no detergent required), a runway "walk-off" and other nonsense, this flick bulges with stupid, silly, nonsensical humor. Depending on -your- sense of humor, this film may wear itself out early or leave you craving seconds. Most will find LOL's aplenty with one helping sufficient.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most idiotic premise ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is, of course, the job of an actor to act, there are certain things that just can't be done. Without straining the ability to suspend disbelief, for example, you could not have Oprah Winfrey play the biological mother of Haley Joel Osment. Having Bernie Mac play JFK would be another stretch that's pretty much unimaginable. And the idea of having Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson play male models is on the same level.Some people might say that that's the point - it's inherently funny to have a man who resembles a chimpanzee and a man with half a nose playing models. That might be true, were it not for the fact that Ben Stiller, Jerry Stiller and Owen Wilson have, between them all, the comedic talents of a stale animal cracker. The only plus to this movie was Will Ferrell - that's it.I have no idea what a person might find funny about Zoolander - clearly some people find it endlessly amusing, even some of my friends - but I can't, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone that I don't want to see commit suicide. If you really want to experience something that nearly emulates the amount of pain this movie will inflict without having to spend over an hour watching it, may I advise the following?Go duck hunting with Dick Cheney. Have an intimate encounter with a food processor. Dip your most sensitive bits in gravy and tease a rabid wolverine. Hug a wrecking ball (in use). Apply for a job brushing the teeth of great white sharks.Any of these will allow you to experience the sheer mental torture that "Zoolander" will inflict on you without actually having to invest the time in watching Ben Stiller 'act'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the last of the famous international top-models</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of this Ben Stiller's effort ranks among the ones that American cinema particularly has a liking for. The flawless career of a fellow at first unlikely to succeed his life but who, ultimately will have become rich, respectable and will have found his place in society. Stiller must have been influenced by this kind of story for his work. He acts Derek Zoolander, an eccentric young man who could have spent his life in poverty due to his limited intellectual faculties. But, fortunately, the world of fashion rescued him and he became a seasoned top-model. I must admit that I'm not fond of this kind of topic, very simply because it seems unlikely to me. A topic like this one prevents a movie from working well. I will attribute without any hesitation, my opinion to Stiller's movie. The absence of directing is to deplore as well as his execrable performance. By his grimaces, the way he talks, he tries to ape Jim Carrey with a much less convincing result which gives ludicrous sequences. Moreover, with "Zoolander", Stiller's intention was to shot a satire of the world of fashion; but this point is flown over than denounced. Sorry, Mr Stiller you missed your chance. At last, it is not a labored and inconsistent screenplay that will make up the whole. I used the term "inconsistent" because Stiller acts a so dumb character that it is nearly impossible to imagine him running a center for children who want to learn to read.Ultimately, it is a humorous piece with ponderous humor. If Ben Stiller proved himself as an actor (although "Zoolander" doesn't belong to his major opus), he still has serious improvement to do at the level of directing. Really, the year 2001 wasn't a good one for American comedies. Only, Wes Anderson played his game well with the witty "the Royal Tenenbaums" that year...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened, Ben?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Ben Stiller is usually quite funny, especially in Meet the Parents (update as of 12/04: his shtick is now growing weary), but Zoolander is one of his worst. There are few funny moments that I actually laughed at. Even though Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are best buds and frequently work together in films, it didn't help the rest of the movie at all. The female love interest of Derek Zoolander lacked charisma, and though Ben's real life dad Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld) was in this, he couldn't save it either.Zoolander is a huge misfire because it tries to target a specific age group and, I think, fails mostly due to the fact that it's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is. Sure, it has a few funny cameos from the likes of Billy Zane, David Duchovny and Will Ferrell, and there are a few funny one-liners including "How are the children supposed to learn to read if they can't even fit inside the building?", but if you've already seen the trailer...you've seen the best bits.2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zoolander</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by, and starring Ben Stiller, I knew this film was about modelling, and it turned out to be a pretty funny film. Basically Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is the three time VH1 male model of the year, and he looks forward to the fourth, but is beaten by rival Hansel (Owen Wilson). So Derek's friends disappear, his father Larry (Jon Voight) is disappointed in him, and feels like he's not a good model anymore. But he soon gets hired by the fiendish fashion guru Mugatu (Will Ferrell), only to be brainwashed into killing the President of Malaysia, and many other models have something implanted in them. Time Magazine journalist Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) is now trying to help Derek hide out from the Katinka (Milla Jovovich) and the other bad guys, and find a way to stop the brainwashing murder from happening. Also starring Jerry Stiller (Ben's father) as Maury Ballstein, David Duchovny as J.P. Prewitt, Judah Friedlander as Scrappy Zoolander, Nathan Lee Graham as Todd, Alexandre Manning as Brint, Asio Highsmith as Rufus and Alexander Skarsg?rd (Stellan's son) as Meekus, with cameos from Donald Trump, Christian Slater, Cuba Gooding Jr., Natalie Portman, Fabio, Lenny Kravitz, Gwen Stefani, Heidi Klum, Mark Ronson, Paris Hilton, David Bowie, Kimberly 'Lil' Kim' Jones, Claudia Schiffer, Lukas Haas, Amy Stiller (Ben's sister) as Hansel's Posse Member, Jennifer Coolidge as American Designer, X-Men's James Marsden as John Wilkes Booth, Victoria Beckham, The King of Comedy's Sandra Bernhard, Emma Bunton, Blade's Stephen Dorff, Winona Ryder, Vince Vaughn as Luke Zoolander and Billy Zane. Stiller is good at playing both stupid and Hissy fits (he won an award from it funnily enough), and pulling those "pose" faces, and it is good to see so many famous faces in a satirical comedy film like this. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ZOOLANDER / (2001) ** (out of four)The first thing I do after watching a movie is evaluate any personal changes it made with me. A film can completely change my outlook on parts of life. Zoolander did indeed make a lasting impression.on my view of male super models. I can honestly say I'll never look at another Calvin Klien billboard the same way again, but that isn't exactly a towering accomplishment.Zoolander is not supposed to make a lasting impression; it's flimsy, 90-minute escapism. Though I didn't laugh very much in this nonsensical comedy either, although it does contain some funny material involving the title character's stupidity, and it benefits from keeping its tongue firmly in cheek.Following the success of his blockbuster comedies "Meet the Parents" and "There's Something About Mary," Ben Stiller gathered family and friends to make Zoolander, an original, stylish satire on the fashion industry. Based on a 1996 VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards character Stiller co-created with MTV Movie Awards writer/producer Drake Sather, Zoolander is quite pleased with its unique sense of humor, but unique does not necessarily spell funny.Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, who has defended his title of Male Model of the Year for three consecutive years now, but this year his competition gets the best of him. A dashing, red-hot newcomer, Hansel (Owen Wilson) nabs the award, sending Zoolander home with nothing but a low self-image. Shocked by these and other tragic events, Derek wonders if there's more to life than being "really, really good looking." He returns to his Southern roots only for his coal miner father (Jon Voight) to disown him. Enter a diabolical plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, and you have yourself the visually amusing concept of Zoolander.Ben Stiller has the stuff here, as does Owen Wilson, Jon Voight, SNL veteran Will Ferrell, Jerry Stiller, and Milla Jovovich. I especially enjoyed the charismatic performance by Ben Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor as an aggressive Time Magazine Reporter. Andy Dick, Fabio, Cuba Gooding Jr., Donald Trump, Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Billy Zane, and Garry Shandling and other big stars appear for satiric cameos. There's a lot of talent involved with this film, which makes it all the more tragic that it doesn't work.Ben Stiller, who also directs, writes, and producers this movie, has a lot of fun. During pre-production, Stiller and Owen Wilson spent two days being photographed by Frank Ockenfels to create model "portfolios" for Zoolander and Hansel. They posed in mock ad campaigns for Gucci, Perry Ellis, Tommy Hilfiger and Evian, as well as bogus magazine covers for GQ, Details, Rolling Stone, Surfer, American Way, ESPN and the International Male catalog.Filmed in New York City and Los Angeles, the film creates an enjoyable world of glamorous fashion fiction. Production designer Robin Standefer and costume designer David C. Robinson imagine lush, outrageous, exotic costumes and images that greatly contribute to character development. Even with such a complex visual arena, however, Zoolander flops. It's visually entertaining, yes, but the story is not interesting, the characters one-dimensional, and the attempt at humor only occasionally makes us grimace. It's dazzling, flavorful candy for our eyes, but Zoolander is all style without substance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Is This Crap About ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally like Ben Stiller but I think with ZOOLANDER he has too many irons in too many fires . Directed by , written by and starring Ben Stiller proves you can have too much of a good thing . Stiller works best when he`s playing it straight in a comic situation like THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and MEET THE PARENTS , but here he`s vainly trying to be funny and ends up being silly . The script might have worked if it just concentrated on male models ( Himbos ? Bimboys ? ) being pretentious with lines like " Of course models help people . We make them feel good about themselves and show them how to do their hair " . Even if it had stayed on the subplot about Derek Zoolander returning to his roots at the mining town the script might have had some saving graces , but no it suddenly turns into THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE where it loses all credibility and entertainment value .To see how satire on the male model industry works catch Sacha Baron Cohen`s ALI G IN DA USA where he plays a gay Austrian male model</fullReview>
