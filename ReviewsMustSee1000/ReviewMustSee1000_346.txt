		<fullReview>I can't believe that Requiem For A Dream is on the top 250 list but this isn't. I never thought this movie would be so incredibly underrated! This was the only movie that made me completely swear off drugs. The characters are so young and vulnerable and you get to see them slowly fall into this world of drugs and violence and be completely swept away. In Requiem For A Dream, the characters start out doing some harder drugs and you barely get to see where everything goes wrong, it just seemed to be like that all of a sudden. The characters aren't as likable and I thought it ended a bit abruptly leaving us no knowledge of what is to become of the characters. I have to give it props though for some brilliant scenes like when they all go into the fetal position at the end.  Basketball Diaries on the other hand gets you involved and attached to the characters. You get to watch them throw away their basketball careers and their lives. The part where Lewis is going through withdrawal is so real and horrible. And after he goes through all that pain, he throws it away and goes straight back to the drugs. This movie is so incredible, I really wish more people would see it and think the same.Shay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very powerfull statement against drugs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think 'The basketball diaries' is a realistic and very important movie. It shows the road that one walks to being addicted to drugs. From taking dope once a week to taking dope every day, every hour. Leonardo DiCaprio playes a basketballplayer, a schoolkid(Jim Carrol) who walks this path. He experiments with drugs 'till there is no way back. He gets himself in all kinds of stupid situations. He starts robbing stores, ripping off money from old ladies just to get some cash for dope. His life is beginning to look like a living hell. His basketballcoach wants to have sex with him, and when he passes out on the basketballfield due to taking a wrong kind of 'pep-pil', he gets kicked out of the basketball team and from school. From this moment on everything goes in a downward spiral for DiCaprio.An excellent scenario you would say, and it is. The acting from DiCaprio is great. We saw it earlier on in his career when he got oscar-nominated for 'What's eating gilbert grape'. A gripping drama in which he playes a disabled kid. But in 'The basketball diaries' he playes an equally difficult part. Not a lot actors would have put down this kid who's life is wrecked, and who is constantly thinking about dope as well as DiCaprio did.The statement the movie delivers is a powerfull one. Being addicted to drugs is horrible. Usually people learn about this aspect trough seminars or televisonshows such as Oprah Winfrey. But it never really gets the kind of attention and understanding from the audience as 'The Basketball diaries' delivers.The amazing performance by DiCaprio, the fact that this movie is actually based on a true story and the reality the movie is set in, 'The basketball diaries' deserves a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beings that this was Leonardo's first leading role, he was very impressive as Jim Carroll. The movie also stars Lorraine Bracco, Marc Wahlberg, James Madio and Patrick McGaw as his mother and sidekicks respectfully. As an ex-addict myself, I could relate to his story and everything he went through. The movie was so real it brought up a lot of old memories that I thought I had forgotten. I wish every young person was made to see this movie as it takes the fun and games out of even recreational drug use. Not even the strong survive. I give it two thumbs way up and my sincere thanks to Jim Carroll for fighting off his demons to write "The Baasketball Diaries".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another heroin-addict diary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you've watched plenty of movies based on some drug-addict life story you can't help compare them... I mean, the story is always the same: a guy begins having drugs for fun, or because he's boring, or just because he's young and wants to try new experiences, then he gets hooked, starts to rob or to prostitute himself, and eventually ends up in prison. That's what we see in Christiane F., El Pico, Trainspotting, Drugstore Cowboy... There may be differences in the form, and in the characters, but the content is always the same. The dinstictive feature of Basketball Diaries is that the main character actually exists: Jim Carroll, a writer-singer-performer born in NYC in the 50's. And this is supposed to be his autobiography (or the cinema adaptation of some diaries he wrote when he was a teenager, heroin-addicted). Because of that, Basketball D. is more poetic than the rest of the movies I named before, the voice over of DiCaprio's character is present all along the film, telling us about his thoughts (rather nihilistic's) , with a style near to Burroughs or Jack Kerouac, urban poetry, tough and without ornament. Maybe that's the strong point of Basketball Diaries, because movies such as Christiane F. or El Pico recreates much better what it means to be a drug-addict, they're much more explicit, more dirty, much harder...DiCaprio's performance deserves a new paragraph, 'cause it's simply astonishing. His best performance EVER, plenty of different shades. As he did in Gilbert Grape or This Boy's Life, he shows us how versatile he can be. If only he'd choose better the films he works in. My rate: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good depressing movie. But, you can't make a good anti-drug movie without making it depressing. DiCaprio is brilliant. Arnie from What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Richard from The Beach, and Jim Carroll from the Basketball Diaries are about Leo's deepest characters. He is an excellent actor. The scenes that get you the most are the withdrawal scenes, and everytime he confronts his mother in the movie. This movie deserves a 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every teenaged kid should watch this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the U.S. government wanted to win the "war on drugs", all they had to do was show this film in every high school in America ... a lot cheaper than running the D.E.A., I reckon. There are other films which could fit into this group; "Midnight Express" comes to mind. During the short time that I spent living in Toronto, I saw a shocking number of people whose lives were destroyed by drugs. I believe that the real root of the drug pandemic lies in the fact that young people don't understand the nature of hard drugs like cocaine and heroin. I take my hat off to Leo. He is a much better actor than people give him credit for being.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was Leonardo's first leading role, and he does great work as Jim Carroll. The movie cheats him from time to time, but he gives a consistent and believable performance. He is helped by an excellent supporting cast, especially Mark Wahlberg and Lorraine Bracco.

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Indictment Against Drug Addiction...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An uncompromising script and a solid performance from Leonardo Di Caprio help make THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a powerful and memorable film experience. Leo plays Jim Carroll, a high school student with a love of basketball and a flare for writing whose life goes right down the toilet when he becomes a heroine addict. Yes, perhaps Leo gets hooked a little too quickly but everything that happens to him after he gets hooked is totally real. Along with CLEAN AND SOBER, this movie so clearly and honestly demonstrates where drug addiction can take you...how nothing else becomes important but how and where that next high is coming from. There is one harrowing scene after another here. We see Jim returning to his mother (Lorraine Bracco) after being kicked out of the house and we see Jim turn from begging child to threatening thug in a matter of seconds, a scene brilliantly performed by DiCaprio. We see Jim and his friends beat up an old lady for her purse and we even see Jim prostitute himself with a man in order to get money. It's a frightening and realistic spiral downward that Jim takes and he does make it back, but it is important to remember when watching this film that a lot don't. DiCaprio gets solid support from future star Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby, Jr., Juliette Lewis, and Michael Imperioli. A harrowing film experience that will not be forgotten once the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>St. Vitus' Dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a type of disease associated with St. Vitus and this film qualifies in the comparison because it's quirky, fast, and it never stops moving. Director Scott Kalvert gives the movie a 'look' that makes the Manhattan of the period when it supposedly takes place, believable.Leonardo DiCaprio was at his best in the film. His performance is very nuanced and in your face, at the same time. Mr. DiCaprio makes you feel the pain Jim is going through; he is a lost soul. Not being a fan of Mark Wahlberg, I must confess that in this film, be it because of the direction, or whatever, he shines, as Mickey. As Jim's mother, Lorraine Bracco has never been better in anything she has been in recent memory. Bruno Kirby is perfectly creepy as the coach of St. Vitus High School. As far as the connection with the Columbine School massacre, since the sequence where Jim is involved is a dream, it's easy to understand how the twisted minds of the ones responsible for the killings would have taken this scene as a model for their terrible crime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>May I say, that I was impressed with this movie. It shows the truth of drugs and what they can do to you. After I saw this movie, I went out and found the book and read it. It's more sad then the movie, but still seeing Leonardo's performance is very effective. Jim Carrol is a high school basketball player who once in a while gets stoned with his friends. But eventually he becomes brutally addicted to the drugs and looses everything he has worked for.To Leonardo, you did good.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful and adamant message against drug abuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie first, and was inspired to read the book. In the middle of my reading I saw the movie again. Even though the movie is nowhere close when it comes to being faithful to Jim Carroll's fantastic novel, I still regard it as one of the most important movies I've ever seen (and Carroll's novel my favourite book).Even though the movie made up 80% (if not 90%) of Carroll's life, its anti-drugs message is still strongly and powerfully delivered. Unlike "Traffic", the most recent anti-drug movie, "Diaries" is carefully-paced, interesting and most importantly, it speaks directly to the audience. DiCaprio's Carroll (or the film version) is someone who has to sacrifice his dream -- which is to become a basketball player -- to feed his seemingly never-ending hunger to get high. "Diaries" is not only a movie for non-junkies; it is also a movie for drug addicts. DiCaprio's astounding withdrawal scene is the one you're likely to remember out of the whole thing, and I think it provides a mirror for drug abusers to look into, to see how crap they really look.(mild spoiler) Anyone who's seen this movie should know that drug addiction would pretty much screw up a person's life. Although Carroll -- both the film version and the real-life figure -- came out of it a stronger person, not everyone has it in them to completely kick their habit. Example: Mickey (Mark Wahlberg) has to use his life to pay for a drastic and irreversible action that happened on a whim of fury, when he got cheated by a drug-seller, and Pedro is still on heroin even after reform camp. (end spoiler) "Diaries" is both touching and sad, but more importantly, it's powerful.Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect as Jim Carroll, if not a little scrawny for a basketball player. I regard Leonardo, along with Joaquin Phoenix, as the finest actor of his generation, and it's not hard to know why. I read a comment here that said he overacted during the scene outside his mom's apartment. Well, I beg to differ. How else was he supposed to act under such extreme desperation? DiCaprio's wailings and whinings were spot-on, 'cause that is exactly how *I* sound when I cry (and I mean, REALLY cry). That scene was the most memorable one for me, followed by his withdrawal scene, which I felt was worth the price of the DVD alone. DiCaprio looked disgusting with drool all over his face which was bloodied earlier on, and it was completely effective. Mark Wahlberg, Patrick McGaw and James Madio all gave strong support, but the star here is really DiCaprio.To reiterate: "The Basketball Diaries" is one of the most important movies I've seen, and the book is one of the best and also important I've read. Teenagers should see this one. (I'm 15.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Redemption?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I had heard good things about this movie. It certainly does a good job depicting how ugly life can be. It is very dark. Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job in this film, but does much better in other works (just about everything else he has ever been in). The scene where he asks his mother for money and cries outside of her door should have been more violent. Maybe his character didn't have any more strength to act more violently, but the movie had me suspend disbelief willingly up until that point. The movie doesn't glorify drugs or violence and I didn't find it at all unrealistic until that scene outside of his mother's door. I expected Jim to be considerably more violent and desperate, but instead he just kind of paws at the door and at his mother and then whimpers and cries on the steps outside her door (oh he half heartedly yells out a few times but where is that desperate strength, that animal rage that should have been there?). And then at the end - Jim is redeemed so quickly - how and why? What does he have to live for? Why does he cleanup in jail? What is his life about after the drugs? Telling and retelling his horrific "drughead" days? That's not redemption. I did not find this movie to be as good as I was lead to believe it was going to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeCaprio Was Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It pisses me off when people say that 'Basketball Diaries' is a rip-off of 'Requiem for a Dream.' The stupidity of the uneducated. It was interesting though seeing the similarities to both films, but that is besides the point.I was one of those people who thought that Leonardo DeCaprio was just a washed up 'Teen Beat' cover boy. All of that because of 'Titanic.' I really hate to admit that now that I have seen the majority of his work. The first time I really began changing my mind was in 2002 when he starred in both 'Gangs of New York' and 'Catch Me if You Can.' What got me thinking is that both Scorsese and Spielberg aren't the type of directors to hire an actor just because they have a teenage fanbase and also, DeCaprio's performances in both were excellent.But, it wasn't until recently that I changed my mind completely and realized just how much of an under-appreciated actor he is. He has done films like 'The Beach,' 'Basketball Diaries,' and more, all of which received high acclaim, but because of 'Titanic,' people won't give him a seconds glance. And he was great in 'Titanic.'Honestly, I doubt that there is any other actor out there who could've done a better job as Jim Carrol. Hell, even Mark Whalberg did a great job. He is another under-appreciated actor.If you are one of the many people who say that they won't see 'Basketball Diaries' because of Leo, don't be so judgmental. He made the movie so wonderful. It is an excellent film and he is an excellent actor.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated... In a good way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film isn't for everyone, you either hate it or love it. It sometimes lacks that constant up-beat easy to watch feel that certain types of audiences need to enjoy a film and is replaced with brutal honesty.The performances from all of the actors were outstanding, with Leonardo DiCaprio performing some of the best acting I have ever seen. His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name: The basketball scene in the rain, every confrontation between Jim and his mother, and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy, modern, stylized, glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest, raw, bold and touching movie about the self-destruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked, underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid flick, with good young DiCaprio performance, good and worth-seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kalvert's portrayal of a catholic school basketball star, turned junkie is touching, but definitely flawed. DiCaprio is pretty good in the lead role of Jim Caroll, although he had some problems with the drug scenes (especially the first one) and the basketball scenes (he played like he sucked), other than that his performance was pretty good. The film had a great supporting cast, with Lorraine Bracco shining as his mother and Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and James Madio were all great in their roles, as well as Michael Rapaport, who stole his single scene from DiCaprio. The problem I had was that the film was not the most realistic, although a lot of the stuff it did portray I can either relate to or have seen go on in my high school (not exactly the most safe environment, California high schools or NY...). The direction was good keeping it interesting at most times, but i felt the screenplay was a bit weak and especially in the 3rd act it fell apart, although the ending was a bit cliché, it still helped as it rescued the 3rd act which seemed to be going nowhere. The acting was good, direction was nice and music used was also well done, screenplay was lackluster however. 8/10 #207 on my list of all-time favorite films</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sorry True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonardo Di Caprio puts in the best performance of his career in this sickening true story of boys growing up in a man's world. Him and his friends(including boogie night's Mark Wahlberg) start a life threatening race of drugs and murder. Ernie Hudson puts in a small appearance as Reggie, the do gooder who tries to put Leo on the right tracks. Juliette Lewis is smartly placed as the local prostitute, and Bruno Kirby plays the gay basketball coach to perfection. The most disturbing scene for me was when Reggie tries to get Jimmy(leo) off of drugs by locking him in a room for a long time. Both actors do well with Leo in a polished performance. The Basketball Diaries is disturbing, but at the same time, it tells the truth in a way that keeps the images in your mind. If it had one fault, it was under using Lorraine Bracco and Michael Imporliano(both appeared in Goodfellas and The Sopranos). Rating=3/5</fullReview>

De Caprio completes his role perfectly, when he shows the fragile nature of the character turning inside and writing down the diary. The entire cast of character is even credible. Every member of his gang offers a well structured stereotyp. The movie tells stations, reasons and the social consequenses of an drug addict with a huge realistc impact -but without any advices. Plotpoints, Szenes and sequences seem unavoidable and without any alternative. Viewers probably getting enlighten by theire self.

		<shortDescription>Fantastic book,awful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I made the point of approaching the film with an open mind considering "The Basketball diaries" was one of my favourite novels when I was a teenager. First of all, good points. Great performance from Di Caprio. The scene with the four boys playing basketball in the rain, set to Jom Carroll's "people Who Died" on the soundtrack, was for me the one scene that truly nailed the spirit and attitude of the book.Hence the two good points.Bad points. The film reduced its wonderful source material to just another preachy, moralistic, stating the obvious 'kids, say no to drugs' diatribe.It also didn't have the guts to push it main character's decent into the hell of drug addiction further. Example:the scene where he meets his first client in the public toilets. If,according to the film,is that how bad it got for the main character, it rendered the film completely unbelievable and reeking of boo-hoo self pity and Catholic guilt.In short, the film needed a strong sense of non-compromise if it was to get anywhere near the compelling vision that Jim Carroll depicted in the novel. Simply put, it fell into the trap that a great number of films about drugs and drug abuse fall into. They either glamourise, like "Dogs in Space" or "Less Than Zero, or preach, like this one.The three best films about drugs and drug abuse for me would have to be "Drugstore Cowboy" and "Trainspotting";"Requiem for A Dream", by Darren Aronofsky, would without a doubt be the finest film about drug abuse ever made,full stop.They neither glamourise of preach. They simply show the damage, both physical and emotional and in a candid and truthful way, that drug use can cause and they never judge. "Requiem for A Dream" especially.See that film instead, ore read the book of "The Basketball Daries".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One seriously confronting movie about the world of heroin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a huge uproar regarding this movie because of a scene where the main character walks into his classroom and starts gunning everybody down with a shotgun. As is typical everybody has missed the whole point of the movie. It is not designed to encourage school shootings, but to show people what heroin is really like. When it comes to violence on television and video games then I will repeat what was said to me once, not that anybody will listen - people are so stubborn that once that have a mindset, no amount of reason will change their mind. Anyway, before television there was an awful lot of violence - the Napoleonic Wars, the thirty years war, the crusades, and even World War I: probably one of the most violent of wars. Even then before literature or even the written language, Cain killed Abel, and he did not do it because a video game made him think that it was a good idea. Violence is apart of our nature and we do it because we are frustrated with the world and the way people react to us. It is basic to our nature, and I am not saying that it is alright, but rather stopping violence in the media is not going to change anything.The Basketball Diaries is about a heroin addict. We follow his life from when he becomes one to when he finally gives up. Even though he does not start off as a heroin addict, he is still taking drugs, or rather sniffing glue. He, Jim Carol, hangs with three other friends and they simply act like teenagers with a lot of energy. Jim is also a champion basketball player. There is a darker side to his life and that is that his best friend is dying of Leukemia. He does not want to believe it, but it is reality and once he dies things slowly begin to change. We are not sure what really happens, but I guess it has something to do with the realisation that they are no longer immortal. But that is not the main reason, it more has to do with the pain and the loss that he suffers after his friend dies, and it is not something that they could have fought against - in fact he was powerless to do anything about it. The realisation of ones weakness is a true humbliser.Starting the addiction is not focused that heavily on in the movie, but his first trip is, and it shows him running through a field of flowers. It is more that he describes how all of his pain has gone away - both the emotional and the physical. This is the thing about Heroin - it is one of the world's best painkillers, but it is also an incredibly addictive drug. What we see is how his life collapses around him as he becomes addicted to Heroin. He is kicked out of school, slowly looses his friends as they are each arrested for various crimes, and finally he himself is taken away as he lies in a pathetic heap before the door to his mothers' apartment. Near the end we even see him resort of Homosexuality, something that horrifies him, especially when he is molested by the basketball coach, to get money for drugs. This is further undermined when the drugs he purchases are fake.The Basketball Diaries is an incredible movie and shows something that we wish to ignore. The school shooting scene is not all that bad, and more shows his frustration with life and the way the drugs take away this frustration - but at a cost. It is something that has been taken right out of proportion and as such people take the wrong idea about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most underrated film ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trust me the basketball diaries is the one of the most underrated films I've ever seen, but on rare occasions that's what makes a film brilliant - this is one of those rare occasions.The acting is absolutely superb especially Dicaprio who people only seemed to acknowledge after playing a preety boy character 'Jack' in the Titanic. After watching this film I really appreciate what a marvelous actor he is. He's so convincing as Jim Carroll a basketball player, poet,drug addict and lost youth shedding his innocence in the seedy city of New York. Most powerful scene in the movie is when he is begging his 'Ma'for some money for a fix, which is absolutely heartbreaking to watch. Leo's acting really shines when he does a cold turkey scene which is one Oscar nomination well over due! It was so convincing, hairs on the back of your neck will stand up!Mark Wahlberg plays a disturbed tough guy/school pal very well, Lorraine Bracco is great as Jim's despairing mother and Jim Carroll himself (the author)makes a great cameo. If you haven't read the book the film will prompt you because it's a great read too. The commentary with extracts from Jim's poetry are very fitting and a very beautiful back-drop for Jim and his pals getting up to no good.One of my favourite films (could you tell?) Well worth a look I hope my review helps. CBR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lurid, dark portrait of modern youth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Basketball Diaries is the true life story of Jim Carrol. Although please don't be fooled by the above as the film only charts a mere fraction of his adolescent youth, all of which is crammed into 97 minutes. But this is effective stuff. The acting is solid and at times superb(in particular is Bruno Kirby's perverse turn as Basketball coach 'Swifty')even good old Ernie (Ghostbusters) Hudson makes his presence known with very subtle delivery, especially as the film spirals deep into its very lucid heroine addiction centre. Stand out performances would have to go to Lorraine Bracco who plays Jim's tortured mother, Mark Wahlbergs 'fresh off the street rebel swagger' is fantastic to watch and we can't forget Leo's own characterisation of Jim Carrol. Clearly Leo is far more comfortable in these kind of roles. With stand out performances covered it must have made it easier for director Scott Kalvert to concentrate on the look of the film. Which is wonderfully dark, gritty and in places, quite beautiful. The directors only faults are his interpretation of the time period. The time of Jim Carrol's life that is being portrayed here is the 1970's, but when watching it you can't help but think it's more late 80's early 90's. Not too much wrong, though a bit longer would have been nice. This could even be considered a strong, honest 'don't do drugs lesson' for school children. and there's nothing wrong with that as this is a bold film with solid characterisation and fantastic imagery. Poetic you might say.Rory John Shelley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is an unapologetic look at the plunge into the nightmare world of drugs and teen angst. Though based on a true story (however lightly) it has tremendous merit by itself. It abandons the preachy politically correct pathway and takes you down the road without any warning. It leaves the viewer free to form their own opinion. I love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of DiCaprio's only good performance's, but the script stinks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides "Gilbert Grape", and "This boys life", this is Leo DiCaprio's only good performance, unfortunatly its in this only moderately successful film. Based on a true story, DiCaprio plays a teenager whose life seems to be going just fine, until he gets into drugs, hes kicked off the basketball team, and goes nowhere but downhill from there. If it wasnt for the run of the mill script, this could have been a very powerful film, unfortunately, its doesnt reach its potential due to that. I mean its watchable, but dont expect to be blown away or anything. The supporting cast is superb though, Lorraine Braco(Goodfellas), Bruno Kirby(City Slikers), Mark Wahlberg(Boogie Nights), Ernie Hudson(Ghostbusters), and Juliette Lewis(Cape Fear, From Dusk Till Dawn) all give impressive performances. Im still going to give it a 6, because DiCaprio gave a great performance, and I liked the actors. Star rating:**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heroin is bad. Quitting school is bad. Do heroin, and quit school, and you'll end up a hopeless loser. If you understand those two points, then you already know everything The Basketball Diaries is trying to tell you. If you think the drug issue is any more complex than that, then prepare to be disappointed by this movie.The movie started off somewhat promisingly, with a look at the lives of Jim Caroll and his friends (as interpreted by the moviemakers, of course). The first part is in turns funny and sad, and is generally realistic enough to be poignant.As soon as Leonardo diCaprio is forced to play someone spiralling into a nightmare of addiction, however, everything goes downhill. If this movie has any subtle or interesting point to make about drug abuse or society, it forgets it here. It just goes back and forth between silly drug-induced dreams and numerous scenes of petty crime, filthy rooms, and Jim looking increasingly corpselike.The main reason why this part of the movie seems so absurd is the performance of diCaprio himself. The scenes where he tries to get money from his mother, and where he goes through withdrawal, were so hammily overacted that I stopped being shocked and started laughing. Then I stopped laughing and started wanting to hit the mute button. There is one scene where he seems like he does nothing but moan "maaaaaaaaaa... wahhhhh" for minutes on end. There is a difference between drama and melodrama. It's clear that this movie can't resist portraying the latter at the expense of the former.Anyhow, if you want a movie that will challenge you to think about the drug issue, watch Traffic. If you want an after-school special, watch the Basketball Diaries.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Blame this Movie for Real-Life School Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the past few years, "The Basketball Diaries" has been blamed for a rash of disconnected school massacres in the United States. The anti-media zealots who blame school violence on the fantasy sequence, where Jim Carroll(Leonardo DiCaprio) barges into his classroom to kill everyone in sight, starting with his teacher, ignore the facts, as usual. The reasons that Carroll fantasized about this killing spree were; 1)The teacher got a sick thrill from beating his pupils, and 2)Carroll was high on heroin. Of course, one does not need to become a drug addict, in order to desire revenge against power mad tyrants, who exploit people that they believe themselves to be morally superior to. As for the kids of Columbine High, and other pre-Columbine mass-murderers, most of them were either bullies, or victims of bullies. The fact that they were fans of this movie is irrelevant. If what I'm saying isn't true, then perhaps the opponents of free speech would like to tell me why there weren't a rash of school shootings following the 1968 movie "If..." Rent, or buy an original copy of this film for the following reasons; 1)The talent of Leonardo DiCaprio, 2)The explanation for that controversial fantasy sequence, and 3)The music video for the song "People Who Died,' by the REAL Jim Carroll, just in case you thought that when he made that song 20 years ago, he was only kidding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Didn't know the movie, found it while browsing IMDb, so i wasn't expecting such a movie.It has a very powerful message, about drugs, like many other movies. But in this one you can see the process in much detail. Would say in some aspects similar to Requiem for a dream. Just maybe here you can grasp the intensity of the main character's feelings deeper.Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion makes a fabulous role in this movie. Although 21 years old, seems as though he was 15 (real protagonist's age), and so makes a stronger point. He is able to act scenes as though he really is a heavy heroin user therefore convincing the audience.Mark Wahlberg too, so young and great acting.Overall a dark, sometimes stressing, hard movie that I would recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basketball Memoirs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very loosely based on the memoir of the same name, The Basketball Diaries transposes the late '60s adolescence of writer and artist Jim Carroll to some unspecified time period at least 15 years later, further confusing the time frame with three decades of rock music, some by Carroll himself.The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Lorraine Bracco, James Madio, and Mark Wahlberg.It was directed by Scott Kalvert.Jim and his Catholic school chums are on the hottest basketball team in New York, but their friend Bobby languishes in the hospital with leukemia. In-between typically boyish adventures, Jim scribbles in his notebook and experiments with sex and drugs. His group of friends begins to disintegrate after coach Swifty not only makes a pass at Jim, but also catches him and his pals using drugs on the court and kicks them off the team. Out of school and on the streets, Jim turns tricks, betrays friends, robs stores, and deals drugs to feed his heroin addiction. Not even the efforts of former addict Reggie can cure Jim.Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He cannot go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity, which ultimately ends with Jim's incarceration in a state penitentiary. After months in the hospital, he gets out and later does a talk show about his drug life, but before that he turned down free drugs given to him by his old friend, Pedro.Jim started out as a practice basketball player, and moved on to writing his memoirs.Although it masquerades as a cautionary tale about the horrors of heroin, this epic of teen-age angst is more accurately seen as a reverential wallow in the gutter of self-absorption.One thing about the plot is that the view never understand what really motivated this intelligent adolescent, a gifted basketball player and sensitive writer, to descend into the hellish life of a drug addict and hustler on the mean streets of New York.It only showed how drugs can destroy one's life.As for the movie,it was a must-see as you get a glimpse of the great actor Leonardo DiCaprio is going to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since hearing the commentary track of Paul Thomas Anderson for the Boogie Nights DVD (I heard it like in early 2008), this title, Scott Kalvert's The Basketball Diaries, came to stay in my mind. I really love the way P.T. Anderson, like Tarantino or now Edgar Wright, talks about his influences, about film in general, and in this case after hearing that he cast Mark Walhberg after seeing his performance in The Basketball Diaries ("god, he was good, god, I though he was so good" ? and Mark made sure P.T. Anderson wanted him for his acting and not for his body!) definitely made me want to check it out (I Am Cuba is another of the titles that stayed with me thanks to that commentary. I still have to watch it tough). And P.T. Anderson explains that actually his first choice for that part was Leonardo DiCaprio. He doesn't specify, but it's very probable that DiCaprio became his choice also due to The Basketball Diaries (however he decided to do Titanic instead). Anyway, there is not a R4 DVD around that I know, so it was until some weeks ago, when I found on ebay a really cheap R1 DVD of it, when I sort of recall everything and finally got it. When you see a movie with the title of "The Basketball Diaries" and a very young DiCaprio, I mean, a young blonde kid in school clothes in its DVD cover you may not think of it as something really interesting. Definitely you don't think of it as a strong movie about the consequences of drug addiction. This is a movie that deals with the downfall of some very talented young basketball players. It has few to offer for those seeking for a straight sports movie though. We learn that our characters really can play basketball, and pretty much that's it. This is really a straight drug movie. And it's a really good one even though it doesn't really add something "brand-new" to the drug movie sort of formula (but we probably have here the basketball game with the most doped players. That scene features the Doors' "Riders on the Storm", which is pretty cool indeed). My sort of analogy goes with the thing that DiCaprio became like a different actor once he began working with Martin Scorsese back in 2002. He definitely left Titanic behind. Maybe before Scorsese but hell, since Gangs of New York I, at least, see a different DiCaprio. So here in The Basketball Diaries we have like the two DiCaprio. The movie at first sight is a coming of age one with the Titanic DiCaprio suffering the type of education that his Catholic school gives but also having fun with his friends (all are part of a great Catholic basketball team that is pretty much invincible) and stuff; it's a "kids being kids" kind of story. Once the movie gets much darker we get to see the Scorsese DiCaprio. Somehow some scenes really make see the very intense DiCaprio from the Scorsese films. It was a surprise to have him here doing something like that, two years before Titanic (I have yet to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape, for which he earned his first Oscar nomination back in 1994). This is worth watching stuff.</fullReview>

The fact that its based on a true story and the impressive performance from DiCaprio only involves you more and more into the story until you feel as if you know each and every character. Watching the characters change throughout the film is remarkable, it really does put across the anti-drugs message, without doing it in a high-school documentary style.

DiCaprio's character really gives his struggles a human feel with his diary used as a narration. Speaking of DiCaprio, he has a breakout performance in this film which helped to propel him to the mega star that he is today. And rightfully so; he does a wonderful job playing the strung-out, desperate character of Jim. Mark Wahlberg is also very good in one of his early roles.The movie has heart with the characters of Bobby, Reggie, and Jim's mother. They all bring kindness to the film, but all do so in their own unique way. "The Basketball Diaries" is a very good film and definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Basketball Diaries is the story of the true experiences of Jim Carroll, underground poet and entertainer, and how he overcame drug addiction to become what he is today. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Carroll. The film is not for the squeamish and it has the best drug withdrawal scenes since Frank Sinatra did Man With The Golden Arm.We first meet Leo with his friends Mark Wahlberg, Patrick McGaw, and James Maddio as a group of delinquent Catholic school kids. They all play basketball and they all are constantly in trouble. DiCaprio is your kid with all the teen angst and self conscious about his lower class status. His mother, Lorraine Bracco, works as a chambermaid in some swank Manhattan hotel and I'm sure she parts with some big bucks to see her kid gets a Catholic school education. There's no father in the picture.But drugs of all kinds are available and the whole group of them get hooked with the exception of McGaw who breaks with his friends. The title is based on the notebook diary writings that DiCaprio keeps. Eventually they're published and Carroll is acclaimed and still today as a writer who speaks to young people today. Leo and the rest of the cast give some terrific performances. It's easy to see why he and Mark Wahlberg became the stars they have with this film. Also Bruno Kirby as the closeted gay basketball coach who misreads DiCaprio's mind and comes on to him is also a standout.The Basketball Diaries hopefully if seen by some of the young will serve as a 'scared straight' guide to saying no to drugs. This film really does show the horrible consequences of a destructive drug habit and the fact it can be beaten and one can live a most useful life.</fullReview>

The film is buoyed by an intense performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is very believable as he descends into a drug-fueled life of crime and self pity. The trouble is that the (MINOR SPOILERS) climax suggests he managed to turn his back on drugs, but how this happened is never shown. That would likely have increased the film's length but also have made it more interesting. Some may also be put off by the perceived anti-gay bias.

		<shortDescription>The Basketball Diaries Plot Summery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the best actors of today. Personally I believe this is one of his best performances, he really brought the story to life with his unbelievable performance as Jim Carroll. The story begins with Jim Carroll (DiCaprio) as a teenage, probably 16 or 17, being woken up by a loud neighbor. Once he is up he begins writing in his journal. He and his friends goof-off, get high and disrupt other people's day. Through out the movie they all get heavier into their drugs. Jim is sexually harassed by his basketball coach, which some would say pushed him farther into his drug addiction. Mickey (Wahlberg) sees that Jim is blowing his writing and basketball career and pulls out from the crowd urging Jim to follow his lead. Jim and his other two friends, Pedro and Mickey, are all expelled from school and kicked out of their houses. You see them going to drastic measures to get the money for the addiction, such as robbing an elderly woman on the streets. In desperation they rob an ice cream bar. Pedro gets caught up in a milkshake, while Neutron finds a gun in the register. Suddenly they friends begin to hear sirens in the distance coming their way, when Pedro won't leave Neutron shoots him, so Jim and Neutron bolt. Jim confronts Neutron about killing their friend, however he shows no remorse. Later Neutron confides in Jim about the best dope he has ever had. However when they try the dope they find it isn't real. Neutron's anger overpowers him and he begins to chase the dealer. Jim quickly follows him, to find that Neutron kept the gun that he shot Pedro with. Jim isn't able to stop Neutron and he pushes the dealer off the roof. Jim is left alone and enters a depressed state. Jim ends up passed out in the snow only to be found by an African-American man, Reggie, that he used to play basketball with. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) takes him into his house and takes away his drugs. Reggie keeps Jim in his house hoping to kill his addiction. In the next scenes you see some disturbing images of a Jim rolling on the floor rolling around screaming and crying with blood shot eyes. When Jim finally escapes he wanders around for a while begging for money, running into a prostitute that he and his friends used to make fun of. He finally turns to his mother who, locks her son out of the house and begins crying and calls the police, knowing she really is trying to help him. The next scene answers all questions about his friends. You find out Mickey joined the NBA to pursue his basketball dreams, Neutron was tried as an adult for pushing the dealer off the roof and is in jail, Pedro had just gotten out of Juvenile Hall and offers Jim the finest dope ever. Jim declines, but offers Pedro to come check out what he is about to do. The final scene begins with the camera going around Jim, while he is talking about his experience with drugs. When the camera angle is showing the back of his head you see an audience that stands up applauding. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Even though it is a low budget movie the acting, directing, and story line makes up for it. I highly recommend this movie, however I suggest you take into consideration the rating because of the gravity of the subject and Leonardo DiCaprio's incredibly memorable performance as Jim Carroll</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Basketball Diaries - Addictive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is set in New York city, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg in a stereotypical group of young lads up to no good. As the film goes on we see that this group begin to derail and seem to make more and more bad choices. Jim played by Leo documents his journey with use of a diary, which becomes his saviour.This film left such an impact on me. I think Scott Kalvert did an incredible job in making such a realistic film about drug addiction. It is so horrible to watch teenagers getting sucked into a trap so deep it seems impossible to escape. This film also shows the effects that drug abuse has on family and friends. For example you see Jim's mother, trying desperately, even praying for her son. She is some kind of saint for Jim, this is shown with her super imposed with a painting of Mary, and in the end she is his saviour which is a beautiful shot. You also see his friend Reggie trying to get him clean, though sadly like all addicts you can't quit until you want to quitThis film is so heartbreaking. It strongly addresses the problem with drugs, and how easily it is for teenagers to become involved with them. It also addresses problems in education and with child abuse. Though its such an amazing film, I can't stress how much you should watch it. I think anyone with a drug history will be deeply impacted by this film; I couldn't stop watching from the minute it started until the end, i feel this film has changed my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of DiCaprio, so I watched this movie with great expectations. It was slightly disappointing.This is a propaganda film, not from the better kind. As my summary said, it was more like Mr. Mackeys speech against drugs from South Park. The main character plays in a basketball team, wanting to be a professional, but as he starts to take drugs, he loses his career, his friends, even his family. That kinda sums it up.I'm a 16 year old teenager, and it's clear that this movie targets my age group by its message. The book was much better in my opinion, because that had an impact on me(I read it after the movie). It has a moralist, preachy message, which is very weak. It didn't make me feel disgusted by drugs. I think Requiem for a Dream is a much, much better film to show teenagers what the consequences of taking drugs are. However, it wasn't very bad. There was one scene, which captures the books atmosphere quite good. The acting was solid, especially DiCaprio, who's as good as always, and the soundtrack is also alright.</fullReview>

He's the brash leader of his friends Pedro (James Madio), Neutron (Patrick McGaw) and Mickey (Mark Wahlberg) sniffing glue and causing trouble. They play winning basketball for their lecherous coach Swifty (Bruno Kirby). His best friend Bobby (Michael Imperioli) is dying of leukemia. He plays neighborhood ball with Reggie (Ernie Hudson). He starts to do cocaine and then heroin which sends him down a very dark road.The movie seems to take place in both the present day and somewhere in th 60s. That conflict along with the poetic diary entries create a surreal dreamlike feel. It takes the tension out of the movie and limits the immediacy. Leo and everybody do a good job. Leo's star power shines and keeps the movie interesting. However, I just don't feel a sense of danger from this dark coming-of-age movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film adaptation of street tough Jim Carroll's epistle about his kaleidoscopic free fall into the harrowing world of drug addiction. As a member of a seemingly unbeatable high school basketball squad, Jim's life centers around the basketball court and the court becomes a metaphor for the world in his mind. A best friend who is dying of leukemia, a coach ("Swifty") who takes unacceptable liberties with the boys on his team, teenage sexual angst, and an unhealthy appetite for heroin -- all of these begin to encroach on young Jim's dream of becoming a basketball star. Soon, the dark streets of New York become a refuge from his mother's mounting concern for her son. He can't go home and his only escape from the reality of the streets is heroin for which he steals, robs and prostitutes himself. Only with the help of Reggie, an older neighborhood friend with whom Jim "picked up a game" now and then, is he able to begin the long journey back to sanity. Roger Ebert wrote "DiCaprio ("What's Eating Gilbert Grape?") does what he can with the part but is miscast, I think, as the hard-boiled hero. Ernie Hudson is strong as the ex- junkie, and there is real emotion in Lorraine Bracco's underwritten mother. Oh, and Juliette Lewis, as a scuzzy hooker, once again finds an absolutely authentic note. But the movie is unconvincing. At the end, Jim is seen going in through a "stage door," and then we hear him telling the story of his descent and recovery. We can't tell if this is supposed to be genuine testimony or a performance. That's the problem with the whole movie." Basketball Diaries is pretty powerful but it is no Requiem for a Dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oddly enough I saw 'The Basketball Diaries' the day after seeing 'Bad Lieutenant'. Both are stories of men out of control on drugs. But 'Lieutenant' was more realistic, it presented a downward spiral of drugs without all the tired plot baggage that weighs this movie down.Leonardo DiCaprio is miscast as Jim, a basketball star at a St. Vitus High School whose heroin addiction threatens to become his life. He drops out of school, his mother throws him out, he begin prostituting himself and he refuses contact with anyone who sees that he has a problem No cliché is spared here: Jim gets help from a former junkie (Ernie Hudson) who doesn't want him to throw his life away. He watches as his former friend become successful on the basketball court and there is the inevitable scene where he goes to his mother begging for money. Adults in this film fall into three categories: Sinner, saint and fed up.This is hard-hitting stuff but we've seen it all before. The plot and the characters are cardboard cut-outs from every afternoon special ever made. It's a familiar road, we know the signs, we know the speedbumps and we know the destination.Rating: ** (of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't awful, but it isn't that good either. I agree with most people who said this is probably one of Leo's best performance. But the movie itself has lots of flaws. First off, the screenplay sucks. I didn't sympathize with the main character at all. The movie tries to tell you that if you do drugs you could as well be throwing your future away, but truth is, the kids in this movie have been throwing their future away before they even do drugs.And what's with one of their friends' sudden change of behavior? Out of a sudden he's telling his friends not to do drugs? What's the reason? And what's with the scene where Jim begs Diane for money? Now Diane's suddenly clean and sober? How?Actually, Leo's performance is the ONLY thing that makes this movie worth watching. Everything else about it sucks (well, pretty much).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vivid look at the life of a young drug addict, DiCaprio is unforgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about Jim Carroll going into this one. But this movie vividly depicts him, and it stuck with me after it was over. It's unabashedly unpleasant, but extremely effective. There are many controversial moments in this film. Jim (DiCaprio) gets spanked with a paddle by a Father. There is a storyline where Jim's basketball coach happens to be gay, and hits on Jim (Brilliantly played by Bruno Kirby) an old lady gets mugged and beaten up, there are many vivid dream sequences that are quite violent, and more. It definitely pushes the envelope. Jim isn't exactly entirely sympathetic here. He does some questionable things to say the least, that made me shake my head, but you can't help but feel sympathy when he succumbs to major drug use. I wanted to jump into the screen and help him many times. As great and powerful as this movie is, this movie belongs to Leo DiCaprio. His incredible showcase here had me in awe. I didn't feel he was an actor playing Jim Carroll, It felt like he WAS Jim Carroll. He looked and acted like a drug addict. This is Leo's movie, despite a very capable supporting cast, and he nails it with perfection. Leo's withdrawal scenes gave me chills, and it's something I'll never forget. It's no surprise as to why Leo is one of Hollywood's best actors, going today. Lorraine Braco is excellent as the torn Mom. She doesn't have a ton of screen time, but she plays a pivotal part. Her scenes with Leo are very good. Mark Whlaberg plays a scumbag to a T. I hated him, and I'm sure you will too. It was a great performance. Juliette Lewis has a small part as a hooker, and Jim Caroll himself has a small role as a drug dealer. Basketball Diaries does have somewhat of a happy ending. After all the turmoil I went through in this movie, it was nice to be relieved with something heartwarmingFinal Thoughts: This is a movie that will be entrenched in my mind for some time. Make sure you're in the right frame of mind if you decide to view this. It's an extremely bleak experience, but well worth it. It's a must see. You won't find many performances that can match Leo DiCaprio's in Basketball Diaries9.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film recently with my girlfriend and several friends having not seen it since around the time when it first came out. I remember at the time thinking how powerful a performance Leonardo Dicaprio gave of Jim Carrol's real life character. The performance was so good I remember at the time telling friends who had recently seen Titanic, that they will be shocked by this performance as it proved he is one of the most versatile actors in cinema today and then. Over the years I have told people I have met, you need to see this movie but not many have and it seems to have sneaked under the radar a little. Therefore when It was on television recently I made everyone watch this film. Everyone who did came back to me saying the same thing, 'wasn't leo good in it'!! The scenes involving Carrol begging his mother to let him into the apartment so he can ask for money to help feed his drug habit are shockingly powerful.Its an amazing portrayal of the dangers of drug addiction and how it can effect young people who dabble with the dangers so quickly, turning their lives on its head with out them realising how it even happened. some strong messages in this film that many teenagers need to watch.Having watched it again some years later, It has dated slightly in time but not only Leo is outstanding but Mark Whalberg shows that he too was showing potential back then 15 years ago or so. I have never been too sure of Whalberg in the past sometimes mixing natural acting ability in movies such as 'the fighter' or his interesting performance of the character police detective 'dignam' in the departed with shocking performances such as 'the happening or Planet of the Apes (where to be honest I don't blame him but the directors for poor casting). But Wharlberg in this movie shows genuine class, perhaps portraying a young man who had an adolecence pretty similar to his diaries character 'mickey'.on a whole the film is a class act and hidden gem. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie but a terrible adaptation of the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS AHEAD ABOUT BOOK AND MOVIELike many others I saw the movie first and thought it was fantastic. DiCaprio is always great but this is a movie that proves he was amazing from such a young age. The scene of him outside the front door of his mother's apartment at the end is heartbreaking. That said, I quickly read the book and reread it many times over the years and it's taken a great deal of the shine off of the movie. There's an obvious need to form a coherent story out of diary entries: the multitude of characters in the book are merged into the main characters in the film and I get that. But many elements of the film were created just to embellish the story, when the book has everything the film would need:1. He was not expelled from school in real life, and graduated. 2. Ernie Hudson's character was completely made up to provide some voice of reason. 3. In the book he was quite nonchalant about hustling, and some of the stories are actually borderline funny. The movie makes it out like it's the end of the world (and it's pretty bad) but he certainly didn't write it that way. 4. He did not get rid of his heroin addiction until he was in his 20s (read "The Downtown Diaries", a great follow up). In hindsight it makes the ending of the movie seem contrived. 5. The time period of the book (early 60s) also plays a big role in the book, especially in how he frequently mentions the threat of atomic war. In all, the film is best if you've never (or don't intend to) read the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again, a movie based on a book having many differences and hiding things because of conservatism (to not say hypocrisy) in our society.Despite that, the movie runs real fast and we enjoy every second of it. DiCaprio performance's here beats Titanic's easily. We are able to collect his disturbed feelings in an unbelievable way, we are able to see how things were in his way of life and what it would feels like if we were in his situation.We are able to see people helping each other with nothing in return, like Roogie did for him. It was an humanistic and unselfish act from Roogie that we should follow in our lives for a better place to live.Not 10/10 because of Hollywood's eternal question involving police.

		<fullReview>What is rock bottom? Everyone has their notion of what rock bottom means, but the general consensus is when your life just can't go any lower. This idea is subjective to the individual so take your own definition of "rock bottom" then multiply it by 10. Now you have the depravity and tragedy of Jim Carroll, the person who The Basketball Diaries is based on. This movie tells the story of Jim Carroll in his teenage years as he deals with rapidly growing drug addiction. It begins with him and his basketball team, one of the most important things in his life. He has some wild friends whose judgment might not be the best, another friend who is dying of leukemia, and a teacher who isn't very fond of him. Regardless, his future still looks promising. But as the story progresses, Jim and his friends sink deeper and deeper into addiction. His life falls to pieces around him as everyone he thought cared about him turn on him one by one. It makes for a depressing and brutal look at real life.The story here is a difficult one that only gets sadder as it progresses. Everything only gets worse and worse, with no uplifting catharsis anywhere along the line. The tone of the film can be represented by a line that slopes downward the entire length. Jim's life stoops to such depressing lows and his drug addiction puts him in situations I could never imagine being in. It is a different kind of life with so few boundaries and rules that he and his friends basically run rampant throughout the streets of New York. I wasn't entirely sure of the directors intentions with this film. I couldn't tell whether I was supposed to sympathize with Jim and his friends or not. The bleak look at this reality makes one feel sympathy and sorrow for these unfortunate characters, yet at the same time everything that happens to them was brought about by their own actions. It is here that I question just how much sympathy I can feel for a group of teenagers with such poor judgment. I can't help but think that they had it coming. But like I said, they live in a different world where their actions are not judged as harshly by the people around them and they must learn for themselves the difference between right and wrong, all through personal experience. It is human nature to make mistakes, and Jim Carroll and his friends make their fair share in The Basketball Diaries. It is a debate that will rage for centuries, but for now I'll have to move on.Looking past the emotional intentions of the film, it is technically well made and merits praise in many areas. The film is gritty and realistic, and the actors do a fine job at portraying these elements. My opinion of Leonardo DiCaprio has changed over the years. When he entered the Hollywood scene he was quickly type-casted as the romantic prettyboy, fulfilling this stereotype in films such as Titanic (1997) and Romeo + Juliet (1996). As he has grown older and matured, I have gained much more respect for him. His recent roles like Martin Scorsese's pictures The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2010) both amazed me. His most recent role in Inception (2010) was also exceptional. The Basketball Diaries was released in 1996, during his prettyboy phase. Yet this one stands out and he plays a much different character. In this film we see DiCaprio in a much different light than Titanic or Romeo + Juliet when we watch snot run down his face with tears in his eyes as he begs and begs for drugs. He fits the role very well, and it is almost because of his prettyboy reputation that it is so tragic to see him stoop so low. The supporting cast does a great job here as well, such as the flamboyantly angry Mark Wahlberg (Three Kings, Boogie Nights) filling his ever aggravated typecast role. The direction stands out in some scenes more than others but it is very good nonetheless. There are some odd dream sequences that break the flow of the film, yet I never found myself losing touch with it or getting overly distracted. There's nothing that truly holds The Basketball Diaries back from being a fine film.This movie provides a harsh look into reality, so be prepared to have one mans depression beat into you with one harrowing scene after another. The Basketball Diaries is not delivered without issues, but it is a well made and well acted film with its fair share of gritty insight into reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>does what it needs to do- tell us a mostly tragic and sometimes inspirational story- with talent and verve</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Basketball Diaries is a film that has a little bit of poetry in the midst of a sea of reflection. It's Jim Carroll's story of how he grew up in high school among a love for basketball and heroin, and poetry when he could. He had talents, but the film's goal is to show that someone who is smart and bright and outgoing can destroy themselves, and when given the right dramatic heft and actor presence it can rise above possible After-School Special trappings. Basketball Diaries helped launch a couple of careers, and give a few good ones a little more room to work, and it doesn't spare characters who went into oblivion either by death or overdose or jail.I think what works for me seeing the film again- it had been years before and only in small chunks, remembering a song here (The Doors' "Riders on the Storm" in staggering slow-motion as the guys on downers fumble a game) or a performance there (Mark Wahlberg in his first serious dramatic performance as Jim's scuzzy friend Mickey)- is the attitude and the dedication to the artistry behind the message. It could be a self-serious portrait, or just too exploitive, but the filmmaker finds a good middle-ground to work with. We know early on what makes Jim so depressed and anxious, the death of a close friend (to cancer, played in a few really remarkable scenes by Michael Imperioli), and the only significant fault is to see how quickly Jim jumps from that death to drugs. The film, if anything, could be a little longer.But seeing how DiCaprio pulls off Carroll is one of the thrills of the picture. It's not always easy to get into the state of a drug-addled youth, and as Jim he gets deep into what makes him clever and resourceful and how his own worst enemy overtakes him. I'm reminded of The Panic in Needle Park, where we get to see a whole sort of degraded sub-culture that looks too low for the main characters, at first, and then becomes their entire world. Again, other New York actors get to shine in spots (Lorraine Bracco gets her spotlight as she kicks Jim out of her house, and Bruno Kirby gets a weird supporting role as the Coach on the team with something to hide), and the film gets in some rather dark humor in a few spots such as a hyped-up basketball game played at night in the rain and put to Carroll's own band's song ("Die Die!"). Yet I kept coming back to DiCaprio, his star power and magnetism, and how he commanded the film in both Jim's high points and deep dark lows.So, you can watch it for the message, which is fairly cut and dry and deep down isn't very deep, or you can watch it for its craft and its attempt to rise above itself to be about a place and state of mind, real people affected by addiction and betrayal and despair. Certainly it has one of the best "coming off of junk" scenes with a small part for Ernie Hudson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see, if only for Dicaprio's powerful, intense and truly haunting performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At just 19 years of age Leonardo Dicaprio gives undoubtedly one of the best performances i have ever seen, no matter how the overall film turned out (which was rather good) this film merits a watch just for this incredible piece of acting. "The Basketball Diaries" based on Jim Caroll's autobiographical novel tells the harrowing tale of a young teen Jim (Dicaprio) and his transition from star basketball player to desperate heroin addict. Here is a film so raw and wrenching that it makes for very hard viewing, showing with unflinching realism the effects such a drug will have and indeed the lengths it will push it's users. How Dicaprio was not awarded an Oscar for his performance here is truly a mystery. Very rarely does an actor so young give such a devastating portrayal. Dicaprio is so believable, his acting so natural it gets to a point where it's hard to believe he was not an actual heroin addict.In two particularly well acted scenes Dicaprio's desperation becomes almost too hard to bear. The first involves a "withdrawal" sequence in which he pleas for a hit, moaning ("It hurts, I just want a taste!'') over and over as he sobs and screams. Never have i seen an actor radiate so much intense desperation. The second involves another desperate but equally as brilliant acted scene. Here he is forced to beg his own mother for money. Moving from tearful, frantic pleas to fits of rage and finally endless deep sobbing, Dicaprio creates such a sense of agony its impossible not to be shocked at this incredible display of talent.The others actors do a credible job and help the film flow: the music is fitting, the script is good and at times even profound. My only issue with this film was that it felt a bit too preachy.....to in your face with its anti drug message, however staying that it sure achieves it, i doubt anyone would pick up heroin after watching this.An unsettling, disturbing "junkie" film with a mind-blowing performance from Dicaprio 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the novel that this is based upon. It wasn't intentional that I watched this so soon after seeing Shutter Island. This is a very grim and realistic look at drug use. The pace is energetic, much like the youth, and later slows down, but there is not a boring or unengaging moment to be found in this. This utilizes a somewhat loose cinematography, and it helps to make this all feel spontaneous and less like a linear progression of events. The editing is great. This has marvelous acting, from DiCaprio, Hudson, Wahlberg, Bracco, and so forth. The characters are credible, well-developed and distinguish themselves. I would point out that Juliette Lewis is not in this an awful lot(which is not to say that she isn't excellent when she does appear), and yet her name was on the cover of my copy. Not sure why they felt they needed to sell it further, and why they wouldn't use the aforementioned talents in the cast. This is quite disgusting at times. There is plenty of strong language and disturbing content and a bit of sexuality(if only a little of it is graphic) in this. I recommend this to anyone who wants a film about narcotics and addiction. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his descent in to drug hell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basketball Diaries as a title conjures up quite a few images, none of them quite in tune with what this film is actually about. Jim Carroll loved to write and kept a journal of his life as it spiralled out of control, part of a group of Catholic lads who formed the school's basketball team, three of whom rebelled to such a degree it destroyed their futures, this is Jim's story. It's a harsh picture at times, but to me it never quite breaks free from a Hollywood sheen, with the reality being that if it didn't star Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Wahlberg, it would have largely been run of the mill stuff. Both actors do good work here, with DiCaprio hinting at the great ability that was to come. His transformation from jovial school prankster to self destroyed sap lifts the film way above the ordinary. As Carroll's mother, Lorraine Bracco is badly under written, and the always reliable Bruno Kirby does fine with what he is given. Juliet Lewis pops in and out as a sort of moral warning character, while Ernie Hudson {in perhaps the films critical role} sadly suffers purely because the mentor character has become hackneyed over the years.It's a good film, but after waiting for such a long time for it to be adapted to the screen, the final result falls somewhere in between twee and impacting. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But it does.The Basketball Diaries was one of those movies that came along out of nowhere and completely exceeded my expectations. I did not know much about it to begin with, so I went in watching with an open mind, and from the beginning of the movie I was kind of doubting watching it, because I felt as if it would be boring and uninteresting. However, this was ever so ridiculous of me. It turned out to be a spectacular film, so I believe, and one that is often unfairly disregarded.The movie picked up pace after a while of minor character development and plot structure, all it needed at least, and once it gets into that actual story line, I could not help but get sucked into the movie. The director, Scott Kalvert, does some fine jobs with shots in the movie. Some scenes are very well filmed angle-wise and give off the sense of actually being there and witnessing the event to the viewer. The cast are all great, but there are not any stand out performances from anyone, which may be a minus to any viewer looking for a strong, upfront depiction.It is a really entertaining and roughly true movie. The plot: it's disgustingly seductive, and painfully enjoyable, if that makes any sense to you. I could not help but keep my wide-open eyes on the screen at all times. Sure, it's not completely enthralling, but for some reason that I find hard to explain, it's very mesmerizing. I don't know if it was what I said about how some of the scenes are filmed, the plot itself or the boyishly handsome Leonardo DiCaprio, who by the way gives the best performance, but in the end, The Basketball Diaries was a really great film with a really wonderful plot, great acting and a few amount of tasteful and suspenseful scenes. It was overall very entertaining, well done and well worth the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have this uncanny love for dark and disturbing movies and had my eye long on 'The Basketball Diaries'. So finally watched it last weekend. This is Leonardo Di Caprio's one of the early movie and the most under rated one in terms of the performance."The Basketball Diaries" is a lurid and uncompromising study of how drug addiction can destroy lives. The film has been ignored or underrated because many people would find it unwatchable. The protagonist's decline into the lowest of society could hardly be made more graphic. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jim Carroll, a Catholic high school student and basketball star. He is also a would-be poet, scribbling essays in a journal that he jealously guards. Jim's risk-taking, anti-social behavior and drug abuse soon leads to the destruction of his life. Quitting school and leaving home, he turns to hard-core criminal acts to get money for his next fix. He has little understanding of his situation, no desire to overcome his habits, and the only question is will he end up in prison or in a morgue.Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is downright jaw-dropping. Words can really not do justice to the work that he does in this film. His tortured, honest and stunningly natural portrayal is in the same caliber as James Dean of yesteryears. He doesn't act according to the page. He pulls his deepest emotions out and spatters them across the screen, providing us with scenes that will shake us up and lead us to feel Jim's pain. Not only is the representation of drug addiction perfectly depicted, but the emotional complexity of the character as well. We see this young man for what he is ? tormented, hopelessly confused and fiercely searching for answers that he will never be given.If you have the stomach for this sort of movie, you will be rewarded. There are many outstanding scenes, such as Jim attempting to cheer up friend and leukemia patient Bobby, and Jim trying to play basketball while on downers.Perhaps the scene most difficult to get through has Jim pleading to his mother (Lorraine Bracco) to give him money for a fix. His mother has locked the door on him, unable to trust her own son, and sobs uncontrollably over what he has become.An uncompromising script and a solid performance from Leonardo Di Caprio help make 'The Basketball Diaries' a powerful and memorable film experience</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor because of the range of characters that he plays. In this movie he plays a teenager named Jim in a catholic school who longs to be a writer and a basketball star. After a friends death, his grief overwhelms him and he turns to harder drugs such as heroin. The acting in the movie is what really makes the movie as Jim narrates from his diary and does drugs. He goes to some pretty harsh extremes to get a fix. Then there is the withdraw scene which is so well acted that no one can compete with it. With some help from a basketball mentor who saved his life to some time in the clink, Jim is going to be his old self again. This is an amazing movie and it's based on real life so I let it be an inspiration to me sometimes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not big a Leonardo DiCaprio fan, actually I don't usually watch his movies but this movie is an exception. I think this is the best his role to date. This movie will keep interested to the end. Althau there are some unpleasant scenes. The first half of a movie was about Jim Carroll's first drug experiences, the second half was mainly about how he is slowly killing himself and there were a lot of unpleasant scenes. What is good about this film is that there were shown how do people become a drug addicts(the first times usually come from curiosity and curiosity is one of humans main feature, so it's pretty natural, but some people stop after they satisfy their curiosity, some don't usually because they have trouble in their personal life and it's easier to ignore those problems this way). There should be more those kind of movies because you can learn a lot from them. People don't start doing drugs because their life is so wonderful so if you want to fight drugs you have to deal the reasons why people start doing drugs. And the addicts can't be blamed for that because society made them this way. Everyone is addicted to something and the only difference is that some addictions are acceptable for society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Basketball Diaries is a competent, but faulted film.

As Basketball players their futures seem promising but they slowly decent into a life of sex and crime, ending up getting kicked out of there homes and out of school. They are forced to live on the streets of 1970s New York and hit rock bottom.The film is well made, and DiCaprio does give a good performance. I think it was a well directed film, really showing how bleck New York was and how bad drugs are. The film reminds of films like Thirteen, Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream. However, my criticism of the film is there is no sympathetic character in film, and therefore, you don't truly sorry for any of them. This wasn't the case in the other films I mention.The Basketball Diaries is worth watching, but you don't have to knock-yourself out to see it.</fullReview>

It's about young men messing around, their bonds and friendship. Leonardo DiCaprio is really amazing as a drug addict. His withdrawal scenes in the black guy's home deserve to be honoured. His performance is so real and so heartbreaking. It brings out the message of the scary side of drug addiction.The plot is also very touching. It concentrates on "how low can one get". Every time Leonardo DiCaprio gets more dehumanised, I get even sadder. The ending plea through the door is heartbreaking. Yes it is a film, but it is based on so many true stories around the world.It's a film that connects with and impacts the viewers for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So High yet so low</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I could only wish that I saw this movie before I knew who Leonardo DiCaprio was. The basketball diaries is one movie that could really shake you up and the fact that it is based on a real person really makes you believe in it, the screenplay and tremendous acting helps too. The fact that I have seen this movie so late makes it much easier to absorb, but I know for fact that it is one of the best performances I have seen from either Leonardo DiCaprio or Mark Whalberg.The movie is a must watch and for a person who can relate to it, it has a totally new meaning. The movie also focuses on the how relationships, be it parental or friendship work in such situations. I can't say that it's really going to make a difference in my or anyone else's life but this movie is going to drag you back to itself time and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cold turkey has got me on the run!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only this film features a young (and thoroughly excellent) Leonardo Di Caprio,but it also casts Mark Wahlberg as pal Mickey and Juliette Lewis as a prostitute junkie ."Basketball diaries" is exactly what the title reads:it's the youth memoirs of singer/songwriter/poet Jim Caroll,as a voice over tells us what he writes day in day out.A catholic education (hasn't Caroll made an album which has got that title?"Catholic Boy" ?) with sadistic priests who beat their students in a way I'd hardly call anachronistic ,hypocrit confessions,and of course the sport as the perfect alienation tool.Such a stifling milieu quickly begins to fragment at the edges: the death of a friend ,the discovery that the coach "Swifty" 's dream is to s...off in the showers and the ghetto in which he lives in leads Jim to despair thus to drugs.It's a long day's journey into night and Di Caprio's sufferings when he goes cold turkey are so realistic,so intense they are almost unbearable.More a chronicle than a biography,"Basketball diaries" is a movie Di Caprio can be proud of.And I'd add that it's not a reason to dismiss "Titanic"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent- a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think this movie is a must- see for any teenager. I just recently saw it, and it had such an impact on me. Even though I've never had any personal experience with drugs, I felt the film was an excellent representation of life as a drug addict. Every aspect of DiCaprio's performance was believable, from his withdrawal scene, to the scene at the end with his mother. I disagree with anyone who says this scene was melodramatic; I thought it was the complete opposite. DiCaprio did not hold back at all during this film; he was a big reason why I loved this movie so much. There was nothing about this film I didn't like; I was mesmerized. It has left me thinking and contemplating over it for several days now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fine film walks a fine line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many films that claim to be "anti-drugs" messages, while their intentions are good, end up being the exact opposite. While no film can really impress on an audience the horror that is a heroin addiction, this film is probably the closest thing I've seen. It comes dangerously close in parts to crossing the line from "anti" to "pro", but never does in my opinion.My feelings on Leo are mixed. He's got talent, but he's been in some truly awful films. If you ever need to convince someone of his acting talents though, don't show them the scene where he confronts his mother at the apartment door. Show them the one in "Winky and Blinky's" apartment, where he goes to the medicine cabinet and takes an assortment of drugs, then looks straight into the camera. Might not look it but that's an incredibly hard thing to do, a straight-to-camera look with no dialogue. It's just one example of the awesome performance he gives in this film (without even realising it, it seems like) Only slight niggle i have is the ending. It wrapped up too quickly and cleanly. After all those years of degradation it comes across as him getting over it all very quickly, which doesn't happen with heroin. I guess they had to jump ahead in time for the film though. Having seen the film I want to read the book, but its been out of print for some time. Might have to check out second-hand bookshops or Amazon or something...anyway, awesome movie, added to my collection, will watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Basketball Diaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Leonardo DiCaprio's early movies and he is really great in this one. Often people forget, that there also was a pre-"Titanic"-DiCaprio when they discuss his acting skills. In director Scott Kalvert's "The Basketball Diaries" he plays Jim Carroll, who attends a catholic school in New York. But you soon will notice, that in real it is a movie about drug addiction and the big danger this is for teenagers. Around the turn of the millennium we have seen some great films that deal with drug addiction and I think this one was one of the forerunners, because in it's style it reminded me on the films of Darren Aronofsky and Paul Thomas Anderson, at least in a few scenes. What "The Basketball Diaries" shows best of all recent drug movies is how a young person gets into drug addiction in passing. Some characters in this film may be clichéd, but in the end, it's a real jewel of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Di Caprio was an innocent poignant teenager</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leonardo Dicaprio had a tremendous potential when he was still a teenager or so. He had the physique of his age. He had the style of his age. He had the flexibility and obvious lack of selfconsciousness typical of his age. And he finds himself in this story, true or not does not matter at all, in one inspiring tale that seems to be a personal tale. He lives his story so strongly, so intensely that he really takes us into the story and makes us feel the horror of his trip down into the hell of the syringe, of the shot, of the nosejob, and eventually of some blowjob to finance the trip itself. And he had a potential in the film too as a basketball player. But somewhere along the way he met bad company in the street. Somewhere along the way on some New York sidewalk he lost his best friend, his basketball hero to, leukemia.Somewhere between here and there he lost track of his body, of his muscles, of his basketball potential, of his desire to be on the top, of his loving mother that he started betraying like in a dark blind sunless and lightless alley. Drugs transform your life into some kind of unravelling piece of cloth lost in the rainstorm or snowstorm of a bad season, be it cold or be it warm, it does not matter because you only hope to enjoy and die when high in your trance. Maybe the best scene is when he goes cold turkey at Reggie's home or when he begs at his mother's door. But like all teenagers, he will have to grow out of it and into a new phase, whereas the other members of his gang will not. The end of the film is so sad in a way because he is growing up but he has lost his innocence, or if you prefer his innocent guilt, and now he is going to carry and wear his fake because guilty adult innocence that is going to hide what he was, what he has done, what he nostalgically remembers and will remember for the rest of his life. And that is when Leonardo Dicaprio becomes a little bit cold, distant, unreal. We don't feel him so well in this transformation that requires some depth built on the death of something in his mind caused by the death of something and someone, and maybe many someones, outside in the wide wild world. We feel so sorry he did not find his way to adulthood depth, except in his eyes. Don't you ever look at him straight in the eyes. You may then fall in some mental abyss. His eyes, man, his steel sharp daggers of two eyes are what is going to grow of age fastest and deepest.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine &amp; University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cult movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually looked this film up on wikipedia.com, and discovered that they classify it as a CULT FILM, meaning it is only accepted by a select group of fans. Something is tremendously wrong with American cinema, to the point where I am disgusted.So thats how it works. A BRILLIANT film like Basketball Diaries is released and it gains little to no fame while pathetic productions like Lost in Translation receive Academy Award nominations. It is quite obvious Americans are too sensitive to accept topics like drug abuse, while the country is literally drowning in addiction.An average rating of 6.8? Please, lets be realistic. I gave it a straightforward ten, something I am reluctant to do often. Leonardo DiCaprio is phenomenal in every aspect of the movie, especially at the end when his mother rejects his desperate attempts for money. Call me crazy, and you will, he performs better than he did in Titanic. Meanwhile, the incorporation of Jim Carroll's poetry creates a certain attachment with the character in the movie. I rank this movie among my Top Three while my friends are unaware of its existence.So, all in all, I guess that is how it works in our great country. Americans rather see a movie that makes them smile or where the underdogs always win. No wonder our country is mocked so frequently.As a sixteen year old in the suburbs, I have been dramatically impacted by The Basketball Diaries, and intend to read the book.</fullReview>

My first movie I seen with Leo was What's Eating Gilbert Grape? He was excellent in that movie, I couldn't believe he was able to act that good at such a young age. Everyone that was in the movie and played along side Leo did a great job, Mark, always love your work especially in your underwear. Lorraine, loved you in Natural Born Killers too,real trippen movie, and Patrick, even Bruno who played the sick coach, that seen really bothered me, Leo does not do well with gays, but I honestly can't blame the coach for trying, right?

		<shortDescription>Leonardo DiCaprio's best performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an amazing film and in my opinion should be shown to every person of school age to show them the reality of taking hard drugs. In this true story, DiCaprio plays Jim Carroll, a teenager with a promising future as a Basketball Player in front of him. He and his friends take uppers etc for fun, but this soon develops into more serious drug addictions after he and 2 of his friends are thrown off the team when they are caught out one day.This film really shows the harsh side of drug-taking and that what may start out as a few pills and poppers, can lead to a more destructive path. Mark Wahlberg puts in an excellent performance as Jim's friend and I can honestly say I don't think there is a single cast member who lets this film down.An honest depiction of drug taking and it's not so glamorous side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If there ever was an inspirational anti-drug film.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Basketball Diaries, originally a autobiographical 1978 novel written by Jim Carroll, chronicles the life of a teenage heroin addict. Jim Carroll, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a catholic schoolboy who gets in over his head with drugs, and does not look back. The film itself is great, and the screenplay adaption seems to not miss a beat. This film marks the beginning of a new generations of very talented actors. Mark Wahlberg, Julliette Lewis, and DiCaprio himself all proved that they could handle mature, complicated roles like these. The directing was also on par with the acting lending to the story almost like an actor in itself. The appropriate cinematography brings the viewer closer to the type of life that Carroll and his friends lead through the grimy streets of the Manhattan underworld. It is a shame that Scott Kalvert used this film to show the peak of his talent, instead of as a launching point to his career. He has offered us "Dueces Wild" following this extremely brave and well polished effort, which is sub-par if respectable at all. Overall this film does get its point across very well, never being too preachy or overbearing with its message. This film should be a pre-requisite for anyone entering high school.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember that when the Columbine shootings happened, some people blamed "The Basketball Diaries". When I saw the movie, I couldn't understand the connection at all. True, there's a school shooting scene, but focusing only on that misses the movie's point. The movie is the true story of New York teenager Jim Carroll (Leonardo DiCaprio) and how he descended into the ugly world of drug addiction. If you're squeamish, then I should warn you that there are some pretty nasty scenes of drug addiction and what happens.Yes, it's ugly what happens, but that's what makes the movie so good: they're not afraid to get down and dirty. Also starring are Lorraine Bracco as Jim's mother, Mark Wahlberg as Jim's friend, Bruno Kirby as the high school coach, Juliette Lewis as an acquaintance, and Ernie Hudson as a man who saves Jim from dying out in the cold.Like I said, this is not a movie for the fainthearted. But otherwise, I truly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Leonardo di Caprio had not already made this film, he would be cast immediately for the role of lifetime. Leo's performance as the lanky, audacious, and attitude-heavy high school star basketball player is a descent to heroin-hell with the story of author, Jim Carroll. It can only be described as a superb performance. As often as di Caprio is cited for his Titanic performance, it is "Basketball Diaries" that showcase his earlier star quality in a resume of fine, solid performance. With cameras in streets of lower Manhattan, the junkie life of a street urchin is neither fun nor games, it is pathos and crime. Teenies who flock to the di Caprio film library should see "Basketball Diaries" as a point of information. When the glamor and veneer of heroin and cocaine wear off, what is left is Jim frothing at the mouth, twisting, and screaming in pain as he undergoes a cold turkey rehabilitation program by his friend, Ernie Hudson. Additional violence in a fantasy sequence has Jim with shotgun in hand killing a class room of students from his high school and the priest teacher may be the source of "Jeremy" but it is perhaps too problematic for younger audiences and sensitive adults.In a too brief cameo appearance, the author recites poetry of haiku grace about his own speeding raps and heroin nods in memories of Catholic ceremony, a chilling monologue filled with irony as the real Jim Carroll is cooking up to fix while he speaks to di Caprio as a younger version of himself. These fine performances from the young supporting cast include thuggish "Marky" Mark Walberg, and Soprano regulars, Michael Imperiolli, Max Cassella, and a heart wrenching performance by Lorraine Bracco as Jim's mother who can do nothing for her son but call the police on him. Each makes "Basketball Diaries" worthy of everyone's attention with this hard perspective on the glamorous 'game' of heroin chic.</fullReview>

She also had Leo's movies like Titanic, Romeo+Julie etc. and I thought DiCaprio was nothing but a pretty face. But now it seemed he really could act.I think this movie is in a way like Trainspotting. You almost vomit during the film and are kind of sad after wards. I know I cried an felt sick watching this..If you have seen this film, you probably will not became an addict... This film is very true and shocking. Although Jim Carrol(Leo's character) survives, this movie makes you want to kill the person who invented drugs..

I believe all heavy-drug users MUST see this movie, and its a shame so few people have seen it. Its definitely under-rated and deserves much more recognition. Hell, Leo deserves an Oscar. His performance with his mother was simply AMAZING. and his withdrawal? TOUCHING AND HEART0BREAKING. He is so convincing in his role. I must say this is his best role yet, but him in the Aviator is a close second. I felt sorry for his mother, and thats a situation NO MOTHER would want to be in. I thought the scene with the older man in the bathroom was disturbing, however, the movie WAS based on the book after all. This movie did have a lot of swearing, sexuality and violence so steer clear if you don't think your mature enough. (Im 15 by the way)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leonardo, Ruler of the tortured boys during the early 90s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched the Basketball Diaries for the first time. Although i find, the American public thinks it is cliche to be a Leonardo DiCaprio fan in the year 2004, he gives one of the best drug related performances i have ever seen. Leonardo has the ability to allow himself to be tortured, whether he is born with his tortureness (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), whether he is being tortured by a crazy step father (This Boy's Life) or whether he is torturing himself through the use of heavey drugs (The Basketball Diaries). This ability of torture, lets the audience see the harsh reality of an actual person. The scene in which his mother (Lorraine Bracco), is standing on the opposite side of her apartment door and Jim (Leonardo) is begging for $20.00, is so amazing for two reasons. The first reason is Lorraine Bracco's face when she slightly touches his hand and he begs her to hold it. She is so desperate for any sign of love from her little boy, she is almost willing to give him money for drugs. The second reason is the way Leonardo wines and begs for his "mommy." He wines so well that the wining becomes apart of his character's identity. He's not wining like any old drug addict, he is wining like the child inside THIS drug addict. The acting was brilliant, from everyone. The story lacked a plot, but the lacking of the plot made the characters seem more real because the life of a drug addict, doesn't really have a plot. Everything just falls into where it is. The performances are wonderful, the story is heartbreaking, and there is not one person who doesn't shine during this film. For the record...I am a huge fan of Leonardo's acting skills. He is the epitome of excellence of male acting in the 90s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dicaprio shines...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a huge fan of "pretty boy" types (much like Leonardo Dicaprio) because often times they tend to rely ONLY upon their "good looks" to get them through a movie. Such is not the case with Dicaprio, however, and he proves it in this movie (along with one other performance...What's Eating Gilbert Grape...stupid movie, but fantabulous acting on his part).I won't go into the synapsis, since most know it already, I'm sure. The movie itself is a pretty interesting view into the world of drugs and their ultimate impact on a young person's life. Do not be fooled, though, by any mention of this being the story of Jim Carroll's life or even a factual account of his Basketball Diaries. Sure, there are some similarities, but overall, the director took a lot of artistic liberties with this movie. Regardless, The Basketball Diaries is still a realistic representation of "street kids" and drug use.The movie can be boring at times, but Dicaprio draws you in nevertheless and inspires you to keep watching. Overall, I believe it's worth it. There are a few especially incredible scenes that are well worth the time in watching the movie. One of which includes the friends basketball-in-the-rain game after the loss of a friend.Most likely, had a less charismatic and talented actor taken on the role of Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining as it was. Thanks to Dicaprio and his ability to fully become his character, the movie has some very redeeming moments. Overall, 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DiCaprio at his best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely the best Leo Di Caprio film to date. The story is about a pop icon named Jim Carrol. I have both of his books and one of the albums he has made. This man is a decent artist in all forms. He teamed up w/Pearl Jam and redid a couple of songs for the movie. And Jim also has a cameo as the guy in the shooting gallery. First, I have to brag on the cast. There is a wonderful ensemble of characters. You have Mark Wahlberg, Ernie Hudson, Lorraine Bracco, and Bruno Kirby. The movie sticks to the book pretty well, except for a few name changes and graphic detail about what he does for money. And it cuts out a lot of the time where he was happy getting stoned on weed and liquor. I have seen this movie over 25 times and it is one of my top 10 films of all time. Some of the antics that the 3 main characters get themselves into are unforgettable. I.E. puking on someones head on the ferry and nodding off on heroin while stealing a car. And then you see a scene where Mark Whalberg's character gets his arm broke and then you see the limp arm falling right after shooting a fix. This is a definite drug movie. You see redemption by Jim, and eventually has a happy ending. But the whole movie is all about the downward spiral and the lows you stoop to to get a fix. Also a cameo by Juliette Lewis. This movie was pulled off of shelves shortly after the Columbine incident, due to the daydream Carrol has about popping a couple of the faculty and students. I would definitely add this one to my collection. I rate this movie 4/5 for all the drug content and superb acting by the cast. I wouldn't miss out on this one folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scene where Jim Carroll shoots up his class got more attention (especially after the Columbine Massacre) than the rest of the film, and it was a dream sequence! Most people know The Basketball Diaries from that sequence alone. Experience this film for your self, it's very well acted by all the characters, Jim's mother probably plays on the most convincing mothers in cinema, as she did in Riding In Cars With Boys. There is an anti-drug commercial featuring the band Everclear on the DVD, but other than at this movie really isn't something that preaches "Don't do drugs 'cuz drugs are bad!" like an after school special but a film that shows what heroin can do to you.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe that Requiem For A Dream is on the top 250 list but this isn't. I never thought this movie would be so incredibly underrated! This was the only movie that made me completely swear off drugs. The characters are so young and vulnerable and you get to see them slowly fall into this world of drugs and violence and be completely swept away. In Requiem For A Dream, the characters start out doing some harder drugs and you barely get to see where everything goes wrong, it just seemed to be like that all of a sudden. The characters aren't as likable and I thought it ended a bit abruptly leaving us no knowledge of what is to become of the characters. I have to give it props though for some brilliant scenes like when they all go into the fetal position at the end.  Basketball Diaries on the other hand gets you involved and attached to the characters. You get to watch them throw away their basketball careers and their lives. The part where Lewis is going through withdrawal is so real and horrible. And after he goes through all that pain, he throws it away and goes straight back to the drugs. This movie is so incredible, I really wish more people would see it and think the same.Shay</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, but read the book too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a powerful movie. The anti drug message isn't preached, as if by teachers, but screamed, by a junkie. This is based on the diary of Jim Carroll, a former high school basketball star shot his future right up his arm. It's disgusting, frightening, depressing, desperate, and a little hopeful.This movie came out before Leo was an international superstar, when he was just another rising young actor. At this time he was starting his rise to the top because, as is showcased in this movie, he possesses unrelenting talent. (Too bad about that big boat movie). This is also an early glimpse of Mark Wahlberg's acting talent.The movie doesn't stick entirely to the book, and that's a shame - it loses power at the end because of that. So, see this movie, and read the book also.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps it's not socially constructive to attempt subtlety in an anti-drug message, but artistically, this movie starts off well and then proceeds to tank. It really lost me with the sort of symbolism I would expect to find in a 12-year old's writing assignment copied from yesterday's soap opera episode (to avoid a spoiler, I will only say - mother, window, can). Some performances were quite good (the mother for example), it looked nice, but all the early complexity of the movie is washed out by the end. Some bad acting and a weak screenplay bring low what could have been a fine movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read some of the comments people wrote about this movie and decided I needed to set the record straight for all you close minded people who gave this movie a bad review. When I saw this movie I was 15, I did not know very much about drugs and the damage it would cause. Besides scaring me enough not to want to do drugs ever, it taught me the damages drugs can do to a person. I am now the ripe old age of 19 and have now seen the results of many drugs first hand . Shame on you people who think this movie was bad. How can you possibly say that unless you have no concept of a truly amazing life story that touches people whether they know everything about drugs or nothing at all. The scenes in the movie show the viewer firsthand what drug abuse is and how it damages lives beyond recognition. I am so disappointed anyone had anything negative to say about this film. Jim Carroll deserves respect and admiration for what he went through and the fact that he pulled himself out of this destructive lifestyle . Bravo to you Jim.</fullReview>

I sure wish that I had seen this movie sooner. It's unique and really well done. I noticed that the user comments are mixed; viewers either hated it or loved it.Basketball Diaries follows Jim Carroll's true-life story as a Catholic high school student from star basketball player to drug addict.Leonardo Di Caprio was excellent playing Jim Carroll. Mark Wahlberg and Ernie Hudson are also very good as supporting actors. If you did not like Di Caprio in Titanic, you should see this movie, he actually does a good job here. I gave this movie a rating of 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

Great acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, and supporting actor Mark Wahlberg. Leonardo starts off as a normal child but with friends and school and his mother, pressure becomes too high. He explodes and acts without thinking. The people who you think will help you when you need it the most never do. People think that they are just invincible and their troubles will just go away.

		<shortDescription>Better junkie movies exist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like Di Caprio's character: it starts with potential but goes downhill as does DiCaprio's performance. While some people may not feel that Catholic High Schools can produce quality athletes, I beg to differ. However I cannot see any school where a skinny kid like DiCaprio would be a starting point guard, Catholic or not. The fact that this movie is set in New York makes it even less believable that Di Caprio has any potential to go to a big time college. For us to believe DiCaprio's fall from stardom, we must 1st believe he was a star which is hard to swallow. While Mark Wahlberg and the other supports do decent jobs, it is equally hard to believe DiCaprio as a drug addict. Many people either loved or hated his performance, I didn't buy it for 1 second. In too many parts such as his begging his mom for money or his desperation for a "fix", DiCaprio seems to be overacting. It makes it hard to sympathize with him when you don't feel he is really an addict. The different spot shots of New York are a nice touch, but all in all this movie feels like an afterschool special that would give DiCaprio the stage all to himself, which it does. He is the movie and when you can't imagine him as a star basketball player or a druggie, the movie fails entirely. I liked that the director didn't overdo the violence or go too far showing the characters do the drugs, this movie could have been better b/c everyday inner city kids experiment with drugs locking in to the cycle, but I can't buy DiCaprio's performance in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gripping drama about life and drug taking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think "The Basketball Diaries" is a realistic and very important movie. It shows the road that Jim Carrol takes being addicted to drugs. It focuses around Leonardo Di Caprio (Jim Carrol) a school kid in downtown New York. It begins showing that he is a very talented writer, and at every occasion he is writing something in his diary.It is a typical story of robbery of stores and street people, just so that he can fund his habbit. You see him and his friends constantly taking drugs, until Jim is kicked out of the Basketball Team for taking drugs. And finally goes too far and is forced to go 'Cold Turkey'.Although this movie is based on a true story, it delivers a powerful statement to young children of his age and older about why it is not a good idea to take drugs.I give this movie a deserved 8 out of 10. Some of the material is unnecessary, but still a gripping drama of a movie, well worth the hard earned cash.This is one movie that you would probably have to watch a second time just to get to grips with the story line, because it is so powerful the first time you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Basketball Diaries" show the teenager life like it is. It's one of the few films that show the real life how it's; with nothing that make you feel good at the end of the film(like the usual "happy ends" in 99% of Hollywood's films).In this film you see a group of teens that start taking drugs when they're very young,and that destroy them lives.That last thing happen every day in the occidental world thousands of times. The reason why teens start taking drugs it's the same that explain why they drink lots of alcohol and have sex with anybody without any protection;they enjoy doing what everybody has said them to be dangerous,why?;for the pleasure of the risk.The only thing that make them feel alive in the "flat" occidental life is that:the risk.If a teen don't feel risk doing something ,he(or she)don't feel alive. That's the reason why is comic for me see "teen" films like "Down to you","American Pie"(it's a comedy ,but it's full of stereotypes),"10 things I hate about you" , and a lot more of them;all the characters are false; hardly 5% of teens are like that ones.Them shows so surrealist things like the usual "girl that want to be virgin until marriage";in the real life ,the girls want to have sex the same than the boys, the only difference is that them (the girls),don't say anything about it(like the boys conversations about sex). This is the real life ,without stereotypes or surrealist things about teens.So,if you want to know something real about teens,see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Basketball Diaries wasn't really my pick-of-choice at the video store a few months back, but I'm glad I picked it up. If I didn't, I would of missed out on one of the most emotionally brutal and powerful movies ever made.This film is based on the true story of drug addict Jim Carrol. Kicking off at Carrol's (Leonardo DiCaprio) high school, the film charts his downward spiral from surly teenager and sometime pill popper to desperate figure who loses almost everything to heroin: his basketball career all but crumbles after his coach (Bruno Kirby) makes a pass at him; his writing dries up; and even his mother (Lorraine Bracco) turns her back on him, providing the catalyst that finally causes him to wake up to himself. Sharing the limelight are Carrol's equally dependent but less gifted gang of friends (headed by Mark Wahlberg), whose playful rebellion turns sour all too quickly, plus an unrecognisable Juliette Lewis as a sleazy streetwalker.The scripting is brilliantly beautiful, it portrays Jim Carroll's rise and fall from heroin perfectly. The direction from Scott Kalvert is so amazing that it manages to actually make you gasp, and the film editing in The Basketball Diaries was also another effective turn. But, the performances here are the most powerful thing about the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jim Carrol with an unforgettable attitude, his acting skill in this film goes so far that is easily one of the bravest and boldest performances in film history!The Basketball Diaries is one of the most underrated movies of the 20th century. If you want to miss out on this masterpiece, then do so, but you'll regret it when you are lying in your grave without The Basketball Diaries on your top 10 list. I rate The Basketball Diaries 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

I like most movies that ends with a moral without being preachy about it, especially against drugs, and this is one of them. By showing how destitute one like Carroll can be when drugs take control of your life, this movie imparts a powerful message about the dangers of drug-taking, and the actions, however disgusting, one would take just to be able to get the drugs needed for the next hit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Basketball Diaries was loaned to my teenage son by a friend of his. I had recently become addicted to Leo due to the Titanic craze I wanted to see everything he had ever done.The story of Jim Carroll, excellently portrayed by DiCaprio, is extremely unsettling and as it has been stated previously on this site, this movie is not for everyone. I was a little disturbed because I was trying to watch Jack Dawson. DiCaprio is a gifted actor and can portray any type of character very well. He does an excellent job in this movie as do his supporting cast members. The movie is important because it is a true story about a problem that really exists, heroine addiction.However, people who are easily offended or extremely sensitive may not be able to watch this film. Also, of course, it is not suitable for children, I would say under 13 or 14, due to the extreme content in the film.</fullReview>

His music is highly rewarding in many ways.. especially lyrically, he's yet another great artist that didn't get his due. The movie is by all counts an accurate portrayal of his life right before getting his recording contract. DiCaprio, sports a credible likeness to Jim Carroll and does a fine job here.

		<fullReview>The basketball diaries is not a movie for everyone.This movie could be considered an unwatchable movie for most people, however, for those who can tolerate this movie, they will find a true gem.This film stars Leo DiCaprio as Jim Carroll, a catholic high-school basketball star who would definitely not fit your definition of a typical catholic schoolboy. Carroll and his group of friends are nothing more than a gang of thugs who do nothing but bad things and this eventually leads him down the path of destruction.Carroll must fend off his overbearing and malicious teacher who seems to get pleasure out of taking the paddle to him in front of the rest of his classmates and his still-in-the-closet basketball coach who propositions him in a matter that had surely been done to others before. Add to this the fact that he recently lost one of his best friends, mis-communication with his mother and the ever so inducing world of drugs that takes him in like so many before.I enjoyed this film because of the great performances by DiCaprio and the supporting cast. Each had a great tone of realism to make the film feel that much more as if it were taking place right in front of you.I would recommend this film to anyone who has become desensitized to overly violent films that have more to prove than just blood and guts. If you didn't like Trainspotting or Reservoir Dogs, this movie isn't for you.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more happening on the court, besides just basketball</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Basketball Diaries, is a harrowing journey, which in it's 102 minute time, we feel we've been to hell and back, it's final scene, where Jim Carrol had finally got his s..t together, reminiscent of the final scene in Stella Does Tricks, where like Jim, she addressed her young audience about her journey, through drugs and prostitution. This is the no holes barred look at the destruction of a man who had a talent for words, and what we've go through with him, is something we're glad we never endured. De Caprio shows us again here, what a brilliantly dramatic actor he is. There were moments he was so real, I was getting goosebumps. But we must give thanks to another great actor in the prime of his career, Underestimated ex Calvin Klein model, Mark Wahlberg. When not having seen the film for years, I forgot just how bloody good he was in this, almost on par with Leo, where as Jim's best friend, Mickey, saw him plummet harder with his drug addiction. Like Leo's, it's an engrossing performance. TBD is not for everyone, especially people easily affected by the drug scene, which as I said before, it's is a frank film on the subject. The dream sequence, that has Leo bursting into a classroom, opening fire on his friends, while letting out a howl of anger, was one of a couple of scenes that earned an R. It's a quite violent and frank scene, be warned. Of course, this notorious scene was the one suspected as the inspiration, or trigger for that very similar classroom shooting, two years later. The film really hones in on the desperation of that need, that fix for drugs, where money sometimes has to be earned in degrading ways. De Caprio fully embraced this role, like he does many others, although the film's well acted by everyone, especially Bracco as Jim's long suffering Mum you really feel for, and wish to hell she could help him, looking many years older than her younger self in Goodfellas. The film which has suffered some scathing reviews, which I myself believe, it could of been better, may'be stretched out to two hours, as to add some more input, to tell this tale of a hellish nightmare, where still like it is the film is bloody effective and poignant. Too, I found the film, besides being confronting, quite an entertaining view, due to Jim and his wild, but mostly funny exploits with his mates, which includes barfing on an innocent passenger below deck on a Statton Island ferry, the after effect of yes: meth sniffing. It good to see these troubled teens beat the odds, where only just learning of the demise of the gaunt faced Carroll, took me by surprise. Very recommended viewing.</fullReview>

Ironic to see is how his friend introducing him to drugs becomes a pro basketball player after choosing for his career instead of drugs. Jim has to make some crucial decisions in a mather of life an death. He has to learn how to trust people again an start to work on his addiction.Its a very interesting movie with outstanding acting of DiCaprio.

		<shortDescription>Another Movie From A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll just cut to the chase. The main problem with "The Basketball Diaries" is that viewers of the film are never certain as to exactly what time period this story takes place. If you have read Jim Carrol's staggering memoirs, "Basketball Diaries," you will know that he was writing his totally drug-drenched 70's and 80's memoirs.This film version doesn't know quite how to play it. There are times when the characters act like 1990's kids, and other scenes that seem to be stuck in the 60's.As the film opens, Jim (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his best friends are getting plastered by sniffing cleaning fluid. What day and age is this? In the next scene, we see Jim and all of his friends getting prepared for a big game. Mark Wahlberg (formerly "Marky Mark") is astonishing as Mickey, Jim's best friend, who provides pills to the team, resulting in a scene that has become a classic...everyone on drugs attempting to play basketball to the tune of The Doors classic "The End." What destroys this film is that the script falls apart early on and the characters leap from one personality to another..from one situation to another...with no development.Tons of futile plot twists and confusing musical decades are packed into this film. Neutron (Patrick MacGaw) seems to be the most sensible of the group. He shouts angrily at the ball team for using drugs, YET.. in the scene JUST BEFORE THIS, Neutron is wearing a ski-mask and helps his friends assault an older lady so that they can get cash for heroin. The editing and art direction are deliriously wrong. Before it's all over, Juliette Lewis shows up as a heroin whore, who becomes pure and clean (with no explanation) and tosses pretzels at Leonardo; Ernie Hudson is a black man who plays basketball with Jim, and later tries to come to the rescue when he declares, "You were frozen in the snow like a goddamn fuge-sicle!" Lorraine Bracco ("The Sopranos") goes nuts in the few scenes that she is in. She's screaming at Leo about the pills she found in his room. Bracco wails, "What are you gonna tell me? That they're VITAMINS???" It all ends with Jim going to prison and learning his lesson. There is nothing really wrong with this movie unless you know the real story. Jim Caroll's stunning memoir, "Basketball Diaries," takes you deep into a harrowing world. This movie just barely scratches the surface.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>proof of Dicaprio's talents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that The Basketball Diaries is great film in terms of performances, i felt in some areas Scott Kalverts direction wasn't necessarily helpful to the film as some of the pace is lost during certain scenes and that he could have gotten greater performances from his actors, Lorraine Bracco proved herself in Scorsese's Goodfellas and i thought her performance became weak and unbelievable in parts. I find sometimes that after Titanic a lot of people under-rate Dicaprio as an actor whereas i feel hiswork in films prior such as, "This Boy's life" "Romeo &amp; Juliette" and of course "The basketball diaries" all confirm that he is an important contempory actor and I predict that in twenty years down the line he will be mentioned in the same breath as De Niro, Pacino and Brando and i am thoroughly looking forward to "The Aviator." Another surprise performance for me was Mark Wahlberg, for some time i have rated him as a good actor and here we see why, he is entirely believable in the film which is surprising because it is early in his acting career. all in all i enjoyed the film but felt that i relied too heavily upon its actors and for me the direction was neither innovative nor fluid enough. cheers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been many movies about drugs among teenagers in the past. But few of them are actually good. At first I didn't understand this movie, but as I got older I understood it completely. It focuses on many issues that teens STILL face today. Only, this movie is different...this movie was an actual true story. It had absolutely great acting. The performances were unexpected....yet by the end I couldn't believe what I saw. Movies like this are out there that focus on the same concepts like (Thirteen), which was a movie I found to be completely un-realistic. But like I said this was different , this is something to actually see and to remember.The way Leonardo portrayed Jim Carroll was very interesting. I mean this was a man who actually went through the vixens of life. Drugs, Sex and the pressures of friends are just a few of them. He escaped the grasp and lives on to be a wonderfully insightfully poet. The many other REAL characters had great acting as well. But i'd understand you to not like this film, after all it's not for everyone, but as for me it was this film that drove me to be such a huge LEOLOVER!!!!!!It is a movie to rent when your feeling like you need something new to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far superior to Requiem For a Dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie the first time when I was about 15 and was totally blown away, since then I've watched it three or four times more and I still think it is a great and powerful movie, extremely under-rated.The parallel to Requiem for a Dream is easy to make seeing they both revolve around the same subject matter and make use of similar artistic camera techniques etc, but in my opinion there is no competition at at all. Basketball diaries has all the elements of humanity, sympathy and believable characters that Requiem just plain lacks. And even though Requiem makes use of some very neat photography I personally would rather watch the absolutely amazing performance of Di Caprio over this any day of the week. This is a film you should watch first and foremost because of the acting-performances from everyone involved, but I think the rest of the elements that make a great picture are there as well.Simply a great buddy / drug / teenage movie. Don't miss it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Quick Rant or Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Belatedly, and long after reading the book, I saw this film on cable. I had almost forgotten Jim Carroll and his gripping story. And I half expected Leonardo Di Caprio not to be up to the task of portraying him.To my surprise, I found Di Caprio more than just adequate; he pretty much carries what weight there is in this truly abysmal effort at capturing the truth of Jim Carroll's book.Viewers who take the time to read through some of the comments recorded here will take note -- if they can forgive the unusually poor grammar and spelling of most of them -- that many are from people with first-hand experience in using drugs or knowing those who do. They have a poignant and personal ring to them. But it takes someone with a depth of experience in dealing with what one reviewer properly identifies as the important contemporaneous background to Carroll's story to lend relevance to this flimsy and concocted visual melange.I for one am a little put off by Carroll's apparent assent in being a part of a bad movie adaptation of his book. I can only guess someone convinced him that it would not get made unless he was willing to see his real story toned down and made into a politically correct polemic. Of those apparently young viewers who have commented here, most have missed entirely the poetic and celebratory -- and ultimately all too human -- aspect of personal rebellion involved in the addictive use of drugs. To fail to deal directly with this important and compelling part of life that the book has as its center is to miss the point entirely. I think Di Caprio might have been up to the task of going deeper into that character, a kind of James Dean portrayal. Now that would have been something!No apt comparison of newer and therefore contemporary films about drug use such as "Trainspotting" or "Traffic" applies here. In order to understand Carroll, one has to go back to the likes of William Burroughs or Hubert Selby. The only such movie I can think of coming close to this one is "Drugstore Cowboy."Movies drawn from literary sources must either be made true to their origins or improve on them. This one does neither.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar story with strong performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They're have been many films made about characters getting involved with drugs and the stories have become familiar so I have to look to see if any of them have a special quality to recommend them. I don't think this film has that special quality but it does present the viewer with a very strong performance by its star. This is the true story about Jim Carroll (Leonardo DiCaprio) who is a teenager in New York City and the star of his high school basketball team. He goes to a catholic school but definitely does not behave like a good catholic. He hangs out with his friends Mickey (Mark Wahlberg), Neutron (Patrick McGaw) and Pedro (James Madio) and they like to experiment with popping pills and using inhalants. In his spare time Jim writes in his diary about his everyday events and the people in his life. One night while partying with some rich girls he experiments with cocaine for the first time and it doesn't take long before he is using hardcore drugs on a daily basis. During a game Jim passes out and his coach Swifty (Bruno Kirby) kicks him off the team and he and Mickey quit school. Jim's mother (Lorraine Bracco) can't deal with him in this state and kicks him out of their home so now he is living on the streets with Mickey. They rob stores and steal cars to feed their habit until Jim is passed out in the snow. A friend named Reggie (Ernie Hudson) finds him and takes him back to his apartment where he forces Jim to quit cold turkey. After a rocky ordeal for a few days Jim sneaks out and meets Mickey where they try and score in a park. They get ripped off and chase the dealer to the top of a building and during a scuffle with Mickey he is pushed over the edge where he falls and dies. After getting beaten up by the locals in the neighborhood Mickey is hauled off by the police. Jim heads to his mothers and begs for money but she doesn't give him any and the police later catch up with him there. This film is directed by Scott Kalvert who is making his debut in feature films and the only thing he had directed before this was the video "The Marky Mark Workout" and at times while watching this film I had the notion that the material may be over his head. At times this film does have a strong visual style but as a director his storytelling is pretty basic. This is your familiar story about someone getting involved with drugs and it doesn't really offer anything that you haven't seen in other films about this subject. A lot of the blame comes from Jim Carroll himself and its because survivors of drug addiction love to think that they have something special to offer the world. Don't get me wrong, its great if he can stop individuals from entering a life of hell but for most of us that sort of information is unnecessary and it certainly doesn't equate into a good film. Kalvert does do one thing correctly that enhances the film, he allows DiCaprio the freedom to submerge himself into this character and the camera at times lingers on his face as he wallows in his grotesque state. Some have said that DiCaprio is miscast but I disagree. DiCaprio with his youthful appearance was certainly believable as a teenager and this is a very strong performance. The scene where he is crying by the front door begging for money from his mother is one that is not quickly forgotten. Juliette Lewis has a small role as the hooker Diane and she is also pretty good. I think they're are much better films dealing with this subject and even though I can't really recommend it I do think that the performance of DiCaprio would be the only reason that curious viewers might want to check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leonardo's great performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To tell the truth, "Basketball Diaries" is not a perfect adaptation of Jim Carroll's book. Yet it captures the spirit so finely you cannot deny the director's masterful work in its case. But the main reason to watch the movie is undoubtedly DiCaprio's superb acting. In this pre-Titanic performance, Leonardo seems absolutely focussed and dedicated to put his best. No one could perform better as the heroin addicted hero. Truely speaking, I like this performance more than those in Titanic or The Beach.The story centers too much in him but in my opinion it was good in one point of view. At least you don't have to bother much on the course of the story. Just watch the acting and that would be enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Basketball Diaries" is a kind of movie that you have to be old enough and mature enough to understand it's message. Younger audiences that see it might think it glorifies and encourages violence and drugs, instead of fighting it, which is its initial message. It also includes a good performance by Leonardo Dicaprio. He needs to do more movies like this. Not violent ones, but ones that offer strong roles, instead of all the dumb chick flicks. On the other hand, this movie is appalling, disgusting, revolting and morally wrong. It tries to comment on the world of juvenile delinquency, but it gets so wound up in it's own reign of violence and drugs, that it fails to precisely deliver it's message. I and many others did find the message, but there are many others who won't.</fullReview>

I know that Leonard DiCapio is every girl's idol, but this movie just makes him look like a moron.so is worth renting? If you're obsess with DiCapio. But please rent it first.

		<shortDescription>Unrelentingly downbeat but unconvincing junkie melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Basketball Diaries" throws just about every imaginable junkie-movie cliche at you, one by one, like a dress rehearsal for "Trainspotting." Thing is, that film was the best film released during 1996, while this one is just plain mean.Leonardo DiCaprio (in an excellent performance that nearly makes the film work) stars as Jim Carroll -- the screenplay is based on his 1970s cult novel, which we are to interpret as being his autobiography -- who is a top basketball star at his NYC Catholic school in the film's beginning (a Catholic school complete with a perversely masochistic priest and a closet homosexual basketball coach, of course), and spends the film descending into heroin oblivion. Along the way he's accompanied by his hophead friends, his tough-but-caring mom (Lorraine Bracco, who's terrific), and an angelic black guy who stuffs Jimmy's I've-hit-rock-bottom-but-I-don't-know-it face in the mirror with the always faithful "Look at yourself!" There's also the usual gallery of unusual, freaky characters, and a series of badly shot and edited "fantasy" sequences which are supposed to illustrate what's really going on in ol' Jimmy's head, in case we didn't quite get it in the first place.What's the problem here? Is it the performances? Of course not -- everyone in the cast gives convincing, sometimes terrifying performances in their underwritten roles. The problem is with the director, Scott Kalvert, and the fact that he's not a very good director, and that the writer, Bryan Goluboff, resorts to all the expected and worn-out devices from addict stories of decades past, almost as if it were a celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the first notable addiction/ withdrawal film, "The Lost Weekend." The trouble is, even when Goluboff's screenplay tries to reach for new and inventive cinema, Kalvert's lazy direction ruins everything.Recently the film met with some notoriety when New Line Cinema wanted to recall the film, due to one fantasy sequence wherein Jim, dressed in a chic black trenchcoat and steel-toed military boots, brings a shotgun to school, blah blah blah. The reasoning, I guess, was that it preemptively echoed the Columbine massacre, and the sight of teen-favorite actor DiCaprio dressing in Trenchcoat Mafia dress and doing Trenchcoat Mafia stuff would inspire other teeny-boppers to do the same. Uh, mmkay. Anyway, free speech defenders cried out in anger, shortly before New Line realized they didn't own the rights to the film, labeling the move an assault on free speech and artistic expression. Thing is, though, there isn't much in "Diaries" that hasn't been expressed before. Maybe that seems insensitive and maybe I'm not displaying the proper social attitude of Go Free Speech!, but honestly, if we lost "The Basketball Diaries," there'd still be at least a half-dozen other films available that told the same story, but better.</fullReview>

Film takes Carroll's story out of the 1960's and into modern times, which muddies the scenario and leaves behind some confusing dislocation. Decent acting makes it semi-tolerable, particularly by Bruno Kirby as the basketball coach, but the movie is very sour and cynical--that is, until the final scene when it decides to turn preachy! Leonardo DiCaprio does his standard eye-squinting, pointing-with-his-nostrils thing, his fashionably limp hair hanging near his eyes. He's at the center of the drama, and yet it's easy to forget about him. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful, but not as effective as other anti-drug movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this biopic based on true events, Leonardo Dicaprio stars in his first leading role as Jim Carroll, a high school teen in Manhattan who plays on the basketball team along with his friends Mickey (played by Mark Wahlberg), Neutron (played by Patrick McGaw), and Pedro (played by James Madio). The four begin sprawling the streets of downtown Manhattan, experimenting with illegal drugs and prostitution. Soon, they begin experimenting with heroin, which unexpectedly grows into an addiction. Before too long, their lives begin descending into a downward spiral when their addiction takes a toll on their high school career as well as their home lives.Many anti-drug movies such as Trainspotting (1996) and Requiem For a Dream (2000), succeed on painting realistic pictures on how drug addiction damages people's lives as well as deliver clear messages on why you shouldn't do drugs. This one does manage to give an authentic look on drug addiction with the main character. When you watch as he and his friends steadily transcend into a life of heroin addiction, they get involved with crime including robbery, theft, assault, and eventually homicide. They also end up getting kicked off the basketball team, expelled from school, and even exiled from the comfort of their homes. The movie does do a decent job at highlighting the perplexities that their drug addiction leads to. The main problem however is that the story pays very little emotional investment, and it makes the plot less effective than it should be, not to say that it fails to deliver its message. Aside from this, as the story approaches its final act, the film goes into some rather strange directions. For instance, one of the characters leaves the group not wanting to grow further into the heroin addiction. From there on out, we never learn what happens to him or what. Then there are some drug-charged hallucination scenes like the infamous school shooting scene and a scene showing Leonardo Dicaprio's character get shot while shooting a basketball that made almost no sense.Overall, Basketball Diaries is not too bad for a film. Even though it may not be as effective or believable as other drug-themed movies, it still manages to be somewhat powerful and deliver its message. The cast also deliver some good performances, especially Mark Wahlberg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Basketball Diaries</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it limerick or should we say it's prose? The movie "Basketball Diaries" is a great one of childhood friends as depicted by Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio and others as they grow up hoping to achieve recognition on the courts as well as remain friends, grow into good lovers, and tackle society in their midst. There presence together and apart challenges themselves and each other to recognize their demons and remove them to be able to move on with each other in a sportsmanlike fashion. The story is fashioned to be a parody of puberty in a sense I think but for the boy, and not the girl. It is a funny story about how boys grow up, the mistakes the make or might make and the challenges that could possibly face growing up. It reaches for goals as they would and then get disappointed with them and embraces them as they do it, challenging them along the way giving nothing but heartfelt recognition to the plight of boyhood but in a tough kinda way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this movie- oh boy, it's a toughie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, see it AS SOON AS YOU CAN. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Jim Carroll is spot on. It seems that he really has an addiction to cocaine and heroin. Yes, he was trained by a coach to study the physical and mental side effects of drugs, but other than that he was a- mazing. Mark Wahlberg was okay, too, I guess. But he was actually addicted to cocaine when he was a teen, so it was easier for him. You think Trainspotters is good? Check this out! It will definitely make you think twice about drug and alcohol abuse, trust me. If you struggled with drugs in previous years, you'll fully understand this plot. Although it isn't 100% accurate to the book, I think Mr Kalvert did a good job. So watch this movie ASAP. If you dislike DiCaprio, this will change your thoughts.</fullReview>

Just wow, absolutely raw and heart wrenching especially at the height of his addiction. I'd also forgotten that Mark Wahlberg is in this (very young Marky-Mark days) and also Juliette Lewis.The entire movie is very dark and inconsistent in its storytelling but filled with excellent performances; following Carroll (DiCaprio) as a 1960's teen, his star basketball days and subsequent spiral into heroin addiction along with a few of his school buddies. Crime, homelessness, prostitution and chaos ensue. 02.01.14 Quotes: "First, it's a Saturday night thing when you feel cool like a gangster or a rockstar -just something to kill the boredom, you know?

The ending proves to be quite a good one, despite there is less footage of the process endured in the prison. From the acting side, I really like how Leonardo DiCaprio showed a great totality in acting here. He can really nail, although not perfectly, all the physical conditions a junkie with demanding addiction would do.

		<fullReview>Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries tells in tattered detail how the author went in a few short months from being a Catholic high school basketball star to being a strung-out heroin addict who turned tricks for drugs. Like many such stories, it hangs fondly over the shock and repulsion, and ends with unbecoming quickness after contentment is recovered. Will there ever be a venue for a film about a character who skips through his drug period because he's so excited to show us what he did after he pulled his socks up? Not likely. If there's anything more tiresome than a scandalous parable with a lesson at the end, it's the lesson minus the parable.And so this reverential flounder in the sewer of narcissism shows us profusely that if you become addicted to drugs, you're prone to discover yourself living distraughtly on the streets, selling a body that looks increasingly less like a worthwhile purchase. Carroll was a kid who notwithstanding his misery attempted to develop his experience into prose. The snag with Scott Kalvert's film is that he's apt to translate the experiences too literally: Jim is so urgently pale and miserable that the idealism feels vain. He plays basketball at night in the rain after his best friend dies of leukemia, and it just looks wholly contrived, fake and banal, not poignant.As the film begins, Jim is on the basketball team at a Catholic high school in New York, where a depraved priest drools while spanking disobedient students with a full-size paddle and the class cringes rhythmically. This scene's more indebted to Victorian pornography than to any real private school in 20th century America. Jim and his friends are not upright Catholic boys. They steal from the lockers of the opposing basketball team, and the preferred off-court activity is experimenting with inhalants and pills. Swifty, the coach played by Bruno Kirby, makes implausible passes at Jim. And Jim's mother, played by a sadly wasted Lorraine Bracco, is a crudely flat character who functions here exclusively to implement tough love by kicking him out.Life for Jim is a descending coil of pills, cough medicine, booze, diving off cliffs into the Harlem River, fainting during a game and masturbating on the roof. There are also stirring gleans into the underbelly of users, pushers, hookers and pimps, as Jim floats at large from his comfort zones, while recording all in his diary. Jim's writing predictably operates as a narration. Like most poetry written by teenagers, it's childish idealism, agonizingly earnest, seeing life as sad because the writer's not happy. Soon though, he samples heroin, and "any ache, pain, sadness or guilt was completely flushed out." Remarkable, how real life unravels exactly like the movies.The movie hinges on three hard-wearing formulas: Jim facilitates his dying friend's temporary escape from the hospital so he can push his wheelchair down 42nd Street, Jim sees his ex-teammate on TV playing in an all-star game while Jim is in a squalid bar and, of course, Jim is rescued by a dignified black man, who finds him out cold, brings him home and puts him through cold turkey. In accounts like this, you can continuously rely on a laudable black ex-hoodlum, combing the streets for distressed white kids, functioning for white tolerance soap-boxing purposes as hidden supplies of authenticity and honor.DiCaprio does what he can with the role. Ernie Hudson is solid as the ex-junkie, and there is genuine feeling in Bracco's underwritten mother. But it's Juliette Lewis, as a greasy hooker, who once again taps an utterly real edge. But the movie is not credible. By the end, Jim is seen going in through a stage door, and then we hear him telling the story of his decline and recuperation. We can't determine if this is intended to be actual acknowledgment or a show: That's the whole movie's trouble.While the film has a preachy earnestness more like older films that take drug issues in hand, its mercilessly murky concentration on the despair of drug abuse makes for effective, gripping viewing, if only for purely morbid interest. The teen years, an age of revolt and insecurity in the best of conditions, can be shocking when an individual gets that carried away. This stark, muddled film depicts this, with reductive prurience indeed, but also with brutalizing efficacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true look at addiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of those rare movies. It shows you what can and will really does happen when someone is on drugs, and just how fast you can get addicted.As an ex-heroin addict myself, I can relate to it so much. DiCaprio deserved an Oscar for his portrayal of Jim Carroll, he was just fabulous. The withdrawal scene really made you think it wasn't a movie, but a documentary, because of how real Leo made it seem. Also the scene where DiCaprio comes back to his mother dope sick &amp; wanting some money, is very, very true. It's not over-exaggerated, not in the slightest bit. Heroin withdrawal is agony, and I was shocked how well Leo portrayed that agony. He makes it seem like he really was in that much pain.I think a lot of people under-estimate DiCaprio's acting abilities because of Titanic, but, after seeing him in this film as well as "Gilbert Grape", it will make you change your mind about him immediately, because he really is one our greatest actors.I once saw someone said that "Diaries" is a knock off of Requiem for A Dream. And that is absolutely not true. Diaries came out in 1995, Requiem came out much later.I recommend this movie to anyone. It is very honest &amp; real. Absolutely stunning acting by everyone involved. Leo definitely proves he's more than a pretty boy, and he has some serious acting chops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always thought Leonardo Di Caprio was just another pretty face.But I have rarely (if ever) seen better acting than the scene in this movie in which he comes back home to his mother and she refuses to take him in.DeCaprio mixes passion with a "bad boy" coolness in a way that I find very appealing.This movie is worth seeing for anyone who has dealt with loved ones who are addicted. Having been down that road myself, I didn't detect any false notes.For "The Basketball Diaries" alone, Di Caprio deserves to be a major star.Highest possible recommendation!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Isn't This In Top 250?!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cried multiple times in this film. This is the best anti-drug film i have ever seen. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a great performance in this role as Jim Carroll and looks like he would when he was younger. I have never read any of the book or heard any of his music or read any of his poems but Jim Carroll seems like he had a tough life growing up with a heroin addiction. The drug sequences in this movie are very scary. He could have died at any time. I am wanting my mum to see this movie but she never has time for anything so hopefully soon i will be able to get her to view it. Also the display of the hooker and Jim and how the tables can turn can really turn you off drugs. Also the rape scene between Jims coach and himself is really frightening and disgusting because there are people like that in this world that do much more worse things than that. Anyway, go and see this movie. It is the greatest movie ever and i just don't know why this isn't in the top 250.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most powerful movie I've seen in my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The PR-Titanic Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jim Carroll, the poet and musician who spent much of his adolescence addicted to heroin and shooting hoops with fellow Catholic high school kids. As a biography, the film doesn't amount to more than the sum of its gritty scenes of smack use, violence, perversions (poor Bruno Kirby plays a lecherous coach who comes on to young Jim), and the usual scream-and-puke dramas that go along with a cold-turkey session. Director Scott Kalvert doesn't seem to realize that most people don't know who Carroll is and therefore can't possibly understand why they should care about his gutter ball youth. DiCaprio, having nowhere to go with his performance but maintain Carroll's tailspin, is boring and redundant. Some kind of allusion to the literary and rock &amp; roll life that follows the mess we're watching might have been helpful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched The Basketball Diaries at 13 years of age. I am Australian and it is rated R but I found it totally compelling.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Jim, a young high school student who falls into the world of drugs. Jim Carroll's autobiography of the same name was the idea of this film.It follows him through the stages of drug use, the things drugs force him into and the heartbreaking downward fall of a talented poet and basketball player.As a young female watching this, I have to say many of the scenes disgusted me - the stripper scene, the pornography and masturbation innuendos. Just not something a thirteen year old girl really wants to know about boys! But this movie holds an important message; that drugs can ruin a young person's life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film as a teen. Back then, it was the most riveting portrayal of heroin addiction I had ever seen.That being said... I recently watched it again and really thought it was rather awful. I cringed during Leonardo's whining and over-acting. I was unmoved by its begging for seriousness when the acting was truly not very good. Not to mention, Wahlberg sort of mucked this one up for me as well. I have never been a great fan of his acting (I hope he does something surprising in The Departed).I have met and been around people addicted to heroin. I think this film paints a very silly picture and has a lot of stereotypes. I hope the book this movie was based on is quite different. I haven't read it and probably won't. Stick to Trainspotting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a note about a lot of background goofs in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie, but something that I find bothersome is when the film maker doesn't make the effort to authenticate the sets, props, etc... for the correct time period. A few things I noticed: when this film opens they pan the NYC skyline showing the World Trade Center which wasn't completed until April of 1973. Jim Carroll's diaries where written during 1962-1966. There was also a Wendy's Hamburger's sign in one scene (founded in 1969), a sign for the show STOMP, which played in Union Square in the 1990's, the NY State license plates throughout the film had the Statue of Liberty on them and that style wasn't issued until the 90's. I believe the license plates in that time frame would have been gold with blue lettering. There was also part of a scene filmed in front of Hogs &amp; Heifers in the meat packing district. I may be wrong on this one, but I don't think that bar was around in 1966. I couldn't find the facts to back me up on that last one, so it's just a hunch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of people hate Leonardo DiCaprio, especially since Titantic. Lots of girls love Leonardo DiCaprio, again, especially since Titantic. I am neither for or against him, but I do like this movie and think he does a truly fine acting job of a drug-addicted youth. There is a great story here and it's finely portrayed. But I'm reminded of True Romance in that there's lots of small brilliant roles that give this movie depth. Lorraine Bracco as the grief-stricken mother, Ernie Hudson as the caring friend, Juliette Lewis as the reformed drug addict/prostitute, Bruno Kirby as the perverted basketball coach, and Micheal Rappaport as the angry guy. Granted this isn't nearly as good as True Romance, it is good. If you can tolerate Leo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the autobiographical novel written by Jim Carroll, The Basketball Diaries follows one young man's descent into addiction, crime and homelessness. Jim (here played with mature dedication by Leonardo Di Caprio) is a promising high school basketball player, who along with his three friends, enjoy shooting hoops and getting into general mischief. What starts out as a past-time, soon deteriorates into something more deprived and desperate, as Jim sees his world crash around him as his drug habit becomes an unstoppable affliction.When Jim's situation gets so desperate that he leaves home to hustle and rob on the streets, he begins to push away the people in his life that were once close to him. His mother, played by Lorraine Bracco, throws him out after the extremities of his situation become apparent to her and refuses him back. Reggie (Ernie Hudson) was an inspirational figure and mentor to Jim and regularly met up to play basketball in the court. And Neutron (Patrick McGaw) distances himself from Jim and his friends' habits and focuses on his basketball career, much to Jim's dismay. These people will all have a profound effect on Jim's eventual redemption. The film also switches the book's real-life setting from 1960's New York to the 90's.What The Basketball Diaries attempts to do is to create a realistic and gritty (a phrase that seems to be thrown around a lot these days) depiction of drug abuse, and create a hellish portrait of a confused young man who his throwing away his many talents in favour of a life that is doing nothing but ruining his life and isolating the people around him. In reality, this is a terribly-directed film that seems to sledgehammer the phrase 'drugs are bad' into the viewers skull, rather than having the nerve, or in deed the respect, to let the audience make their own mind up. Or maybe the director doesn't have the skill to create a film capable of conjuring up those feelings in the viewer. It sounds ridiculous, but if you have seen the South Park episode where Mr Mackey is giving his anti-drug lecture by simply listing the drugs that are 'bad', then you can see a clear parallel to this film. Jim basically goes from one drug to the other and one crime to the next. It's not interesting, convincing, and to be honest I found it all just very annoying.Jim is a character of no redeeming qualities. He's selfish, careless, and is basically a whiny little kid. Fair enough, this is a chance to develop an interesting, fully-rounded character, but director Scott Kalvert and scriptwriter Bryan Goluboff cannot combine their 'skills' to pull it off. Even though Jim narrates the film and reveals everything about his feelings and opinions, and Di Caprio's fantastic performance, we never get inside Jim's head enough to understand him and why he is willing to give up on a fledging basketball career. This is a character that we're supposed to be praying for to overcome his addiction, but (spoilers!) when his clean-break arrived, I asked myself should I be feeling happy for this arsehole?A well-acted film all-round, namely from the lead and Mark Wahlberg as his friend Mickey, but a film that is swamped in faults and scenes that are just ridiculous. Possibly only remotely remembered for the controversial scene where Jim storms his school with a shotgun in a drug-addled fantasy, which was caught up in the media storm surrounding the Columbine High School massacre. Watch only for signs of early promise from Di Caprio, but otherwise avoid.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Basketball Diaries, 1995 Decent performance by Leo De Caprio in the starring roll but still not a very good movie. I could point out several things I didn't like about the movie but I'll simply stick to my biggest problem. This was a character driven movie, and I couldn't help but not give a damn about any of the characters involved. That really hurt my abilaty to enjoy the movie. On the plus side it was shot pretty well and wasn't boring, plus it introduced me to the song "people who have died" by The Jim Caroll Band, which I'm totally loving right now .---5/10, 36th best movie of 1995, 321st of the 90's 815th overall</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ahh.. torturous youth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the true life story of a poet/musician named Jim Caroll played by Leo (never heard of him), and his time being a drug abuser/heroin addict as a teenager going to Catholic school. Jim is a promising basketball player. His school team is one of the best in the city. However, as Jim slides into the typical rebeliousness of teen adolescence, he and his chums start getting into the usual experimentation with drugs. But when one of Jim's buddies who has been suffering from lukemia dies, he can't handle it and slowly but surely, ends up spirialing out of control. Jim's life is filed with angst, a basketball coach who makes sexual advances towards him, and a cold institution that offers him no guidance. The film is OK, Leo is good in it and so are the other actors. However, Leo's portrayl of a heroin abuser is overshadowed by the fact that he still looks like a pretty boy. I have seen what hardcore heroin users look like, and even though they throw makeup on Leo to enhance the affects it still doesn't pay off. This the third "heroin" abuse movie that I have seen and the other 2 I saw were certainly better. But you did get the sense of kids trying to find an identity for themselves and yet having no direction. Everyone can identify with that. As for the so called "shooting" controversy. It is soooo ridiculous that people would consider this movie the culprit for the Columbine shootings. If anything those kids had the brains to watch this movie and have some intelligence in seeing an independent film, that portrays what REALLY happens to teenagers if they start doing drugs, instead of seeing some typical Hollywood drivel. If anything the film is a powerful lesson for kids. But the shooters probably didn't have the intelligence to comprehend it. Rating 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just say "No" to this flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Basketball Diaries" is just another flick about the moody, angst filled, angry, self-destructive adolescent behavior of young men growing up...in this case catholic boys in New York City who play basketball. The film seems to have little purpose other than trying to out do itself with one audience shock after another as it follows the boys from the confessional through the "mean streets" embellished with a lame sort of poetic pesudo-philosophical narration. Lots of over acting, little plot, and a protagonist we're not made to care about. Billed as based on the writings of Jim Carroll, this film is really based on the imaginings of the screen writer and director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Unless you are just filling space until you die, you're going to want something out of experiences like this. The idea is supposed to be that someone can guide us to alternative worlds and report back with something useful or at least interesting. It is not enough to merely watch a loser devolve. "Mean Streets" gave us something about energy and honesty. "Requiem for a Dream" was an essay on vision. "Trainspotting" was a matter of comic irony as survival. Each of these had a reason for being.What here?One idea is that basketball somehow provides a framework for living. We see a lot of ball, but it is mere scenery. We see a lot of religion too. Sports and religion are cut from the same skin. But no real traction here: just something to rebel against.Another idea is that we have the reporting "from the scene" as it really happened from someone who was there. A journalism of the soul by a transcendent talent. But nothing we see or hear gives any inkling of any talent; in fact the writings seem to be just like the visual inserts we get from time to time -- incoherent and shallow.Yes, Leonardo can be intense. But why? His energy in the role is like the kid he portrays, a waste. (We hear at the very end that he escaped drugs, but nothing of THAT journey.)Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable Performance by DiCaprio in Haunting Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basketball Diaries, The (1995) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Powerful adaptation of Jim Carroll's autobiographical account of his free fall from good student to heroin addict isn't a pretty film to watch but there's no denying its power. Leonard DiCaprio, in his first starring role, plays Carroll who when we first meet him is playing sports and is still in school but soon his minor drug habits start to spin out of control and he finds himself hooked, living on the streets and any hope for the future is nearly gone. I remember going to see THE BASKETBALL DIARIES a week after my fifteenth birthday and still remember what effect it had on me. I really didn't understand all the negative reviews the movie got at the time of its release but I found the film to be remarkably powerful and the message against drug abuse is still very strong in today's time. What all people then agreed on is that star DiCaprio seemed like he could do anything in the world. Coming after supporting roles in films like THIS BOYS LIFE and WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE, this was certainly a departure from those two films but it was a real eye-opener because there's some of the most raw and powerful acting that you're ever going to see. The final thirty-minutes of the film pretty much has DiCaprio playing a drugged out character who is just inches away from death and the brutality of the performance is something one isn't going to forget. This is hands down a performance that once you see it it's unlikely to leave your mind and DiCaprio really gives it his all and it's really hard to think of another actor out there who could have given so much to the part. The way DiCaprio just crumbles under the drug abuse is so chilling and haunting that you really do feel as if you're watching a real addict and not just an actor playing a part. The support cast are also quite good with Ernie Hudson coming off extremely strong as a man trying to save the kid and Lorraine Bracco as his mother. Mark Wahlberg, Bruno Kirby and Juliette Lewis are also strong in their roles. I think there are a few issues with the film including too much attempted style by the director and this is really apparent during a sequence where DiCaprio is suffering from withdrawals. The acting is strong enough so the stylistic touches by the director are more distracting than anything else. The screenplay has taken some heat from people but I thought it was pretty good and captured the free-spirit of the novel, which it's based on. THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is as relevant today as it was when first released and it's certainly a terrific showcase for its star who has gone on to prove all those early critics right when they called him one of the greatest actors coming up. The film is a haunting reminder of the downsides of drugs and the rawness of the performances make it hard to watch at times but there's no denying its power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irritating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie irritated me.I just wonder how Jim Carroll was involved in this easy, flat, boring, moralistic commonplace film (but seeing him with an old junkie haircut in a cameo makes me think he was involved). I also wonder how a bunch of quite good actors decided to work in this, with its cheap and ridiculous dialogues. And the version I saw, in Italian language, was even worse and cheaper. I guess all this reaction is partially due to the fact that I liked so much the Carroll's book when I was a teenager (and his first record too), and it was raw and sometimes poetic. It's not easy to make a good drug movie, we got plenty of examples, but this one is useless. This movie rapes the poetry, rapes the basketball and in my opinion rapes the drug too.</fullReview>

Its melodramatic and the script is messy and unrealistic. Why would Dicaprio become a junkie all of a sudden? At first he was a bit of solvent sniffer and then just hours after trying a bit of coke he is raiding a medicine cabinet just to get high. I'm sorry but addiction is a gradual progress. It doesn't come out consuming a few lines of cocaine to aid sexual performance. Waste of time. What is sad that this could've been a decent film. Bloody crap</fullReview>
