		<shortDescription>Jeff, who lives in all our homes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody has a quirky movie that they, and few other people or critics, like. It just might be that a movie simply comes along at the right point in our lives and interlocks with events in it. I certainly have a number of movies among my favorites that fit into this category, and I have a feeling that Jeff, Who lives at Home might have been admitted to it.Although it is billed as a comedy, and there are certainly comic elements to it, there is a more serious component that underlies it and gives it some depth. Jason Segel plays a slacker who, at the age of 30, has few prospects (and living at home at 30 seems to be the modern stereotype of a loser). Jeff clings to the idea that some 'sign' will appear to show him the way. In fact, he is viewed as nothing but a loser by his mother, brother, and just about everyone else. When someone mistakenly calls his number asking for Kevin, Jeff, seeing this as the sign he's been waiting for, begins his search for his role in the universe, brushing aside all ridicule in the process.I like movies that show how small, apparently insignificant, choices can lead to life changing events. I also like movies in which a character is redeemed by adhering to principles that everyone else thinks are insane. In its own subtle way, the movie questions many of the basic premises that underlie modern society. Yeah, I know, maybe I'm reading too much into this, but, I suppose, that's why we all like certain movies that others don't.You're not going to get a better guy to play a slacker-loser than Segel. The other actors hold up their roles well. I admit that I expected little of this movie, but I found it engaging right from the opening scene. Give it a chance and I foolishly believe you will not be disappointed</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't let the title scare you away, 'Jeff, Who lives At Home' is a deep character study about three unhappy people and the meaningless existences they each inhabit.One such person is Pat (Ed Helms), a man stuck in a roller coaster of a relationship with his wife, Linda (Judy Greer). Pat has recently purchased any man's dream car, a brand new Porsche. Judy doesn't share in his delight for his new automobile, which only distances them even more. When Pat suspects Linda of having an affair, it leads him on a inept detective mysterious, where most of the films humor draws on.Susan Sarandon plays Sharon, the mother of Pat. A widower, Sharon is very lonely and loans for someone to connect with. When a "secret admirer" begins sending her flirty messages, Sharon is delightfully surprised someone is still interested in her despite her age. It's up to Sharon to uncover this mystery person's identity.The last chapter, the title character, is played by Jason Segal. By far the best part of the movie, Jeff is a slacker in his 30's with no real aim in life. After seeing the movie 'Signs' and having someone with the wrong number call him and ask for a Kevin, he believes it to be a sign. The rest of his arc delves into him following after all things tied to "Kevin," and the strange paths it takes him.A common misconception I can see being falling into is that this will be a broad, raunchy comedy, like the ones Ed Helm and Jason Segal have headlined in their career. If you go into this film expecting that, you'll be disappointed. This is a thinking man's movie, with smart humor and likable characters sprinkled in. With your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slacking off like a pro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff, Who Lives at Home starts out by referencing a film from 10 years ago. The main character, Jeff, speaks about his love for the movie Signs. That movie was all about signs being sent to us and that we must use those signs as guides for living our lives. This becomes Jeff's mantra for how he lives his life. These signs haven't been getting him anywhere as of yet though. He's a grown-up slacker who still lives at home with his mother as the title of the film says. It's this bohemian free-spirited attitude that has led him to where he is. He seems at peace with things, yet something is missing from his life. His brother Pat is the opposite. He's married, has a job, and even just bought a new Porsche; he doesn't believe in slacking off like Jeff. That doesn't mean everything is going well for him though. He really didn't have the money to comfortably afford the Porsche and you can tell that his wife isn't happy about it. But Pat lives in the moment. While showing off the Porsche to Jeff, they see his wife with another man and start to suspect she's having an affair. Even though these two brothers don't generally get along and seem to despise each other a little, Jeff agrees to help Pat out and find out what's going on. Along the way, they begin to learn about each other and their different ways of approaching things. Pat always thought he had his life together and looked down on Jeff. Now's he realizing that maybe Jeff had a better way of looking at things. Jason Segel and Ed Helms play the 2 brothers and make the best of their roles. There's also an interesting sub-plot about what's going on with their mother (Susan Sarandon) at her job. The movie is part of a recent genre of film called "mumblecore" which generally have low budgets and focus more on the dialogue - sort of like a Quentin Tarantino film without the action. Luckily, the dialogue here is very good and holds your interest throughout. At less than an hour and half (which is very rare nowadays), it doesn't meander at all. It focuses on how we spend our days and seems to have a message of living more carefree. But there are plenty of laughs throughout the film which make it very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More of a drama then a comedy but very good. Heartfelt and moving. Not your typical Segal movie. I say B+</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You ever feel like your waiting for forever to find out what your destiny is and when you do it's not really that exciting?" After receiving a phone call from a wrong number Jeff (Segel) thinks that the call has a deeper reason. His mom (Sarandon) calls and asks him to run an errand for him. What starts as a simple trip to a hardware store begins to evolve and change the lives of everyone Jeff comes into contact with, including his brother Pat (Helms). This is another movie that is almost nothing like the preview. The preview made it seem much funnier then it was. While this did have some funny parts in it I found this movie to be more sweet and heartfelt then I expected. Some of the aspects of the movie are very serious but they are done in a way that tone it down. Segel is just about the perfect choice for this role because there is just something about him that you find disarming and comfortable no matter what he is doing. If you are looking for a typical Segel comedy this is not it. This one has more substance and heart and is very much worth watching. Overall, if you liked "Everything Must Go" then this movie is for you. I recommend this but this is again not your average comedy. I give it a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yea Funny it is ..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I pretty much knew I was going to dig JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME right from the first scene, where Jeff sits on the toilet, and waxes poetically into a tape-recorder about his undying love for the movie SIGNS. I tend to like the Duplass Brothers, who wrote and directed, so I guess this wasn't a hard sell.At first glance, JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME seems like a bit of a minor film, with it running a scant eighty-minutes, and taking course over a single day. Heck, for ninety-percent of the movie it was a minor work, and while I liked it, it still felt like a bit of a disappointment on the heels of CYRUS, which was one of my favorite films from last year. The film works mostly due to Jason Segel, who's affecting as the eternally optimistic Jeff. In another actor's hands, Jeff could have been insufferable- but Segel brings a sweetness to the part that meshes well with the Duplass Brother's big-hearted, humanist philosophy.Like CYRUS, this owes a lot to the Duplass Bros., mumblecore origins, with it seemingly shot on lower-grade digital, possibly hand-held cameras, just like CYRUS. Some of the dialogue also seems to be improvised, with the exchanges between Segel and Ed Helms (who seems to be playing Andy Bernard with a goatee here- no complaints) having a natural, unscripted feel. The film also has a very nice score by Michael Andrews, heavily reminiscent of his excellent soundtrack for Miranda July's ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW (the release of which remains the last time I bought a physical CD).In terms of laughs, yeah- JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME is funny, but in a genteel sort of way. You'll never double over in laughter, but the whole thing feels pleasant, and at eighty minutes, goes down pretty smooth. Now, I said that for ninety-percent of the running time, this felt minor. The last twenty minutes or so throw the audience a bit of a curve-ball, with Jeff's idea of destiny having a surprisingly dramatic payoff, that pushed the film into territory I wasn't expecting. However, this switch isn't jarring, and works to the film's advantage, give it a uniqueness I wasn't anticipating.There's also an interesting subplot involving Jeff and Pat's mom, played by Susan Sarandon, as she interacts with an office co-worker (Rae Dawn Chong of COMMANDO!!!), and deals with a secret admirer, which pays off in a fun, heart-warming way that, again, makes the film a little different- but in a good way.All told, JEFF WHO LIVES AT HOME isn't quite as good as CYRUS, but it's a unique, pleasant comedy that once again proves that the Duplass Brothers., might be on to something with the way their films seem to simultaneously aim at the heart AND the funny bone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny comedy that proves life is tough, but when you get out of your shell you discover!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another one of those independent films that will touch you and you will cheer for it because it's not only heart touching and warming it provides plenty of laughs along the way it's message and central theme proves that one can discover life and make a connected difference even when one is sheltered. And the cast and chemistry is well shown as "Jeff Who Lives at Home" features veteran Susan Sarandon and up and coming stars Ed Helms and Jason Segel and the work of all blend well into a good picture.Set in Louisiana it follows the life one day of Jeff a 30 year old live at home slacker stoner who doesn't have a job and beat it all he lives like the crypt keeper as he stays in the basement! The only thing keeping him going is his stash and TV watching and thinking about the world in the strangest ways only this slightly changes some when he meets up with his cocky and business type older brother Pat(Ed Helms)and Pat now suspects that wife Linda(Judy Greer)is having an affair. Aside from that the hard working mom of Pat and Jeff Sharon(Susan Sarandon)finds an unexpected and crazy surprise at work with her boss Carol(sexy 80's screen siren Rae Dawn Chong).Thru it all this film showcases that a lot can occur in the lives of people during a day, some of it is just unexpected and crazy still it proves life is complex and a struggle and still love and happiness is possible. Most rewarding is seeing how in the film's end a sheltered character like Jeff can become a hero that shows life in some shape and form can be rewarding for all if you just come out explore, discover and take risk. Overall good film about the struggles of life, family, relationships and it shows life takes unexpected twist and turns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching film about the search for emotional attachments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a mother and her two adult sons, who experience varying degrees of interpersonal problems.The first half of the film portrays a socially awkward Jeff, with his newfound infatuation with anything to do with Kevin. It looks like a pothead comedy, which I do not usually enjoy. The mood of the second half changes dramatically, as the characters get emotionally complex. Their emotional wounds get explored, and the film becomes touching and engaging. The ending is well built and climactic, and I find myself very touched by the heroic events. How each family member found emotional attachment is beautiful to say the least.Though "Jeff, Who Lives At Home" may be a little boring at first, it is worth watching as the last twenty minutes are excellent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Destiny Found in a Basement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is "the best day in the history of the whole world" ? a quote pulled from brothers and main characters Jeff (Jason Segel) and Pat's (Ed Helms) deceased father in a dream. And it just so happens to be the one day in the life of Jeff in Paramount Pictures "Jeff Who Lives at Home" who reconnects with his family on a human level on the same day.Jeff is a character whom his family consisting of his mother Sharon, (Susan Sarandon) and brother Pat passes off as an underachiever to the extreme. Jeff lives in his mother's basement where the majority of his days are spent eating, smoking weed, and watching infomercials like the "incredible vitamin" and consistently searching for a sign to something greater to his seemingly detached existence. Jeff becomes obsessed for his signs of something greater after watching the alien invasion film "Signs" starring Mel Gibson, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin.When Jeff gets an arbitrary sign through a phone call, it puts his world into an unexplainable focus to reaching his destiny while fighting-off the negative reactions from his brother and mother. The end result is a new view of Jeff as someone who is fearless, and open to seeing the world as it really is and not just as a spectator passing through it.The signs may hold coincidence in Jeff's life, but for many they are always there. Just few are able to see them. "Jeff Who Lives at Home" is a meaningful story about what happens when you open yourself up to the unexpected and what you might gain by putting yourself in a vulnerable position. All too much is needlessly lost due to fear of consequences and what others might think. This life is your own and it IS what you make of it is the underlying message of the film."Jeff Who Lives at Home" is written and directed by brothers Jay and Mark Duplass. Their past films include shorts and a documentary (called "Kevin"). During a press conference, the duo talked about their unique way of making this film. They said that they fully lit each scene before the actors stepped onto the set. After that, the actors were free to improvise and play-out the scenes with each other. Mark stated that there were "no rehearsals on the film. We don't believe in the rehearsal process in this instance because you might lose something that you don't get (on film)." Mark also said that once the camera is rolling, they don't like to stop because "you lose the moment".The movie was filmed in New Orleans, but the story takes place in Baton Rouge. Jeff's bravery rubs off on Sharon and Pat. Directors said that Jeff is a character that really sacrificed a lot by not getting a regular 9 to 5 job and getting married. "He is holding out for that grander that he knows he is meant for" said Duplass. This is something that is admirable and most people secretly wish that they could do according to film makers."Jeff Who Lives at Home" opens in limited theaters on Friday, March 16, 2012.www.HollywoodJunket.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A man who lives at home follows signs that bring him closer to his destiny. Most of these characters are facing life/relationship problems, but Jason Segel brings a lovable, quirky dorkiness to a film that inevitably carries lots of heart. The premise only works if you go along for the ride, and it doesn't hurt that the characters are likable - for the most part. Part fun, part strange, it's a down-to-earth world that becomes large because of its themes and ideas. Check it out! 7.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The Duplass brothers, Jay and Mark, were responsible for a terrific, creepy little comedy called Cyrus. It dealt with a dark, strange relationship between a mother and her grown, stay at home and do nothing son. The Duplass mumblecore beginnings often used familial relationships to find those moments of discomfort and comedy. Their latest movie brings all of that together as they examine multiple relationships within a family, and the possible role of destiny.Jeff (Jason Segel) is an unemployed, 30 year old, childlike pot-head who lives in his mother's (Susan Sarandon) basement and watches the M Night Shyamalan movie Signs so often that he is convinced there are no "wrong numbers" in life ... everything is a sign leading us to our destiny. After the latest "sign" (phone call for an unknown Kevin), Jeff heads out to complete a simple task for his disenchanted mother. He gets sidetracked on his quest for Kevin, and stumbles into his brother Pat (Ed Helms).By this time, we have seen Pat interact over breakfast with his wife Linda (Judy Greer). Note to guys: serving breakfast to your wife will not neutralize your surprise purchase of a Porsche. These two people have clearly lost whatever bond they once shared. One thing leads to another and we are soon watching Jeff and Pat stalk Linda and her male lunch friend ... or is he more? While this amateur detective work is playing out, Sharon (their mother) discovers she has a secret admirer at work. Her spirits are immediately lifted as she has pretty much given up on a personal life since the death of her husband years ago. Her friend Carol (Rae Dawn Chong) helps her be receptive to the idea, and this story line provides a nice Duplass twist.Despite the fact that none of the characters are extremely likable: Jeff is borderline goofy, Pat is kind of an ass, Sharon just seems frustrated ... the story moves along so that each of them grows a bit and their relationships evolve. The ending is a perfect cap and provides meaning, though initially quite a shock to the system after first three-quarters.The Duplass directing style utilizes micro-bursts of quick zoom in many scenes, giving this a quasi home-movie feel at times. As for the acting, I can't imagine another actor than Jason Segel could have pulled off the role of Jeff. In lesser hands, he would have come off as mentally unstable or just a total loser. Segel's sweetness pays off. It's always great to see Rae Dawn Chong back on screen, and I didn't even hate Susan Sarandon! Judy Greer's scene in the hotel room is so well played, it's a reminder of what a terrific and under-utilized actress she is. Don't expect a laugh outloud comedy, as this is more drama than comedy, though the smiles and chuckles occur in the moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An okay little film. Awkward, a bit lost, but mostly moving forward. It's a simple idea that unfolds fairy well, although exactly what the "signs" are and the importance of "kevin" is are never fully realised.Until the climax involving a car wreck, a submerged vehicle, and a rescue. A dull and idiotic ending to an otherwise okay movie. If the writers had come up with something better for the end, probably a 6/10.Decent acting from the cast. Oh, and if you're going to be quirky do you have to still be didactic? We get it - family is important. Love one another. Such writing is kinda dull, guys. And you'd done a good job for 60 minutes of avoiding dull. Close, but no cigar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff (Jason Segel) is a thirty year old man with a puncheon for the film Signs and lives in his mother Sharon's (Susan Sarandon) basement. His older brother Pat (Ed Helms) still lives close by with his wife Linda (Judy Greer). He and Linda are in the midst of serious marital problems. One day while she is at work, Sharon asks Jeff to go to the shop to pick up some wood glue. Convinced that the name Kevin is some sort of sign he ill advisedly follows various Kevins' around the city bumping into his brother along the way.To me the film was like a cross between a Wes Anderson film and The Office. It has the odd, quirky indie charm of an Anderson picture but the awkward humour and filming style of The Office. Unfortunately it was neither as good as any Wes Anderson film I've seen nor The Office. At times it was quite funny but these moments were usually fleeting and there weren't many of them. The story was reasonably interesting and the film had a sweet ending but it just didn't mesh together. The whole 'the Universe will show me the way' nonsense was really annoying and although the ending was very sweet, it was obvious and annoyed me.The film is reminiscent of the Duplass brother's last film Cyrus, which I really liked. You get the feeling that both films inhabit the same world. That film was quirky, funny and sad and these are all things which this film sets out to be. In the end it slightly misses the target on each occasion. The acting is really great but the characters were pretty forgettable. I'll still keep an eye out for the director's future work but this film didn't move me in the way it was meant to. Also, we all live at home! www.attheback.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>30-Something Slacker Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff, Who Lives at Home, is 30-something slacker propaganda disguised as a mopey indie flick. After first being introduced as a comical, delusional loaf (lazy oaf), we, the audience, spend the rest of a movie full of pat coincidences being programmed into believing Jeff is (somehow) right after all. About what, I don't know: apparently, the moral of the story is that we, of the slacker trade, must wait to hear our calling from the Universe, and when our calling comes we must be quick to the rescue. And our calling must be as dramatic and heroic as saving a family from a sinking car, after which we can return to our dull, infantile existence for the rest of our meaningless lives.Jeff is an exaggeration; his brother is a cartoon. This is the sort of movie that because it is indie doesn't whore itself off to product placement but instead uses familiar products to give it the semblance of real life, which is in my mind equally as patronizing, especially when I am supposed to believe movie moguls Jason Segal or Susan Sarandon have any channel whatsoever to what is real life.In a way, I felt like Susan Sarandon's character while watching this movie: superfluous, and easily manipulated by an exploiting presence to feel the heady pleasures of superficial, short-lived enjoyment, which like this movie lasted only 70 or so minutes, before reality set in and I realized what I watched was a perfectly contrived machine for making me feel this way... and absolutely nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shooting for the target, missing it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know what this movie is supposed to be shooting for, but it misses its mark badly. It's trying to go for quiet, quirky comedy/drama that contains meaningful message. But instead of quiet-it's lethargic. Instead of quirky-it's unfocused. Instead of meaningful, it's saccharin. The concept is silly, which is fine if you can pull it off, here it's not. A 30 year old loser with no prospects sits in his mom's basement smoking pot and obsessed with the movie 'Signs'. His obsession winds up affecting the lives of people around him whose lives are superficially OK, but just as messed up. The part where Susan Sarandon's character starts imaging the sprinklers as a waterfall was where the fake schmaltz level went through the roof. The dramatic rescue scene was the only saving grace in the entire movie.I'm open to these kinds of movies done well, done badly it's just a painful waste of time. Time better spent smoking pot in the basement. If you want to see a movie that's along similar themes that's far more entertaining, go see 'Our Idiot Brother'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Man, something really big is happening here."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd venture to bet that most people go through a period of angst trying to decipher the meaning of life in their own way. I went through mine during my early twenties, about a decade before Jeff (Jason Segal) did. At some point however you figure out that you better get on the stick or you'll find yourself with no cash and even fewer prospects. So I can relate.I'm reading some of the reviews for the film and starting to feel sorry for some of the folks who didn't see the humor here. There were some genuine laugh out loud moments in the first half before Jeff's mission started to materialize. However for this flick to work, forget about the randomness of the universe. There are probably more contrived and coincidental things happening during the course of the story to move it along than I've ever seen in a picture before. And of course, if it weren't for Jeff's laid back and easy going attitude, he would never have stuck it out with brother Pat's (Ed Helms) classic me-first attitude.What one is left with when it's all over, is a nagging feeling that all isn't right with the world after all. Pat's marriage is saved, mom Sharon's (Susan Sarandon) got a new perspective on relationships, and Jeff has found salvation after running into his third Kevin. However the demolished Porsche is in impound, and I'd bet that Jeff follows things up with a big fat doobie. Not exactly the feel good ending you get teased with at the final curtain. On top of that, I'd also be willing to bet that Jeff still lives at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK, but could have been more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with a lot of potential. A quite interesting plot (even though it's sometimes a bit too obvious) and great acting from three great and likable actors! Especially Susan Sarandon does a great job and her character feels really real. Unfortunately, everything else in the movie is rather poorly executed...The light is bad, the soundtrack sounds like an annoying phone signal and the constant work with the zoom every time someone reacts is not artistic in anyway, it's just plain irritating and kind of reduces the acting.I would also have wanted it to be more humor in the movie. Jason Segel and Ed Helms are funny guys, but the script does not give them a chance to really show it. Jeffs obsession with signs is a funny idea (the intro is hilarious) and they should have made more humor of it. However, the ending is quite nice and it saves the movie. And the last Kevin-thing is satisfying even though it's obvious and on the verge of cheesy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe there was something I missed, but I surprisingly didn't like this. Early on, the movie seems to compare itself to Signs, in how it meanders before finally making sense in the end. "Everything happens for a reason" as we know it. But whereas Signs had Shymalan's signature suspense and mystery to back itself up, Jeff just seems to merely meander. Maybe there's just something more to it, but the idiosyncratic style and uneven shifts between comedic and dramatic tones muddle down whatever the movie wants to say.I'm a huge Jason Segel fan, and I love Ed Helms as much as the next guy, and they are the best parts of this movie, especially when the two of them share moments of intimate conversation with one another. However, these moments, poignant though they may be, don't provide much help. Susan Sarandon is also trying her best, even if her alternate story feels like something out of a completely different movie. Even Judy Greer, whom I revere and adore, couldn't save this movie for me. Granted, I'm not discouraging anyone from seeing it, it's just that it didn't stick with ME.**1/2 / *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The search for meaning in this chaotic world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff (played by Jason Segel from How I Met Your Mother) is the perfect idealist who is searching for meaning in the world after the death of his father. Everything is a sign from the universe, no matter how trivial it seems to his brother Pat (played by Ed Helms from The Office). The brothers have a strained relationship, as Pat mocks Jeff's every thought. They have an even touchier relationship with their mother Sharon (played by Susan Sarandon), who receives messages from an anonymous admirer at her workplace. The film is driven by Jeff and Pat's pursuit of Pat's wife Linda (played by Judy Greer from What Women Want), as they suspect she is cheating on him. Throughout the course of the most adventurous day that you can imagine, Jeff, Pat, Linda, and Sharon undergo transformations that fundamentally change their relationships with each other and allow them to find meaning in this chaotic world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why, oh why have they described it as a comedy? It has nothing to do with a comedy, it is a damn melodrama, as funny and exciting as going to the funeral. This movie has so many flaws it is horrifying to watch. To begin with, I was extremely disappointed with Jason Segal acting ? I swear if it was Nicholas Cage instead of him, I wouldn't see any difference ? his stone-dead facial expression was really disturbing. Then comes the directors' share in the disaster ? what is the meaning of all those lengthy scenes ? the road rolling under the car's wheels or a nirvana moment under a fire sprinkle?? The action is already painfully slow, why would you slow it any further? And the soundtrack was the last blow to this piece of "art" ? sort of disturbing, profoundly sad chill-out music that gives you shivers.Looking for good stoner movies?

		<shortDescription>Boring, forgettable, unrealistic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting wobbled as much as the camera-work from boring and flat to jittery and overly stylized. None of the characters were particularly interesting nor were their lives. This movie doesn't really make it as a slice-of-life movie because the character's reactions to each other and the situations in which they found themselves were simply not believable. They were however all too often predictable and traditional TV/movie bits. The ending was too pat and gave a dutiful nod to the Hollywood/new age concept that we are all connected in a mystical spiritual world full of signs and portents. The movie was trying so hard to look meaningful it forgot to actually have any meaning. Only worth watching for the snob appeal of being able to say you watched it. Possibly a good date movie for a guy who is trying to impress an artsy girl who takes herself too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting . . . not exactly significant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some people have a theory that there is no such thing as coincidence; that everything that happens in life happens for one reason or another. Maintaining that state of mind, I would imagine, requires constant frustrating vigilance. You're always on the lookout for what connects one thing to another.Jeff (Jason Segal), the protagonist of Jeff Who Lives at Home thinks that way. He has plenty of time. He is just past 30, unemployed, lives in his mother's basement, smokes pot and hasn't had a girlfriend since high school. He watches the 2002 thriller Signs over and over again to reiterate his theory that nothing just happens, not even when he gets a phone call from a guy asking for someone named Kevin. Out on an errand for his mother, Jeff spots a guy with the name Kevin on the back of his jersey and follows him. It doesn't go well.Jeff has a brother Pat who is even more clueless. He is floating through a marriage to Linda (Judy Greer) that is going nowhere in particular. She wants to save money for a house, but he spends it on expensive things, like the Porsche he just bought because it was such a great deal. He makes her breakfast to break the news of his purchase and her response is to dump her breakfast on the hood.After Jeff's unfortunate run-in with Kevin, he runs into Pat (though not by coincidence) and the two spot Linda getting into a car with another man. Thus sets off a day of free-wheeling misadventures as they try to uncover the mystery of whether or not she is cheating on him. Pat is angry and wants to know who the mystery man is, while Jeff's eye is constantly following the signs to find out the meaning of "Kevin". No points for guessing that this will eventually lead to something.Meanwhile, Pat and Jeff's widowed mother Sharon (Susan Sarandon) works in an office cubicle and begins receiving instant messages from a secret admirer. The messages are sweet and clever and she becomes intrigued. Discovering the identity of the mystery person isn't that difficult. All you have to do is to follow the economy of characters in that office and you'll figure it out long before it is revealed.These three elements: Jeff's search for Kevin, Pat and Linda's marriage and Sharon's secret admirer lead up to a scene that brings them all together at the same place at the same time. Cosmically, there is a reason to this, so that all the characters can have closure to their individual problems. Although the revelation doesn't have as much meaning as we might hope. It is interesting how the movie gets the characters to that spot, but that's about it.There are two scenes in the movie that work perfectly, first is the scene when Pat finally confronts Linda about the other man. They have an argument that is full of truth and really seems to come out of reality. The other is the discovery of Sharon's secret admirer. What comes of it is briefly touching, but the movie moves past it so quickly that it feels like a loose end.Jeff Who Lives at Home is a nice, sweet movie of no real significance. It is appropriately funny when it needs to be; dramatic when it needs to be; and moving when the need arises. The disappointment is that it doesn't really go over the top with any of those things. I like it when a movie really reaches for something, but this movie climbs to the peak and reveals nothing surprising on the other side. I enjoyed the movie while I was watching it, but it isn't one that I am going to carry with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look. I can almost guarantee you that anyone who wrote a bad/okay review for this film, not only doesn't understand this movie, but most likely doesn't understand the universe, or the art of cinema. I would love to philosophize all day about how people are closed minded and essentially unaware of their existence, but I won't. I'm just going to say, being a cinematography major, this is what art looks like in film. It's anything but commercial. The camera work alone will pour emotions through your heart. This movie is not for everyone. But if you are debating on watching it, think Sideways, American Beauty, Demolition, Dead Poets Society. Except that this is a feel-good movie. And it's not like any other movie. Sideways is a good comparison, but I like this much better, it paints a much larger picture. Anyone can love this movie, honestly. Just, "Follow the signs, and you will uncover your destiny."-Jeff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Need to Talk About Kevin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acting on the belief that everything happens for a reason, a 30 year old layabout sets out on a quest to find out who "Kevin" might refer to after a wrong number phone call in this brisk independent American comedy. Jason Segel is well cast as the philosophical title character who waxes poetic over how the seeming randomness in films like M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs' leads to perfect moments, and while ostensibly pathetic (unemployed, living at home and no girlfriend), Segel moulds a surprisingly warm and likable character. His quest also has a delightful sense of spontaneity as he plans nothing in advance and simply goes off perceived clues that he finds along the way. Much of the film, however, revolves around him reconnecting with his narcissistic older brother, played by Ed Helms, who is rather grating. There is also an oddly slotted in subplot involving the brothers' mother, but Susan Sarandon is fortunately so solid and down-to-earth in the role that it seldom seems like a distraction when the film cuts away to her. Clocking in at just over 80 minutes, the one thing that can be said about 'Jeff, Who Lives at Home' is that it never outstays its welcome. The extremely upbeat note on which the film concludes seems a little at odds with the project's otherwise unglamorous take on very real people, but it is still a pleasant enough experience and one that leaves open some food for thought. The title character is the only person in the film who is content and optimistic throughout, so perhaps there is something to be said for being a 'slacker' in life?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, there are two ways to go about this movie. There's the way of a nice superficial 2 or 3 out of 10 and then you can actually try and understand it a bit. This was what I chose. The movie is heartbreaking. It's kind of random and weird but if you go along and stick with it, you can see that this is a masterpiece. The problems it discusses are there more and more frequently the past few years. It's a movie of its time, and it touches all the sensitive issues. It discusses about the alienation between family members as well as our inability to understand the different in all aspects of life, respect it and just nurture it. It also gets into the marital issues that drive so many couples apart. And although these seem a lot, and there are even more, it makes it. It gets you a small sample of everything, emotions flooding and leading you to maybe cry a bit but hopefully be a better person by the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Following familiar signs and forcing a preachy climax on destiny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stay pure of heart and you will see the signs. Follow the signs, and you will uncover your destiny."And with that opening title card we basically get what this film is all about: a 30 year old man living in his mother's basement awaiting for a specific sign to discover his destiny while he sits back in his couch smoking weed. This was the Duplass brothers fourth feature film working together as directors, although with a much bigger budget this time around which enabled them to hire well known actors. Their screenplay has its sweet and funny moments, but you can't help but feel the familiarity of the story. For a film centering on looking for signs and following them, this movie does so in a very predictable and obvious way with stereotypical characters. Jeff, Who Lives at Home also manages to wrap things up in a neat and convenient way so I really didn't find anything about the story very unique or interesting. As a fan of Shyamalan's Signs I did enjoy the references Jeff makes towards it and how it basically dictates his own personal life, but I was expecting some surprises along the way. In the very first scene of the movie we are introduced to Jeff (Jason Segel) and in only a few seconds we know exactly what kind of person he is. He is a man child who hasn't quite figured out what to do with his life, but he doesn't seem too worried about it either. He is waiting for the signs to point him to his destiny. When he receives a phone call of someone asking for Kevin he immediately takes it as a sign that he should search for a Kevin instead of just discarding it as a misdialed call. A few minutes later he receives another call, but this time it's his mother, Sharon (Susan Sarandon), who is calling him from her office and asking him to go to Home Depot to fix something in the house. Sharon is worried about Jeff, and she wants him to get on track with his life. She asks his brother, Pat (Ed Helms), to encourage him, but he is going through some marital problems with his wife Linda (Judy Greer). Pat isn't the ideal husband and he doesn't even consider asking Linda for advice when it comes to big decisions such as buying a brand new Porsche. This of course brings friction to their relationship. On his way to the Home Depot, Jeff sees a young teen wearing a jersey with the name Kevin on the back, so of course he takes it as a sign and follows him. These signs inadvertently lead him to the exact place where his brother Pat is and while the two are catching up they discover Linda is with another man. Could this be the reason why Jeff has been led to his brother? To help him discover if his wife is cheating on him? From this point on a series of casualties ensue.The film relies on the strong chemistry between Segel and Helms, two very talented and funny actors. They both play characters they're very familiar and comfortable playing, Segel the childish and naive slacker son, Helms the uptight and career driven husband. The highlight of the film is watching these two great actors interact with each other despite all the schmaltz. The subplot revolving around Susan Sarandon's character and her secret admirer didn't really tie up to the story and only seemed to serve as a filler for the feature length time. Judy Greer is also comfortable in her role here, but she doesn't really get much to do here other than be the victim who her husband never really listens to. Despite some scattered funny moments which can be mostly attributed to the talented cast, the ending felt way too sappy and convenient and ultimately hindered my appreciation of the film. It simply tried to force the underlying message of the movie of destiny and it only added to the overall sentimentality of the film. The cinematography was also distracting at times with too many quick zoom-ins on the characters faces. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We often go through our ordinary lives without truly living and making a difference. It's up to charming indie films like "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" to inspire us. Independent films often touch something true and deep, that many mainstream blockbusters don't come close to. The Duplass brothers are indie kings. They're kind enough to cast Jason Segal, Ed helms, and Susan Sarandon in a film that costs virtually nothing. Jason Segal gives one of his between roles as Jeff, a low- life underachiever who lives in his mother's basement. off on an errand, he spends the afternoon with his miserable brother Pat (Ed Helms) as they track down his wife who they are convinced is having an affair. With only 83 minutes of screen-time, The Duplass brothers pack in hilarious dry humor and touching family scenes that go beyond what may seem expected. The whole central idea these boys try and touch is how there is always destiny in life. Jeff and Pat couldn't have been more likable and refreshing characters to enjoy. We get tons of development from them, and tackle their journey with them. Ed Helms and Jason Segal work brilliantly together. They change the feeling of the film in seconds. It's surprising how hard you can laugh before crying your eyes out due to beautiful brotherly contact. Veteran actress Susan Sarandon is superb as always. We're gifted to have her play the brothers mom, who we learn is having her own crisis after the death of her husband. "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" does get a little pretentious and overdone towards the end, but it's a real audience pleaser that tries to tell an impactful story in the most meaningful way without missing its feel-good effect. Remember, it's a comedy, meaning we do get a lot of mischief between the boys, which may frustrate some viewers. I couldn't have liked it more. This is the pleaser that makes you stand up and cheer if you'r lucky enough to hear about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whoops, not as funny as I thought</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was probably my fault. They say you should never judge a book by a cover and, in this case, I didn't really read much about the film before I watched it. I just looked at the cover and figured it was going to be one of those light-hearted 'Judd Apatow' adult comedies where things get a little silly and a lot saucy. I was wrong.They claim 'Jeff, Who Lives at Home' is a comedy, but I would say that if falls firmly in the 'off-beat drama' category. It's about two brothers (one a slacker who lives at home - Jeff, obviously) and one who's trying to make his way in the business world and their capers dealing with a day of fate and revelations when they think the brother's wife is having an affair. All in all, that sounds like a reasonably good recipe for comedy, but the film focuses on the more quirky dramatic aspect of it all, rather than pies landing in people's faces.It's one of those films that probably requires a second viewing to appreciate it properly. I sat down expecting an American Pie-esque comedy. Therefore I was always going to be disappointed. However, if you're in the mood for something just a little bit more dramatic where the humour is a lot more subtle, this one could be for you.As a comedy it's only a 6/10, but as a drama it should be looked at a little more highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff, Who Lives At Home is a great example of an indie film. Jeff, a 30-year-old slacker, is searching for meaning in an aimless life, looking at pop culture references for a sign.Jeff's journey may seem like a simple one, but his mission to buy wood-glue for a broken shutter is not dissimilar to Odysseus's epic return. The twist in the third act underscores the idea that within all of us lies a destiny. (Jeff, Who Becomes a Hero, as a title, would've given it away.) Jason Segel gives a great goofy charm to the lead character, and he is ably supported by Ed Helms as his obnoxious and insensitive brother. Susan Sarandon is faultless as the mother looking for a sign of her own as she suffers bleak corporate office cubicle.Ultimately, this is not only a comedy about a slacker living in his mother's basement, but a hopeful look at family and what that word means. It starts slow, then reveals some wonderful surprises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff (Jason Segel) is 30 and living in his mother Sharon (Susan Sarandon)'s basement. He's aimless and unemployed. His favorite movie is 'Signs', and he's looking for signs for a direction in his life. He answers an angry phone call from someone looking for Kevin. When he sees someone in a jersey with Kevin on the back, he follows him around. Meanwhile, Jeff's brother Pat (Ed Helms) is a bad salesman and he angers his wife Linda (Judy Greer) by buying a Porsche. Sharon has a secret admirer at work.It's a Duplass brothers movie. They do these whimsical indie movies. These characters are not particularly likable to me. Jeff is weirdly fixated on Kevins. Pat is way too angry to like. Ed Helms plays such an annoying character. It's hard to get into the brothers' relationship. If he could play anger without being a douche, I might find some humor in this. I don't find anything about them funny. That's the threshold that I need to cross for this movie. It's just not funny to me. The ending wraps things up nicely but it's a long unfunny road getting there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is gonna go down as one of my favourite cult films, with lots of unusual goings on and a wacky structure to it that I've never seen before. The whole thing kicks off when a stay-at-home nerd Jeff takes a wrong number from someone looking for a guy called Kevin, and from that point on that name holds particular significance to him, and he must follow anything with that moniker attached to it.It only gets odder from there, as the rest of his family aren't any less strange either... his brother is obsessed at the prospect of his wife having an affair and so keeps her under constant surveillance, and his mother is being passed anonymous love notes at the office... which turn out to be from another woman.It all might sound as though it's silly for the sake of it, but there is an underlying structure to all this mayhem which only becomes clear a few minutes before the ending credits. Until then, the pleasures are bountiful...We hear REAL people talk, not one dimensional cyphers, and they're warm and witty, and we like all of them. These are the sort of individuals I want at my funeral (But let's save that discussion for another day) We care about their fates, and the many snarky exchanges (especially between Jeff and his brother) make it laugh-out-loud funny too. Plus, at a time when originality in cinema is so rare, here's a relative gold mine of ideas.I get the feeling that the rewatchability (Not a word, but who cares?) aspect of this film is high, as so much goes on you'll have forgotten about half of it by the next day. And believe me, I intend to prove that in the future. Fabulous. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Needed to Talk About Kevin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How's this for a movie twist? I wanted to watch We Need to Talk About Kevin, but realized I didn't have access to that movie and settled on Jeff, Who Lives at Home and the entire idea of the movie is based around talking about a "Kevin" who will lead our "hero" Jeff to?something?meaningful.Well, "Kevin" led me to something insightful, all right: a very nice little indie that satisfyingly served my emotions right for the night.Now, I've been a Mumblecore fan over the years. They're the little independent films mostly done by the Duplass brothers (see the Mark one on the awesome FX series: The League) and they show every bit of a "low budget." I doubt this film will fit in that category, even though it's written/directed by both Jay and Mark Duplass. Regardless, it's got their charm all around.Jeff (Jason Segel) does, in fact, live at home and smokes pot, has less than a percent of ambition and gets freaked by a landline phone call from someone looking for a "Kevin." Originally, that's incidental to his mission to head to Home Depot to buy supplies for home repair, his mother requests.Sidetracked ? or was he? ? stoner Jeff wanders in a quest to find the meaning of said "KEVIN" and repeatedly works with and bumps into his straight-laced brother, Pat (Ed Helms, who slightly channels his The Office character, Andy) to spy on his mid-life marriage crisis unfolding.As with a lot of indie films that don't have the budget to execute a fulfilling conclusion, I expected the worst. Sure, I would've still liked the film although I still expected the open-interpreted cop-out and low-cost finale. Mercifully, this one might have rode on the star power to get the ending we all wanted. Needed.NO?I'm not attempting to spoil anything. It's just suffice to say, they don't end it like some first-time writers/directors leave the audience with the ocean-wide finale so that "people will talk" which I am finding tedious (and clich) as of late.Now, the movie isn't perfect by any means, and like most fictional movies that were based on other fictional movies (they tell you this one's based on another movie in minute one) it's hard to live up to expectations. I'm a fan of Swordfish ? which many are not ? and both movies come with the opening speech concerning what movie this is based on. That's like me making my $1,000 movie and saying how much I LOVED Halloween in the opening. It's doubtful my movie will pan out as masterful.Also, while I like the message, the deliberate pacing and most of the lines, it wasn't an outright laugh-fest nor had the deepest of meanings. I think it wanted to, but failed just shy of that.Still, it's enjoyable, and I loved the third act. Yeah, even with the most obvious revelation in the middle section with momma bear, Sharon's (Susan Sarandon) character.</fullReview>

Unfortunately most of them were entirely predictable; the lone exception being the final climatic scene (but that was followed by a VERY predictable denouement). While performances were decent all around, the characters were poorly developed. Thus you never get pulled into the story and you never really feel anything for any of them. The obligatory indie-emotional xylophone soundtrack made me feel like the film makers were trying a final gimmick to make me feel something. Throughout the film I kept thinking the writers (Jay &amp; Mark Duplass) were trying their best to write a Charlie Kaufman script. It falls far short of that. Sadly, I just felt like I was watching someone try too hard to make this into something it is not: relevant &amp; poignant.</fullReview>

And boy, for old Jeff, Who Lives at Home, he seems to not spend all that much time there. I mean he takes the bus to get some wood glue and by the time he comes home with it, he's staked out his sister-in-law and tried to break up a sexing session in a hotel room, he's conspired with his brother to stake out a lunch date, he's been mugged by and smoked out with someone (who probably isn't really named Kevin), and his mom has been turned bi. Pretty normal day for most people...But, although this movie was fairly banal and seemingly meaningless for the first hour with us really seeing little more than Jason Segel do facial expressions and Ed Helms descend further into self-parody, the end scene was a payoff like rarely seen in cinema these days. With the son who lost his dad too soon (Jason Segel, Jeff) able to follow a series of unintelligible hunches and arrive in a place to save a pair of daughters from ultimately losing their dad was good karmic retribution. The fact that he was able to draw closer to his brother and save his brother's marriage in the process was icing on the cake. As he mentioned about his dream, and as The Smashing Pumpkins put so well, it was all about Today being the most important.As for the acting, it was OK. Susan Sarandon (Sharon) was a revelation. Everyone knows she can act, but she just never mails it in and I love that about her. Although there was a scene in which she turned bi with just a 30 second phone call followed by the fire alarm being set off at work, that's on the writing not the acting. Jason Segel was pretty good too. Ed Helms (Pat) was his usual poor-acting self, unfortunately.My main issue about this film was that I'm not sure why they titled this JEFF, WHO LIVES AT HOME. The reasons being that his living at home had nearly nothing to do with the story. He could have been a Wall Street stockbroker and the story would've been virtually the same. And, I'm sorry but older people who "live at home" would never display those heroic qualities of jumping in the drink with no hesitation. Otherwise, he'd be Jeff, Who Works for the Police or Jeff, Who Served in the Army, or maybe Jeff, Who is a Paramedic and Drives an Ambulance. I realize that the director was probably going for an extraordinary deed from an ordinary person, but I'm not buying it.TL;DR: A pretty solid movie. If you can stomach gratuitous amounts of Ed Helms, you should enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny and enjoyable comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a feel good and yet funny comedy that I enjoyed watching thoroughly. In fact at some points I didn't want it to end because it's just entertaining to watch how the character interact with each other. The story is about Jeff who is a bit socially different and lives with his mom and believes in some comic force and destiny. And is the most likable character in this movie. He is played by Jason Segel and I don't know how anyone else could have taken this role. His brother on the other hand played by Ed Helms is the most practical brother from the two and is sarcastic about everything that he doesn't feel to be practical. And the mother of the two brothers played by Susan Sarandon is dealing with inner problems of starting to dislike his sons and yearning for a love life. And how it all comes together at the end. It was just fun how each character deals with their problems, especially Jeff who is constantly trying to chase his destiny. This is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy that is worth seeing. It almost made me want to chase something that is a random occurrence as well, kinda.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen a movie by the Duplass brothers, so didn't know what to expect going in. If you have strong ties to your family, particularly to your sibling(s), this movie will move you. It is a funny movie that explores a lot of the ups and downs that brothers experience growing up. Ed Helms and Jason Segal play their parts perfectly. Jason, the younger of the two, is the reclusive loner who has not figured out what to do with his life, while Ed the more successful brother (at least from the outside) battles the trials and tribulations of middle age. A nice little side story involving Susan Sarandon and her secret admirer lends a depth to this movie that it would have otherwise lacked. The plot comes together at the end, and you feel for each one of the characters. It is a funny movie that makes you think hard about the people who really matter to you in this world. Hilarious, poignant and moving. Definitely watch this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Jeff, Who Lives at Home" is NOT a film for everyone. It is very indie in style and features mixed up characters who are difficult, at times, to like. It is far from the sort of thing you'd expect to see from Hollywood, that's for sure.Jason Siegal stars as the title character. He's a 30 year-old loser--with no job and living in his mother's basement. He sits around smoking a bong and has little going for him other than, down deep, he is still a very nice person. Much of the film concerns him and his brother, Pat (Ed Helms) who is MUCH easier to dislike. Unlike the optimistic Jeff, Pat is caustic--critical and not particularly nice. Their mother (Susan Sarandon) is frustrated with her life...though she has a hard time recognizing this. By the end of the film, events have taken place that both bring them all together and get them all to reassess who they are.As you can tell, this is certainly not a traditional plot. It's much more like a typical Duplass Brothers film--with realistic but highly flawed characters that you grow to like in spite of themselves. However, unlike one of their films, they apparently impressed someone with money, as this one has major stars and obviously cost much more to make. Not a brilliant film but there are many, many small moments that you'll appreciate. Also, it starts off VERY slow--stick with this one.By the way, in a supporting part you'll probably recognize Steve Zissis from anther Duplass film, "The Do-Deca Decathlon".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dispatched from his basement room on an errand for his mother, slacker Jeff (Jason Segel) might discover his destiny (finally) when he spends the day with his brother (Ed Helms) as he tracks his possibly adulterous wife (Judy Greer).Roger Ebert called the film "a whimsical comedy (that depends) on the warmth of Segel and Sarandon, the discontent of Helms and Greer, and still more warmth that enters at midpoint with Carol (Rae Dawn Chong), Sarandon's co-worker at the office." And while this is certainly true, there is much more, too...The film starts with a riff on the film "Signs" (and actually continues that riff for the duration of the movie) but then actually transcends the film it was apparently inspired by. This movie is more fun, funnier, more repeat watchable... and possibly even more touching. While not the perfect film (what is?), it should not have gone under the radar like it did... this had real potential. Have we found the next Wes Anderson?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Full fledged adventure, in a day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about a mother, her romantically challenged son and her dreaming slacker son, all very lonely and disorganized. The story begins with Jeff (Jason Segel), a 30 year pot head that lives in his mothers basement. Jeff believes that everything is a sign or has a deeper meaning. He receives a mysterious phone call asking for a "Kevin", but he doesn't know a Kevin. He takes this as a sign. He is somewhat philosophical but is viewed as a slacker by his mom, Sharon (Susan Sarandon) and his brother Pat (Ed Helms). Pat is a mono-toned and pretentious salesman. We are introduced to Pat and his wife Linda (Judy Greer) at breakfast. Pat attempts to water the dying flower that is their marriage with breakfast and a not so welcomed surprise, a new Porsche boxster. This sprouts into an argument do to the fact that they don't have the money and that ultimately, Pat made the decision without Linda. Linda vents her frustration by throwing the breakfast onto the car as passive-aggressive Pat watches. We are brought back to Jeff who receives another call and is hesitant, it is his mother Sharon asking him to go out and get a new shutter for the pantry. She really intends on getting her middle aged son out of the house. Jeff than leaves for what is more than just a trip to home depot. He begins seeing signs relating to "Kevin" such as a kid with the same name, he follows the kid resulting in his mugging as well as crossing paths with his brother, Pat while he is at Hooters. The brothers than crash the new car into a tree. Pat pays some people off to not call the police due to the fact that Pat had been drinking. They spot Pat's wife, Linda at a gas station with another man in the car. They proceed to follow her around to find out what is going on. All this is happening while Sharon is at the office receiving hints from a secret admirer over IM. She is excited but also cautious because of her insecurities with her age and her body along with the fear of rejection, or being the butt of a joke. She confides in her friend Carol ( Rae Dawn Chong) as she continues to wonder who the secret admirer is. The movie seems to have a lot of content packed into one day. Jeff and Pat are chasing around Pat's wife, Linda, in suspicion of infidelity. Sharon is desperately searching for her secret admirer who has an inflated importance because of her loneliness. The film feels like a climax to a much longer movie. In the matter of a day we see Jeff conflicting with Pat, Pat conflicting with his wife, Linda and Sharon conflicting with both of her sons and all of them conflicting with themselves. The story results in the saving of lives along with the saving of their own lives. Through a series of traumatic events we find the characters re-prioritize and come together as a family. The climax is what made my rating a 7/10. It felt like everything was happening all at once (in a day) and made it feel pretty unrealistic. The movie than hit the climax which provided an interesting turn in the story. This comedy-drama felt like another Step Brothers (Will Ferrell and John C Reilly) at first but proved to be more of a family drama with a few decently funny scenes. Overall a good film even though I don't feel the need to watch it again anytime soon or really boast about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Quirkly Duplass Brothers Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Indie writer/director brothers Mark and Jay Duplass comes the movie that was my favorite film of the 2011 Austin Film Festival and is now available on DVD and On Demand. This quirky comedy stars Jason Segal and Ed Helms as two very different brothers who are brought together by fate and strange circumstances.Jason Segal is Jeff, a stoner who lives in his mom's basement. He strongly believes in fate and that everything in the world is somehow connected and has a purpose. While sitting on the couch getting' high he gets a wrong number phone call from a guy asking for "Kevin". Jeff lets him know that nobody named "Kevin" lives there. He is then berated by a bunch of angry expletives and hangs up. This begins Jeff's journey through the film. He sort of reminds me of another famous slacker named Jeff, "The Dude, or El Duderino if your not into the whole brevity thing" I'm talking about one of my all-time favorite movies "The Big Lebowski" Although this Jeff does have his own style, their outlook on life is quite similar. His mother Sharon is played by Susan Sarandon, an office worker looking for something more in her life as she is starting to feel her age. She ends up finding excitement in the form of a secret admirer.Ed Helms plays Jeff's older somewhat more successful brother Pat. He is married to Linda (Judy Greer) and has just bought a Porsche without consulting her. Needless to say after dropping this bomb their relationship in walking a fine line. Since they live in an apartment and don't have any kids, Linda suggests that it would be easy to go their separate ways. Over the course of the film, with Jeff's help, he rediscovers his love for her and what he really wants out of life. Finding your place and connecting with family is a big theme in this seemingly dopey comedy.Taking place over one day Jeff has one job to do. Take the bus to Home Depot and buy a bottle of glue to fix a kitchen cabinet. On the bus he is distracted by a guy wearing a basketball jersey with the name "Kevin" on the back. He thinks this is a sign and follows the guy only to get mugged in the end. This does however lead him to Pat who is spying on his wife. She is having lunch with another man and Pat thinks she could be having an affair. The movie revolves around the brothers relationship and their misadventures. The Duplass brothers have a unique way of making movies that are very real and heartfelt. Although not much seems to happen in the course of the story, you can't help but feel like you been on a journey of discovery with these characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff's a whacky, outside-the-box kind of guy, a devotee of M. Night Shyamalan who's been looking for a Sign in some of the wrong places. He's also a type beloved of indie screenwriters, of course, and the Duplass brothers have come up with an awesome 45 minutes or so of screwball comedy, preceded by a leisurely buildup and followed by a listless feelgood ending, for a total running time of 83 minutes. Good work by Jason Segel and Ed Helms (not exactly playing against type as Jeff's selfish asshole brother), Judy Greer (she's great but does she ever not play the wronged, put-upon wife?) and Susan Sarandon; haven't seen much of Rae Dawn Chong since she was a nubile cavegirl back in the day. Didn't expect they'd all be living somewhere outside New Orleans, presumably for tax purposes. The good stuff is really good, but I was disappointed the bros couldn't go the distance. PS?a cynical reviewer on Netflix suggests that an obscure indie film like this couldn't have prompted so many online reviews unless they were being churned out by "a small group of poorly paid people," to which I say: if only!</fullReview>

The script is forced and uninspired and the cinematography and direction are horrible, the camera keeps zooming in and out and makes it almost unwatchable.</fullReview>

It says we are living in a disappointing world that only those who have tasted the sadness can help others. It sounds a bit dramatic. Just like the proverb; poor are more generous!

		<shortDescription>Charming indie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess that my favourite type of movies are the low budget independent movies. "Jeff, who lives at home" very much falls into this category and it is very enjoyable.The story mainly focuses on the relationship between 2 brothers Jeff (Jason Segal) and Pat (Ed Helms). The brothers have totally different personalities and the interaction should be very familiar to most people with brothers and/or sisters. In common with many indie films there isn't too much of a plot to follow, it is all about the interaction between the characters. Segal is brilliant in the lead role and he's ably supported by the rest of the cast which also includes Susan Sarandon. This film definitely isn't one for the adrenaline junkies, but if you are into off-beat character studies it is very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly as good as 'CYRUS' but it's still a pretty good little film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'JEFF, WHO LIVES AT HOME': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Brothers Jay and Mark Duplass wrote and directed this offbeat comedy-drama film about a slacker-stoner, who still lives at home with his mom, spending the day with his brother, following his possibly adulterous wife, while looking for signs to his destiny. The Duplass brothers made a name for themselves making ultra-low budget 'mumblecore' films, that became classics of the genre, and are now trying to go a little more mainstream. In 2010 they made the John C. Reilly / Jonah Hill anti-buddy film 'CYRUS' (which is one of my favorite films of that year). This quirky little 'life lesson' isn't quite as impressive as 'CYRUS' but it's still a more than decent offering from the brothers that's definitely worth a look!The film stars Jason Segel as Jeff, an unemployed 30-year-old stoner who lives in his mom's basement spending all his time getting stoned and watching TV. He's a dreamer who believes in destiny and is currently obsessed with the M. Night Shyamalan film 'SIGNS'. He's watched it repeatedly and is now looking for signs in his own life that will lead him to his life's purpose. He receives a wrong number phone call for a man named Kevin and believes that's a sign that he must follow. His mom Sharon (Susan Sarandon) calls from work demanding he leave the house and go on an errand for her, especially considering it's her birthday. While on the errand he runs in to his brother Pat (Ed Helms), who's just gotten in to a big fight with his wife, Linda (Judy Greer), over the porsche he bought that they can't afford. While Jeff continues to follow clues which feature the name Kevin the two spot Linda with another man (Steve Zissis). They begin to follow her and a series of crazy events cause the day to become more and more hectic. At the same time Sharon learns she has a secret admirer at work. The Duplass brothers claim they cried through the entire premier of this movie! I didn't find it quite that moving (they're a lot closer to the film though of course) but I did find it emotional and inspirational, especially when everything finally builds to a climax. The film was not nearly as funny as I was expecting, given the cast and the filmmakers previous effort ('CYRUS' was hilarious!), but there are more than a few LOL moments and the situations as a whole are very humorous. It doesn't really matter that the film doesn't work that well as a comedy though because it's still a very lovable and quirky little movie. The characters are likable (and you do end up caring about them) and like I said it's emotional and inspirational. I really liked the overall idea and message for the film as well. It is flawed and not nearly as good as 'CYRUS' but it's still a pretty good little film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOMEqlGt6m4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought it was good. I enjoyed watching it and I was intrigued about the character's climax. I was hoping for the relationship to work, the secret admirer to be true and Jeff to find his destiny. I thought the acting was solid, nothing over or under. Their was a few funny moments too, I have to admit I did laugh a bit. But I respected it wasn't comedy and it was better that way. Although, initially, I thought it was going to be comedy because of Jason Siegel and Ed Helms appearances.As the story progressed I was intrigued. I was genuinely worried about the characters and I connected with them. Mostly because how well each actor plays them and how much they suited them.The ending was a bit melodramatic, it could have done removing maybe one or two things and it tried to be a little too smart for its own good and maybe that was a good thing, but not in my opinion. The film is no masterpiece, but it is an enjoyable little film if you like these types of films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fate is what we make it...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sweet natured indie Dramedy by the Duplass brothers takes its starting point from the movie 'Signs', which posits that the unrelated trivialities of life hold a stronger more meaningful interconnectedness. And thus, after a wrong number asking for 'Kevin', slacker Jeff (Segel) embarks on a series of misadventures, ostensibly to purchase wood glue to repair a wooden slat, but in actuality allowing this search to reveal the unpredictability of a meandering quest for a 'destiny' of any kind. Jeff's mother, Sharon (Sarandon) is a bored office working widower whose day is brightened by an instant message from a 'secret admirer'. And his odious, yet redeemable brother Pat (Helms) is struggling to hold on to his marriage with the potentially adulterous Linda (the often overlooked, but superb, Greer). It is these disparate narrative strands of a distant and dysfunctional family unit that are woven together by Jeff's pursuance of 'Kevin', told through a mildly frenetic and documentary like lens. The plot occasionally flounders, due to its own exploration of randomness, but at a brisk 82 minutes it's always engaging. The denouement is a touch heavy handed, but perhaps necessarily so, offering a comment on the human need for a strong and complete sense of fulfilment. What we are ultimately provided with is an unpretentious and entertaining microcosmic view of the haphazardness of existence and the arbitrary nature of fate. Oh, and it's funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jeff, Who Lives at Home so wants to be profound. That's unfortunate, because it possesses all the right ingredients for a solid plain-Jane comedy ? a talented cast, a unique concept and some witty moments. The problem is this film ventures outside of its element. It's not satisfied with the strictures of its genre; instead it so desperately wants to play like The Descendants and leave the impact of Signs. Not in the alien or carnage sense but in the "putting it all together with life's little lessons" sense. It endeavors but fails badly, lacking the equivalent talent, writing, all so important attention to details and of course the metaphorical prophetic girl holding glasses of water. Instead, what we get here is a different kind of family story: first, Ed Helms and his terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day (e.g. Porsche destroyed - check. A potentially Charlatan wife - check. Apologizing to wife for HER infidelities ?check), second, Susan Surandan and her hunt for the office SECRET admirer and third, the protagonist Jason Segel aka Jeff ? the film's Yoda. In the end, they attempt that magic moment ? where everything falls in place, ala, Signs. It comes off so forced and, yes, predictable.</fullReview>

His brother not so much, as Ed Helms seems to have a limited amount of tricks in his acting hat, he's always acting like slightly different versions of basically the same character. Their mom is the single saddest person that was committed to film in quite some time and it's a testament to Sarandon's acting prowess that my heart went out to her each and every time she was on screen. Her loneliness, desperation, and sadness was palpable. And while the ending seemed way too pat for my tastes, it didn't cause me to have ill will towards the film..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JEFF, WHO LIVES AT HOME - 7.5/10.I can honestly admit that prior to watching this film I was expecting a half-hearted attempt at a wannabe-indie-comedy; this is only because there had not been much buzz around it here in the UK so I foolishly assumed that it was one to miss. I could not have been more wrong. This film has more heart than any film I have seen in a while and it truly is beautiful.The main reason I did decide to watch this film was the seemingly impressive cast, namely the two lead actors that are Jason Segel and Ed Helms, both of whom have delivered extraordinary performances in the past. First of all who better to play a slacking yet lovable pothead than Jason Segel and he does it with such grace on this particular occasion that when it comes to the second half of the film you almost forget entirely the fact that his character, Jeff, was essentially down and out from the film's inception. Then you have Ed Helms' character Pat who you are forced to dislike within mere minutes of being introduced. From the outset Pat is impulsive and inconsiderate which immediately provides an exquisite conflict between the two dominating personalities in Jeff, Who Lives at Home.Essentially there are three different plots running at the same time here, the first being the most prominent which is Jeff and Pat's mission to uncover the secrets of Pat's wife, Linda (played by Judy Greer) and her affair. Surprisingly I actually felt that this storyline was the weakest in terms of meaningfulness despite being the most entertaining but I think that this is mainly due to the fact that it got the most attention from the writers as it is the fundamental basis for the other two plots. There really isn't much to comment on here apart from the fact that this is the storyline that generates the most laughs; mainly from seeing Ed Helms run around with a strained expression on his face as he tries to track down his wife (or Porsche, whichever seems more appealing at the time) while Jeff trails behind still half-stoned.The second plot is the alarmingly touching sub-storyline of Jeff and Pat's mother Sharon (played extremely well by Susan Sarandon) and her 'secret admirer'. This took me by absolute surprise because it is just so far from what we would have expected to happen in a scenario like this. The easy way out would have been to provide Sharon with a strapping middle-aged role model to act as a father figure for Jeff and Pat however it becomes evident that the Duplass (Jay and Mark - Directors/Writers) brothers don't like taking the easy way out and I can't praise them enough for that. The turn that this particular plot takes is so fantastic that spoiling it for you would be a sin in my eyes ? you'll just have to go and see it for yourselves.Finally we have Jeff's ongoing personal struggle to try and discover his destiny in life. This is introduced to us as soon as the film starts where Jeff ponders the film Signs (M. Night Shyamalan's multi-million dollar blockbuster starring Mel Gibson) whilst poised in a majestic fashion on the toilet whilst trying to figure out what his future might have in store for him and how he can use signs to help him find it. This plot is just sort of dragged through the whole film while the first two take the spotlight however it is in the final 10 minutes or so where you are once again swept off your feet. At risk of saying too much I will stop now as I really can't do it justice with words.All three of these plots are equally engaging and perfectly written. The reason I believe these are perfectly written is because when all of these plots come together at the end of the film it makes your heart warm! It is absolutely astounding the effect that the Duplass brothers manage to induce onto their viewers with this movie! It is certainly not as dark natured as Cyrus (2010 release from the Duplass brothers, stars Jonah Hill and John C. Reilly) but in my opinion it is a lot more developed in terms of script and character development, it is also a hell of a lot more engaging.Jeff, Who Lives at Home is marketed as a comedy. While it certainly does contain some comedic value I would say that this film is essentially a drama, and a very good one. If you were, like me, expecting a comedy please do not be put off because I guarantee that you won't be let down by this movie as it is in my virtually impossible to dislike. I may go as far to call this the most likable movie of 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***spoiler***This is seriously the worst movie that I've ever seen. If someone offered me $100 to watch this whole thing again, I am not joking at all when I say that I would turn it down. This is not a comedy and it is not even remotely funny.Nothing happens the whole entire movie... I literally watched the whole time waiting for some sort of story to come out of this, but nothing! Oh then at the end he gets stuck in a traffic jam and his entire family and everybody that he knows just happens to be there at the exact traffic jam at the exact same time.

		<shortDescription>What's with the camera work?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, it's a good script with good editing and wonderful acting. In fact, the acting is the best part of this film. Everyone in the cast is tremendous. But but but...the reason I even checked in on this film is because of the camera work. I read the reviews to see if anyone mentioned it. I only found one guy who had. The reality is that the camera work almost sinks this film. For some reason, someone decided to arbitrarily zoom on almost every shot - in and out! Randomly, without any logical point related to story. Now generally you keep you hands off the zoom in film because it is unbelievably distracting. Pulls the audience right out of the film every time. In this film, the camera will zoom in, then zoom in again, and then zoom back out without any justification. No reason for it. It's like some kid got into the studio and grabbed hold of the zoom. I can't figure out why they did it. But it really damaged what otherwise would have been a much more solid film. I don't know whose idea all the zooming was - the cinematographer Jas Shelton's? The Duplass directors? If it was the cinematographer's idea, the directors should have pulled him back and made him stop it. If it was the directors idea, then they should have noticed during the first dailies that it doesn't work and reshot. Really unfortunate decision. It doesn't ruin the film, mainly because it's a solid story and the acting is so good, but believe me, when you watch the film, it will drive you crazy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet, Unexpected Character Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"People break down into two groups. When they experience something lucky, group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence. They see it as a sign."Jeff is a daydreaming slacker who lives in his mother's basement, smoking weed and contemplating M. Night Shyamalan. He spends his days waiting for destiny to come calling and when his phone rings for a man named Kevin, he's sure it has come. "Group number two sees it as just pure luck. Just a happy turn of chance."Pat, Jeff's brother, works hard and tries hard and does everything he's supposed to. Like most of us, he believes in coincidence and willfully ignores fate, even when it's sleeping with his wife. Pat and Jeff's mother, Sharon, is a lonely office worker, tired of her basement-dwelling son and unappreciated by her other. When a secret admirer takes an interest in her, she's half sure it's a joke and wholly hoping it's not.Jeff, Who Lives At Home was nothing like I expected it to be. There weren't many laugh out loud parts and no cheap jokes, but it was charming and beautifully acted. Don't watch expecting your average stoner humour, because what you'll get is a sweet film about fate and taking risks when life has left you with nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was looking for a relatively short comedy film to watch and found this one, the rating looked OK and the cast looked familiar so I thought it would be OK. I was very wrong.First of all it is listed as a 'comedy' - I don't think I laughed once. The plot is weak and never fully explained who the hell Kevin is, its just stupid with really longed out scenes of absolutely nothing happening. It could be looked at as a drama but as I said the plot is just so weak you feel no attachment to the characters what so ever. I would definitely recommend to avoid this one at all costs. 2/10.</fullReview>

I didn't like that kind a movie, it was about free love with anybody but also kept the meaning of the family. It starts with a negative life feeling with a boring kid who has a boring family. Anybody in this movie has a pointless life. Plus is has a really slow procession to show the life could be good. There isn't humor in this movie, it tries to, but can't touch your lung to laugh but he classification said it's a comedy. There isn't any action really, it's all predictable easily. I don't know who directed the movie 'cause I din't saw any other movies of his repertoire, but I confirm it was waste of time and money to spent to watch and make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Showing, and not telling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts out somewhat complex and absurd, but ends up telling a story of the simplicity of life and fate.Although the story, and the way it's told, may seem wildly absurd. That's because it is, but sometimes that's the way life is. It may be classified as a comedy, but the plot is deeper than that. It deeply reaches into how simply we can relate to each other as humans, and how that simplicity speaks volumes compared to our usual petty small talk and cynical mockingly dialogue we drape ourselves in.The idea of fate is of course abstract and intangible, but we're shown how it may work, and how the smaller things leads to the bigger ones. Fate is behind a veil of seemingly unimportant, ridiculous events and coincidences that only a dope-head would be able to recognize. Go figure. But it shows that unsought spirituality and meaning in meaningless places play a pivotal part in our lives.The most important thing about the movie is that it's showing us, but not telling us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Save your 83 minutes of life on this one. Terrible filmaking. Story could have been OK with good camera work and cinematography and better dialouge. Don't know what the producers/directors were out to accomplish on this one. Student film making? Too, too many implausibilites to make this even a tiny bit realistic. The two leads, JASON and ED were unbearable!!! The language was not called for in a film like this. The sub-plot with SUSAN SARANDON was uncalled for, although she did a wonderful job as she always does. The fact that she could make her character work is indeed Oscar awarding itself. Nice to see RAE DAWN CHONG again. Again, don't waste your time on this piece of NOTHING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and Ultimately Feels Meaningless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with the Duplass brothers' 2012 movie can be summed up in one word: boring. It is just so unapologetically boring. Combine that with the fact that I just didn't care about any of the characters, and this movie doesn't come close to being as enjoyable as their movie CYRUS. That film was quirky and fun; this one tries to be, but falls way short. I can't blame it on the cast because I can see they tried. I just couldn't force myself to care about the story; it just wanders on and expects us to believe in coincidence so much that we don't care that the whole movie is just these two characters bumbling their way from set piece to set piece. The Jeff from the movie's title is played by Jason Segal, a thirty-year-old stoner who continues to live in his mother's basement watching the movie SIGNS over and over again. He is a firm believer that M. Night Shyamalan was on to something and that everything happens for a reason. In fact, he believes it so strongly that he can't even make basic decisions without some random event influencing his decision. His brother Pat (Ed Helms) is in a deteriorating marriage and his mother Sharon (Susan Sarandon) suffers a menial office job while pressing her stoned-out son to find the motivation to move on with his life. A wrong number phone call spurs Jeff into action, sending him on a journey to find the supposed meaning.I guess the characters in the movie were somewhat relatable. They just weren't very likable. Jeff is an idiot. I know we're supposed to be charmed by his naivety and never-ending faith in the universe's ability to lead him in the right direction, but he came off to me as just a grown man-child who's smoked a little too much and can't take responsibility for his own life. Pat is a selfish wannabe hotshot, awkward with his employees and neglectful of his own wife. And then there's Sharon, Jeff's disillusion mother and her soul-crushing job. I understand how she can be so disappointed in her son and I expect that we'll see him change her mind in one way or another over the course of the movie, but I don't understand why she needed her own entire subplot about how disappointed she is with her life and how an anonymous office admirer is spicing it up. I was having a hard enough time caring about anything going on in the Jeff/Pat plot without constantly cutting away to see Sharon flirting via instant message in an unrelated love story. Honestly though, the lamest aspect of the whole film is the concept as a whole: a stoner obsessed with a flawed Shyamalan movie wanders from place to place, miraculously finding himself at the right place at the right time. It's all about Kevin. Got to find Kevin. Wait, now it's time to help Pat save his crumbling marriage.I'll give the cast credit. They're all very talented people and they're all trying to do something here. I guess they saw how well CYRUS came out and they wanted to be a part of a quirky indie film too. Jason Segal is great, and Ed Helms appears genuinely clueless about how he's damaging his marriage. Susan Sarandon does an excellent job, even if her character was more prevalent that she needed to be. Each of them are great actors in their own right, but the material is just lame. The whole thing is just too "quirky". It felt as if they were shooting to make the most stereotypical indie film they could, loaded with kitsch and snap zooms. It was a bizarre combination of forced and meaningless. For whatever reason, the hand-held shaky-cam technique and constant zooms weren't so blatant in CYRUS but JEFF, WHO LIVES AT HOME shoves your face into the non-action. I'm not ready to give up on the Duplass brothers yet. I haven't seen their earlier films but right now they seem hit or miss, and I'm sure they'll have some more quality work in the future. This movie isn't beyond salvage, but it's boring. And for a medium meant to entertain, it can be just as bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeterminism and predestination battle for supremacy in "Jeff, Who Lives at Home", a slacker comedy about Jeff, a middle aged man (Jason Segel) who lives at home with his elderly mother. Various quirky characters deride Jeff for ascribing meaning to what they perceive to be random events, but Jeff persists in his philosophical outlook, leading to several climactic events which may or may not validate Jeff's religion.What's Jeff's religion? Though it's not mentioned in the film, the guy probably worships at the alter of Jeffery "the Dude" Lebowski, God of the slackers, messiah to all those who choose to "just abide". The film co-stars the always likable Susan Sarandon.7.9/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am still in awe about how this movie was able to capture the journey many young adults go through. This movie is simply amazing. Even when I think back about the movie, the sum is so much greater than its parts. In that, I mean, that the movie is so very meaningful and it seems like it has no sense of purpose... until the end. The movie is wonderfully crafted and pulls a "gotcha" over the viewer's eyes (for those that will get it). The main character essentially gives the movie away within the first minute. In my world, this movie would've won Best Picture.It is really not that funny, nor exciting, but very pleasing. I could totally relate to this movie and it's great to see that others have gone through the same thing. A part of me hopes that the majority of the people that watch this movie, do not understand it - Like Jeff's brother in the movie, because that is reality.I give this movie a 10/10 and there is really something wonderful here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think I have ever seen a movie, as powerful yet light-hearted as this... "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" pulls off the perfect combination of sweet and sour, and rather well. There are two brothers, Jeff and Pat, who have lost contact for years. Jeff, obsessed with the thought of omens/signs, lives in his mother's basement. Pat, a married and somewhat successful man, finds out his wife is having an affair... This is a movie that will make you smile and cry. I haven't found a single moment in this movie that was boring or dull. I was intrigued with the plot and it's characters. All the characters are pretty likable. You feel sympathy for them because they're all suffering, and struggling with difficult situations. And Jeff still manages to pull them all back together again... This movie is absolutely amazing. If you like comedies/dramas, with a touch romance and adultery, I highly suggest this title to you. Don't pass up the chance to watch this movie, you'll be missing out on a great movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was Fate That I Watched This I Guess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were no signs that compelled me to watch this movie, so I guess I just have to chalk it up to fate. On the bright side, fate made sure that I'd watch a movie that was less than an hour and a half in length, so I didn't actually lose too much of my life to this. On the other hand, I didn't come away from it thinking that I had in any way watched a gem either. It has its moments, but essentially it suffers from revolving around two essentially loser-type characters. Jeff (Jason Segel) is essentially a lazy bum. He spends his days apparently doing nothing but watching the movie "Signs" over and over again, and becoming obsessed with signs and fate as a result. He seems to have no job, and he lives with his mother (Susan Sarandon) - but he really detests being asked to do anything to help around the house. Then there's his brother Pat (Ed Helms) - who's a different kind of loser-type. Pat wants people to think of him as a success, but he's really a thoughtless bonehead who's little less than cruel to his wife and really wants little to do with his family - and, when you get right down to it, isn't really that successful anyway. As a result of - I guess - fate, Pat and Jeff hook up one day and have a few experiences that end up helping them and their families bond. How sweet. And I wasn't entirely sure that I got the need for the same-sex relationship (whether sexual or emotional was never really explained, although there was a kiss exchanged) between Sharon (Sarandon) and Carol (Rae Dawn Chong.) It just seemed to be thrown in for no especially good reason. Don't misunderstand me. It didn't offend me. I just didn't get the need for it. The Pat and Jeff stuff was quite enough.It's short. By the time the movie gets to its last few scenes it becomes a little bit touching. And there are a few moments of humour in it. But really, for the most part, this came across to me as largely pointless and without direction. If you're really interested in a movie about fate and how all things - even seemingly unrelated things - work together for a positive outcome, take Jeff's advice - watch "Signs." (3/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was looking for a Comedy, what I got was an engrossing, endearing film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Jeff, Who Lives at Home' is a hidden gem of a film. When Netflix suggested it to me, I was hoping for a comedy. It stars Jason Segel and Ed Helms, men known for their comedic roles. What I got was a very engrossing and endearing film about the family bond, with a little funny mixed in. Jason Segel is Jeff, a 30 year old man who still lives in his mother's basement. He is still struggling and a little messed up by his father's death many years before. To Jeff, everything has a meaning, there are no accidents. When an accidental phone call reaches him at home, Jeff sets off on a day of adventure, trying to discover the meaning of the dialed wrong number.Jeff's searching for the meaning of the call takes him to many places in town and into many run-ins with his older married brother Pat, played by Ed Helms. Pat is a nice contrast to this film with his self-centeredness and humor. His marriage is falling apart. Pat must ask for the help of Jeff to spy on his wife and to find out what is going on. The third character in the film is Sharon, Jeff and Pat's mother played by Susan Sarandon, who discovers she has a secret admirer at work. It takes place over the course of a day. The characters in the film find that their lives are bound and intertwined together. At the end of the film, it left me feeling the warm and fuzzies and glad I watched the show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way Underrated and Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that no one saw Jeff, Who Lives At Home because it's a really smart, funny indie comedy with good performances by some brand-name stars. I think the best part is where Jason Segel's character Jeff, thinks he can find his own meaning of life by watching Signs. This is a light-hearted comedy and most likely one of the most mainstream movies the Duplass brothers have done so far.This film is about a slacker named Jeff who wants to find out his meaning of life so he meets up with his brother Pat, and together they also track Pat's wife to find out if she has been cheating on him or not.Jason Segel is really good at these kind of characters. He reminds me of the character he played in I Love You, Man. He brings natural sweetness and sympathy to his character. Ed Helms practically plays himself from the Hangover movies but it's always fun to watch. Susan Sarandon also has some really funny and surprising scenes as well.Overall, this is a surprisingly funny comedy that people should really see. I can't believe how bad it did at the box office. Jason Segel and Ed Helms make good pair-ups and maybe we'll see some more in the future. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the film follows the lives of three main characters- all related- whose seemingly insignificant actions lead them to the right place at the right time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is fantastic. It was recommended to me by a friend and I must admit, despite starring one of my personal favorite actors- Jason Segel- I expected very little. It begins as one might expect, at Jeff's (Jason Segel) home. Jeff delivers a deep, serious monologue in which we begin to see the premise of the film outlined. Jeff believes that much as in the movie "Signs" everything is linked to everything else. I.E. It all happens for a reason. He then stands up and wipes his ass. This opening scene embodies the slow paced humor used throughout what is actually a very funny film. Much of the film is spent with the characters searching for some meaning to their life- whether it be Jeff, looking for a way out of his mother's basement, Pat (Ed Helms) trying to fix his broken and loveless marriage or Sharon (Susan Sarandon) a woman desperately caught between her two failing sons and her own lost dreams. Having watched it numerous times, I can say that it is not a film one can skip through. Every second contributes significantly, building towards the final scene. I don't want to give away the plot more than necessary- it's utterly superb in every aspect from timing and suspense to characterization- but the accumulation of moments, all relevant to what happens in the last ten minutes is truly astounding. And every time you watch the film, you notice something new that you missed before; something tiny and seemingly insignificant that makes it all come together in the end. As for the characters, they are handled extremely well but it seems each one becomes someone new by the end. They are all very changed by their experiences over the course of the day. Pat embodies the typical "douchebag" brother, slamming Jeff and his beliefs, not listening to his wife and generally being a dumb-ass. Sharon is lost. Just as lost as Jeff truth be told, but caught in the position of caregiver despite her personal struggle. She is depicted humorously but as with many of the aspects of this film, has a relatable and unavoidable twist of realism. Jeff is the most heavily featured and is a lovable, although ultimately useless layabout. He seemingly drifts about, waiting for life to come and meet him, but his character develops through the course of the film and by the end he seems to have been doing the right thing all along.And that is the most incredible thing about this film. So little openly happens in the way of significant events and yet it embodies so much. So little could be taken from it if you were to dismiss the meaning behind it all. The way that each of the characters' actions led them to be in the right place at just the right time makes this film stand out to me. There is no simple way to describe the effect it has, but needless to say, it's the main reason I rate "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" so highly. A must watch. If it doesn't change your life, you weren't watching it properly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm biased guy. Come on, I don't own the truth. When I like something, it's important to me to check out if I'm alone. That being said I have to say that I know what I like. And I loved this movie! Once I finished seeing it, I came here mesmerized, hoping, in a real optimistic way to find great reviews, big ratings, people that hopefully felt the same way towards this little gem. And, the, I was let down. No, although some would find it awesome as I did, many more to my surprise didn't like it.I confess that I started to think: was it what I saw, not as great as I humbly thought it was? Was I in a different groovy mood today, and that's the reason why I loved it so much? In a deeper sense, did I like it so, cause I lost my father too early? Many things crossed my mind as I started this movie laughing joyfully, and ended it crying and moved in a deep way. If it wasn't so late, my urge was to call all my best friends ant tell them to watch this movie.I didn't do it, obviously. So I came here, at the end of my day (the next day), to find out what other people thought about it. Remember that I said that I can be biased by other people's argument of what I felt and seen. I confessed it! And the I've found bad reviews questioning zooms (wich I loved, and found very pertinent)I' ve found people questioning themselves for living "at home" and searching for strangers opinions, I went through the boards and found stupid discussions about many things, and for a moment I felt sad... Well, I hoped, but people didn't get it.I didn't want to feel intellectually special for having loved this film so much. I just wanted to find people that related to this movie the way I did. But... I couldn't.This movie is about a family. A family that has everything going for them. Until something unexpected, a surprise, a misstep off the script happens, and from then on, everything drifts apart. Well... it happens all the time to many people. And then chaos presents itself. Then it's each for each own.But if, I say if, destiny or fate, could just for one day, put the pieces together, then everything can turn out fine.That's a fantasy. That's a fable.Do I believe in fate, destiny? No. But this movie takes on a journey and invite us to believe so. Or not... But shows us, that as much as it can be f*cked up, our family IS our family.At least, that's how it stroked me. And I loved it. No matter what :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully written movie that will grab your heartstrings and refuse to let go.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first stumbled upon Jeff, Who Lives At Home, I wasn't much other than a few laughs and another consistent performance from Jason Segel. I was absolutely blown away by what ensued. Jason Segel plays the title character, Jeff. Jeff is a grown man with little essence of direction in his life and completely blinded by the possibility of destiny. His increasing obsession with the movie "Signs" leads Jeff to believe that his destiny is out there, and as a result he takes every little abnormality as a sign. Segel gives a wonderful performance. Many will relate to Jeff and warm up to his character very early into the movie. His brother, played by Ed Helms has his life together. Or so it would seem. He's married with a stable job and seems to have his life together. I'm not particularly fond of Ed Helms but he gives a very dedicated performance throughout the film as his character's life begins to fall to pieces. The brothers unite in a journey that ultimately leads to Jeff fulfilling his destiny in a beautifully written ending. The ending will grab your heart strings and make you appreciate what life has to offer. Jay Duplass deserves a lot of credit for this absolute gem of a movie producing a magnificent story that really demonstrates the wonderful acting ability of Jason Segel. Topped off with the amazing, Susan Sarandon, playing Jeff's mom, who struggles to find happiness in her life, really puts the icing on the cake. Inspiring film. You'll want to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is fate, and does it really matter?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff believes that there are signs everywhere, and you will find them if only you are aware. He even considers looking for and following the signs as an essential part of human life. This renders his lifestyle to be passive, which is indicated in the title: He (still) lives at home. On the contrary Jeff's brother, Pat is pursuing an active lifestyle, working as a salesman and believing that man forges his own destiny. Their mother portrays a third perspective on life. She has surrendered, given up hope to achieve what her sons are looking for. Three unhappy characters, struggling to understand their own life and the environment they are living in.This movie is about fate, about believe in yourself and the universe, about courage and despair. The great part is that it does not need religion, no moral, no pathos. It is not cheesy at all. Jeff believes that life needs magic, which can be found by following the signs. Pat is also looking for magic, but he finds it in a Porsche. A brilliant moment arrives when Pat and Jeff are trying to find Pat's wife in a motel. Both get there in different ways: Pat with his determination and stubbornness and Jeff by, guess what, following a sign.The final scenes tell us, in a heartwarming way, that either of the character's conception of life is equally right. When they all meet together, each one has found a way to overcome their unhappiness, THEIR way. A brilliant movie, with a great Jason Segel, and story told without being obtrusive, but quite remarkable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Segel plays against type in this interesting indie film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most comedic actors, at some point in their careers, play a role which goes against their usual persona,like Will Ferrell in 'Stranger Than Fiction'.'Jeff, Who Lives at Home' is such a vehicle for Jason Segel. Known as playing the goofy nice guy, Segel switches gears in this indie comedy-drama.Segel plays Jeff, a 30-year-old pot-smoking slacker who lives in his mum's basement, is obsessed with the movie 'Signs' and is constantly searching for his destiny. He has a tense relationship with his brother Pat (Ed Helms, also playing against his usual comedic persona), who is seemingly far more successful than him. Unemployed and unmotivated, Jeff seems to be drifting through life, seemingly unable to complete the most basic household chores (like buying glue from the store to fix the broken shutter). While the film, directed by the Duplass brothers, could have turned it into yet another "slacker comedy", with Jeff the butt of the jokes, they show restraint and portray him as a real person with real problems.One morning, Jeff gets a call from a man looking for someone called Kevin. Believing this to be a sign, he goes out searching for anyone named Kevin. Meanwhile, Pat is dealing with the breakdown of his marriage to Linda (Judy Greer), whom he suspects is having an affair. To top it off, their mother Sharon (Susan Sarandon), a straight-laced woman, is dealing with a secret admirer at work, while confiding with her friend Carol (Rae Dawn Chong) about how directionless her life is.While, on the surface, 'Jeff?' feels like a depressing film, the overriding message is one of hope: of never giving up on something you value or something you thought had long passed you by. It's also a realistic film: life doesn't always work out the way you want and sometimes you can feel stuck in a rut, but Jeff's almost naive belief in signs and destiny is refreshingly optimistic, especially when even Jeff's own family has written him off as an unmotivated slacker. If you're after something a bit more grounded than the usual "slacker comedy", then this is well worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I have heard a bit about the Duplass brothers, this is their first movie I am watching. It is not innovative or nothing that you have not seen before, but does build a terrific environment carefully setting up the characters, their positions and relationships. Occasionally funny, sweet, touching and heartwarming in equal amounts while still maintaining a quirky look at all the regular things.Jeff (Jason Segel) is unemployed, looked down upon by his brother Pat (Ed Helms) and mother Sharon (Susan Sarandon) and as the title goes stays at home until the phase of the story started. You wouldn't see him at home during the rest of the movie. Pat is going through a midlife crisis and is shunned by his wife Linda (Judy Greer) for buying a Porche without consulting her. Pat discovers that Linda might be having an affair and brings in Jeff to follow her. Sharon is dragged into a little anxiety about a secret admirer at work. Also Jeff believes in destiny and he is pursuing a snippet he got in the morning. How all these stories collide will form the rest.It is a role tailor made for Jason Segel and he delivers that held back performance which was perfectly apt. Helms, Sarandon, Greer all perform their roles really well inviting us to their world the Duplass brothers have created. Background score is that offbeat indie style while rest of the departments does a decent job nothing too special for mention since the movie is not too ambitious.Does well within its limitations considering the minimal ambitions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This title is a good "lazy Sunday" movie to watch. Ed Helms and Jason Segal do a great job as a pair of brothers: one who questions his destiny, and the other who has lost touch of his own. The movie has many moving plots that come together in the end.I rented the movie from Redbox because I am an Ed Helms and Jason Segal fan, and I got more out of this movie than I thought. I figured it would be an oddball indie comedy, and it was more like a dark comedy with a good message. Worth watching! Is it a classic? No. For sure an enjoyable movie through and through. Funny moments as well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeff, Who Lives at Home is an excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, co-directors and co-screenwriters Jay and Mark Duplass have made a film which is sold as one thing and ends up being another one...something I say as positive, even though the general audience might find that tricky. Their film Cyrus had the appearance of being another simple and vulgar comedy made in Judd Apatow style, but it ended up being a very interesting characters study with an unusual deepness and realism, seasoned with occasional moments of humor in order to balance the drama. More recently they did exactly the same with Jeff, Who Lives at Home, even though with a more solid screenplay and more maturity as filmmakers.The screenplay from Jeff, Who Lives at Home includes various sincere moments of revelation and personal inspiration, many of which are obtained playing with our expectations and employing clichs which take a different road to the one we expected. Besides, the main character of Jeff, Who Lives at Home kinda reminded me of the Dude from The Big Lebowski, whose funny isolation from reality also brought him the unexpected benefit of seeing beyond the obvious, and accepting the good and bad situations with a balanced and objective philosophy. Nevertheless, the narrative from Jeff, Who Lives at Home is much more modest, because it doesn't pretend to transport us to a magical existential adventure, but to share with us the simple but honest ideology from a "loser" main character who ends up surprising us with his wisdom...even if he obtained it from drugs or from the film Signs.Jason Segel is perfect as the title character, because he brings the exact attitude his character needed. As his brother, Ed Helms also brings a solid performance. On the beginning, it seems that he's going to repeat his routine of innocent and well intentioned twerp, but as the screenplay moves by, Helms displays a dark side we had never seen from him, and he did it really well. And I also liked Susan Sarandon's performance.The only thing I can say against Jeff, Who Lives at Home is that a few details feel a bit forced. Nevertheless, I liked this movie very much, and I recommend it with a lot of enthusiasm, not as a comedy, but as an excellent family melodrama in which the laughs are melancholic and the tragedies hide a humorous vein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very entertaining Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any movie in which "Signs," one of my all time favorite flicks, is a major plotpoint should be a good one. This film mentions that film several times, and it's theme about how everything happens for a reason is exactly the same as the theme for this movie. There's even a little tribute to the movie involving Jeff grabbing a knife. But enough about why the movie is good just because it glorifies a movie that I love that seems to be love or hate, let's see it's other pros and cons.I have never seen a movie by this directing duo before, but I have to ask, do they always zoom in and out that much. Most of the time I could just ignore it, but there were several points where I thought I should focus on something because it zoomed in and that wasn't the purpose. And I was a little disappointed in how the signs all lined up, I don't know I was just hoping for a little bit more near the end.But this movie mixes comedy and drama extremely well. I loved Jeff, although Pat left a little to be desired. Their mother's love life actually interested me. The score is so ridicuosly catchy, seriously they keep using the same music and it won't get out of your head. The buildup is really nice, even if I was a little disappointed in the conclusion, and I ended the movie with a smile on my face.This movie isn't a masterpiece by any means, it's just an entertaining film. The characters are likable, the comedy is funny, the buildup is nice, and the score is catchy. With the help of some great acting, Jeff who lives at Home is definitely worth a watch. Especially if you love "Signs,"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a tough sell for a movie, because while this is funny, it's not laugh out loud funny. Most of the time it isn't. Most of the time it is awkward funny. But even if you can see some of the things way ahead, it is more than nicely acted and has the weirdness going for it. I really liked it a lot, but it is definitely not everyones cup of tea, no matter what flavor is inside the cup.Segel is really exceptional as are the other actors and while the story is pretty straightforward, it still takes you on an emotional ride (if you let it that is). A nice little movie that will fulfill what you hope it does, with a title like that :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeff, Who Lives At Home...3 out of 4 Skittles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Duplass brothers, kings of the indie film world, are back with their fifth feature film delivering on their reputation for telling strong stories with the idiotically named mumblecore camera style that has put them on the map. Jeff, Who Lives At Home, like their 2010 film Cyrus, has a much healthier budget and name stars, but still continues the natural realism and spirit of their early films The Puffy Chair and Baghead.In Jeff, The Duplass brothers experiment with the meaning of life? is everything in life connected and happen for a reason? With a theme this heavy you might expect the film dig in deeper than their past endeavors, but the writer/director sibling team keep things light. Although Jeff feels less ambitious than Cyrus or The Puffy Chair, the guys keep the film moving forward at a fun, entertaining pace.The strong cast seems to have a lot of fun working with the Duplass Brothers highly improvisational style. Jason Segal (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, The Muppets), Ed Helms (The Hangover, Cedar Rapids) &amp; Susan Sarandon (Thelma &amp; Louise, Dead Man Walking) truly feel like a fractured family that know too much and weirdly not enough about each other at the same time.Jeff, Who Lives At Home may not be a huge leap forward for the Duplass Brothers, but it's a nice film opposite from most main stream movies that forget to include a story as a backbone of their special effects display. Jay and Mark Duplass will always have a purchased movie ticket from me.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually within the first 15 minutes of a movie, I get a sense of where the movie is going and where the plot may be heading. With "Jeff Who Lives At Home", I had no idea what was going to happen. From the opening scene to the credit's, this film had me guessing, and I thought because of that, I was taken on a thought provoking ride through the main protagonist Jeff, who is played by Jason Segel, who has been obsessed with the movie "Signs" (yeah I'm referring to the Mel Gibson movie) and has based his life around the movie looking for "sign's" that would lead him to his destiny.It's full of random occurrences which of cause end's up making sense once you really figure out what's happening. I loved everything about this film, from the script to the performances from a great cast with Ed Helms playing Jeff's brother Pat and Susan Sarandon playing Sharon who is their mother. It's a moving story with a powerful message. A very thought provoking and deep Drama/Comedy. Great way to spend 83 minutes of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often I see a movie that compels me to write a review, this was one of those few occasions. "Jeff" delivers in such a simplistic and yet emotional way that tops what many blockbuster acts, these days, just can't do. To say the least, this has to be both Segel and Helms' best roles to date! I walked into this movie on a whim with some encouragement from other reviewers and was pleasantly surprised. The Duplass brothers delivered fantastically with Cyrus and, in my opinion, again with this. So far, they just seem to have that certain something that brings their stories to life in a way that can't be matched. If you are a fan of comedy that lives in the actual ups and downs of real life, and the reality that sometimes it might all just mean something.... then this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Duplass brothers get more personal with "Jeff"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brothers Jay and Mark Duplass have made their name as filmmakers to this point by examining uncomfortable personal relationship dynamics and exaggerating all things awkward that arise in those situations. With "Jeff, Who Lives At Home," they focus on life's essential relationships with an entirely different sense of purpose and humor appears to be a secondary objective.With Jason Segel, Ed Helms and Susan Sarandon, the Duplass brothers have assembled more star appeal than they've ever had to work with before. "Cyrus" boasted an impressive cast in John C. Reilly, Marissa Tomei and Jonah Hill, but Segel and Helms in particular are two of the hotter names in mainstream comedy right now, both in film and television. Their casting here is not necessarily off, but misguiding to average viewers who might stumble across this title in their search for a night of gut-busting comedy.Segel plays the title character, a 30-something who lives in his mother's basement and likes to get high. Nothing novel there, except that this doesn't define Jeff at all. He spends the first five minutes at home, but the rest of the film takes place out and about in Baton Rouge as he pursues a mysterious "Kevin" and helps his brother, Pat (Helms), uncover if his wife is having an affair. The story plays out nothing like its title implies, which in the right light should be viewed as refreshing if not the entire point of the movie.The film is built around Jeff's perspective on life, that everything is connected, there are no coincidences and that signs exist all around us that point us to our fate. Obviously, as a man without a job living in his mother's basement, that outlook hasn't gotten him anywhere, but he also carries an abundance of optimism and doesn't sweat much of anything.Taking course in one day, Jeff's adventure begins when he receives a call from a wrong number at home from someone angrily asking for Kevin. Jeff interprets this a sign, and on the bus on the way to Home Depot, he encounters a young man wearing a basketball jersey with "Kevin" on the back. Convinced, he follows him, a choice that ultimately leads him to cross paths with his older brother, who is obsessed with material objects and has lived his life the expected, methodical way, which given his marital problems, hasn't done so well for him either.When Pat and Jeff spot Pat's wife, Linda (Judy Greer), in a car with another man, Pat gets wildly jealous and enlists Jeff to help him spy on them. It's an unusual form of brotherly bonding, which is the Duplass' wheelhouse, and therein lies the bulk of the humor.Their mom (Susan Sarandon) gets her own subplot completely apart from everything else. Her work day takes an unexpected turn when a secret admirer begins to drop her notes and instant messages at work. Suddenly she's confronted with the idea of not being as old as she feels.True to how Jeff sees things, nothing in the film ends up being coincidence, even if there's no other possible explanation for it. How does Jeff's pursuit of Kevin lead him to exactly where he runs into Pat? How do Jeff and Pat end up coming upon Linda? That's just the beginning, too.The opportunity for situational comedy waits around every possible corner in this movie, but the Duplass brothers aren't interested in it. Almost all of the humor emerges naturally from the progression of the story, which, to be honest, is instigated by the exaggerated traits of the characters.Pat is the main ruckus-causer, a role that doesn't fully suit Helms. He's much better at playing the lovable loser than the thoughtless, jealous jerk type, but when the script finds tender moments he makes them feel natural. Segel, however, is terrific as Jeff. He could have a bit more of a full-on weirdness about him, but as a romantic and somewhat naive type, he's perfect. Their clashing outlooks make for most of the film's drama.Undoubtedly, as filmmaking brothers, this had to have been a personal project for the Duplasses. All the members of this family maintain an appearance of being harsh toward each other, but they're all written in a way that sees them drawn to each other, like there's a definite need to be connected as family, and the events they endure play with these ideas of familial obligation and kinship, even while the focus of the film stays on testing Jeff's thesis about the connectedness of the universe.In a way, "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" isn't a misleading title, and the clue lies in the comma. With it, the fact that he lives at home is considered non-essential information about Jeff, but without it, it implies that it defines who he is. This is a story about Jeff, and it just so happens that he lives at home. He's much more than that, and so is the film.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet and slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If your familiar with any of the Duplass brothers films than Jeff, Who Lives at Home's low budget, shaky camera and general mumblecore-ness will be no surprise to you. Whoever much like their previous film Cyrus, this one is much more aimed at a mainstream audience, especially with such a well-known cast in Jason Segel, Ed Helms and Susan Sarandon.The film is acted beautifully by all, and while you might feel confused about the direction the film is going during the first half of the film, it wraps up very nicely in the end in one great sweet moment. However, what makes this film is the inclusion of Susan Sarandons kind of parallel storyline which stays separate to the main line of story until the end, without her inclusion the film would be relatively mediocre, because of the fact that her character ties up the ending so well, and it is the ending that makes this movie great.The film doesn't suffer from any major problems but the it can be said that the settings are often very bland and boring, probably due to the low budget of the movie. I also felt that the inclusion of a sort of mystical nature to Jeff's thinking was forced and didn't seem to fit in the story as much as I thought the brothers wanted.Overall the movie shines a light hearted, well acted film with a very fulfilling sweet ending.For more reviews visit - http://itsnotamovieitsaflim.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie like many others expecting another raunchy profane comedy with the likes of Helms and Segel. Don't get me wrong I enjoy those movies. Instead what I found was a delightful tale about three people struggling with everyday life. The characters paved their way through the movie with a few quirky hurdles and plenty of heart to heart moments. All three characters face different demons within themselves, but are to afraid to ask for help. I would recommend this movie to anyone that has ever pondered the meaning of their life, because after this movie the ultimate questions of fate , and destiny didn't seem as important to me as how I got there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Duplasstic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writing-directing sibling duo of Jay and Mark Duplass have delivered another solid quirky indie comedy. This time they have the home field advantage of telling a tale about adult brothers in "Jeff Who Lives at Home". The movie stars Jason Segel as Jeff, a slacker who is 30 and (ya!) lives at home. He is an avid fan of the movie "Signs", and it's not a good sign when he thinks that everything that happens around him is a cosmic-force guiding sign to something extraordinary. Jeff ignores the warning signs from his demanding mother Sharon who urgently orders him to fix a closet shutter or else. Sharon has a bit of lovebird signs going on herself when she encounters that someone from her job is playing the "secret admirer" game with her via instant messaging. In the film's opening, Jeff receives a harassing call from someone asking for a Kevin. Low and behold, Jeff thinks that Kevin Costner can land him a role in "Waterworld 2"? OK, I am kidding! But the "Kevin" factor does play a prominent role in the movie. "Jeff Who Lives at Home" is more about the relationship between Jeff and his egocentric older brother Pat than actually Jeff living at home. Through a series of pseudo M. Knight Shyamalan events (for lack of a better director), Jeff ends up unexpectedly meeting Pat at several locations which result in some very comedic moments. Pat is in a troubled marriage with his wife Linda. She resents the fact that his self-centered ways have led him to purchase a new sports car instead of saving that money so they could buy a house together. Not a lot really goes on in "Jeff Who Lives at Home" but that's not such a bad thing. The Duplass bros do succeed in telling a brotherly tale about the dysfunctional ways of adult siblings and how surprising events can build those sibling bonding bridges back. Their direction did lack enthusiasm at times during the film, but their extremely witty screenplay compensated for that. Segel continues to make his mark as one of the best comedic actors in the business. Jason was brilliant as Jeff! This homeboy knows how to act. Ed Helms stood pat with his steady performance as Pat. Judy! Judy! Judy! Judy Greer continues to move up in my actress aficionado list with yet another exceptional performance. She shined as Linda. Susan Sarandon brought some adequate motherly love to the picture with her good work as Sharon. And it was great so see once again Rae Dawn Chong in a movie after a long hiatus in the motion picture industry; or at least it seemed that way. I was wondering when it was going to be Chong's "next movie". Rae Dawn was breaking dawn (ok, very corny twilight pun here) in rejuvenating her acting career with her great supporting performance as Susan's co-worker pal Carol. I don't think you should get out of your home to see "Jeff Who Lives at Home", but then again it's not a bad idea to spend 90 minutes at home by watching this picture. Later homies! **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting great performances from Segel and Helms, likable characters and an engrossing plot line surrounding why this 30 year old guy still lives at home and how he is going to move on in his life. I guess I didn't feel like these criteria were met.The first half of the movie was rough; I did not connect with any of the characters and thought the brother seemed like a jerk. Jeff's "quest" to see the signs in his life connect seemed written in and forced. The mother's online secret admirer was the only thing that kept me interested and guessing.For me the turning point was in the hotel room when Pat and Linda had it out. Thought it was well scripted and acted.From that point on things get better. Though Jeff is still set on seeing "Signs" in his life, it does seem like (without trying too hard) the movie comes through. The ending water scene where everyone comes together is sort of redeeming. Best part of the movie.I still am confused about his mom, how she is not a lesbian, and ends up how she does. What was Carol's intentions with Sharon (and vice versa), seeing that, for her whole life, she has only swung for one team?When I see a good movie, I remember it days and weeks, sometimes years after i've seen it. I will forget about this one after tomorrow. BUT I am not a seasoned critic. I may be missing something. Worth watching for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never bothered to write a review for any movie before but this one made me want to create an account on IMDb just so I could praise it.There is a lot more to this movie than meets the eye. Though it appears to be a regular story about family and relationships, there is a much deeper meaning to Jeff, Who Lives at Home. It's all about that quote by Jeff at the beginning of the movie. Watching for the signs that the Universe sends us. There are many movies which deal with the cosmic plan aspect of life but what's remarkable about this one is that it is presented to us in this sweet and simple story. And that's exactly how these things work in real life too! The miracles are in the little things and all we need to do is to watch for them and allow that inner voice to guide us.Jason Segal is just amazing! He's so sweet and sincere. Overflowing with kindness and optimism. I simply can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Jeff. He is absolutely perfect for it! That last scene where he's watching TV is so deeply moving. I had tears in my eyes as I watched his expressions.I really liked all the other actors too. They played their roles so naturally. It wasn't at all like they were 'acting'.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone who has an inclination towards spirituality.I'm going to be talking about this movie and referring to it the way Jeff keeps referring to Signs. :)Oh and I haven't watched Signs but because of this movie, it is now on my list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeff, Who Lives at Home (2011-12) - Follow the Signs, and Achieve to Find Life's Purpose!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by acclaimed filmmakers, Jay and Mark Duplass, "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" is a funny and heartwarming comedy-drama film for the independent film era. Featuring an all-star cast, the movie stars Jason Segel as the title character, who seems to be inspired by the movie, "Signs". He believes that everything happens for a reason, and he sees and follows signs in his real life, that will allow him to achieve greatness. He actually believes that fate can appear out of nowhere, and thinks it can affect his life. His brother Pat, played by Ed Helms, is experiencing a rocky marriage between his wife, played by Judy Greer, whom he believes is having an affair. The mother of these two people, Susan Sarandon, is then trying to figure out the "secret admirer" that has been giving her messages all day at her workplace. As these story lines fall into place, fate comes along and connects all these stories into one masterful motion picture. "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" is one of the best movies of the year. This is a self-aware, wonderful, and entertaining piece of storytelling. Jason Segel delivers one of the best performances of his career, and yet he never disappoints in any movie he's in. His character feels so realistic and likable, and you can easily feel sympathy for the character. This is the performance that absolutely shows how great an actor Jason Segel is. Also, Ed Helms actually delivers a memorable performance as Jeff's brother, not to mention that he also shares a great bond between him and Segel, and it felt like that they're actual brothers. Judy Greer and Susan Sarandon round up the supporting cast, providing excellent performances to the movie respectively, Greer as Pat's desperate wife, and Sarandon as a lost mother in search of fate. Directors Jay and Mark Duplass do a rather perfect job in capturing the viewer's attention, while at the same time, taking them on a journey through the real world. The writing is so believable, and it creates an authentic and creative value to the movie, and it makes the film more entertaining to watch. This movie makes you grow and feel sympathy for the characters, and it creates a realistic portrait of everyday life. By the way, did I mention that I was actually crying in the end? This movie had one of the most heartwarming and powerful endings I've seen in a while! This is when every single detail makes sense, the characters' problems are inter-connected, and the story then follows a unique path. From start to finish, "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" is nothing but pure greatness. I probably knew I was going to like this movie in the first place, but in the end, I felt that this movie provided everything perfectly, making this film have zero flaws. This is a beautiful, entertaining, realistic, and inspirational motion picture. This is also one of the year's best! "Jeff, Who Lives at Home", in my review, "remarkably authentic, and beautifully entertaining".</fullReview>

While I enjoyed the sad humor of "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and am truly addicted to "How I Met Your Mother", a huge fan of Jason Siegel I am not. That was until he played Jeff, the title character, and he sealed his rightful place in that deep heart-felt place where Zach Braff lives. "Jeff, Who Lives At Home" just won space on the top shelf among other favorites as Garden State, Henry Poole is Here, and the Descendants. Wonderful film that questions the meaning of life, and why we are where/who/what we are. I was in the right place (frame of mind) at exactly the right time to watch this film. I highly recommend!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of them films that sits with you for a while...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that pleasantly catches you surprise after viewing the trailers. "Jeff Who Lives at Home" outdoes its title and promoted content. The cast, script, photography, direction and even the music score are surely bound to sweep up awards this year.The film also provides a great vehicle for Jason Segel and Ed Helms as they both succeed in taking on their best roles yet. It's always refreshing to see comedic actors assume roles of more "serious" substances as they have in "Jeff". Good going', guys. Susan Sarandon is brilliant as ever (and looks pretty amazing as well).As the title has gone into video on-demand and DVD status, we're sure to see it resurface again come Academy Awards time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not that bad...not that great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an indie comedy, that I have to add is not one of the best I have seen but it sure has some laughs and also though the cinematography could have been better (who am I kidding could have been far better) the plot though simple, was fun to watch things unfold.Won't recommend a cinema watch, but will say if you ever catch this on TV take the time to see it.Plot goes, Jeff (Jason Segel) is inspired by the movie Signs, and believes that everything in life happens for a reason, and after he gets a call, then another to run an errand for his mum, this live with mum 30 year old man gets on an interesting journey that led to him meeting his brother, getting involved in unfolding an adulterous act, and an it all works out ending.Though I have not seen any movie done by the directing pair, I do advice they work on their directing a little. Using a cast that is well accustomed to acting such roles may have helped in passing the message across, but the lines in the movie lacked professionalism.To take in mind that the cinematography was bad, add unnecessary waste of screen time. Now the actors did a good job the story unfolds to something that made me smile and the ending had a little touch of lesbianism well what can I say, it is a complete package.First movie I am seeing Ed Helms in other than HANGOVER and HANGOVER II.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So? basically?. They made a movie about a guy who took "Signs" seriously.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's just something that I don't find appealing about these "film festival" moves that take comedic actors and put them into situations of having real life person problems. While I shouldn't complain that there is a genre of realism that doesn't wrap up in a nice bow like your average romantic comedy, I still can't be taken by a mundane movie that shows your average person with an average life problem. Jeff's character probably mirrors someone that everyone knows, and Pat appears to be the average middle class man with an imperfect marriage and a short sighted financial view? again? probably someone we all know. The most interesting character is played by Susan Sarandon (Sharon), being a widow coaxed into new experiences in her later years, after feeling regret about how her life turned out. The odds are, when I reach that age, I will know someone exactly like her as well. The story is boring, the filming isn't bad, and the characters, while believable and real, aren't anything special.If it comes up on your Netflix or TMN, check it out for the sake of feeling cultured, and better yet, to see a new Porsche wrap around a tree. Other than that, I'd say skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See it for Segel's performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly Jeff, Who Lives at Home is a pretty uninspiring title. Perhaps because of the title I was not expecting a lot from this film. I liked it more than I thought it would (i'd give it 6.5/10 if I could).My main reasons for watching were the fact it's described as an offbeat comedy and that Jason Segel is the lead. I enjoyed Segel's performances in I Love You, Man and Bad Teacher regardless of how good those films were and he didn't disappoint me here either. He plays the title character, who is a bit of a likable loser who pursues this idea that everything happens for a reason and that his destiny is out there waiting for him somewhere. His performance is engaging and never resorts to the cheap over the top physical comedy that some of his peers are guilty of producing.Quite often, films where the characters are chasing their destiny end up overblown, exaggerated and totally unrealistic, which isn't the case here. Jeff gets taken on a fairly simple journey where he deals with the real issues affecting his life, such as the relationship with his brother and mother. I did find Ed Helms quite annoying as the brother, but I guess that's just the character he was playing.If you're looking for laugh-out-loud comedy then this isn't for you, but there are lots of amusing little sequences as well as nicely handled emotional moments. It's not going to win any awards, but I found Jeff, Who Lives at Home to be oddly uplifting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too bad-definitely one of those "quirky indie movies"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: I loved the storyline. Though the end was a bit cheesy, I enjoyed it. Jason Segel was fantastic. Of course I'm biased, but hell, I saw Bad Teacher last year, and hated it, and seeing him couldn't even save that for me. But I thought he did really well in this role. I'm sure people would argue that Segel playing a 30 year old stoner isn't much of a stretch, it was nice to see him flex his dramatic muscles a bit-something we've seen time to time on How I Met Your Mother, but that is generally absent from his film roles (again, he's part of the Apatow crowd, and as much as I enjoy those movies, it's nice to see him doing something different). Ed Helms does a great job as well-taking on the role of the reformed asshole very well. Cons: The camera work is terrible. I know for indie movies the shaky camera seems to be the thing to do to make it seem more "authentic," but in this case it was terribly distracting. Also, as a note to the Duplass brothers, for the love of all that is holy, not every shot needs to have 15 different quick zooms. Overall, I enjoyed the film, though, as I said, the camera-work left a lot to be desired. I really hope to see Segel and Helms in more roles like these, because they're both great actors with a lot of untapped potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant Character Study with Fine Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeff, Who Lives at Home (2011) *** (out of 4) Pleasant comedy-drama about slacker Jeff (Jason Segel), a thirty-year-old who still lives in his mother's basement because he keeps thinking signs will show him his destiny. One day he believes he's following one of those signs and he ends up spending time with his brother (Ed Helms) who believes his wife (Judy Greer) is cheating on him. JEFF, WHO LIVES AT HOME isn't the flat-out comedy that the trailers want you to believe and at times I was a little surprised to see how serious it was getting. With that said, the screenplay really doesn't go for either laughs or drama as its main goal and instead it really just seems like a slice of life tale centered on a few hours in these brother's lives. I think what the film does the best is offer up some very good performances from the leads. Segel is completely believable in his role as the pothead trying to figure out his meaning in life. I thought the actor played the stoner bit extremely well but even more impressive was the way he was able to play the dramatic moments because this is where you feel for the character. Helms plays the same type of role that he often does and that's the jerk who needs to realize who he really is. Segel and Helms really do come across like real brothers and this certainly helps the film. Greer easily steals the movie as the wife and Susan Sarandon does a very good job in the role of the mother. Even Rae Dawn Chong does a good job in her bit. The one thing that really bothered me about the movie was its look and especially some annoying small zoom shots. These little zooms happen throughout the film and I'm really not sure why but they got quite annoying after a while. Still, the performances are what make the film and they're good enough to where the film just comes off very pleasant and entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the story, characters and acting (as much as i managed to see of it )seemed of the highest standard. but sadly the performances and entire look of the film are spoiled by nonsensical camera work.it seems as though the intention was to give the film a doc/mockumentary look. and the frame has the irritating habit to jump at you every few seconds, as the camera snap zooms in slightly. frankly, that is about as irritating as taking your mother to a date with the intention to score (not with your mum). this adds nothing to this film, it only detracts. once you've noticed it, it becomes like the song 'barbie girl'; you just cannot get it out of your head and it drives you slowly mad.eventually i turned the film off. lividly. doesn't happen often that i will get angry with a film. but here i couldn't help myself, for it is shameful that such a conceptualised directorial and editorial decision has to spoil incredibly good work by everyone else!</fullReview>

'Jeff, Who Lives at Home' Synopsis: Dispatched from his basement room on an errand for his widowed mother, slacker Jeff might discover his destiny (finally) when he spends the day with his unhappily married brother as he tracks his possibly adulterous wife.'Jeff, Who Lives at Home' deals with people &amp; people issues. Its a human-story, that isn't superficial or escapist. Its all about what people make out of their lives &amp; there-on. Jay Duplass &amp; Mark Duplass's Screenplay is thoroughly arresting &amp; emotionally rich. Their Direction, on the other-hand, is under-stated. Cinematography &amp; Editing, deserve a mention.Performance-Wise: Jason Segel delivers a credible performance. Ed Helms is remarkable. He's never been this good. Susan Sarandon is in command after a long time. The veteran is excellent. Judy Greer leaves a mark. Rae Dawn Chong lends good support.On the whole, 'Jeff, Who Lives at Home' is a must see. So Under-Rated!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Maybe it came at the right time, but I thought this short dramedy was very very worth while. Great character development for such a short movie taking place over such a short time (one day). Worth a watch. It's a feed good movie with a happy ending, which, these days, ain't so bad. And by the way, I've ready several reviews stating "and we never find out the significance of the name Kevin." If you pay attention, you'd find out in the final scene of the movie, while Jeff is watching the news story of his heroic rescue, that the name of the man who's life he saves is, in fact, "Kevin". Guess only those who paid attention "got it". Just like Jeff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something strikes within the first few minutes: why the Duplass brothers have that fancy of using zoom-ins "Office style" ? This technique is to be used only in a few cases, here we are under the impression that it is a bad attempt at adding realism to the story, it is badly used and even distracts the viewer.Anyway, the movie starts off on the wrong foot with this weird cinematography. As for the script, the story navigates between these three characters without trying to go deeper on anything. There is no clear structure, the message is foggy and in the end, it is hard to understand what the two brothers wanted to tell the audience. Too bad because with a Segel-Helms duo, one could have expected much better.</fullReview>

Just some advice to viewers, this is not a comedy, if you want to feel depressed or your life is boring and you have nothing to do but follow idiotic signs, then this is the film for you.. This is my first review, believe me when I say, I have seen some terrible movies and held my tongue, but this? such a budget as well? on what? I am truly disappointed...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark (at times), yet honest assessment of interpersonal relationships and family strife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the film "Jeff Who Lives at Home." Was expecting a silly comedy, which is not at all what it was. It was a dark yet honest look at interpersonal relationships and familial strife. Probably one of those films that will make someone take a look at their life and re-evaluate it. It might just be that dose of reality that someone needs to change for the better.This is not a feel-good film, and I don't recommend it to people who recently went through a traumatic event or recently lost a loved one.This film is more geared towards people who are in a pretty stable emotional state and have a pretty good grip on their personal relationships. For those people who may be having a tough spot in their love life, I might recommend watching it with that significant other. It might make it easier for you to talk to one another, and make you realize how precious that relationship really is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeff, whom resides at his place of residency</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Segel plays Jeff, a thirty year old unmarried, unemployed louse wallowing in bong exhaust in his mother's basement watching Mel Gibson's film Signs over and over again, convinced that everything in the world is a divine coincidence and our job is to figure out what they all mean. When his mother, Sharon, played by Susan Sarandon, calls to tell him go to the store to get wood glue to fix the broken kitchen shutter, what unfolds is a life changing experience.Sharon also makes a call to her other son, Pat (Ed Helms), a man with a seemingly better life, what with being married to Judy Greer's Linda, but he doesn't. He inhabits a passive-aggressive relationship with her, and finds out she is possibly adulterous in the meantime, after getting in a car accident with Jeff.While this is occurring, Sharon is at work and finds herself the target of a secret admirer, who enjoys flirtatiously sending her messages on the computer and flies her a picture of a rose on a paper airplane. Sharon is desperately seeking companionship, and is hoping to find someone who sees and likes her for herself - aren't we all? Jeff, Who Lives at Home is a quaint film, and the Duplass brothers (Jay and Mark, respectively) have done an extraordinary job at injecting the film with life, personality, and depth in only an eight-three minute runtime. The film is assisted by its three magnificent leads, two of them known for their raunchy comedy work. Not to mention, Susan Sarandon, an actress of incredible talent, beauty, and charisma, pulls off her character nicely and is not to be ignored. But just a little hint to Ed Helms, I laughed a lot more in this picture than I did in The Hangover Part II.Once in a while, during one of the countless films I watch over time, I'll encounter the line that viciously triggers a certain mood or personality trait that could describe the entire film. The line is said by Jeff in such a desperate and helpless tone, and perfectly conveys isolation and fragile tendencies one can possibly not control. The line is uttered when Jeff and Pat are fighting, and Jeff states, "you and mom will never understand me. And you're all I have left." Another beauty is that every character is defined by some unique personal trait, yet is tightly wound by one recurring connection. Jeff is very superficial and digs deeper into things to find the subtle meaning. He gets a call early in the film and a man angrily requests to speak to "Kevin." There is no "Kevin" in Jeff's house, yet he is convinced that the name has some sort of significance. Pat is angry and frustrated at things he can not control. Early in the film he buys his wife a beautiful new Porsche, which she beautifully decorates with the morning breakfast. And Sharon hungers for a life robbed of desperation and replaced with urgency, meaning, and companionship. These characters all have one thing in common and that thing is loneliness. They hunger for traits they don't possess and for things they can't find. And don't we all? Do we not dig deeper into the subtleties in life? Do we not all becoming consumed with anger and moroseness? And do we not remain optimistic that we'll encounter someone or something that may, in fact, give us more purpose or gratitude for life? Jeff, Who Lives at Home just makes one mistake, and it is the film's attempt to turn stylistic and cutesy with its camera-work. The Duplass brothers have made a name for themselves in the world of Sundance and soft, admirable mumblecore, yet they persistently try a trick in the film that simply does not work. Every once in a while, about every three or four scenes, the camera will either zoom in or out slightly to try and establish credible emphasis (an assumption). You'll pick up on it, but perhaps won't be bothered. I found the technique to be unnecessary and distracting. Thankfully the story was strong and the heart and purpose was big.Starring: Jason Segel, Ed Helms, Susan Sarandon, Judy Greer, and Rae Dawn Chong. Directed by: Jay and Mark Duplass.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"To properly know the truth is to be in the truth" - Soren KierkegaardWhen the media began to co-opt the sixties counter-culture's anti-establishment message and turn it into advertising slogans and the marketing of tie-die shirts, you knew it was the beginning of the end for any serious purpose the movement may have embodied. If the Duplass Brothers' slacker comedy, Jeff, Who Lives at Home, is any indication, the corporate culture is now looking to trivialize and exploit the burgeoning interest in spirituality. While the film promotes sound ideas of spiritual connection and a purposeful universe, it turns them into a meaningless jumble of clichs, using them only as a device to market a contrived and artificial commercial product.As the film opens, Jeff (Jason Segal), a 30-year-old slacker living in his mother's basement, is talking into a tape recorder. He tells us his belief (which is flashed on the screen) that we are all connected, that everything happens for a reason, and that we have to look out for "signs" that will lead us to our destiny. To support his philosophy, he points to the 2002 movie Signs although, in reality, that film was not about looking for signs from the universe at all, but about crop circles and hostile aliens. The fact that Jeff is dictating while sitting on the toilet is an early indicator of the value the film places in his message. When Jeff is on the receiving end of a hostile phone call looking for someone named Kevin, he decides that there is a purpose behind the wrong number.While on the bus, he sees a young black basketball player (Evan Ross) wearing the name Kevin on his shirt. Thinking that this must mean something, he follows Kevin to a pick-up basketball game and begins a conversation with him after the game. Inviting Jeff to join him in smoking weed, Kevin sets him up for a mugging in a scene that has the smell of a racial comment. Jeff's older brother Pat (Ed Helms) is the 180-degree opposite in personality, but they share a set of dysfunctional values. Pat is a clueless and self-absorbed paint salesman who reveals to his wife Linda (Judy Greer) that he has just made a bold move and bought a Porsche without first discussing it with her. Her goal was to buy a new house and perhaps have a family and she is aghast at what she considers a reckless and unnecessary expenditure.A series of hapless misadventures then take place in which the two brothers relentlessly (and often hilariously) pursue Linda after she is seen having a conversation with another man. There is also an unlikely sub-plot involving the boys' mother (played by the great Susan Sarandon) and her co-worker Carol (Rae Dawn Chong), a sequence that, while well-done, seems to have been thrown into the mix only for the sake of political correctness. I will not say where all of this sitcom-like film ends up but if you are familiar with movie clichs, you can probably guess.Although the cast is excellent, they are let down by a weak script and a concept that appears to be used only to justify irresponsible behavior. A melodramatic sequence near the end may indicate the narcissistic Jeff's sudden awareness that it is possible to give of oneself to support other people, but the odds are against it. While the idea that we are all connected and that things happen for a reason is valid and has been around for thousands of years, it is ultimately only valuable as context not content, as an experience rather than as a belief system. It does not and should not replace individual and personal responsibility.While it is important to recognize guidance in having our intentions realized, sitting back and waiting for signs to give us direction is like waiting for a bus that runs only at very intermittent intervals. The idea of Deepak Chopra that we should, "pay attention, look for clues, decipher their meanings, and eventually the truth will be revealed" is erroneous. We are not Sherlock Holmes. There is nothing to decipher. The truth will not be revealed. It has already been revealed. Our life is the truth, one that cannot be understood but can only be lived - every moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got a chance to see this movie and this movie was one of the most anticipated movies of 2012 for me. I am so glad i watched this movie because this movie was a blast. It's got funny parts and also very touching and dramatic parts that worked really well. Jeff who lives at home is about Jeff, the main character, who is struggling on what to do in his life and his destiny. He believes in signs that can maybe change his life. Pat, played by Ed Helms, plays the most biggest ass ever and he does it very well. He is having relationship problems with his wife and he thinks his wife is having an affair. Sharon, Jeff's and Pat's mom, gets these strange "secret admirer" messages at work and she is very confused and excited at the same time. Towards the end, all these different stories come together and makes a beautiful and touching conclusion. I loved how you really don't care for the characters in the beginning but as the movie progresses, you get to actually feel and care for the characters which is very rare in a lot of movies. I also like how the relationship of the family grows towards the end of the movie. The only problems I had with this movie is that the Duplass brothers zoomed in and out too much in this movie and that this movie is only 1 hour and a half and it felt really long so it had some pacing issues. Other than that, this movie was very funny and is one of the best movies of the year so far. Thank you for reading my review! :D Overall: 9/10 A-</fullReview>
