		<fullReview>They don't come any better than Midnight Run. It has everything except a few Academy Awards and that's a mystery in itself. Dialogue, action, comic timing, stunts and all around fabulous acting ability from everyone involved. If you haven't seen this film yet, dig up a copy from somewhere, get a few beers and prepare to be captivated from beginning to end. To think that only 10,000 or so have voted for this film on IMDb and it's not even in the top 250 is a complete travesty. I know, there are other films just as worthy that are not in the top 250 but this is the one that get's me riled up. There are no weak moments or poor scenes in the whole film and the ending is pure joy. Someone please explain why this didn't clean up when it was released because I can't see anything else that came out in '88 that comes close to Midnight Run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the smartest, funniest, and exciting buddy pictures ever made. It has never received the wonderful attention it justly deserves. The performances by the two leads (De Niro and Grodin) are wonderful and they get outstanding support from Joe Pantolino, Dennis Farina, and Yaphet Kotto. But what separates this picture from all the other action / comedies ever made is that the screenplay is so sharp and original. Easily my all time favorite movie - you know how I know that? I must have seen "Midnight Run" at least thirty times and every time I see it, it gets better and better. A true film classic and is getting rereleased on DVD in June of 2003.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging adventure with two likable stars...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DeNiro is (Jack Walsh) a self-righteous ex-cop so unpopular with the Chicago police department, now wanting to make one final 'midnight run' that'll pay big so he can buy a nice coffee shop?He is hired by an hysterical bondsman to find and bring back a former Mob accountant called Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas (Grodin) who has stolen $15 million from the Los Angeles mob, given the money to the 'unfortunates of the earth.' DeNiro quickly captures the 'white-collar criminal' in New York, and is given five days to bring him to Los Angleles, to collect his $100,000 fee...Unfortunately for DeNiro, the fugitive accountant is too neurotic to fly the distance... The embezzler's ex-boss wants him badly for knowing all his financial transactions, and agent Yaphet Kotto warns Walsh not to interfere with the FBI's plans to bring the 'Duke' into federal court? And if this isn't enough, there is some third-rate bounty hunter (John Ashton) who is intrigued about DeNiro's special deal?In an extended cross-country chase, the two men's personalities and relationship develop? DeNiro shows how to catch talents of improvisation... His cheeky schoolboy look certainly supplies some of the film's lighter moments... He delivers some of the best punchlines, when he replies: 'Well if you don't cooperate, you're gonna suffer from fistophobia.' Charles Grodin is perfect as the prisoner who gets some of Serrano's records on computer disks, figuring if things got too rough, he could always trade them for his life? He continually gets on DeNiro's nerves, and with his soft and ironic tone of voice he advises Walsh that a restaurant is 'a very tricky investment.' He easily dips into Jack Walsh's life ('Don't you want to be loved?'), wandering about his broken marriage ('Did she hurt you, Jack?'), his habits ('Cigarettes are killers. Put the cigarette out.') and whatever he can think of... The best parts of the film are, in fact, the interactions between the two stars? The story holds up perfectly and entertains the viewer in every way? Martin Brest does bring out the realistic, funny and moving sides of his likable characters? Suspense is maintained to the very end?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is a movie of my favourite sort regardless of the genre - you feel you would neither add nor substract anything from it. Excellent cast, beautiful script, professional director's work. The main strength of the movie can be found in its unpretentiousness. It primarily aims at providing fun and entertainment, and fulfills it in an efficient way. You have your comedy and action galore. We are usually willing to suspend our disbelief when watching comedies. No such need when it comes to this movie - the plot, the relations between characters, their motives, everything works like a flawless machinery. It is as credible as life itself.The movie is brimming with memorable scenes. I have seen it twice - first when it appeared more than 15 years ago, and then again yesterday. I was delighted to find that the movie had lost nothing of its freshness and endured all time traps. I highly recommend it.9/10 !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Way too much objectionable language is the only fault of this otherwise extremely-entertaining film that is justifiably popular.Humor is what makes this "crime film" stand out as tough guys Robert De Niro, Joe Pantoliano, John Ashton, Dennis Farina and others provide a lot of laughs as not-so-tough guy Charles Grodin is escorted from New York to Los Angeles to face retribution from a mob boss.The dialog between Grodin and his bounty hunter captive De Niro, is terrific all the way through. The soundtrack, featuring the guitar of Ry Cooder, also is outstanding and adds to the fun of this film.The capper to this likable story is the satisfying ending, which almost everyone seems to like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To hell with the pretentiousness of a Shyamalan or the increasingly misplaced self-adulation of the Coens, 'Midnight Run' has no other purpose in life other than to use the movie as a medium of entertainment. . . and it does. Oh boy; it does.Badly underrated on release and still unfairly under valued even now, 'Midnight Run' is actually class-act film making, the narrative impeccably engineered and the acting uniformly excellent throughout.Faults? Definitely, not the least of 'em being the gratuitous use of profanity: the movie's tone is such that it just doesn't need the endless ear-grating use four letter words -- 'Midnight Run' isn't about reality or anything remotely approaching it, so the insistence on so much gutterspeak is a major error.Set pieces though are gloriously handled, and the helicopter sequence is quite as good as anything in a Bond movie -- a genre that has managed quite well without spraying profanities everywhere because it knows, and we know, none of it's real.9/10 then for 'Midnight Run', because as an exercise in how to develop a movie, to establish characters and plot trajectories, to bring 'em all together in a final wrap up and still leave space for a minor plot twist, it's of textbook quality. * I happened to see this as a late-night TV re-run, the day after watching the Coen's 'The Man Who Wasn't There'. 'Midnight Run' is everything that the Coen's work is not: it isn't self reverential, it isn't seeking to be a cult, and above all, it knows how to tell a story with speed and with style. RECOMMENDED.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can one say about their favorite movie? A movie that would make one laugh, in suspense, excited, and even touched. A film that takes two personalities which clash, and learn to get along with each other, to where they actually care for one another in the end. A film that touches one's soul, is a film that one can consider to be their favorite of all time. Robert De Niro plays Jack Walsh, a ex-Chicago police officer who is currently a bounty hunter. He works in Los Angeles for Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) who is a bail bonds man. Eddie offers Jack a job to catch and bring back the infamous Jonathan "the Duke" Markukas (Charles Grodin). Jonathan is a accountant who stole millions of Jimmy Serrano's (Dennis Farina) money, and gave it all to charity. Jonathan jumped bail and is in hiding. Jack needs to find John, bring him to the L.A. county jail within four days, and Jack will collect 100 thousand dollars. Jack does find John, in New York City, the first day. But Jack has many people following him. First there's the FBI, led by Alonzo Mosely (Yaphet Kotto) who wants John to testify against Jimmy Serrano. Second there's Tony Darvo (Richard Foronjy) and Robert Miranda (Joey), two dim-wits working for Serrano, who want John dead. Then there is Marvin Dofler (John Ashton), another bounty hunter who wants John also, but for a smaller price. From there on, it's a cross country trip which involve all of the men looking for Jack and John. A film which has some very exciting moments with action. Other moments where the scenes are intense where Jack and John's lives are in danger. And scenes where the two men share each other's thoughts and feelings, which surprisingly makes the movie touching. The acting by De Niro is at his best. He does his usual tough guy attitude, but he also mixes it with some humor, and emotions. Charles Grodin is also great as the sensitive accountant who is the exact opposite of Jack's personality. And Dennis Farina is funny and scary as the outraged mob boss who has a vicious attitude. The music by Danny Elfman, I find to be his career best. It's not like his famous BATMAN, BETTLEJUICE, or SLEEPY HOLLOW style of score. It's more like a mixture classic Chicago rhythm and blues, which even Elfman himself considered to be his most unusual score. The writing by George Gallo is also excellent. He manages to fit a cross country story within two hours of time, while still bringing out personalities of the characters and making sure there are no holes in the plot. He also manages to have some very funny scenes involving Jack and John. And the direction by Martin Brest is outstanding. He keeps the movie at a very fast pace, without any slowing down. He does brilliant moves like having De Niro and Grodin improvising their lines while arguing. Brest also does a great job by making the film enjoyable for it's 125 minutes. This is a movie that touched me, it can be considered a "man's" movie on the surface. But take apart this film, and it's also a film that women can enjoy also. The most emotional scenes involve Jack seeing his ex-wife and daughter after not seeing them for ten years. It shows that everybody makes a mistake in life, and that we can all try to forgive people that emotionally hurt us. People say that one can identify a person's personality by the movies and music that they like. To find out what I am like, pop in this movie into your DVD player or VCR, and you'll see. Saying this movie is better than CITIZEN KANE, STAR WARS, GODFATHER, and GONE WITH THE WIND is a pretty bold statement. But, the character of Jack Walsh shows my personality. This is the way I am, therefore it's my favorite movie of all time. And I'm not the only one, Robert De Niro said on a interview on Oprah Winfrey, that this is his most enjoyable film that he's done. ***** (out of five; THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT Writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pleasantly surprised by this one. I had heard people refer to this one, but hadn't seen it for myself until recently. One of the better buddy-action movies I've seen, due to a very tight script. Superior writing by George Gallo. The story is what drives this movie from beginning to end, and doesn't need to depend solely on the cast to keep the audience interested for the full 2 hours. DeNiro and Grodin are excellent together, with a great supporting cast. I would keep this movie in my personal collection. I would also consider it a fine example for other buddy action movies to follow, even today. Highly recommended for great comedic writing, directing and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best 'mismatched buddy' genre movies of the period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Walsh is an ex-cop turned bounty hunter working for bail-bondsman Eddie Moscone. Looking for another job to bring in, Jack is presented with an ex-mob accountant, Jonathon Mardukas, who has ripped off the mafia for millions of dollars and has gone on the run. Using the very basic tricks of his trade, Jack easily finds and catches his man and prepares to transport him back to Moscone and collect his pay. However, with the FBI, the mafia and other bounty hunters all looking to bring in Jonathon for differing reasons, Jack has a hard road ahead of him ? and that's before he discovers Jonathon's phobias about planes.In terms of cinema, I remember the 80's for one main genre ? the buddy movie; the genre continues today but that is my overriding memory of the films I saw during this time and since then from the period. Hardly a dynamic hotbed or imagination and innovation, the genre did throw up many films that are quite enjoyable if you meet them on their own terms and it did occasionally produce some that are very enjoyable and still stand up years later ? for a combination of reasons, Midnight Run is one of these and, for my money is a great street smart comedy. Of course it is still a genre film but the plot is well written combining a reasonably engaging story with a fun series of set pieces. While it is not laugh our loud funny apart from maybe once or twice what it does manage is to have a comic tone to it and a great sense of fun and energy throughout. It is hard to describe but it is one of those films that just feels comfortable and fun to watch.A major part of this is the fantastic playing of the actors ? the cast and their chemistry go a long way to making this a better film that it may have been in other, less able, hands. De Niro plays his well-practiced tough guy but allows himself to be the butt of humour if not out and out jokes. What he (and the writers) did very well was to keep the audience on his side even though he was basically transporting Jonathon to his death! He comes off as a likable guy and De Niro takes what many other actors have made into a clichéd part and really made it his own. His easy chemistry with Grodin also helps a lot and the two really so work together thanks to a good comic performance from him. Of course in a more serious film, Jonathon as he was would be very unrealistic but Grodin's delivery suits the material and tone of the film perfectly. The support cast are all given minor roles to share out and they all contribute in their own little way. Kotto gives plenty of laughs with a minor character. Ashton has less time and a less likable character but still does OK; Farina could not look more 'mob' if he tried; Pantoliano swears a lot and is amusing while minor roles for the like of Walters and Hall add to the cast in cameos. While the film has a deep cast, it really belongs to De Niro and Grodin, both of whom really deliver and have an easy chemistry between them befitting the genre.If I had a complaint it would be the sheer volume of swear words in the film; the first time I saw it was on ITV (that most notorious of editors ? they cut whole scenes out of Die Hard due to swearing!) and it was cut to shreds with plenty of badly dubbed lines and scenes just removed due to language. Personally I'm not overly bothered by it but it is such a fun film that it seems a shame to make it unsuitable for children by such liberal use of the F word (one or two can be forgiven but every other word pretty much makes it unsuitable), but I suppose it is all part of the tough but fun tone of the film and I enjoy it regardless.Overall this is not one of the greatest films ever nor one of De Niro's best but it is a very, very good genre film and, in my mind, stands out from many other buddy-style movies that have been made in the crime/thriller sort of mould. The plot mixes a good story with many fun set pieces and keeps a solidly enjoyable pace all the way through while a roundly strong cast all make better use of the script than lesser actors could have done. A very enjoyable genre film and one that I will keep coming back to due to its reliable mix of pace, energy, fun and excitement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most enjoyable movie I have ever seen: hilarious situations, unforgettable lines, car chases, characters you care for, and even a dramatic scene that makes me cry every time. A real American classic: call it a road movie, action comedy, buddy film, whatever---it's a beautiful script, professionally executed. What a country, huh? What a country!My friends and I rented this movie to celebrate a reunion after 12 years, and we were rolling with laughter in five minutes. Don't watch the TV version if it's got the f-words edited out---they are very important to the experience.I can't believe: (a) this movie didn't get an Oscar, (b) it's not well known even in the U.S., and (c) there's no DVD version available any more. I want to buy it! Why don't they want to sell it???</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film i have ever had the pleasure to witness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello.I actually created an account merely for the purposes of composing a review for this film.I wont waste everyones time with describing the plot and/or what occurs in this film as there as hundreds of numerous other reviews which do just that.I will begin with what i believe is what makes a good film...Far too often i find that in the current climate so much of a film is devoted to CG and "plasticity", if such a word exists, but i suspect that you all know what i mean.Not a lot of what one see's these days is actually devoted to the testament of a good actor, and when this is recognised and witnessed, it is quite an achievement.The reason that this film is such an accomplishment is down to the fact that from beginning to end it is a display of everything that a film should be and all that makes a film good and worthwhile watching.From the start to the finish this film is graced with a good storyline and FANTASTIC acting throughout, even though i could never associate with how any of these characters would feel being put in their situations every scene makes you believe that is believable.Deniro (Jack Walsh)and Grodin (Jonathan Mardukas) are an unsuspected but utterly fantastic combination of 2 characters making this film simply come to life in ways that other films can only hope to strive to achieve, coupled with John Ashton (Marvin) and Dennis Farina (Serano), this makes for a cast that delivers one of the best screen performances individually and as a group that i have ever witnessed.Every scene has meaning and relevance, even scenes that are aired for comic intent solely but still achieving more than that.These days many people are bored by watching actors "act" and simply want whizz and bang and fizz and pop and bells and whistles attached and i suspect it has led to a significant increase in the dumbing down of (hollywood) cinema.Directors and actors should take a page out of the book of this film and realise and re-embrace what is truly needed for a film to stand out regardless of a (suspected) dumbed down audience that exists these days. If people are too stupid and ignorant to be able to follow a plot then they deserve the drivel that is put on the big screen but i suspect that the majority of people still want a good film, and apologies for digressing from the point but this film is it.Funny and serious all rolled into one from the offset and grittily realistic and truthful and insightful into how people really are.Some of the one liners alone are simply hilarious;"Marvin look out!" "Well i've got 2 words for you, Shut the %$?&amp; up" "96 bottles of beer on the wall" "Would you ever have $?X with a chicken Jack?" "Watch your cigarette with this one Jack!" "Did you do the litmus configuration?"In summary, this film is what makes a film worthwhile watching, fantastic acting, plot, and cast to mention but a few positive aspects of. Considering you can probably purchase this film delivered for less that ?4 ($5-6) these days you really would be a fool to miss out.Finally, i have not to this day watched a film so many numerous times that i can still watch and laugh at a gag i have heard many times before. Every time i watch this film something new presents itself to me.Put simply one of the best films i have ever seen and anyone who considers themselves a seasoned avid film watcher would regard this simply film genius and poetry in motion.You WILL relish every minute of this film i suspect, so enjoy! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Run is quite simply magnificent.If we were to judge it on a technical craft level, we can only conclude that it is a masterpiece of its genre.The Writing? pitch perfect. The dialogue is hilarious, clever, idiosyncratic, truthful, sublime. The plotting and character development was economically and brilliantly and logically constructed with a heart stopping finale and quite magical final scene...The Acting? Perfect. I mean it, literally perfect. There is not a false note or showboating, raised eyebrow performance in sight. EVERY singe actor in this film, the leads AND the support is a 10. It just doesn't get better. But obviously this is DeNiro and Grodin's movie, each in turn stealing the scenes from the other. It's like a masterclass in the craft. That these two actors never worked together again is a crime by todays standards. This was a vintage year for DeNiro movies, well 87-88. there was this, The Untouchables, Angel Heart, but this is maybe the best and most honest of them all. Any student actors who want to know 'how to do it', simply watch his scene with the daughter he hasn't seen for 8 years, you won't be able to breath it is so powerful.The directing? again perfect, there is not a scene you would direct differently than it is done. It is tight economical forward moving visual story telling, exactly appropriate for the type of film it is. Not over done or self conscious. just clean and simple with wonderful, surprising and suspenseful scenes. The car chase with the helicopter and Jack Walsh's final moment over the ravine with the same helicopter are just terrific.The music is terrific too and has remained so in a way that many 80's film soundtracks haven't.Okay there, so if you like films to be great on technical level, you have a masterclass in every department.If you don't care much about excellence on a technical level and just like a good story well told, Then Midnight Run is one of the most wonderful, warm, engaging, funny, exciting and most satisfying stories you are ever likely to encounter. I mean it, whoever you are, YOU. WILL. LOVE. THIS. FILM.Oh but there is LOTS of swearing which I personally found hilarious and though virtually constant, always so expertly written and delivered it somehow never felt gratuitous. Just funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Road Movie, Buddy Movie, Comedy-Action all Rolled into One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the key ingredients for a successful movie is chemistry that evolves between actors playing particular characters. In the case of Midnight Run, Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are unlikely bedfellows as a bail bounty-hunter and his bail-jumper accountant who used to keep the books on a mobster who runs drug rings in Chicago and Las Vegas (where else?). Jack Walsh (De Niro) has been hired by a sleazy bail bond firm in Los Angeles to bring back Jonathan "the Duke" Mardukas (Grodin) in 72 hours or everyone turns into pumpkins. His bounty is worth $100,000, partially because the firm put up nearly one half a million dollars for the bail. If Grodin isn't brought back in time, the courts will keep the bail money and the firm will be out of business.However, it turns out there are other parties involved who also want Mardukas. The mild-mannered accountant had been keeping the books on the mob for several years but didn't realize he was doing it for Jimmy Serrano, one of the most notorious drug king-pins in Chicago. Before the events of the movie, Mardukas, upon realizing his involvement, embezzled millions of the mob's drug money but made the fatal mistake of sending postcards to Serrano bragging about how he was using the money to fund charitable causes. He was arrested for being party to the mob but later skipped out on bail.The story begins with De Niro being hired to track down Mardukas to bring him back to Los Angeles, although the mob might try to assassinate him before any kind of legal proceedings. Grodin still has in his possession all the "goods" on the mob, their racketeering, etc. So the mob decides they want Grodin before he is returned to custody. Then add to the mix the FBI who also gets into the act decides they need Grodin to help build their case against Serrano. If that isn't enough, the bail bond firm, distrusting De Niro, hires yet another sleazy bounty hunter, Marvin, who also wants to get Grodin for the payback money.Walsh finds Mardukas at a mundane New York apartment with his wife. The original plan is to take him to LA via a plane, but Mardukas claims that he suffers from a fear of flying and forces them to take a cross-country trip. "Midnight Run" is essentially a cross between several genres: a cross-country chase movie, a comedy, a buddy movie, an action movie. Not unlike the road movies of the 1940's, the two characters end up in all kinds of strange locales across the United States, from Chicago suburbs to the Arizona desert. They go by passenger trains, stolen cars, even a cargo train.Aside from the essential plot, which is a bit fantastical in retrospect but plausible enough to suspend your disbelief during the course of the movie, the real gem is the relationship between De Niro and Grodin. I don't think these actors had ever played in a film before this pairing and yet they seem strangely natural together. De Niro as Walsh is the cigarette-smoking hard-talking urbanite who looks like his clothes were laundered last in the 1970's. By contrast, Grodin is the soft-spoken suburbanite accountant who thinks in terms of practical decisions, the complete opposite from De Niro. During the entire film, Grodin needles De Niro about his habits and eventually his relationships, including his ex-wife and daughter. At first the two dislike one another, particularly De Niro towards Grodin, but by the end something has changed.A really fun movie, a bit mad-cap in places, but the real treasure is the chemistry between De Niro and Grodin. Throughout the movie, there are several ongoing jokes, but the one that stands out is "maybe in the next life", meaning that De Niro and Grodin could have been friends under different circumstances. Although I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a terribly deep movie, it's almost perfect escapist fair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fast-paced and very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marty Brest (the director of "Beverly Hills Cop") has outdone himself with this fast-paced, very funny cop-buddy movie with a difference. Scripter George Gallo has managed to throw in a large slice of road movie madness too as the audience are introduced to bounty hunter Jack Walsh and white-collar criminal John Mardukis. The two have combined to produce a flick packed with value entertainment.Next best thing is the cast, who all contribute perfectly to the fun. De Niro does well with the angry ex-Chicago cop, and he, along with an equally impressive Charles Grodin, give us much to laugh at. This was an inspired teaming. Funniest moments come from the appearance of Special Agent Alonzo Moseley of the FBI. Yaphet Kotto has a field day with this increasingly frustrated lawman. John Ashton is great as a bit of thick rival to Jack for the Duke's payout, Joe Pantoliano likewise as the scheming bail bondsman, while Dennis Farina gives just the right amount of weight to his mob chieftain.Add to all this Donald Thorin's pacey photography and Danny Elfman's catchy score, and you've got a great night out.Saturday, August 29, 1998 - T.V.Pairing of DeNiro and Grodin makes this film a hit. These two great actors hit it off beautifully! Yaphet Kotto is great as miffed FBI Lieutenant Moseley. Tops too are John Ashton (as Marv the dopey hit-man) and John Pantoliano as the double-crossing bail bondsman.Script from George Gallo is both funny and clever, and director Marty Brest adds up-beat, pacey direction to create a comedy-action flick that's a lot of fun. Danny Elfman's score, foot tapping and jaunty, wraps it up.Saturday, November 27, 1999 - Video</fullReview>

The scene while they are getting chased by the helicopter is outstanding. I love how they are all screaming, then you hear Ashton comment that maybe the helicopter is gone, and you hear Grodin reply, "Oh Im sure we're perfectly safe" in a very dry and disapointed tone is SO FUNNY.

		<shortDescription>midnight run is one of the 80's finest films, watch it and you'll agree...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would just like to say that I love this movie. First of all, it pleases me to see De Niro when he is at his prime, or at least a lot younger. I think this is the kind of movie, where De niro's desire for humor in movies comes at his best! His ability for perfect sarcasm in this film is beyond me. How many times a laughed in this film, I don't know. Probably trough out the whole movie. But it's not just De Niro, which makes this movie great. Every single actor does his best to make this a fine movie, with good acting and directing. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a GOOD movie, where he can laugh , or enjoy the action , or even enjoy the "romantic moment" === ( e.g. when his daughter runs out, to give all her babysitting money. To her father, who she hasn't in 9 years.) Thought this was a touchy moment. I gave it 10 out of 10, just because I couldn't find anything that was missing in this movie !! One of the greatest , watch it !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the most entertaining movies I have seen. The action never gets too violent, and the comedy is great!It's great that they choose Robert De Niro to play Jack Walsh, because he adds a great sadness to the character. Charles Grodin is PERFECT as The Duke, few other actors could have made an "annoying" character like Jonathan charming!The story is about a man (Grodin) who stole 15 million dollars from a Las Vegas gangster (Denis Farina), but then got caught by the police. He escaped from his bail bondsman and is now on the run. A bounty hunter (De Niro) is trying to catch him and bring him to LA. But he only has five days to do so...Of course, it is a roadmovie. Which means that along the road (from New York to Los Angeles) the two characters (who are hunted by F.B.I., the mafia and another bounty hunter) start to like each other. Or they just might in the next life...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My single most favourite film ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got Midnight Run on DVD and can't stop watching it. Even 14 years after it came out, when I meet my schooltime friends, we can crack each other up instantly by one saying "Alonzo Mosely, FBI" and the other responding (yelling) "I'M MOSELY!". Just by reading the subject in another comment ("You lied to me first") made me laugh out loud alone in front of my computer.There IS action in Midnight Run (chases and stuff), there is also drama (the scene with Walsh's daughter brings me close to tears every time), there is even a bit of suspense in the airport scene, but what really makes this film tick is the comedy resulting from a perfect cast with impeccable timing. Most of the laughs come from the actors underacting their parts. Yaphet Kotto cracks me up just by turning around slowly to one of his officers, without as much as raising an eyebrow.I could go on and on, but why don't you see for yourself and go see this very much underrated film.Gave it a 10 (duh!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best Robert De Niro films ever made. Its endlessly quotable and has enough comedy and action to keep everyone happy. Watch out for Dennis Farina as Jimmy Serrano. The funniest part he's played until Get Shorty's Ray Bones. The banter between Johnaton Mardukas and Jack Walsh is genius and watch for Joe Pantoliano playing basically the same part he would play later on in Bad Boys. I would recommend this to anyone with a decent taste in movies. 7.5 is an abomination for such an excellent film. Everybody needs to see it and then give it the rightful place it deserves 10/10. More laughs can be gotten from Yaphat Kotto's portrayal of Alonzo Mosely FBI. It has solid acting and a solid script. It is an absolute must see for fans of De Niro or films like Welcome to the Jungle or buddy comedies. It's a film that will never become dated or old. In fact am going to watch it again now</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I watched this movie, I immediately started it again after the credits rolled. Loved it just as much the 2nd time, and over the years, I can honestly say that almost anytime I watch Midnight Run, I usually end up watching it a 2nd (and sometimes 3rd) time within the next few days. I'm fairly certain the reason for this is that it's evokes such a feeling, creates such a time and place, that I'm practically nostalgic for watching it the minute it ends. Part of that has to do with Danny Elfman's score, and part of it has to do with DeNiro's and Grodin's performances, but more than anything, it's the fact that they just don't make movies like this anymore.Midnight Run is without a question a perfect movie, but more importantly, it's a time vessel back to an era where you could tell this kind of story, and make a movie like this, and everyone comes out on top.I love this movie like I love my childhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be one of the most underrated movies I have ever seen... And i was lucky to watch it randomly on a TV channel. Robert de Niro is at his best and Charles Grodin is also excellent as De Niro's co-star.The plot is easy to get and follow. A bounty hunter (ex-cop) catches a wanted man and wants to take him from L.A to New York to collect his prize. The FBI and Mafia interfere in order to take this man for theyselves and everything gets funny and awesome. Watch this movie is on the best action comedies I have ever seen. And is really weird that this movie did not get the praise it deserves and for me has a really low score in IMDb 10 out of 10 for me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute classic not only in the action/comedy genre but of any genre. Movie fans if for some reason you have not seen this film I urge you to see it now. De Niro as always gives an acting masterclass and shows his versatility by turning a grumpy,money hungry bounty hunter into a character you really are rooting for. Charles Grodin is also superb and when you see his performance in this you will wonder why he ended up playing the dad in the Beethoven films rather than becoming an acting A- lister. The supporting cast are all solid which combined with the two leading performances make for a great movie. This is essentially a road movie and a fantastic one at that. The mostly visceral dialogue coming from De Niro combated by Grodins incessant needle will have you laughing out loud. A MUST SEE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best comedy/adventure of all time, to me at least. Sheer movie magic!Yes, there was a time when comedy was actually funny and intelligent. "Midnight Run" is a timeless masterpiece, I've seen it a dozen times and it never fails to put me in a good mood. Such a perfect mix of star power, clever and funny script, and excellent direction (not to mention the 80's charm adding up to the whole thing) is nothing short of a cinematic miracle.The chemistry between the leads is electrifying, the soundtrack is fabulous and did I mention the brilliant script? Fast-paced and witty, it combines Grodin's deadpan performance with De Niro's energy to a marvelous result. Despite being light like a feather, "Midnight Run" presents strong character development and serious acting skills from everybody involved. They can't (and won't) make movies like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has vaulted unexpectedly onto my 'all time Top Ten' list. Until recently, I had seen it several times, but never from beginning to end. Within the past month, I've now watched the entire movie three times. My enjoyment of it continues to increase with additional viewings, which places it in a very rare category. I thoroughly agree with other user reviews who regard it as radically underrated.This is brilliant comedy. In the manner of Shakespeare comedies, it has many implausible (or impossible!) plot devices that both define and enhance the character of the movie, yet there are many poignant and moving moments as well.The comedy is droll and intelligent. The characters themselves rarely laugh, and yet, there are so many hilarious lines, delivered with brilliant timing. It's just magnificent.The script is excellent, with not a wasted word or superfluous scene. (And the profanity, by the way, referenced in a number of other reviews is very much part of the film.) Every role is perfectly cast, and perfectly played. The musical score is also superb.Finally, after several viewings, I'm 'blown away' by the scene involving the daughter... the expression on her face, captured so magnificently in the cinematography, and the lighting, is one of the remarkable moments in all of cinema in my experience. This may sound like hyperbole... You be the judge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an astounding piece of screenplay and direction! Midnight Run begins with action, ends with action and has action throughout. The best part is that all of it is mixed intelligently with classy and genuine humor all the way. And what makes this action and humor stick together to make a masterpiece? The great original soundtrack. The background score in the entire movie gives you the feel of mischief and naughtiness and gels amazingly with the awesome screenplay.Robert De Niro is simply amazing as the bounty hunter and Charles Grodin does it superbly as the irritating accountant or bounty. I also loved the character of Alonzo Mosely.The movie's direction, editing and acting by every single character makes it so real that you actually start believing all of the chase and deceit is possible! It's a classic and deserves to be in everyone's all time favorites list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Has It All - Can't Be Made Any Better Than It Already Is!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite movies of all time that is one of the few that I actually own! Every time somebody comes to visit, they know they will have to watch Midnight Run with me. It is the only movie I can watch again and again because it just never gets old. It is the perfect duo of opposing personalities in Deniro and Grodin. It's a shame they haven't been paired up in other movies because these two characters make the movie. I even let my 9 year old watch it because there is nothing gory or scary and there is no sex - just a lot of swears. And frankly, without the swears, it is not nearly as funny. I've seen it on regular censored t.v. and when they replace "f*ck" with "hell", it definitely loses something. This would probably be rated PG-13 nowadays given the language. The cast of other characters (from the bail bondsman, to the other bounty hunter, to the mafia, to the police) is also incredible. Whoever chose the cast in this movie deserves an award - and so does the screenplay and the movie. It has it all - comedy, constant action, drama, some mild (child friendly "cops and robbers" type) violence, some good, bad, and ugly, and just an outstanding and memorable story line. My son is 9 and he loves it. Any younger than 9, and the kids probably wouldn't quite understand it because there are so many different characters and so many things going on - they might have a lot of questions. Otherwise, if you don't have a big problem with some serious foul language and one reference to sex (referenced with the "f" word only), it can be a great family movie that everybody will totally enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unheralded DeNiro Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert DeNiro is on my short list of all-time great actors, with a number of memorable performances in great films spanning 40 years in the business. Midnight Run represents one of his more underrated efforts, a thoroughly enjoyable comedy drama which also boasts a fine supporting cast. DeNiro plays Jack Walsh, an ex-cop who now works as a bounty hunter. He is hired by a sleazy bail bondsman (Joe Pantoliano) to bring in Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas (Charles Grodin) within 5 days. Mardukas, who has embezzled millions of dollars from gangster Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina) is a talkative, finicky pain in the ass who frustrates Walsh, questioning him at every turn and complicating his task. DeNiro overcomes countless obstacles while trying to get his quarry to Los Angeles on time for the payoff while being pursued by mobsters, local law enforcement, rival bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton) and Federal Marshal Mosley (the always enjoyable Yaphet Kotto), all doggedly determined to bring in The Duke themselves.DeNiro gives his usual entertaining performance, but Grodin steals the show as the fussbudget Mardukas, and the joy of the movie lies in the interplay between the two. On the run and seemingly in conflict at every turn, the duo eventually develop an understanding of one another, and DeNiro is forced to take stock of himself while being hounded by Grodin's bothersome personal inquiries. We find out that DeNiro's character is an honorable guy down deep- doomed to his current profession for refusing to join his entire police squad who was on the take from the very gangster pursuing The Duke. And Grodin is shown as a person that while not without fault, is a decent guy whose honest accounting business was stained by mobsters. This sets up the inevitable meeting of all parties involved in the final part of the movie.Midnight Run is entertaining from beginning to end and provides just the right balance between comedy and drama. Highly recommended film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprise Favorite Buddy Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Run is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is my single favorite "buddy movie". I can hear the movie people laughing, "Cast who? DeNiro/Grodin in a buddy movie?!". DeNiro/Grodin's performances are ideal. Their relationship is unusual and uniquely entertaining. Primary protagonist DeNiro is forced to confront himself--his insecurity, his fears, his selfishness, his past--and to gradually become aware of a personal agenda, thanks to the fateful presence of an irritating companion. The writing, acting, and direction are perfect. I cannot recall a failure in the suspension of disbelief in this movie. Though, due to adult language Midnight Run is not a family movie, the dialog is hilariously appropriate. For me, Midnight Run is a movie I need to see from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good road trip kind of movie with DeNiro as a bounty hunter and Charles Grodin as his prey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always enjoyed this comedy/action/drama movie, it is probably one of my favorite movies featuring Robert DeNiro. The story has a bounty hunter sent out to secure a guy who apparently ripped off a very unsavory character. DeNiro's character gets more than he bargained for as not only does he have to worry about the typical rival bounty hunter, but also the FBI and guys looking to take out his target. The film kind of plays out like the more comedy oriented film "Planes, Trains and Automobiles". This one is rather funny too, it is just it has more action and such to go along with the comedy than did that movie. Both are good, but for different reasons, even though they share a few similarities such as the many modes of transportation like airplanes and trains. The movie runs a bit long, but not to bad as the pace of the film is really good. Both DeNiro and Grodin are great as the bounty hunter and the target respectively and there are some really nice scenes as you think the two are finally getting along and Grodin once again tries to escape. Really funny and a really good movie, I always love a movie where there is a lot of travel in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll bury this telephone in your head ? Midnight Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gigli. That is all I have to say to begin this review. You may ask why, and I will tell you. Director Martin Brest has not worked in Hollywood since the debacle that was Gigli. After a decade and a half of quality films, his career was destroyed by the pairing of super couple Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. I really enjoy Meet Joe Black, (besides the ending); find Beverly Hills Cop to be highly entertaining; and have heard good things about Scent of a Woman despite Al Pacino's Oscar winning over-the-top "Who-Hahs", and now I can add Midnight Run to the mix of pre-implosion Brest goodness. With a great cast, including odd-couple Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin leading the way, a humorous script, and impressive action sequences on this cross-country trip gone awry, the film overcomes its 1980s atmosphere, (the first class plane set-up is exact to that used in the Wedding Singer, sorry, I had to point that out), to age gracefully and remain as good now as people I've heard say it was; those who had seen it back then.De Niro is an ex-cop turned bounty hunter for a Los Angeles bail-bondsman?a slimy cretin like only Joe Pantoliano can do?that has been enlisted to capture the embezzling accountant of the mob boss that made him lose his job on the force. So, in one fell swoop, his Jack Walsh can make $100,000, get back at the criminal who took his life away, and put a crook behind bars as his self-righteous, by-the-books sensibilities like him to do. By by-the-books, I mean as far as not taking payoffs, not being on the payroll of a drug dealer, and not covering for cops who are. I don't mean someone who takes the safety of his prisoner seriously, nor Miranda rights or any other creature comforts the people in his custody may deserve. He'll handcuff you inside a train car bathroom, throw you into a rapid flowing river, toss you from a moving train, and lead you through a gunfight. But that is the kind of stuff that makes the film so much fun. If there weren't antics and reason for De Niro and Grodin's accountant "The Duke" to hate each other, their sarcasm and biting rapport would never come through.And that is truly what makes Midnight Run so enjoyable to watch. The chemistry between these two leads is phenomenal. We've got the city cop, blue-collar mentality of Jack pitted against the intellectual, white-collared obnoxiousness of Jon Mardukas. Grodin basically epitomizes the annoying child you may have on a long trip that constantly asks whether you are there yet. His questions and unceasing fervor at which he attempts to get the answers would give anyone an ulcer as they try to keep their temper in check. This is vintage Grodin and makes you wonder where he has gone. Looking back at his career, he didn't act in very many films, and when he did it was in smaller roles. However, the guy doesn't deserve to go out with the Beethoven movies. Someone's got to cast him in something, having only one credit to his name in the past fifteen years. As for De Niro, you may be able to call this the first sign of the comedic bent he has embraced in the last few years. Sadly, he has become a caricature of himself lately, but visiting this gem from 1988 definitely shows you the talent he has, the ability to go from serious to funny, especially with a guy like Grodin to bounce off of.The script may be a bit obvious, at least as far as connecting the start to the finish. As for as the journey to get there, however, everything, including the kitchen sink, is thrown into the mix. Our duo has the feds on their tail, hit men from Denis Farina's mob boss Jimmy Serrano, (I still love how great this guy is at playing hard-ass wiseguys, yet he was a cop before turning to Hollywood), a competing bounty hunter looking to collect the cash, city police forces, people consorting behind their backs mucking things up, and whatever else you can think of. Jack Walsh is no pushover though, he is the kind of guy that sets his mind to something and follows it through to the end. Only caring for him and the future he hopes to eventually realize, you soon learn that he'll do anything for self-preservation. The way he treats bounty hunter rival Marvin Dorfler, (supporting journeyman John Ashton), really gets this point across?use whomever until they aren't needed anymore, then drop them off and continue on.There are many little things that add to the overall success of the film as well. Yaphet Kotto's FBI Agent Mosely becomes a lot of fun as he follows one step behind for the duration, the bumbling hit-man are always enjoyable, (having one act like a child, playing around all the time while the other tries to talk to the boss helps), and just the subtle way in which De Niro's past is revealed through his conversations with Grodin bring so much more to what would otherwise be a simple comic actioner. You do find out a lot about the leads through their actions and interactions with those they cross paths with. De Niro's family life and moral compass eventually reveals the kind of man he is, hidden beneath the hard exterior, and Grodin's reasons for what he did come out into the open as well. There are motivations behind each action and that attention to detail, coupled with a witty and strongly performed screenplay, shows what Brest can do when he's given the pieces necessary to succeed. In other words, give him a second chance. I may think differently if I ever view Gigli, but for now, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro doing comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his portrayal of Jack Walsh, Robert De Niro proves that he is one of the most versatile actors of our time, this time in a comedy, not his usual genre. However, it is not all laughs: his excellent performance evokes laughter, pity, and frustration with the ease that we have come to expect from him. This film was brilliantly cast and very entertaining. All of the acting, in addition to De Niro, was superb: Yaphet Kotto, John Ashton, Dennis Farina, Joe Pantoliano, and my two favorite goofs "Tony and Joey." Charles Grodin is unarguably in his best role: it seems as if he is essentially playing himself. Do yourself a favor, and watch the uncut version of this gem and you'll be very glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Run is one of the most underrated movies of recent memory. There has been many attempts a regurgitating the story line from my fellow commenter's, so I will go in a different direction.The Deniro character is awesome. Most Deniro fans will have to see this movie a couple of times to understand his comedic brilliance in this movie. The interaction between Deniro and Grodin is incomparable. It has been rumored that Grodin aggravated Deniro so much on the movie set that it brought out the best in these two actors in the film.The soundtrack is marvelously written by Danny Elfman. I have one question on the soundtrack...who is that playing the Slide and Electric Lead Guitar on the soundtrack? Is this Danny Elfman himself? There is not any listed credits for the musicians so it is impossible to tell who it is...but suffice it to say that the slide guitar player sounds like Ry Kooder on Steroids. The music complements the chase scenes like I haven't heard or seen in many years.If you do not have this movie in your collection, BUY IT. It is one of those movies you can watch every couple of months and never get bored with it or its characters.Jim Morris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a great and funny movie, and certainly lets me down not to see it mention reading about De Niro's work. This movie has been totally overlooked, and that's a shame. I never get tired of watching it. The music backgrounds are excellent - touching in folk, blues, country, rock, and the last track that follows the credits is awesome, lasting for almost four minutes.This film is light years beyond any other road movie since it blends action with humour. Most of road movies are expendable, but Midnight Run is a must-see.Unlike other people have commented here, not all tv versions have been edited. Actually the one I've got was taped from the telly and has everything on it. At least in this place the movie has been "respected".The final scenes are so touching, when Jack Walsh says goodbye to the Duke and the latter gives him a belt full of money. "We'll see each other next life" they sort of say themselves, and then Jack walks out of the airport. The final touch of irony is that, though he has such a lot of money a taxi driver refuses to let him in because he thinks Jack is a comedian so he has to walk in the rain.I think I most enjoy the movie because I'm usually fond of road movies, and in my country (Spain, Europe) they don't come very often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fun Friday night type of flick that MUST be viewed uncut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever notice that some movies fit perfectly into certain times of day or certain days of the week? Well, this is a Friday night movie if ever there was one. Yes its a blast...If you like Beverly Hills Cop, you will LOVE Midnight Run!! The same director, but an even better story. It also has the great snappy soundtrack by Danny Elfman, and the uproarious character actor Dennis Farina as the mob boss ("you two better start getting more personally involved in your work or I'm going to blowtorch the both of ya!")So Jack Walsh (Robert Deniro) needs to a bring mob accountant/embezzler John Mardukas(played by Charles Grodin) back to LA by Friday midnight to get a hundred grand from a bond bailsman. Jacks had his fill of being a bounty hunter and is going to take the cash and open a diner...not so fast jack! This may be trickier than you thought...Thus begins a cross-country odyssey that you will just love. The accountant claims he can't fly (I just love that scene on the plane), so they decide to take a train ....well, this just isn't going to be as easy as Jack thought. Its not just the bail bondsman that wants the accountant, the mob boss (Farina) wants him dead, it also seems some bumbling FBI agents, AND another bounty hunter, want to get in on this chase too.All kinds of various modes of transportation end up being utilized as Jack gets closer and closer to his deadline. Meanwhile Jack and the accountant are bickering the whole way. This brings up one of the keys to this films greatness, the chemistry between Deniro and Grodin is amazing (much of it was actually ad-libbed by the two actors). They are like another version of the odd couple, and you should love it.Also, the other bounty hunter on the trail is also from Beverly Hills Cop, John Ashton...and hes perfect in the role.Give this a try, if you haven't seen it, I ENVY YOU...cause you get to see it for the first time. I've probably seen it 6 or 7! ...Oh, and view it uncut because the profanity is actually part of the humor...(and I got two words for you...Shut the F##K Up!).And I love the wrap-up...its a feel-good movie...again, a great Friday night movie, enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Run 1988, the benchmark for the buddy buddy road movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unsung DeNiro classic. The missing 80s masterpiece as regards everything coming together, and simply the best buddy buddy movie that, to me at least, has ever hit the screen.De Niro &amp; Grodin, there is no other duo in the genre that bounces off each other with the 100% joyful results we get here. They define the term dynamic duo. Director Martin Brest lets his actors do their thing, it is the sort of film where the cast are just happy to be working and use their talent to the max. Be it improv or visually acting in the back ground, both men are at one and in some chemistry zone. The score from Danny Elfman is like some hybrid western wacky races fusion, but hell it works well. One of Elfman's best ever scores in fact. The dialogue is electric, some of the script is so sharp it should be put away in a sharps box and labelled up as to be opened whilst wearing gloves. The rest of the cast are uniformly brilliant, be it the wonderful John Ashton as rival bounty hunter Marvin, the menacing yet cheekily attired Dennis Farina as mob boss Jimmy Serrano, or Yaphet Kotto as the constantly irritated FBI agent Alonso Mosely, it's pretty much a flawless cast in optimum gear. The rating on the big movie sites, though high enough, is still a disgrace, I can only think that DeNiro fans really didn't want to see him doing a comedy? Well I say they are wrong! Because this film shows that the great man once had much to give the comedy/action splinter of film. Perhaps he just needed the perfect foil of Charles Grodin alongside him? Either way this film is smart, funny, even tender at times (I defy all to not be touched deeply during a daughter/father reunion).It has no peers for an 80s action/comedy, with bags of action (Brest shows some great skills at action construction) to keep the pulses raised, a group of characters beautifully brought to life by a top draw cast, and a finale that gladdens the heart because it closes exactly the way it should, Midnight Run, my bias not withstanding, is a benchmark movie for its ilk.Fistophobia for those that don't agree! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh yeah! THE film of the 80's. Together with HEAT, one of De Niro's best!Totally professional film-making. This is a comedy that succeeds on every level. The central characters of reluctant and burnt-out Bounty Hunter De Niro and Grodin as ex mafia accountant on-the-run "The Duke," just meld flawlessly. The script is wicked with ramped up profanities that somehow are absolutely integral to the unfolding plot. De Niro has just hours to get Grodin back to bail-bondsman Pantoliano while his ex-boss Dennis Farina (COULD anyone look more mafioso?) wants him back for reasons of extreme revenge....Perhaps on account of the fact that The Duke has put his funds to better use a la Robin Hood style of redistribution of wealth.This is really laugh-out-loud brilliant stuff.

		<fullReview>This is simply a masterpiece. There is a fantastic story line, there is just enough of the whole one dimensional character aspect to so many of the baddies here, but wonderful explorations of De Niro's and Grodin's characters. Truly, the film explores right and wrong and comes up on the side of the Angels. Angels with dirty faces maybe, but Angels nonetheless. No commentary on this film could be complete without remarking upon De Niro's incredible comic role. I haven't been moved by any of his comic turns since... indeed upon reflection, could it not be suggested that Raging Bull was in essence, high class comedy? Never mind... a piece of magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior buddy action/comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Martin Brest's Midnight Run (1988) takes the popular buddy cop formula (Beverly Hills Cop, 48 Hours, Red Heat, Lethal Weapon, Tango and Cash, Alien Nation, Turner &amp; Hooch, K-9 etc., etc.) and gives it a little spin, the film's unlikely pair of protagonists being Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro), a hard-bitten ex-cop turned bounty hunter, and ex-mob accountant Jonathan 'The Duke' Mardukas (Charles Grodin), who cheated his employers out of $15million.As Walsh escorts The Duke cross country from New York to Los Angeles, where bail bondsman Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) anxiously waits, he is relentlessly pursued by the mafia, the FBI and his arch rival, Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton), all of whom are keen to get their hands on his prisoner. During their journey?which involves planes, trains and automobiles (also the title of an '80s mismatched buddy comedy)?the pair form an unlikely friendship.Occasionally the movie pushes the boundaries of credibility (is it THAT easy to cancel someone else's credit card? Would a bar owner really be dumb enough to hand over his cash to two strangers?), but with excellent central performances (as one might expect from heavyweights such as De Niro and Grodin), great support from Pantoliano, Yaphet Kotto (as FBI agent Alonzo Mosely) and Dennis Farina as mob boss Jimmy Serrano), a wonderfully witty script with genuine heart, and just enough expertly executed mayhem (including a great car chase through the desert), Midnight Run proves to be one of the better buddy movies of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Comedies Ever Made. An Excellent,Hilarious,Action-Comedy Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Run is one of the greatest Comedies ever made,an excellent,hilarious Action-Comedy classic that combines wonderful direction,a terrific ensemble cast,non-stop laughs,an outstanding script,great Action and a memorable score. All of those elements make Midnight Run one of the best films of the 1980s and a fun,unforgettable movie.Midnight Run tells the story of Jack Walsh(Robert De Niro),a former Chicago Cop turned bounty hunter who after years of being a bounty hunter and chasing criminals wants to retire and open a coffee restaurant. But before he retires he has to track down and catch accountant and bail jumper Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas(Charles Grodin)who stole 15 million dollars from the mob and is wanted by the FBI and Jack is asked to bring him from New York to Los Angeles in five days on a Midnight Run for 100,000$. But Jack and Jonathan's trip isn't going to be easy with the FBI,the Mob and a rival bounty hunter on their trail which leads to laughs and fun.Midnight Run is a brilliant and hilarious Action-Comedy that is an instant classic the first time you watch it,a movie that gives viewers 126 minutes of perfection where everything from the wonderful performances,direction,script and score just works from beginning to end. Midnight Run also succeeds in mixing together different genres and elements such as Comedy,Action,road movie and buddy picture playing with the formula of each of the genres and giving the film an unpredictable edge making Midnight Run one of the most entertaining movies that you will ever watch and is a movie that is up there with Lethal Weapon(1987),48 Hrs(1982)and Beverly Hills Cop(1984)as an amazing Action-Comedy and Buddy movie and ranks as one of the best in the two genres. The Comedy and laughs in Midnight Run are hysterical and funny with every comedic scene coming at a quick and rapid fire pace that just keeps on going and never stops until the end the Humor feels natural with many scenes that are classic and well-done. The Comedy is also smart and fresh because there is a balance of going straight and over the top and the movie never loses a beat. The Comedy and laughs also works thanks to the ingenious screenplay by writer George Gallo which is truly flawless,amazing and in my opinion one of the best scripts in a Comedy. The dialog by Gallo is masterful,funny and just makes the characters come alive whether it's the hilarious back and forth banter between Jack and Jonathan or the dialog from the supporting characters throughout spitting out memorable one-liners and exchanges that are very quotable and iconic. The Action scenes in Midnight Run are great because there is gunfights,car chases and explosions that are simple but effective but is done with enough excitement to keep viewers thrilled. Midnight Run smartly balances Comedy and Action with wonderful ease. The main characters Jack Walsh and Jonathan Mardukas are one of the most entertaining and memorable duos in movie history and what makes the two so fun is that instead of one being the usual(in typical Buddy Comedy Movies)straight guy and one being the funny guy both characters are straight and serious which make the scenes and dialog between Jack and Jonathan gold and funny. Like any duo Jack and Jonathan in the beginning don't like each other but as the two continue along with their journey the two begin to like and understand each other despite Jack wanting to kill half the time. Jack and Jonathan are also three dimensional characters because there are some scenes with some dramatic weight and depth which makes Midnight Run rise above the typical Action-Comedy and makes viewers like the characters more. Jack Walsh and Jonathan Mardukas are characters you will love from the start and are characters you won't forget. The ending of Midnight Run is outstanding and truly brings the movie full circle for Jack and Jonathan and gives the movie it's greatness while putting a smile on viewers faces. A fantastic conclusion.The cast is outstanding. Robert De Niro is excellent and at his best as Jack Walsh,with De Niro being tough and funny at the same time. Charles Grodin is brilliant and hilarious as Jonathan Mardukas with Grodin bringing tons of laughs. De Niro and Grodin are dynamite together. Yaphat Kotto is terrific as Alonzo Mosley,an FBI Agent. John Ashton is wonderful as Marvin,a rival bounty hunter. Dennis Farina is outstanding as Jimmy Serano,a Las Vegas Gangster. Joe Pantoliano is delightful as Eddie Moscone,a bail bondsman. Richard Foronjy(Tony),Robert Miranda(Joey),Jack Kehoe(Jerry),Phillip Baker Hall(Sidney),Wendy Phillips(Gail),Danielle DuClos(Denise)and Thom McCleister(Red Wood)give good performances as well.The direction by Martin Brest is wonderful,with Brest always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a solid pace. Great direction,Brest.The score by Danny Elfman is amazing and memorable,with Elfman doing a score that is very bluesy with adventure and excitement that adds to the film. Terrific score,Elfman.In final word,if you love Robert De Niro,Comedies,Action-Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you see Midnight Run,an excellent and hilarious Action-Comedy classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why is this film not on the same level as a Classic,I came across this film by chance in the late 80's and it stayed with me ever since,from start to end you are glued to the screen and all actors do a supreme performance. I urge anyone who like a lot of action and a little comedy and moral story thrown in to get your can popcorn and watch this movie,as Grodin and De Nero are so far apart in their thinking and way of life you would have thought they would clash but it works fantastic. Yaphet Kotto as the FBI boss is excellent and John Aston as De Nero competition well keeps you on the edge of your seat. We had a lot of great hits in the 80's and we still see them on the film channels today but somehow this one as gone AWOL,it's a shame cause when people hear of De Nero they think Mafia Films,or meet the parents or when they think of Grodin they think of Beethoven when these actors have proved they have a lot more to offer the screen</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Run deserved five Oscars in 1989 by my count. Comedies that have people in stitches for two hours straight, however, are routinely deemed inferior to cutesy geriatric jokes and period meditations on race relations... not that Driving Miss Daisy (Best Picture) is a bad film, but Midnight Run has aged better. It could have won Best Director for Martin Brest, because the pace is so relentless and still leaves room for the non-spoken subtleties between actors, unquestionably THE most difficult thing for action-comedies to nail... but then Oliver Stone's work on Born On The Fourth of July was so earnestly grim and ticked almost every political box, so no surprises there. George Gallo's flawless threading of banter and emotion clearly deserved Best Original Screenplay, but Dead Poets Society made all the screenwriters go gooey for its non-stop reciting of stolen romantic lines, making me wonder how actually "original" a nominee needs to be. Charles Grodin's magnificent portrayal of Jonathan Mardukas remains one of the most under-rated supporting acts of all time, but Denzel Washington's chewing of the scenery in Glory was the most conspicuous likelihood for a recognition the Academy thought was overdue. Meanwhile Danny Elfman's masterpiece, a galloping avalanche of country blues which seamlessly drove the action through every state, never had a chance for Best Original Score because that award has become the kiddie's consolation prize over the years, The Little Mermaid winning the 1989 pat on the head for Most Cloyingly Twee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here come two words for you: Go Watch Midnight Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In many ways, Midnight Run is an over-sized parody of other 80's buddy flicks, because you've seen it all before.But Midnight Run embraces its clichés to the point of parody. There's a sleazy mob boss (Dennis Farina), a perpetually angry FBI investigator (Yaphet Kotto at his funniest), two eccentric bail bondsmen, and a real-life Horace-and-Jasper. Yet, even with all these exaggerated caricatures, our two main characters manage to find moments of surprising depth amid all the malarkey.Robert De Niro, in a unique turn, plays John Wesley "Jack" Walsh, a down- on-his-luck, smart-aleck bounty hunter. Charles Grodin is a mild-mannered embezzler, Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas, on the run for breaking bond. Promised $100,000 if he brings in Mardukas by midnight on Friday, Walsh quickly finds and apprehends him in New York. The Duke's aviophobia prevents the pair from traveling by plane to Los Angeles, so they take to the road. Of course, everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Besides a number of obstacles, they are pursued by another bounty hunter, the FBI, and the mob through a series of madcap adventures.The twist is that both Walsh and Mardukas are basically noble men (in the hard-bitten, Clint Eastwood Western sense) striving for exactly the same end. Mardukas, for instance, is a salt of the earth accountant who stole $15 million from a mobster to give to charity. Walsh, formerly a dedicated undercover cop, refused to be paid off by the same mobster, which cost him everything he held dear, and made him into the cynical jerk we all know and love.Very quickly the straitlaced Mardukas realizes that he can use his moral authority to bully the secretly conscientious Jack into giving way (incidentally, this technique doesn't work at all on Walsh's hard-hearted foil, Marvin - he's what Jack pretends to be). The Duke uses every chance he can to awaken Jack's dormant moral compass, from advising him to quit smoking ("Come on - cigarettes are killers!") to encouraging that he renew his relationship with his ex-wife and daughter ("Don't you want to be loved?"). All this, of course, drives the nervy bounty hunter crazy and results in dialogues by turns hilarious and heartfelt. In the end, they're still bickering, but like an old couple: "Shut up! I'm not talking to you for the whole rest of this trip!"The key to all this is that De Niro and Grodin are not trying to be funny. They don't have to. With a few exceptions - Grodin in one scene involving chickens - both of them are merely playing their characters straight, and it's hysterical. De Niro effortlessly shifts gears between cocky sarcasm, fury, insecurity, sensitivity, and vulnerability - sometimes all of them at once. It is his performance I enjoyed more the second time through.Grodin's doing his usual Curmudgeon Suffering Righteously act (this was the first film I'd seen him in - but I've been thoroughly enjoying his in- character Letterman interviews), and consequently has less depth than the many shades De Niro brings to Walsh, but that's not entirely his fault:Mardukas: "Why don't you get yourself a new watch?" Walsh: "I'll tell you when I know you better." Mardukas: "You know me better? When are you gonna to get to know me better? I'm getting to know you better. You're not gonna get to know me better." Walsh: "Will you SHUT UP?" Mardukas: "That's what I mean."Regardless, he's perfectly cast as the sulky, teddy-bear white-collar criminal.A few last comments: the pacing, script, direction, supporting cast, and wonderful, wonderful soundtrack are all great. It's immensely quotable. The movie is a bit long - Grodin and De Niro are separated for a while near the end of the movie and things begin to drag. But it's still one of the best of its kind - and never, ever boring.Review originally posted here: www.longview95.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie again twenty-five years after its initial release confirms that this is a great movie. This is the case because the movie is not dated. Although billed as a comedy, this movie is actually an action-adventure story revolving around the theme of friendship. The movie is endearing because it soon becomes apparent to the audience that the two men, Jack and the Duke, are bonding, even though the characters themselves don't know that. The whole story is about when they will realize that they are actually friends. Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are outstanding as Walsh and the Duke respectively. They make an excellent team. Walsh trying to act tough and the Duke trying to act like a fool are shams which underscore the essential vulnerability and humanity of both characters. Neither one wants to get hurt and so employ elaborate emotional defenses to protect themselves, with humorous results. How's a temperamental tough guy supposed to act with another guy who is passive aggressive?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing Martin Brest's Midnight Run, I think Robert De Niro has officially had too many "tour de force" performances to count. between Scorses's mob pictures, to his work in his immensely underrated directorial debut A Bronx Tale, Raging Bull, and now Midnight Run, the man consistently knows how to take his characters and make them not only fleshed-out and real but also infuse some exceptional character acting skills in there as well. With Midnight Run, he shows incredible leverage and energy as the main character, which is somewhat expected and equally unexpected given his age and his line of roles.De Niro is only assisted by the likes of people like Charles Grodin, writer George Gallo, and director Martin Brest, who stuff Midnight Run's screenplay with about as much action, comedy, and intensity you can ask for. This particular project is what I like to say is taking a simple concept and doing all that can be done with it. Midnight Run wisely doesn't overextend and exhaust itself, but it finds ways to expand on the pure senselessness of its idea in an artfully comedic way, not to mention give us a hilariously antagonistic relationships between two men forced to be together, bound by greed and wrongdoings.De Niro is Jack Walsh, one of those cops we can just look at and know how good he is at what he does. After being informed of a man named Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas (Charles Grodin), an accountant who embezzled more than $15 million from a Chicago mob boss and how, if captured, will be worth a $100,000 reward. Walsh sees opportunity to finally open a business, and winds up nabbing The Duke early in the film (but not before snagging an FBI's identity in order to obtain more private records). Upon capturing him, Walsh assumes the hardest part of the gig is already done and plans to fly him back to L.A.. But after learning that The Duke has an obnoxious and severe fear of flying, the two must find an alternate route to their destination.The event becomes akin to the Planes, Trains, and Automobiles of cop movies, with the two men who do not want to be in the company of each other trying to find a way back to their destination. The humor comes about with the adventures and pitfalls the reluctant duo encounter throughout the course of their trip. Remarkably, Gallo avoids structuring the film like a series of cheap, unfunny Saturday Night Live skits depicting the road trip from Hell. Instead, he makes sure to include character-relations and dialog in the film between Walsh and The Duke to allow the audience to connect to two individuals we really couldn't envision ourselves connecting with.And yet, the other part of this strong relationship is thanks to the natural charisma and charm of De Niro and Grodin, who also brilliantly hold the film together to create an exceptional package of wit and hilarity to these inherently funny situations. Both actors possess an incredible amount of energy here and perform stunts that men half their age would likely struggle with. Consider the scene when one man steals a biplane and the others struggle to hold on and get the other out of the biplane. Or even the scene where The Duke tries to ditch Walsh by hopping aboard a freight train. Both scenes, among others, require ample amounts of energy on hand and De Niro and Grodin always seem to have enough at their disposal.Then there's Brest, who has made a career out of directing action comedies for the most part. Brest likes to direct on something of a grandscale, emphasizing sizable action setpieces and using cityscapes (or, in this case, wide-open landscapes such as deserts) as his playground, more or less. His direction in Midnight Run is consistently clear and never muddled or choppy to the point where being able to decipher what is happening is something of a task. He films what he needs and makes it clear and accessible to the audience, which is one of the biggest challenges with action films.But action-comedies are a different story in the regard that the high-octane scenes need to earn the title of "action" and the humorous and witty scenes need to adhere to the principals of "comedy." Through fun characters and unpredictable chase sequences, Midnight Run is a gem of its genre, with widespread talent across the board and a wonderful, playful sense that never makes it never too serious nor too slapsticky. Somebody show it to Brest, explain that, and get him back to work asap.Starring: Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin. Directed by: Martin Brest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"80's Action Films Don't Get Much Better Than This"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi, welcome to my review on Midnight Run. One of the greatest action films released. To see where it stands in the top 10, check out my list called The 10 Best Action Films of All Time. Anyway let's delve into this review. Midnight Run is a funny, action packed, adventurous and entertaining film which features Robert De Niro at his prime. This film was made in 1988 and many other action films before it came close but not close enough. Lethal Weapon was made in 1987 and could compete with this but when it comes down to simple and typical 80's vibe, this one wins. Lethal Weapon on the other hand comes very close with its great rock music and a comical Mel Gibson playing the lead role of Martin Riggs. But, if I had to choose, I reckon Robert Di Niro is a better actor. Midnight Run features actors from many other action films in the time like Sgt. Taggart from Beverly Hills Cop. This film is a great sum up to what classical American action films should be as it nears the end of the decade known as crazy, the decade I grew up in. And finally ends my review on Midnight Run, a completely enjoyable film from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight Run" is one of those movies it is impossible not to like, in my opinion. Robert DeNiro shows, once again, why he is widely regarded as one of the greatest actors of his generation. A former Chicago police detective who has fallen foul of the authorities, he plays private investigator Jack Walsh who hires himself out to catch criminals. Charles Grodin plays a former mafia accountant Jonathan Mardukas who has embezzled 15,000,000 dollars from them &amp; gone to ground in New York. The mafia bosses have sent out hit-men to "take him out" before he is taken into custody. Walsh is being paid 100,000 dollars by a bail-bond agency to track him down &amp; transport him to Los Angeles. All manner of comical situations befall them en route, beginning at the airport where Mr. Mardukas feigns he has a phobia about flying. So, they have to board a bus out of the big apple which does not please Jack Walsh. The dialogue between them is just great with the captive constantly nagging Walsh about his bad habits. (Smoking &amp; eating junk food etc.) Walsh warns him that if he doesn't shut up he will soon be suffering from "fistophobia". Another great comic verbal exchange occurs travelling on board the train. Walsh tells his captive that when he "turns his arse in" &amp; collects his money he was thinking of retiring from his job &amp; opening up a coffee shop. Mardukas warns him as an accountant not to do so. "More than half of them go under in the first six months", he informs him. "Well, you're not my accountant!", retorts Walsh becoming more &amp; more irritated by his travelling companion. He dislikes him intensely at first but as the movie progresses warms to him, eventually ending up liking him in the end. Great, too, is John Ashton playing a rival private investigator hired because Walsh's paymaster thinks he is "fucking it up". Yaphet Kotto is also excellent as CIA agent Alonzo Mosely also involved in bringing Mr. Mardukas to justice. Mosely arranges a meeting between himself &amp; Walsh to try &amp; find out what he knows. Walsh tells him nothing much, of course, but steals the CIA agent's ID card leading to more comic moments. The scriptwriting in this movie is top-notch &amp; its overall "feel-good factor" is just wonderful. There is never a dull moment &amp;, eventually, it turns into one of the all-time great "buddy" movies. Charles Grodin has never been involved in a better movie than this &amp; it is also one of Robert DeNiro's best. As I said at the outset, what is not to love about this movie?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An altogether excellent film that certainly has to mark one of the high points in the entire "buddy-cop" action comedy genre, "Midnight Run" benefits from the able direction of Martin Brest ("Beverly Hills Cop"), great comedic timing by a superb cast, and a memorable relationship between our brilliantly mismatched leads.The swaggering Robert De Niro and the very dry Charles Grodin, playing ex-cop turned bounty hunter Jack Walsh and embezzling accountant Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas, embark on a cross country road trip when Jack becomes determined to bring bail jumper Jonathan back from NYC to LA in five days' time. Making things difficult for the two of them are henchman of mobster Jimmy Serrano (the late, great Dennis Farina), intent on murdering The Duke on behalf of their boss, and the FBI, led by agent Alonzo Moseley (Yaphet Kotto), who have been trying to bust Serrano. The whole story turns into a sorry ordeal for Jack and The Duke as they continuously have to change their method of transportation, "Planes, Trains &amp; Automobiles" style.Very funny and action packed, with great use of various US locations, this is nothing but fun from start to finish. George Gallos' script offers us some great insights into the characters in addition to supplying a whole lot of quotable dialogue. Farina as the cold blooded Serrano has some particularly delicious lines. The cast also includes John Ashton from BHC as a competing bounty hunter and perennial patsy, Joe Pantoliano in peak sleazy form as a bail bondsman , Richard Foronjy and Robert Miranda as two of Serrano's goons, Wendy Phillips as Jacks' ex-wife, Jack Kehoe as the shifty Jerry, and Philip Baker Hall as Serrano's lawyer. The music score is dynamite, and one of the best things that Danny Elfman has ever done. But holding it all together is the give and take between De Niro and Grodin; both excel in the delivery of their lines.By the time this is over, you'll hopefully really come to like Jack and The Duke. One may delight in their misadventures, but still have a good time hoping that things will eventually work themselves out.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Martin Brest is not one to rush into things. Even though he made the hugely successful Beverly Hills Cop, he waited four years to deliver a follow up. He did manage to get Robert De Niro to do comedy, which nowadays does not mean much but back in the 1980s, De Niro doing comedy was news.This is a comedy action drama with two mismatched people on the road and train trying to evade bad guys. Its Charles Grodin that delivers the laughs, a man who finds light comedy as natural as some people find breathing. He and De Niro bounce off each other. Joe Pantoliano provides another scene stealing performance as the Bail Bond boss. In fact Brest is a director who gets the best out of his cast here and shows a knack in combining action and humour.As in Beverley Hills Cop, the bad guys are ruthlessly villainous but show a bit more charm here.It is a near perfect film and with a title theme tune that is simply sublime with its blaring horn. How it managed to perform so poorly at the box office is a puzzle.The critics raved about this film, it found a willing audience on VHS, many of them who after the film finished, rewound it and watched it again. There were anecdotes that some people laughed so hard whilst watching this film that they were nearly hospitalised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best eighties movie of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, there's really only a handful of great eighties films, but for the most part, this was a time of crisis in cinema history, in which films competed to be as objectionable as possible, with tough guy stars, little dialogue, explosions, gore and no morality whatsoever. This, on the other hand, is a brilliant film. Robert DeNiro showed us all what an excellent actor he was with Taxi Driver, but arguably, this is his best ever part. He shows us his human side, his pricelessly funny reactions to Grodin's increasingly bizarre observations. We also get a brilliant sense of rapport developing between our two leads, both superb actors, with a brilliantly witty script. We start the film thinking DeNiro's a cynic, just out for money, a home life in ruins and a lack of regard for his fellow humans. But as the film progresses, we begin to cut through the layers, and are presented with a truly outstanding portrait of this man, and what motivates him. It's just so expertly handled, and the character drama is perfectly blended into the imaginative chase sequences, none of which seem pappy or mindless. We're also treated to some truly inspired characters in the supporting cast, courtesy of Yaphet Koto, and John Ashton's brilliantly stupid Marvin Dorfler ("I'm always thinking!") It's a perfect film in so many ways; brilliant script, acting, direction...It's also a hard film to classify, as it transcend genres to give us comedy, action, drama and crime thriller all at once. And with perhaps, the most perfect ending ever...it just gets me every time. A hugely entertaining movie, although I wouldn't recommend it if you're conservative in terms of profanity, because there's at least one swear a minute. But still, this is, without a doubt, the most human, enjoyable and beautifully written film of the eighties.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) is an ex cop from Chicago department, now excellent bounty hunter he's got to get Jonathan 'The Duke' Mardukas (Charles Grodin) an accountant , who stole a huge quantity of money from the Mafia, and transport him safely from New York to Los Angeles. He doesn't have a lot of time and Jack has to watch his back from Mr Mosely (Japhet Kotto) FBI agent and the gangsters of Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina) who all want to catch 'The Duke' for different reasons. It seems easy for an expert - Walsh but Mardukas will make sure that the trip is not easy yet hilarious. However, the hunter and his 'prey' Jonathan will find the time to get to know each other and even form a kind unexpected friendship. Both performances by De Niro and Grodin make this movie quite interesting and very funny, even though you can predict how it ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight Run" is the kind of buddy road movie that feels like it's part of an '80s brand, akin to "Planes, Trains and Automobiles". It's got heart, chemistry, great comedy and a well-written and heartfelt script. The relationship between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin is usually contentious but definitely real; there's a genuine camaraderie between the two actors, and they're fine performances. Grodin gets much of the straight-man humor (for which he as a real knack); Yaphet Kotto, too, but Grodin's scene in the corner bar is a real highlight of the movie - kinda like Eddie Murphy's redneck bar scene in "48 Hrs." And the supporting cast is damn well put together. Just an array of great characters (Kotto, Pantoliano, Farino, Ashton, the two mob lackeys). Fantastic movie.8/10Also, I still find it hard to believe Danny Elfman scored this flick. It's about as unElfman-like as it gets. Dude's got chops.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About half-way through the movie, we know why bounty hunter Jack (Robert DeNiro) has an ulcer. It's because his prisoner The Duke (Charles Grodin) is nagging him to death. Street smart Jack has never hooked up with the likes of fussy yuppie The Duke, played to annoying perfection by the dead-pan Grodin. It's like watching a married couple bicker the whole time they're escaping one hair-raising scrape after another.The chemistry here is simply superb. Never mind that half of DeNiro's lines consist of the f- word; his expressions are priceless as he tries to cope with Grodin's whiney needling. Of course, events end up as a kind of masculine love story as these two social opposites evolve into an affectionate respect that amounts to an antic version of the odd couple. That's the movie's solid core.Of course there's all the Keystone Cops shenanigans as the FBI, the mob, and the hapless Marvin try to cut in on the action with generally hilarious results. The script manages to juggle the big cast in inventive fashion with lots of great one-liners and cliff-hanger set-ups. But you may need a score card to keep up with all the characters and action. My one reservation-- the Arizona car chase is like putting sugar on chocolate and goes on a shade too long. Nonetheless, I doubt that any cross-country adventure has produced more laughs or excitement than this 1988 sleeper that will keep you glued to the screen.</fullReview>

'Ten green bottles', 'You lied to me first', 'So why are you unpopular with the Chicago Police Department?', 'These go down, they do down!!','I can't fly!', 'Fistafobia', 'Who are you guys?'.

I never expected to like it when i first saw it, yet it remains a favourite almost 20 years later. While Charles GRodin has always been known for his comedic roles, it was Robert Deniro who surprised me with how genuinely funny he was (which he proved again with Billy Crystal more recently). I highly recommend this movie who wants to take a couple of hours and really laugh themselves silly! Great ending, as well! The script plays on the differences of the two leads as well as the similarities which become more obvious as the story unfolds. Also, great car chases and i am not a car chase person, so, enjoy!</fullReview>

It would of been interesting to see them paired in another type of movie.There's many good scenes, but my favorite is the one in Reds Bar. Charles Grodin steals the show in that scene at his deadpan best.

		<fullReview>Jack Walsh(De Niro) is an ex-cop turned bounty-hunter because a big Mafia-boss, Jimmy Serrano(Dennis Farina) from Chicago gave him the choice to work for him or leave town, as his corrupt police colleagues mysteriously found heroin in his house during his undercover operation with the Mafia. He now works with Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) who is a bigger crook than the people jumping bail he chases after. Marvin Dorfler(John Ashton) is a fellow bounty-hunter and rival. When a Chicago Mafia-accountant, called the Duke(Charles Grodin) jumps bail the two bounty-hunters are sent by Moscone on his tracks. The FBI also steps in, as Agent Alonso Mosely(Yaphet Kotto) and Jack Walsh begin a cat and mouse game to retrieve the Duke.Jimmy Serrano also steps in, sending his hit-men to prevent the Duke from testifying, as Walsh is determined to bring the Duke to L.A., to cash in and leave this "miserable business" for good. But the Duke has other plans.A wild cross-country race, an excellent comedy, with a solid story and fantastic cast.De Niro's best comic effort to date.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give it a 10 for emotional reasons, although it should be a 9 because of the rather uninspired cinematography and the overexposed score. I've seen it at least 30 times, I've worn out two VHS-recordings of it before I got in on DVD, and I enjoy it every time - which is after all a true measure of how good a film can be!The plot is nicely explained elsewhere in the other comments. What makes this so good is that almost every element of film-making is excellent - script, direction, rhythm, cast, characterization, dialog, chemistry between actors, credibility, attention to detail - everything clicks 100%, which is very unusual in any kind of film! Everybody in the supporting cast down to the smallest parts does an excellent job - I have never seen Yaphet Kotto, Dennis Farina, John Ashton, or even Joe Pantoliano this good! There are lots of humor, melancholy, action and suspense - and all that is achieved with no special effects, no sex, and very little violence!In my opinion this movie should be used in film schools as a case study of how a mixture of good parts knit together by strong direction and skillful production effort, results in a great film, and also how to make a good script with a story that is driven by a nice combination of events as well as characters!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my all time favourite films. An action/comedy masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the the late 1980's early 9o's there have been many action buddy comedies 'Beverly hills cop', 'Bad Boys' and 'Bulletproof'and they have all been great. But if i had to say none of them can compare to such a masterpiece as Midnight Run. The film is full of tense and exciting moments of action and humour from both De Niro and Grodin who in this film I think are both at the top of their game. Their chemistry in playing hard ass bounty hunter and sensitive criminal is fantastic. It is such a shame there was no talk of a sequel in mind, especially since it is such an original and cool story and we were gagging to see De Niro return as Jack Walsh again. The film also gives us an impressing supporting cast with Dennis Farina (Snatch, Get Shorty) as an angry mobster and Yaphet Kotto (Alien)as an angry cop on the trail for them both.An easy 10/10. Brilliant piece of movie making.</fullReview>

His character seems mostly straight, but in a comic situation; and rather than being overblown and difficult to believe, it all seems to work out right.As a film, it has just about everything you might want - it's touching in places, but mostly it's just entertaining, funny, well paced and involving enough that you really care about what happens to the characters.Quite simply, I love this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro's comedic masterpiece. Grodin not bad either.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very few can be both dramatic and comic actors with the same degree of excellence. Robin Williams has tried it but to put it mildly he isn't really that great a comedic actor to begin with. His dramatic performances seem much better and his one film with De Niro, Awakenings, is miles better than such crap as Mrs. Doubtfire, Fathers' Day etc. It may be odd to start at commentary about Midnight Run this way but I'm trying to illustrate that what De Niro does here is all the more harder than it seems. He isn't mugging or going for the easy laugh like he has done in later films like Rocky and Bullwinkle but the tongue-in-cheek humor is fully on display in his performance here. I will not go into plot because everybody pretty much know the story.Charles Grodin is primarily a comedic actor, save for his performance in Rosemary's Baby, but his humor is deadpan not slapstick and I think that is the reason why he works so well with De Niro here. Usually, when De Niro works with comedians, they try to outshine him and go way over the top (eg. Eddie Murphy). Grodin's dry comments are hilarious because he doesn't try to stun the audience with his wit and the way he gets a rise out of the De Niro character, Jack Walsh, is pure gold. Too bad they never made a proper sequel which Grodin has frequently pointed out on his talk show.The movie would have received 10 out of 10 from me except for one thing. They should have left out the visit to Jack's ex-wife and daughter. It's a rather pointless subplot which doesn't tie up any loose ends like the Grodin character thinks it will. Maybe that was the point but I have a tough time seeing anything more sympathetic or worse to De Niro's character at the end of the visit. It had already been established before that he has a sore spot in his past and it doesn't ring true to leave the spot sore. Maybe i am completely wrong. The end is kind of in the same tone where Grodin finally lets his guard down. It's a rather touching scene and the final joke is a lighthearted chuckle. Grodin hasn't made a good movie since and De Niro only a few so I hope that someday Hollywood wil give this movie it's proper acknowledgement as the first class comedy that it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot has been outlined in many other reviews, already, so I will not go into it here. The main thing that works with this movie, as noticed by other reviewers, is the relationship between Robert De Niro's and Charles Grodin's characters.Whatever, the situation, Charles Grodin manages to make a comment or ask a question that is virtually guaranteed to bring some profanity in De Niro's response. Yet, De Niro's response is like a bark without a bite - we know that he cannot hit Grodin, in the same way that he hits the other bounty hunter, Marvin.All the other characters make their mark and have their own character: Yaphet Kotto as the FBI agent after De Niro, Denis Farina as the mob boss out for revenge - after both of them, and the bailbonds man Joe Pantoliano.I still laugh out loud at Grodin's deadpan face whenever he drives De Niro completely bananas, with his simple questions and remarks. I actually have not bought this film on VHS or DVD, but I will when I see it, as I never seem to get bored of it.Simply the best!</fullReview>

De Niro and Grodin spark off each other's superb comic timing and the potentially lethal personal differences they have ensure the whole film buzzes along through the pairs highs and lows. Not that the two leads grab all the limelight. The co-stars all turn in memorable performances from Marvin - De Niros single-minded but dumb fellow bounty hunter, to the menacing Jimmy Serrano and his two dumb gangster goons and not forgetting the intensely irritated Special Agent Moseley (please do not watch the cut for TV version - never have I seen a worse hatchet job that manages to wreck just about every one liner in the film).

		<fullReview>This is a great film and one of the best ever made. Midnight Run has it all, one of my fav scenes is when Deniro met his daughter after ten years and she is now in grade 8. It was played with the right kind of awkwardness by Deniro..a great actor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I highly recommend this movie. Like always, Robert De Niro turns in a great performance and as does the rest of the cast. I was extremely impressed by the script and the acting. Not many films can be successful action flicks and comedies at the same time, but this film accomplishes that feat. Anyway, the bottom line is that if you are ever wondering what movie to rent and looking for an action/comedy, check out Midnight Run.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very funny movie; the story flows so easily throughout two hours and you never get bored, not at all! I was very glad to notice that Bobby de Niro, my all time favourite actor, really seems to have fun, unlike the most movies that he has made where he sometimes spends such a long time to be ready and become the guy he has to play. In this movie he really seems to enjoy himself playing Jack Walsh. Charles Grodin is very good too; his part was originally proposed to Robert Redford and Robin Williams was interested in the project too, but I think this movie is very good the way it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favourite films of all time. Top story, cast, script, action and some very funny dialogue. De Niro as bounty hunter(and former cop). Bringing in white collar criminal(and nice guy)Charles Grodin across America dodging The FBI, the mob and a rival bounty hunter on planes trains and automobiles type trek. DeNiro is great as usual(we even get to see him laugh!), infact great performances all round especially John Ashton who does a superlative job characterising Marvin, the other bounty hunter. This role in lesser hands could easily of been turned into a caricature like in the film's 3 made for TV sequels. This film in parts will make you laugh out loud especially the word play between DeNiro and grodin and DeNiro and Joe Pantoliano(who plays the bailsman) Fantastic score by Danny Elfman serves the film well. Atmosphere throughout the film builds higher and higher especially between the 2 leads. Go and see it TODAY</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is perfectly put together, each character from Eddie to the Las Vegas crew are absolutely right. The dialogue between Jack Walsh and The Duke is priceless as is their timing and delivery throughout the film.The director resisted the usual Hollywood plot line of having the "Love angle" going through the script and instead included a heart-rending scene between Jack Walsh, his ex wife and daughter. AND instead of the drivel that these scenes usually contain we have Walsh (perfectly acted,) standing in front of his daughter not knowing what to say.If you have not viewed this movie - get it. If you have not viewed it recently - get it again. It is a rare treat, unmatched since and probably one of De Nero`s finest performances matched only by Grodin who is perfect as the accountant who knows just how to wind up Walsh. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any time someone asks me for a comedy recommendation - I blurt "MIDNIGHT RUN " without hesitation. Well, that's not totally true. If the requester is elderly or young or cringes at profanity I sometimes substitute "Raising Arizona" or "Princess Bride" but that's really beside the point as "Midnight Run" is my true pick. This is the type of film you'll quote and watch again and will make you laugh aloud just by thinking about it. I mentioned profanity - truckloads of it - but it's better to watch it after the kiddies are tucked in bed than to view an edited version. We've caught a couple of "edited for content" network showings, and it is my advice to turn the channel, especially if it would be your first time to see it. As weird as it sounds, the dialogue works because it's so profane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful fusion of a 1980s buddy picture and a wacky Odd Couple-style comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bounty hunter (Robert De Niro) captures a bail-hopping swindler (Charles Grodin) in New York; hand cuffed together they cross America to Los Angeles, chased by gangsters and lawmen.Midnight Run is a first rate amalgam of three distinct genres: road film, action thriller and comedy. It's terrifically enjoyable on all fronts, with De Niro and Grodin an outstanding, genuinely funny 'odd couple.' The film was later followed by three made-for-TV films produced in 1994, which did not feature any of the principal actors, although a few characters are carried over from the first film. The sequels also had a much lighter tone than the original film, and did not seem to directly follow the canon established in the first film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beverly Hills Cop with a white dude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least outside of the US, this seems to be a mostly forgotten movie. I watched it out of curiosity, but expected pretty much a lame, dysfunctional flick. I saw it for the same reason that you'd eat a shrimp cocktail which you'd forgotten in the back of the fridge and which doesn't look too salubrious, sort of slimy and greenish -- but could you throw it away? Nah ...Mostly, this attitude will bring you death by salmonella. Once in a while that attitude will hook you up with a gem of a movie. Such as Midnight Run. This is a great buddy comedy about a bounty hunter (De Niro) who is given the job to bring in a fugitive from New York to Los Angeles. Unsurprisingly, the job doesn't turn out to be the promised "midnight run" (i. e. a dead simple assignment), but instead it's sort of the Iliad with the FBI and the mob in hot pursuit.This was directed by the same guy who did the original Beverly Hills Cop movie, Martin Brest, and it might be even the better, subtler film of the two. Brest has had a tumultous career so far, directing masterpieces such as BHC and MR alongside clonkers such as Gigli (or Meet Joe Black and Scent Of A Woman -- although I have to admit that I haven't actually seen any of those three movies). I sure hope he pulls another one like Midnight Run someday.Although this sure isn't the first road-buddy-movie to come out of Hollywood, and uses every road-buddy-movie cliché in the book of road-buddy-movies, it stands out. The acting is amazing, from the headlining De Niro and his sidekick Charles Grodin (who pulls off an amazing job) right down to the B-parts (I especially enjoyed the hysteric bail agent Eddie "Jack!!!! Where the hell are ya?!?" Moscone, but they're all great). There are many masterly aspects to this movie. For example, the mafia hit men playing pranks on each other like schoolboys. Or how the FBI agent's Alonzo Mosely's hefty sun glasses are repeatedly used as a comedic prop. Or check out how the repeated line "See you in the next life!" between the leading couple changes meaning: at first it means "I don't care about you"; then, after Mardukas has revealed to Walsh that he will likely get killed in jail for betraying the mob, Walsh uses this line to tell Mardukas "Too bad for you, I'll still bring you in no matter what." At the end of the movie, the very same line delineates their hope for a second chance at a peaceful, civilian existence.Really, a comedic masterpiece. Kudos.</fullReview>

The supporting cast is hilarious, including Ashton as a dim-witted bounty hunter, Kotto as an FBI agent, Pantoliano as a sleazy bail bondsman, and Farina as a foul-mouthed mobster. The script masterfully juggles the subplots and the dialog is memorable - when told he doesn't look like a criminal, "White collar," Grodin says helpfully. Brest's direction is excellent, as he not only maintains a perfect pace, but also finds humor in subtle gestures while delivering some moments of poignancy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Run (1988) **** (out of 4)Bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert DeNiro) tracks down a crooked accountant (Charles Grodin) and soon the two are being chased by the FBI as well as a Mafia boss (Dennis Farina) and his hit men. There have been countless road/buddy movies since the dawn of cinema and it seems like the 80's gave us all sorts of these and this one here is certainly among the best as it delivers a great number of laughs as well as some great action. The screenplay offers up a lot of wonderful dialogue and situations even though the film does go on a tad bit too long. What really keeps the film working so well are the incredibly performances not only by the two leads but also by the wonderful supporting cast. DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career and it remains proof that he could deliver plenty of laughs. His stern, smartass character is one he perfectly nails and there's never a false moment to anything he does. DeNiro is wonderfully plays the laughs at the right note and really knows how to mix his style with that of Grodin's. Speaking of Grodin, to me this is the best thing he's ever done in his career and it's that laid back nature of his that really sells his relationship with DeNiro. Taphet Kotto is marvelous as the FBI agent as is John Ashton as DeNiro's rival bounty hunter. Kotto, Ashton, Farina and Joe Pantoliano really mix it up well with DeNiro and this here leads to countless laughs. I think a lot of credit needs to go to the screenplay for allowing us to get to know the characters. A lot of these buddy movies just featured single note characters but that's certainly not the case here because by the end of the film you seem to really know and understand DeNiro and Grodin's characters. The movie even has some nice tension at the end when the bounty hunter and the mob are meeting up to exchange things in a Las Vegas airport. This here is certainly a busy genre but they don't get much better than this. With the caliber of acting and the tight direction this is certainly a highly recommended film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost too much fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favourite screenplays of the 1980s; this captures and fulfills all it's common genres to the fullest extent. Robert DeNiro is simply at his most badass, slipping in lines for full effect. Basically; this is loosely a 'buddy' picture, reminiscent of The Blues Brothers in which everyone is being chased by everyone. Which is one of the crowning achievements and something I was surprised by in the film; every character is developed, even the very supporting one, and if not developed they had clear personalities which is detectable for the audience. It has a very important theme of morality, which is often rare in a film like this; the 'criminal' (Grodin) that De Niro's character has to arrest (for money - he's like a bounty hunter rather than a cop, though he used to be one) does not act as an antagonist but rather a co-lead. In this pairing, they can't resist asking awkward questions for each other (De Niro being more prejudice and Grodin trying to seek out why he does these actions), in which we find out (or judge for ourselves) who is the better person. Grodin's character stole ?15 million... and gave it to charity. But with the apparent justice system that breaking a law is still breaking the law he is taken into custody. My single favourite aspect was Danny Elfman's score, which was a complete and utter consistent delight, embodying the era and turning an apparently dark film quite light hearted creating a perfect mood. I wish it had a more interesting direction and better editing.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See you in L.A. folks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After starring in loads and loads of serious movies in a row, Robert Deniro needed to do something light and felt that Midnight Run was just what he was looking for. Originally a Paramount project, the suits wanted to team him up with Cher for some sex appeal (oh, dear GOD no!) but director Martin Brest (teehee) vehemently opposed this idea and the project ended up at Universal.The role of Jonathan Mardukas ended up going to deadpan Charles Grodin (though a young Bruce Willis auditioned) since Martin Brest (teehee) felt that he had the best chemistry with Deniro. I'm glad he didn't make that compromise. Can you honestly imagine Midnight Run with Cher??? Deniro is Jack Walsh a tough, ex-cop bounty hunter who is offered $50, 000 by a shady bail-bondsman to capture crooked accountant Jonathan 'The Duke' Mardukas and escort him from NY to LA for a court appearance. The Duke embezzled millions of dollars from crime boss Jimmy Serrano (the always great Dennis Farina) and gave it all to charity so it's not just California justice who wants to get their hands on him. The FBI also want The Duke for their own purposes and The Duke is a clever and cunning enough to chuck as many spanners in the works as possible. So it's not just a simple matter of hopping on a plane...or an easy Midnight Run.With Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton) another sleazy bounty hunter after them too and loads of double crosses Midnight Run becomes a sort of action/comedy Planes, Trains and Automobiles character drama with enough F-words to give TV censors a nervous breakdown. Back in the stinkin' early 90s the stinkin' BBC dubbed out every stinkin' swear word with the most hilariously awful stinkin' choices. Why? Honestly, this kind of thing makes me wonder what the hell is going on the minds of these censors. Do they honestly think that they're making the world a better place by not exposing full-grown adults to an ancient Anglo-Saxon word for making love? But that's a separate rant altogether.Those familiar with Brest's (teehee) previous mega-hit Beverly Hills Cop will find a lot of Midnight Run's pacing and cinematography familiar. He is the kind of director that only makes a movie every five years or so but I have a feeling that Gigli has ended his career for good. Don't let that tarnish your feelings toward this film though. Even if Midnight Run didn't have a clever and funny script the chemistry between Deniro and Grodin is worth it alone. We've seen odd-couple buddy/buddy types before but they do it with class.Although it's nearing 20 years old, Midnight Run seems timeless in way (despite the very liberal 80s attitude towards smoking), mostly because it knows it's nothing but pure entertainment that, for once, isn't dumbed down for the lowest common denominator. These days we get crap like Epic Movie and Talladega Nights. Where did the R-rated comedies go? What grim times we live in.Not sure about Danny Elfman's score though. Totally the wrong choice of composer, my only complaint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably one of the best movies of its type of the 80s. But more than that, I believe it to be the best casting job of any movie I have seen. Everyone from the accountant (Charles Grodin), the bounty hunters, the bail bondsmen, the FBI agents, the family members, and the gangsters - is perfectly cast. The methods and tricks of the trade employed by the bounty hunters, and the bail bondsmen along with the subplots and various agendas make it a film that keeps the viewers hooked throughout. Any non-action scenes artfully talk about what makes the characters tick. I do not know why it is not in the top 250 - it should definitely have surpassed some other 80s action films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) is a bounty hunter charged with transporting a renowned white collar criminal Jonathan Marducas (Charles Grodin) across America to Los Angeles for a one hundred thousand dollar payday.He has five days to make the handover and collect his cash. Jack finds and apprehends Mardukas in mere hours after taking the job.An express flight from the East to the West coast of America is 6 hours, and five days is 120 hours. Piece of p*ss right? Wrong. Mardukas claims to be petrified of flying, but that is but a minor hitch once you realise that the FBI want the Duke ? as Marducas was known in mob circles ? for themselves, the mob don't want him in custody blabbing about their affairs and a rival bounty hunter Dorffler (John Ashton) also hired to bring in the Duke conspire to meddle with what should have been a smooth trip.So Jack has three very interested parties that would love some private time with the man he is hoping to be well paid ? enough to retire ? to escort across country. Some want the Duke dead, others want him in prison, and still others just want him for their own financial gain. Now the Duke wasn't the man handling the extortion, execution or shakedowns, he merely did their books. Jack knows this, he was an ex-cop who was involved in the original case himself.The Duke is also a nice guy and loves a conversation. Too nice and too in love with conversation as it turns out; he won't shut up. He is genuinely interested in Jack to the point of harassment. Jack isn't such a bad guy, but he is not such a nice guy, especially after gunfights, car chases and every unexpected dead end, stopover and detour possible. As the Duke observes at one point Jack has "two forms of expression; silence and rage".It is this testy relationship that drives the film, while it might not sound amusing to have one character doggedly asking the same questions again and again only to be repeatedly told to 'shut the f*ck up' it actually is pretty funny. The action is generally not too flashy aside from a car chase that builds to almost Blues Brothers' proportions for a moment and the body count and blood levels are kept quite low.Midnight Run probably shouldn't compare favourably to many other violent road movies but holds up due to the dynamic between the two leads, Grodin and De Niro being better actors than any cast in such a film before or since (I'm talking obviously about the 80s and 90s De Niro ? not The 'Fockers' time waster). The supporting cast too is excellent, Yaphet Kotto as the FBI agent always a step behind Jack, Denis Farina as the abrupt and profane mob boss and even Phillip Baker Hall as his reserved consul Sydney all shine.Final Rating ? 7 / 10. There is nothing particularly new or revolutionary about Midnight Run, especially nearly 25 on, but it is entertaining and interesting throughout, and highlights two of the better actors of the previous generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's better than you might think. At heart it's a mismatched buddy comedy but it has some amusing moments.Robert De Niro is a bounty hunter who has just discovered his employer is trying to cheat him. De Niro, apprehended by the FBI for some minor infraction himself, is surrounded by agents in a large office. The FBI in the person of Yaphet Koto tries to deny him a phone call but De Niro smiles sweetly and explains the rules. As he picks up the phone, he asks politely, "A little privacy, please?" This is where the suspect is supposed to call his lawyer. Instead, De Niro dials his cheating boss and launches into a tirade of truly foul curses at a decibel level that causes the furniture to shiver. The dozens of agents turn and gape at him.Charles Grodin is a fussy former mob accountant who has stolen millions from the Mafia and given most of it to charity. De Niro collars him in New York and, as is usual in the genre, they require changes of transportation that take them through garish cities and exotic Indian villages. They are pursued by (1) a rival bounty hunter, (2) the FBI, and (3) the Mob.There are myriad narrow escapes, lots of exciting action scenes, high speed pursuits, explosions, socks on the jaw, flying bullets, and scenes in which the two fugitives gradually get to know one another. Fortunately, there's little sentimentality. Nothing is more irritating than having your heart warmed.The laughs are sometimes keenly structured and it helps that the performances are as good as they are. The conversations between De Niro and his boss, Joe Pantoliano, are exquisite symphonies of barbarous profanity. If you don't demand too much, you'll probably enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Midnight Run" shows us that a movie can be a edge-of-your-seat action, yet be a comedy with all its witty moments. It's a pure joy watching this classic from the 20th century, in which the director Martin Brest managed to get the best out of Rober De Niro in his role of a bounty hunter (this reminds me of "Killing Season").This movie is reminiscent of another classic staring Dastardly and Muttley (we all know this one), who are putting all their efforts and recourses just to catch one pigeon. The situation here is quite the same with the little difference that Dastardly is the FBI,Muttley is the Mafia and the pigeon are Robert De Niro as the ex-cop bounty hunter (Jack Walsh) and his hostage, the accountant who stole 15M $ from The Mafia - Charles Grodin (Jonathan Mardukas). One of the good things about Jack kidnapping Jonathan is that during the course of the movie, the ex-cop's past begins to unfold before our eyes, just because of his inquisitive hostage's questions."Midnight Run" is a really good movie, which I strongly recommend to people, who are action film lovers, yet they want to experience high quality of directing and acting. This is the film for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best buddy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Combination of buddy, Jack and Johnathan makes this film nice, funny and heartwarming. Two men have contrast character. Jack is a vulgar, a cynic, and alone. Johnathan is gentle, mild, philanthropist, clever. They cover disadvantage each other. It helps their escape. This film seems as comedy, but it tell us what the justice, what is the friendship is. As the story going, we realize that two men are very similar basically. Jack refuses the embezzlement so he betrayed. Johansson commit crime for the philanthropy. Both of them fight for the justice. Theirs friend ship betrayed the villain, Serrano. Also I like this movie because Jack can get the money. Firstly, he lost everything foe Justice, but now he can get the money for his dream, running the coffee shop.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yet another movie I know by heart but haven't seen in ages. And it was just as great as I remembered.Brilliant movie. Brilliant writing, brilliant acting by the ENTIRE cast (from the lead parts to the tiniest support roles), great direction, great score by Danny Elfman, cinematography and great locations. It's extremely funny, it's moving just when needed and it's full of action. Every scene is great and there's no dull moment. Excellent fun without insulting the audience and without damn green screens. Why don't they make movies like that anymore? I fu**ing miss the 80's.The scene with the daughter was always moving, but not nearly as much as it was for me this time. I must be getting old.If you're not familiar with Elfman's other work with the Oingo Boingo, you should check the song "Try to Believe", which is the end credits of the movie but with lyrics.One last thing. For some reason, during two scenes in the movie I was reminded of Michael Keaton. I don't recall the first one, but in the second one (when he shows the goons the Polaroid) I thought the part of Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton) would have been perfect for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Run is one of the few Action/Comedy/Crime films that really balances each genre extremely well. Comedy is probably my least favorite genre (I know that's crazy), but I find that comedies often try to be something they're not. Or they try way too hard to make people laugh. Midnight Run on the other hand, really hits hard with the subtle comedy and the long running gags that it has to offer, while also being a mix of an adventure/crime thriller/action/and even an emotionally resonating film. It's quite simply, one of the all-time greats.It tells the story of Jack Walsh, De Niro, a washed up bounty hunter and ex-Chicago cop who is tasked with the job of bringing back a wanted accountant from New York to L.A. What ensues is a highly entertaining Lethal Weapon meets Plains, Trains, and Automobiles. It has the wit and action like Lethal, and the heart/bro-mance of PTA. Grodin, who plays Mardukas, the wanted accountant, and De Niro both have a lot of fun as the two leads. The initial hate towards each other was just as cool to see as the bittersweet ending to their relationship. Walsh begins as a cocky and ignorant cop who feels sorry for himself, and a part of me felt bad for him too. But it's the relationship with Mardukas that opens his mind to turning the page on what was and what could be for Walsh's career if he turns him in or not. There is a lot of pain hidden underneath Walsh's badge and gun. He hasn't seen his ex-wife and daughter in 9 years, and he has a lot of regrets back from his time in Chicago. He just wants to get his money and move on from this 'Midnight Run', but it's this job that possibly changes his mind on everything.Now of course this film has a lot of moving parts and a ton of characters who seem to appear out of nowhere many times. You have to suspend your disbelief in order to have fun with Midnight Run. For some people, that's a problem, and I can understand that. But it gets ridiculous enough to where you just kind of shrug your shoulders and move on. The entire cast has a ton of fun bringing these characters to life including Joe Pantoliano who particularly sticks out as Walsh's boss back in L.A. But Yaphet Kotto and Dennis Farina also give great performances as FBI agent Mosley and mob boss Jimmy Serano respectively. The movie is also beautifully complimented by the upbeat and jazzy score by Danny Elfman. So in all, Midnight Run is a really enjoyable 80's action comedy that is endlessly re-watchable.+De Niro &amp; Grodin+Elfman's score+Emotional underneath the laughs9.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Chemistry Between The Actors Is What Makes This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, Charles Grodin pulls this whole film together. Grodin's very dry delivery of his lines is perfect and offsets De Niro's emotional delivery. De Niro is famous for improvising his lines, but I never knew Grodin had such a talent. The chemistry is not limited to those two. Throwing Ashton's grumpy sarcasm into the mix with Kotto's externally cool/internally tormented character into the mix creates a perfectly comical interaction between characters with extremely contrasting personalities, right down to the goons. Standing out among every actor and his character, however is Dennis Farina's, Jimmy Serrano. Although his character had a relatively small amount of screen time, he stood out and had you wanting to see more of him. With his cool and confident demeanor, he delivered some of the funniest lines in the film. There's no way to know how this movie would have turned out with different actors, but it's difficult to imagine a better cast. I am surprised that this film received no Academy Award's nominations and even more surprised at its reception at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bounty hunter Jack Walsh is sent to find and return bail jumper and former Mafia accountant, Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas. The FBI have had no success in locating The Duke, so when Jack finds him in next to no time, they are a little embarrassed, and terribly vexed. In order to collect his $100,000 fee, Jack must take The Duke from New York to Los Angeles. However, the Mafia and the FBI have other ideas, as does Marvin, a rival bounty hunter. On their long cross-country trip to LA, the two get to know each other and they build up a strange friendship.....What save this from being just another formulaic chase movie, is the blistering script, and how Grodin and De Niro just take that script, and turn it into cinematic gold.Whenever the two are on screen, it's fascinating stuff, but what really makes the film stand out, is the unusual, unpredictable friendship that the script allows them to have. Yes, they fall out on the odd accession, but you really feel like that they have this wonderful bond, like two people who have known each other for years.Kotto is brilliant as the always agitated FBI agent, and he is at the end of the best running gag of the film, involving him and his identification.Set pieces are fun, it's profane beyond belief, and if you thought Mel Gibson smoked a lot in Lethal a Weapon, see how many De Niro puts away.It's hard to believe that this is from the guy who gave us Gigli, and it's a shame that he's not done anything since, because I'm sure he's got a few more belters under his sleeve.A really fun movie, reminding you just how great De Niro was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin make a perfect pair in "Midnight Run," one of my personal favorites. Bounty hunter Jack Walsh (DeNiro) must bring back "the Duke," (Grodin) a man who has run out while on bail. What results is a very funny trip across the country that transitions from plane to train to automobile (no reference to another title). Nearly everything about this film is made funny, especially DeNiro repeatedly pretending to be an agent he met up with earlier and Grodin's attempt to act like an agent while the two of them rob a store. You will remember many lines after seeing this film, and you'll find yourself laughing at more than you usually do in a movie. There's not much more I can say about this film, as it must be seen to understand why it is so funny and worthwhile. I can almost guarantee this movie has got something enjoyable for everyone.

		<fullReview>This funny comedy about a bounty hunter (DeNiro) who has to duck and dodge the FBI and the mob while he is trying to deliver an ex-accountant (Grodin) to collect a 100k fee. DeNiro shines in the role and makes the film, i found grodin a bit annoying, not as much as other films but still not the most versatility from him and his patterns get redundant. Overall this film is what it is because of Deniro and other than that is pretty average late 80s flick. The writing and direction is adequate though both could have been a bit better as well as the overall development of the plot and relationship between the two characters. IMDb Rating: 7.5.

		<fullReview>I have seen this film many times and every time I see (part of) it on TV it still makes me laugh. The dialogue is crisp, sharp and hilarious. Combined with a great script, matching soundtrack and a top cast this makes for an absolute must see movie.What makes this film really stand out is the way De Niro and Grodin team up. Should the film have been shot with Bruce Willis or Cher (please help me) it wouldn't have worked. Thank God Martin Brest held his foot down on this one. De Niro and Grodin are so good together that it really baffles me that Grodin didn't star in more movies.Although it has some violence and plenty plenty of harsh language, this doesn't cloud the fact that the movie is about human emotions such as friendship, humor and fairness.Strongly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Take: The best buddy-action movie since LETHAL WEAPON. Much like but not entirely like LETHAL WEAPON, MIDNIGHT RUN is fueled with a superb chemistry between two unlikely partners. In MIDNIGHT RUN's case, it's Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin. DeNiro's the guy with the bad mouth, Grodin is the nice guy. Unlike Mel Gibson and Danny Glover who get together as partners, DeNiro and Grodin don't make the perfect pair, and that's what makes them perfect. Hard to understand? Just read on! DeNiro plays a bounty hunter out to get Grodin's character, the bounty know as "The Duke", to get his money. Grodin's character, named Jonathan Mardukas, used to work as an accountant to a crime boss, stole money from his boss and gives it to charity. DeNiro, who plays Jack Walsh, is sent to get Mardukas to get his reward, but the problem is both the FBI and his former crime boss is looking for him too. A number of memorable chase scenes ensue, but they're not just the best thing about the whole excursion. The sparring of these two characters (DeNiro's bad attitudes infuriates Grodin's reputations) are funnier as they get going. While chase scenes promises excitement, DeNiro and Grodin offer surefire laughter.Director Martin Brest (director of BEVERLY HILLS COP) moves the entire film in brisk pace. Brest doesn't hesitate to put in a lot of humor and jokes along the way, and of course the action scenes, which are both fun and humorous at the same time. MIDNIGHT RUN is recommended to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but it's still worth a revisit to anyone who has seen it already. A fine popcorn action comedy.Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DeNiro at his very very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DeNiro plays an ex-cop who works for Joe Pantoliano's "bail bond" agency, bringing back prisoners who jumped bail. He is asked to find Charles Grodin, a mafia accountant who embezzled money from Mafia boss Dennis Farina. Finding mild mannered accountant Grodin is the easiest bit but he needs to return him from New York to Los Angeles and Grodin successfully gets his way out of an air plane faking excessive fear of flying. So he has to return him in a cross-country trip, with Farina's goons, the FBI and rival headhunter John Ashton on his heels ... While I always considered DeNiro a good actor, I also thought that he was still a little bit over-hyped. For me, however, Midnight Run is the film that truly confirms him among the greatest and most versatile actors ever. Midnight Run is an absolute joy to watch because it contains so many quirky characters and actors that have so much chemistry between each other and seem to enjoy themselves from the first to the last second of the film (from the many great performances in the film I would also, apart from DeNiro, single out Joe Pantoliano in particular). In the sense of sheer exuberance of the characters I would compare this film to "The big Lebowski". And the plot is complicated but never confusing. It is obviously as contrived as these kind of stories go but never in an intelligence-insulting way and extremely funny, in a sense which reminds me of "The Big Lebowski".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tend to be a critical film critic, as most of the newer movies seem to rely on digitally perfected "special effects" or Bruckheimer-type explosions to shock and awe the viewer. Midnight Run is a throwback, as it was made in the 80's, to great characters that can hold a line and a scene, irreverance not too overdone that is refreshing, as well as re-watchable-ness that is a rarity these days. It's definitely in my top ten of all time, any genre, and I highly recommend to anyone who wants to see Deniro before he started making cheesy movies in the last decade. Great script, perfect casting, great one-liners; if you haven't seen Midnight Run, you are missing out on a classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funniest film of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a lot to make people laugh. It's one of the hardest things to do on film. MIDNIGHT RUN (1988) just plain hits all marks in that regard. Ironically, this film came out in a year when several other more highly regarded and awarded comedies came out (BIG, BULL DURHAM, A FISH CALLED WANDA). But none of those films for me is as funny as MIDNIGHT RUN, which stars Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin as one of the great comedy teams in all of film history. The real genius of MIDNIGHT RUN is that none the humor are not of the "joke/punchline" variety. It is all genuinely derived from the dialogue and natural character interactions. In fact, there is a healthy amount of drama in MIDNIGHT RUN that is always at the core. The characters don't behave in an absurd manner, although they are in a highly absurd situation. There humor is neither forced nor contrived, totally stemming from the situation.Who knew at the time that DeNiro could do comedy? Before this, he had done such monumentally intense roles such as a psychotic TAXI DRIVER, an on-the-rise mob kingpin in THE GODFATHER PART II, and the RAGING BULL prizefighter Jake LaMotta. He had never done "comedy" (KING OF COMEDY definitely doesn't qualify!). But in MIDNIGHT RUN, DeNiro is hilarious. He nails every scene that he is in. He is a wonder to behold. I had never been a huge fan of Charles Grodin before this film, but in MIDNIGHT RUN, I finally got his style of humor. His super-dry, oddball sense of wit and humor is displayed to full effect in MIDNIGHT RUN. The great supporting cast includes John Ashton (from BEVERLY HILLS COP fame), Yaphet Kotto (from THE RUNNING MAN), Joe Pantoliano (from RISKY BUSINESS and THE FUGITIVE), and Dennis Farina (from COP STORY and GET SHORTY). One of the most perfectly cast films of all time, top to bottom.Martin Brest, who directed the hilarious BEVERLY HILLS COP, outdid himself here by directing this film and plain should have gotten a Best Director nod, as should the film have been nominated for Best Picture. And the jazzy music score of this film is completely addictive, one of the best I've ever heard.There are just very few films that are this funny that you can watch over and over and still laugh at the scenes even though you've seen them a thousand times. DeNiro and Grodin should always be remembered for this one!</fullReview>

I especially liked the fighting, the excitement, everything there is to this film. Heck, this would even blow "Lethal Weapon" out of the water!!!!! Does anybody remember seeing this on the old Disney Channel network when it was a pay station? If you can find my contacts, let me know and tell me what else you saw on the network as well!!!!!

		<fullReview>When this movie came out, I was in high school; it was probably one of the first rated-R movies I saw. I loved it for its humor, its seriousness, its take on real life and its entertainment value.The acting is crisp; DeNiro is at his best in a heartless situation, trying to survive and put his life together the right way. Charles Grodin is not a favorite of mine; this is perhaps the only movie I can tolerate him in, yet he brings a balance to the DeNiro factor which makes this film so enjoyable. The scenes with the two of them on a train, in a car, on foot ... the character development is excellent. John Ashton brings humor, and Joey Pants is his usual smarmy self. Again, the acting just shines.The plot is perhaps a little predictable at times, but many scenes shine for their strength in the middle of the storytelling. In addition to the above scenes with DeNiro and Grodin, there is an especially touching scene -- albeit too brief -- between DeNiro's character and his estranged daughter. It literally brings tears to your eyes, which, in the middle of this movie, is a down-to-earth moment reminding you some people truly do have good lives ruined by no fault of their own.Even 19 years later, this film still has power. It is dated, of course, but the storyline is timeless enough to overlook that. Today, they'd make this movie with more guns and action, ruining its power. If you want a good ol' fashioned enjoyable movie watching experience, watch this.(A lot of profanity, so don't watch with the kids!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The chemistry between DeNiro and Grodin is almost equal to Martin and Candy in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. This is a funny and entertaining movie throughout. There is little not to find great. I think the best scene, however, may been the "Red's Bar" scene, where Grodin pretends to be an FBI agent. Grodin is very good as a Felix Ungerlike accountant, who is on the run from the mob. He is a very unlikely person to be doing so. He is very fussy and he clashes with Deniro (Jack Walsh), who is a former-cop bounty hunter whose only two emotions are "silence and rage". There is a cross-country chase also involving a rival bounty hunter, two bails bondsmen, an FBI agent (Yaphet Kotto), Dennis Farina as a mob boss, and two of his henchmen. Both Grodin's and De Niro's characters end up learning a lot about each other. That is really what the movie is about. In the end, they end up helping each other out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Re-Viving The Buddy Cop Genre With A Whole New Dimension Of Tight Script Writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 80s was always a mixed decade for film that included masterpieces and impressive film making. But there is always a "but" especially with the 80s because there were so many "cheesey Friday night action films" or "mainstream romantic comedies" that comprised of typecast goof balls who got paid good money to do nothing. The 80s was also the decade where "Buddy-cop" movies were popular and the majority of them are bad or average. Still there were great exceptions, the stand out examples that stood out as brilliantly crafted action movies. The most famous and probably the best buddy cop film was Lethal Weapon, the one really kicked off the genre and showed promise. A year later Midnight Run came along and provided a whole new dimension for it all. Midnight Run is a mainstream film, but one with great intelligence that still provides entertainment all these years on.It easy for people to overlook Midnight Run and just see it as some goofy crime comedy that for some reason starred Robert De Niro. I personally feel Robert De Niro is perfectly cast and suits his role with great elegance, providing a wonderful array of humour to the cop "Jack Walsh". Robert De Niro manages to take the role seriously and at the same time the film is very quirky. Charles Grodin manage to not get shoved aside by De Niro's tremendous acting ability and stays on par with De Niro's performance throughout the film's running time. Charles Grodin plays "Jonathan Mardukas" the sensitive accountant who just wants to get out of a mess that he mistakenly got himself involved in.I find it hard to see how anyone could not find Midnight Run entertaining, it mixes hilarious action with somewhat sentimental moments that are littered throughout the film. You might seem it strange that I've said "sentimental", well surprisingly the film has realism and thought provoking moment. The whole "See you in the next life" is a great touch to a friendship created by accident. What makes the film more impressive that the average action comedy is the fact that the script is so tightly wrapped.The script is so fast paced and keeps the film's substance and characters on the same level as the viewer. The script is one that shows hard work and intelligence. It helps you understand these wacky characters and the crazy situations they have got themselves involved in.The films pacing level would not be as good as it was if it was not for the the witting "one liner" dialogue. Another thing I love is the editing and the music, it's got this great 80s feel to it.I highly recommend Midnight Run if you want to watch something that leaves you feeling very happy and at the same time thrilled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I randomly sat down to watch 15-20 minutes of television and got wrapped up into this movie. This is a brilliant and witty comedy. Sheer excellence is a great way to describe it. All characters are played by the perfect actors. The name of the movie is said in the first 10 minutes setting it up for an excellent adventure. This movie takes plenty of unsuspecting twists and turns. I highly recommend it to anyone who can sit down and watch it all the way through. What I am most impressed about is the fact that I had never even heard about this movie and it is such a classic.the house</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buddy movie perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I should say that my vote of ten out of ten is in the context of the buddy movie genre - next to Raging Bull or Le Grande Illusion this is of course more of a six or seven. But it's a buddy movie so I'm judging it by the following criteria:Narrative arc of seemingly at-odds characters coming to like or respect each other. Gripping plot. Genuine tension. Action. Comedy. If I was being really picky it would score low on action and "geniune tension" (one or two scenes not withstanding) as compared to the likes of Lethal Weapon it's action-lite and most of the tension is of the niggly kind of personalities clashing over such quandaries as diet and personal finance. But where it outscores every other buddy-movie I've seen is in the dialogue and characters - the script is note-perfect and the characters so sweetly observed you find yourself rooting for an abrasive bounty hunter and a pedantic accountant. De Niro has never been better in a comedy, Grodin has never been better period. In a convoluted plot, bail-bondsman Eddie Moscone (a great turn from Joe Pantiolani) hires Jack Walsh (De Niro) to bring in an accountant Moscone had foolishly paid the bond for . The accountant, one Jonathon Mardukas (Grodin) is on the run from both the cops and the mob, having stolen millions from a gangster (Jimmy Serano, another scene munching turn from Dennis Farina) in Chicago and given most of it to charity. If Walsh fails to bring Mardukas in within a few days, Moscone will be out of business. Sensing the moment, Walsh demands $100,000 for his troubles and Moscone reluctantly agrees...So far so simple. But there are several ingredients to go into this pot: the fact that Walsh used to be a cop in Chicago and knows the gangster in question. The fact that Mardukas "doesn't like to fly", forcing them across country. A jumpy Moscone loses his patience with Walsh and brings in another bounty hunter to gazump him. The FBI, in the shape of short-tempered Alonzo Mosely (Yaphet Kotto) wanting to take Mardukas off Walsh's hands. Jimmy Serano himself keeping tabs on the whole affair, wanting as he does some fairly violent revenge on Mardukas. Not to mention Walsh's feelings for chickens. It adds up to a brilliantly observed, and in places, surprisingly moving, comedy that is character driven in the best sense of the phrase, and bears repeated viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best comedy road trip of 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making unforgettable Beverly Hills cop, Martin Brest hit the jackpot again.This time with De Niro and Grodin. Since it's hard to write a script, fully packed with laughs, just right amount of action sequences, good chemistry between main figures and some touchy moments (here i'm thinking the scenes, where De Niro's daughter wanted to give him his money and the very end of the movie) much of the credit goes to George Gallo.I won't mention the plot, since many critics before me have already done that. Just picture the 80's, "budy-action" story and De Niro at his best. Oh yeah, and a lot of "F" words. Someone may ask, why did I rate this movie so high. Well, it's no "Oscar material", but every time I watched it, it made me feel good. And there are few movies on the market, that you can watch more than once, without feeling sleepy. Thanks to the pace, packed with all above mentioned stuff (comedy, action, twists).Too bad, they don't made today movies like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good, if very 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the moment I heard of this film, I knew I had to watch it... a buddy comedy pairing up Charles Grodin and Robert De Niro, that's simply too good, to golden an idea to miss. As expected, Grodin's deadpan and matter-of-fact humor compliments De Niro's hot-headed, sarcastic witty humor perfectly. The plot is interesting, though the pace seemed odd to me. It gets going faster than you'd expect it to, and then proceeds to take it's good time getting to where it's going. Maybe it's just too long since I've seen a movie of this period. There's no doubt about it; the film is very 80's. Around half-way through the film, I thought to myself: "There is no doubt as to the fact that this movie was made in the same decade as The Blues Brothers." It starts out 80's, continues 80's and ends 80's. The music, the tone, the dialog... everything. Any fan of the movies and culture of those years should love it. Heck, I'm not... and I thought it was pretty darn great. The score consists heavily of jazz and blues, which both fits and just sounds, well, damn good. The action is somewhat... well, close to non-existent, but that's not what this film is about. It's about the characters - the people we follow. True, only the two main characters are well-developed... but they all seemed credible, and what back-story was provided was excellent. The acting is all good. The humor mostly works... though there were two characters who seemed to only be there to provide comic relief, and of the worst kind. They were inexplicably daft, and this was just hit on every single time we see them... no depth whatsoever to them. Some of the jokes and gags try too hard to be funny, and a few are added in at points in the movie that are too busy, too much going on for us to find them funny. To the director and the writer, I say this: Remember, less is more. You can't cram in jokes wherever. Like action, humor needs pacing and timing to work. Finally, De Niro fools the same character not once, not twice, but three times with the exact same trick. It turns out to be a setup, but still. Still, this is one of the best films of its kind, and it's a lot better than many, if not necessarily all(The Blues Brothers and Trading Places definitely top it) 80's comedies. I recommend this film to most people who can enjoy a film that is a little older than brand new... it has, most definitely, aged quite well. Watch it for De Niro, watch it for Grodin, watch it for some good laughs and a good film experience(thought it would be a lie to say that it's exceptionally well-made, from a purely technical standpoint). 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another underrated gem from the 80s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder when Martin Brest was trying to sell the idea of Midnight Run, did he come up against any opposition? Certainly the idea of captive and captor on the run is nothing new, but what could have thrown people was the idea of Robert DeNiro being made the star of a comedy, and bizarrely, pairing him up with Charles Grodin.That was the effect it had on me. But not the comedy side to it. I knew that DeNiro could handle comedy after the stellar work he put into Meet the Parents. But I wasn't so sure about the double act of DeNiro and Grodin. I just didn't see the connection.But I'm happy to say that Midnight Run was a pleasant surprise for me, and the fact that it worked as well as it did was even more pleasant because it was so unexpected. The plot is nothing to get worked up about, in fact it's rather routine, but the delightful chemistry between our hapless duo turns it into a real treat.Jack Walsh (DeNiro) is a bounty hunter, bringing in people who have skipped out on bail. He has no love for his job, but has to do it after being drummed out of the Chicago police department after ending up on the wrong side of Mafia mobster Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina).Eddie Moscone (A very hyper Joe Pantoliano), Jack's boss, has a new job for him that could finally give him the opportunity to kiss off this job and start a new life. Jonathan Mardukas aka The Duke (Grodin) was an accountant who embezzled millions of dollars from Serrano. After he gave most of it to charity (and some to himself) he was caught, and then skipped out on his bail. Jack now has to bring him back, and he has a week to do it in.Jack manages to track down Mardukas fairly easily in New York. But not before other parties show their interest. Such as the FBI who want him so they can nail Serrano, as well as the Mob who want him dead before Mardukas can prosecute. And a rival bounty hunter Marvin (A very funny John Ashton) who wants a piece of the action too.With all of these parties in the game, it becomes a madcap cross country dash across America to get to Jack and the Duke first. What really makes this special is the marvellous chemistry between DeNiro and Grodin. They are so comfortable around each other, and a lot of their exchanges are fantastic.The dialogue is very nuanced so you start to pick up on hidden meanings after repeated viewings. Such as the Duke offering to pay off Jack, and him claiming he never took a payoff in his life. Which in turn leads up to the revelation of Jack's past dealings with Serrano.DeNiro makes Jack into a very likable character, someone who is very self-deprecating and world weary. But Jack's cynical front hides some painful moments too. There is a very poignant scene when Jack has to borrow money from his ex-wife and daughter whom he has not seen in years. Just watch Grodin's face during this scene, and you can see how much he comes to respect Jack at this moment.As for Grodin, he was born to play the role of the uptight accountant. He never stops badgering Jack about his past, and what makes it so entertaining is the ambiguity to it all. You are constantly wondering if it is genuine concern or just another one in a long line of escape attempts by the Duke.Our odd couple have to use every means of transportation imaginable to keep one step ahead of the rest of the world. Granted the plot falls into an obvious stride, but because the two of them are so intriguing together, you really don't care. The Litmus Test scene is hilarious, Grodin freaking out on the airplane, Marvin being left behind time and again, the joys of this film are plentiful.There are occasions where it seems contrived, but sometimes it's necessary to advance the plot. As things come to a head, all the plot elements struggling for dominance converge in a most satisfying way. The film is perhaps slightly overlong, over two hours which is unusual for a comedy, but it's not boring.A fine ensemble cast, an atypical film score from Danny Elfman, a multilayered script, and a marvellous ending make Midnight Run into a film that has withstood the test of time very well. Having read the novelisation too, which is just as enjoyable, made it even more entertaining for me because I can see where DeNiro and Grodin improvised. Their rapport is so dead on I never get tired of their exploits.A true classic of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Run is an action comedy, and both Robert De Niro, Joey Pants and John Ashton are great actors with the right attitude. "Buddy"-chemistry is crucial in this genre and De Niro and Grodin make a great pair. You can tell De Niro is enjoying spoofing his typical hard case-characters and he also has some great acting moments which, when they're good, they're great. The chemistry actually works better between more characters than in most other action comedies, and it's just awesome to see this caliber of actors taking the genre seriously while also providing the high level of energy and joy it demands. Oh yeah, of course, Dennis Farina, after this role and the one in Get Shorty, he's the man. Hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know whence the characters sprung: "The Odd Couple" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid", vs. those originating from "The Godfather" series, and many lesser mob stories.What made this click are the three cosmologies, shaped by Smith's "Gorky Park"...""Why don't you like the FBI?"...The manic power that was Kirwill made a slight revolution. The grin twisted. "Well, for lots of reasons. Professionally, because the FBI doesn't conduct investigations, they pay informers. Doesn't matter what kind of case--spies, civil rights, Mafia--all they know is informers...See that's the basic difference. A cop goes out on the street and digs up information for himself. He's willing to get dirty because his ambition in life is to be a detective. But a bureau agent is really a lawyer or an accountant; he wants to work in an office and dress nice, maybe go into politics...""And so we have a free for all war of cops vs. the bureau vs. the Mob, all making and switching alliances in order to "drop the Duke." Once the bail jumper is nabbed, it's "Planes, Trains and Automobiles". DeNiro plays it straight here, but the gems are Grodin, riffing on Woody Allen ("These things go down!") and Jack Webb ("Then why do they call you Red?"), and Kotto ("Is this going to upset me?").This movie is the necessary slab in our collective consciousness holding up "Goodfellas" and "Donnie Brasco", etc. Right now, "The Sopranos" occupies this same psychological space.Cinematically, I can't think of a finer match of a completely original soundtrack (courtesy of Elfman) to the visual narrative, revolving somewhere around Chicago electric blues, Stax and Motown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Movie Lines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has not only a terrific story line but terrific actors and great acting. The movie lines and the exchanges between Jack Walsh and Jonathan Mardukis, Eddie Moscone, Jimmy Serrano, Alonzo Mosely, and Walsh's ex-wife Gail (not to mention the gal in the ticket office at the bus station and the kid on airplane seated next to Jack Walsh) are hilarious.When Jimmy Serrano calls two of his "goons", Tony Darvo and Joey, the telephone exchanges alone make this movie stand out. The story is good if not very good but the interchanges between the characters and the development of the characters is outstanding.I think that the movie could have done without the foul language which was over the top in parts. The timing in the interaction between De Niro and the rest of the cast was just plain hilarious; "Is this moron number one? Put moron number two on the phone." "That's the information we got, let me tell you two dummies something, I want this guy taken out and I want him taken out now. You two better start getting more personally involved in your work or I'm gonna stab you through the heart with a pencil".Very funny movie, very memorable lines, very good actors, very bad language (don't let younger children watch this one).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jonathan Mardukas embezzled 15 million dollars. The mob wants him dead. The F.B.I. wants him alive. Jack Walsh just wants him to shut up.Summary written by rcs0411@yahoo.com: Jack Walsh is a former cop from Chicago, who was framed by criminal he was investigating and about to arrest. He is now a bounty hunter based in Los Angeles. His boss wants him to find, Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas, an accountant, who was working for Las Vegas mobster, who stole millions of dollars from him and gave it away. His boss was the one who bailed him out, and now unless he can get him back in L.A. in the next 5 days, he will forfeit the bond and be placed out of business. So he sends Jack to get him, which is Midnight Run or easy job in the bail bond business. Except for the fact that the man The Duke stole the money from, wants to get him, and he is also the same man who framed Jack. And also the FBI wants to get Mardukas so that they can use him to get his boss, so they warn Walsh not to get in their way. But Walsh nevertheless finds The Duke and is about bring him back but when Mardukas claims that he has difficulty with flying the airline throws them out of the plane, so they have to go back on the road. When Walsh's boss, learns that he didn't arrive when he was suppose to, he sends another bounty hunter, Marvin, who is Jack's greatest adversary, to get Mardukas. And when Marvin cancels Walsh's card, they don't have enough funds to make it all the way, so they have to scrape everything they have. And it doesn't help that Mardukas is doing everything he can to escape, cause he says that his former boss can get him even in jail.Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are perfectly cast in their roles. The film is very good and underrated, for reasons that I don't know. I cant find it on DVD and wish it would get a re-release this is better than 80% of the action films out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never seen a film starring DeNiro which disappointed. He is a brilliant actor, one of the very best, and I expect first class entertainment. Some situations in this film are hard to swallow i.e. the helicopter chase where machine guns fail to stop DeNiro and his two "companions", a "dip" in a very turbulent river fails to shake the determination of DeNiro's pursuit of Grodin who manages, despite the encumbrance of a large overcoat, to remain afloat. Aside from a few other minor flaws it is good entertainment with lots of wise cracks from DeNiro which help underline the comedic aspects of the film. I've seen it three times and will see it again.........K.M.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy-thriller which crackles with wit and excitement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Run is a great movie from the director of Beverly Hills Cop Martin Brest. It provides Robert De Niro with a chance to show his comic side (don't worry if you like him mean and moody, because he gets to be that too). It also provides Charles Grodin with one of the best roles of his career, mainly because this is not a simple-minded one-dimensional farce but an intricate mixture of gangster thriller, road movie and comedy. De Niro plays Jack Walsh, a down-on-his-luck bounty hunter working for a very unreliable and sleazy bail-bondsman named Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano). Eddie wants Jack to find an accountant named Jonathan Mardukas (Grodin), a.k.a The Duke. It turns out that The Duke embezzled a few million dollars from the Mob, and now that Eddie has bailed him out of jail he needs to get his money before the Mob can locate and eliminate the Duke. However, Walsh realises that bringing the Duke in is not necessarily to his advantage, because the Mob bigwig from whom he embezzled the money is called Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina), an old adversary of Walsh's. Therefore, Walsh senses an opportunity to get one over on his old enemy by using The Duke as bait. All right, the plot is complicated! But that's not a bad thing, and it's a credit to Brest the writer that he has managed to make his film fairly easy to comprehend, even though there's an awful lot going on. Brest the director deserves a lot of credit too, for drawing dry, witty performances from all his main actors and for delivering some terrific action sequences. The dialogue is great, with lots of snappy and funny interplay between Walsh and The Duke, and some fabulous crudities from rival bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton). There's a heck of a lot of swearing in the film (it might even set a record for the most bad language in a "light" comedy film) but because the actors deliver their lines with wit and relish, the abundance of cursing is surprisingly forgivable. Midnight Run is an absolute blast. A character-driven action-thriller-comedy which moves at a terrfic pace and has style and energy to spare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Action Comedy of the 80's...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what has to be one of the most under-appreciated "Buddy-Formula" movies of all time, Robert Deniro &amp; Charles Grodin strut their stuff on screen for one of the greatest chase films ever made.Yes, for those of you who did not know that Charles Grodin actually DID have a successful movie career (i.e. "The Heartbreak Kid", "Heaven Can Wait", "The Lonely Guy", et al.) before getting into the talk show circuit, you'll be pleasantly surprised to catch his performance in this late 80's jewel of a movie.It stars Robert Deniro as Jack Walsh, a bounty-hunter who sets himself apart because he thinks that he has something that the people in his business usually don't have: "principles". The funny part is that those same "principles" are exactly what links him to the Charles Grodin character, Jonathan Mardukas, also known as The Duke, who has stolen 15 million dollars from the mob, and claims to have done it out of "principles", in order to give the money away to the poor.Whoever thought of the idea of bringing these two totally different actors together is a genius, as their chemistry is literally palpable on the screen, what with Deniro's intensity and Grodin's non-chalant ways, the blend is outstanding.The movie is basically a formulaic chase one, since Walsh and Mardukas are being followed by the FBI, led by Agent Alonzo Mosley, in a great performance by Yaphet Kotto, the mob, led by Jimmy Serrano, in a scary/funny turn by Dennis Farina, and another bounty-hunter named Marvin Dorfler, played by the much under-appreciated John Ashton. There are planes, trains, and automobiles in the movie, but it never gets tired, as it all comes to a magnificent conclusion.We're not used to seeing Deniro play a character like Jack Walsh in a comedy or an action/comedy, as his comedic turns have been more of the intellectual variety (i.e. "The King of Comedy", "Meet the Parents", etc.) or have been ones where he is fully disguised or almost unrecognizable (i.e. "Brazil", "The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle"). But what he does here is brave and courageous, and it pays off big time, as he ALLOWS the character of Walsh to GET THE LAUGHS based solely on WHO THE CHARACTER IS, because there is no change in the way he utters out his threats in this movie, from the way he did it in movies where he was far more scarier (i.e. "Goodfellas", "The Godfather Part II", et al.)."Midnight Run" is a highly entertaining action/comedy movie with a heart, and if you have half the fun, watching it, as the actors obviously had while doing it, then you will have already enjoyed yourself a whole lot more than in any other movie that is "similar" to this one. Recommended as a great entry in the Robert Deniro filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why is Midnight Run so under-rated?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of my top 10 films (if I ever figure out how to do a top 10) and definitely my top comedy.The script is excellent. The scripted gags are natural and realistic, most of them quotable... but I'll not annoy by doing so. Apparently parts were improvised (`If I was your accountant' and on the bus where De Niro all but talks to camera `What a pain in the ass this guy is'). I'd love to see how the original screenplay stacks up.Elfman's score is wonderful. The laid back themes in opposition to the cross-country race, sometimes the film almost gets in the way! The casting is nearly perfect, even down to Tracey Walter serving up the free coffee in the diner.Such an enjoyable film, how come it's so under-rated? Possibly because the locations chosen are more realistic than Hollywood usually allows. Glimpses of the American dream are shown - the Duke's palace, his ex-wife's suburban home - but only to reinforce how much our hero has given up in order to cling to his principles. We don't see his home, but we know it's going to be a sparse, grey, dull flea-ridden apartment, perhaps similar to the Bail Bonds office with the addition of a bed. It's almost an English film in it's drabness. Wonderful, but not Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen "Midnight Run" maybe ten times now. It's still one of the funniest films I've had the pleasure of watching. It's a great premise: accountant, Jonathan Mardukus has ripped off the Mob. He's skipped bail and is in hiding. Jack Walsh (De Nero) wants $100,000 to bring him back from New York to L.A. The Mobalso wants Mardukus, as does the FBI. Sandwiched between the time whenJack Walsh grabs Mardukus in New York, and by the time he delivers Mardukusto L.A.,there are more double crosses, plot twists, one-liners ("if you don't shut up you'll be suffering from fista-phobia"), and visual gags to provide even the most jaded cinephile a great two hours of entertainment. Charles Grodin is a stand-out as Jonathan Mardukus. Just the expressions on his face, and when he 'lectures' De Nero, are enough to send this writer into paroxysms of laughter. A special mention, too, to Mr. George Gallo, for a truly funny script, where the jokes emanate from the plot, rather than just for 'joke's sake'. A very under-rated comedy. See it. It'll have you in stitches</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, Tony. He ain't mad at me, is he?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MIDNIGHT RUN is one of my favourite movies. The performances, jazzy score and yes, even the profanity combine to make this a must-see film. About the profanity; it's not offensive and the way it's used cracks me up. Aside from that, much has been said here (and by the way, it's pleasing to read that almost everyone here loves this movie as I do) about DeNiro, Grodin, Kotto etc. but I gotta tell ya, the two guys who make me giggle are Tony and Joey. These two good fellahs are like "blink and you'll miss 'em" bright sparks. When you rent the movie, pay attention to their antics. The thorough commitment to their relationship is a tribute to both actors and director, Brest.Anyway, get the movie. You won't be sorry."Getchyer camera, take a picture"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, DeNiro and Grodin (who you otherwise would never see sharing this amount of screen time) click together like the best comedy teams ever. It's just a great movie. Martin Brest does a terrific job directing this quite varied ensemble cast and it works wonderfully. Who do you not like in this movie? Dennis Farina as the hard-nosed mob boss, Joe Pantoliano as the high-strung bailbondsman, Yaphet Kotto as the helpless FBI agent, John Ashton as the bumbling hitman. Put it all together and it's a great peace of work. I know a guy who's 80 years old and has seen everything from the original King Kong to Scoobey Doo 2002 and this is one of the most entertaining films he's ever seen. I can only agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From opening to closing Midnight Run is the definative road movie, and is an absolute must view. DeNiro is perfection incarnate as the angry ex-cop with honor, Grodin is a loveable goof while maintaining his classic dead-pan, and all of the multiple supporting characters are great and well used by Martin Brest. The stand out is Koto's FBI Agent, and one has to wonder how hard it was for him the keep his characters stoic facade. Buy it, rent it, copy it, whatever you do you will love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A MIDNIGHT RUN FULL OF LAUGHS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Midnight Run" was one of the best action/comedies that I saw from the '80s next to "Beverly Hills Cop" and "Lethal Weapon". It has a lot of good comedy, cool action, and one of the best performances from Robert DeNiro. It also has a slick storyline: A bounty hunter is offered $100,000 to return a guy who, embazzled $15 million from the Mob, gave it to charity, and jumped bail from New York to L.A. in five days. But things get harder when the FBI get on their trail for the bail jumper to testify and the Mob wants to kill both of them. But I can't just give credit to the people in front of the camera, I also have to give the credit for those behind the camera like the writer, George Gallo and director Martin Brest for this clever movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wild and hardball comic adventure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A wild and hardball comic adventure that stars Robert De Niro as Jack Walsh, a sarcastic bounty hunter who is sent to the Big Apple to bring back Jonathon "The Duke" Mardukas (Charles Grodin), an accountant (who jumped bail) back to L.A. in four days. Walsh's boss, Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantilano) defines it as a "Midnight Run". Get it?The only thing that Walsh doesn't suspect that's Mardukas' former boss, Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina), a hot-tempered Las Vegas mobster, has ordered the hit on "The Duke" for donating a large amount of Serrano's money to charity. Besides dealing with the Mob, the two men must dodge the feds and Alonzo Mosley (Yaphet Kotto), an FBI agent who's determined to get back at Walsh for snatching his badge and Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton), a fellow bounty hunter who tries to get Mardukas for less money.What makes the movie work so well? Director Martin Brest ("Beverly Hills Cop", "Scent of a Woman") and screenwriter George Gallo let the film go at a steady pace and in the scenes where De Niro and Grodin aren't being chased or shot at. Mardukas tries now and then to get Walsh to open up and tell him about his past. One perfect example of that is when Jack and Jon go visit the home of where Jack's ex-wife and daughter live.The performances here in this film are nothing short of excellent and shows how great of a director that Brest himself is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply one of the most enjoyable films of all time. It is endlessly watchable because it understands what makes a film great. So many films in the eighties used the same template and placed wafer thin characters in the story which left them with a poor film. Midnight Run's strength is its ensemble of fleshed out, beautifully realised characters that make the whole thing so damn funny. You have interest in all of the characters, not just the main-men. Lets not forget the pacey direction, witty script and the raport between the two charasmatic leads Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin.Often overlooked by the general audience, this film probably should have been the action/comedy of the 80's, because in my eyes it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film, instant velcro, watch it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I come across Midnight Run while channel surfing, I always stop and stick (if it's the uncut version)...instant velcro. It starts with a bang and doesn't slow down -- the script, acting and directing are impeccable. There's even a scene that gets me choked up. And the movie is funny from beginning to end. Laugh-out-loud funny. When I was introduced to this movie I hesitated. DeNiro and....Grodin? DeNiro, the Method Actor and Grodin the limp dishrag?? In a BUDDY COMEDY??!? Yecch.Boy, was I wrong. Every major character is perfectly cast and gives a nearly perfect performance, and I am not exaggerating. DeNiro and Grodin are the perfect foils, and do not slip into the trite ruts laid by a thousand other buddy movies. Yaphet Kotto, John Ashton, Dennis Farina and Joe Pantoliano all take what would normally be two-dimensional, stereotypical supporting parts and imbue them with life, personality and realism. About the uncut version...don't watch the broadcast (edited) version. It's awful. Some of the characters are hard-bitten and street-wise, and the profanity is used as a natural spice, but not gratuitously. If you are easily offended by profanity, even in context, then skip this movie altogether. Watching the edited version of this movie would be like viewing a classic Rubens painting with crude pasties and fig leafs awkwardly drawn over the naughty bits. Watch the premium cable version, or better yet rent (or buy!) the video.If you're looking for a comedy with depth, bite, wit and excitement, then catch Midnight Run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best comedies I've ever seen - a real surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Midnight Run at a friends' as a rented video. He had mentioned it a few times to me before, and I had always dismissed the choice. When we eventually saw it, I realised the error of my ways.The whole cast of the movie (which includes many less well known faces) play their parts superbly. Both of the lead actors - De Niro and Grodin are excelently matched. I can only assume that they had an absolute gas during the filming.Smaller parts like the duo who run the bail bonds business are also perfectly cast - hound dog expressions a plenty! I think a special mention should be made for John Ashton, who plays Marvin Dorfler, the main rival bounty hunter to De Niro's character. He suffers endless humiliations and set backs in his quest for financial reward, but all through the film he exudes a loveable rougishness.For me, Midnight Run proves that Robert De Niro is one of the world's most versatile actors, and is possibly peerless as such.N.B: I have only watched unedited versions, with full profanity, etc. I can not comment on other versions mentioned in previous reviews.</fullReview>

Universal Pictures wanted Robin Williams opposite De Niro instead, but after screen testing Grodin director Brest battled the studio to persuade them to cast the latter. It's easy to see why. Brimming with great dialogue, swashbuckling action and incisive humour, Midnight Run is intelligent and deeply satisfying entertainment within its genre. Highly recommendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Approaches perfection within its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, a few things about "Midnight Run" have dated. It's got the inevitable '80s car chase, with five million cop cars pursuing De Niro and Grodin while they scream in anger at each other. It's also amazing how many felonies De Niro commits in the course of the movie without ending up spending his life in jail. But these plot points are part of the genre, and as long as we are willing to suspend disbelief a bit, it's not a problem.On to the good things. The De Niro/Grodin chemistry is obviously very good -- this is probably De Niro's most successful comic performance, although he mostly plays the straight man. An absolutely first-rate supporting cast -- including a hilarious Joe Pantoliano as well as Dennis Farina as a mob boss and the sublime Yaphet Kotto as an ever-more-put-upon FBI agent -- gives "Midnight Run" a richness of texture that puts it head and shoulders above other movies. I love the way these characters live out their roles with style and grace -- note De Niro's "inside joke" for Yaphet Kotto after stealing an FBI car.Structurally, the script is excellent as well. The plot is very intricate -- it juggles 3 separate groups of people pursuing De Niro and Grodin (the mob, the FBI, and a rival bounty hunter) while continuing to develop the relationship between the two leads in distinct stages. Things do lag a bit in late Act II -- I could have done without the scene where Grodin and De Niro pose as FBI agents looking for counterfeit money -- but it's a minor quibble. Two superb dramatic scenes (the one where De Niro talks to his ex-wife, and the last scene in which he says goodbye to Grodin) round things out.Budding screenwriters take note: if you want to study a film that's a first-rate example of the 3-act Hollywood movie done right, check out "Midnight Run." Anyone else, just watch it to have a good time.</fullReview>

This is such a convincingly played film, so sure and so true, that you can watch it time and again without tiring of it. The director deserves great credit for allowing his principle leads the time and space to breathe real life into their characters, rather than having them trade limp wisecracks in the usual buddy movie way. DeNiro's terrific and Grodin's never come close to matching his performance here. Because it's one of those largely unrecognised 'great movies' that a lot of people won't have seen, it's also a good one to recommend to a new friend.

		<fullReview>Midnight Run is certainly in the running for the greatest film of all time, along with Citizen Kane and Stick (starring Burt Reynolds). The fact that this cinematic masterpiece was overlooked for Best Picture angers me every time I watch this film. The movie has a solid and proven director (Marty Brest, of Beverly Hills Cop fame) the greatest actor from 1970 on (Robert De Niro) and a brilliant character actor (Charles Grodin). These elements would be nothing without a breathtaking script, which focuses on the zany adventure of Jack Walsh (De Niro), a grizzled bounty hunter out for one last score, and Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas, the accountant who embezzled 15 million from the mob. Walsh will get $100,000 if he can get "The Duke" from New York to L.A. in a week (a midnight run). What ensues is a serious of brilliantly acted scenes (including stellar performances from Joe Pantoliano, Yaphet Kotto and Dennis Farina), incredible action sequences, and overall hilarity. I cannot say anything else about this film, except for the fact that Robert De Niro gives his greatest comedic performance (forget the horrible Analyze This) and that the Academy ignored this really wonderful film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some movies that you can't quite place neatly into a genre. This is one of them. Comedy, Action, Crime, Road, Buddy, all words which apply to this film but still it doesn't quite cut it.Basically, the plot revolves around Robert De Niro's bounty hunter trying to get mild-mannered mob-money thief Grodin across the country to hand him in for his reward, while fending off his rival bounty hunter, the mafia, the FBI and Grodin's numerous escape efforts. Of course, it all works out in the end. There are tons of memorable action scenes, like the off-road car chase and the tense airport finale, but the more thoughtful scenes, like the conversation in the freight train or when De Niro visits his daughter, are well done and genuinely moving, adding a genuine sympathy to the characters, and elevating them above the 2D fare you get in so many 'action/buddy/comedy' movies. You grow to like them just as they grow to like each other.If you missed this movie, rent it; it's a really entertaining evening guaranteed. Just make sure little Timmy is tucked up in bed before De Niro gets to open his mouth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very fun movie that I highly recommend. Despite the plentitude of profanity, there is really not much violence, no sex and this is a movie that focuses on morality in a strange way. The main character, Jack Walsh, played brilliantly by DeNiro, is a man of scruples and tenacity. A couple of qualities we should all possess. And as other reviewers may mention, this movie does not work without the profanity. Seriously, I waited I don't know how long to tape this off of TV but it always came on Disney or TNT and they edit the s__t out of it! As a result, some of the best lines are missing. For example, when DeNiro becomes frustrated with Charles Grodin's constant nagging, he tells him, "Here come 2 words for you-- shut the f___ up!" You see my point- edited, shut up- it IS 2 words and the comedy of the situation is lost. Personally as you can tell, I don't have a problem with all the profanity in this movie- as Spencer Tracy said in "Inherit the Wind," - and I quote: "I think we should use all the words we've got! Besides, there are damn few words anyone understands anymore!" But I digress--- this movie is full of great performances by the other characters too. Yaphet Kotto and Denis Farina are terrific too. All around this is a movie to make you laugh. If you can't see it unedited on TV, do what I did and buy a copy from Amazon.com- it's less than the cost of 2 movie tickets and you'll be able to laugh anytime you want!</fullReview>

It is highly entertaining due to the performances by Charles Grodin and Robert de Niro. Sure there are chases, explosions, shooting, and profanity. (No gratuitous nudity, however. Could have gotten it a better rating.) Everyone here talks about the chemistry between the two main cast members, but what was best was the ability to make many things funny, without going all the way into comedy. De Niro is funny because Jack Walsh (his character) is funny, and not because the actor is. (Obviously, since he is mostly known for dramatic roles) Kudos to the director for letting this film flow from the talent available.</fullReview>

I have just now sat thru another viewing and at the now number of the 45th time I have watched this comedy/action flick, I am still amazed and happy that I have it in my collection of films. It's essence is still crystal clear and even without the use of cell phones and other 'technologically' correct apparatus never fails to entertain and appease our sense of two very different people on a journey towards Life...a communication between 'good guy, bad guy', and their trials and travails traveling together. And the fuzzy distinction of who actually is the good or bad guy. I love all Buddy movies, some that come to mind are "Beverly Hills Cop", "48 Hours", "Twins", Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man", "Planes, Trains and Automobiles"and "Thelma and Louise". If any of you have other titles that fit under 'buddy movies' please name them so that I might be able to watch any that I may have missed for they are a favorite of mine.

		<fullReview>I have always liked this chase movie, but the more I watch it, the more I like it, and the more I see its subtle charm. "Charm" is not a word one usually applies to a crime&amp;chase comedy, but it is the first word that comes to mind when thinking of the subtle development of the relationship between Jack Walsh and Jonathan "the Duke" Mardukas over the course of the film. Walsh clearly views Mardukas as a paycheck and, once he picks him up, a pain in the neck. But we see the interaction between them, subtly worked out over the course of the flick, lead to an unexpected ending. Of course, aside from that, there is the sheer fun of the chases, car wrecks, surprises and plot twists along the way that keep one on the edge of one's seat. Wonderful acting from the leads deNiro and Grodin, as well as from Yaphet Koto as the harried FBI agent, Dennis Farina as the mob boss, and John Ashton as Marvin, Walsh's boneheaded competitor. A very enjoyable and satisfying move that stands up well to repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro is comic genius shock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost unbelievably, history appears to be forgetting Midnight Run. De Niro is still venerated as the greatest actor of his generation and critics constantly roll out Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas ad nauseum, but for me he's never topped his performance in this sadly underrated and rarely televised movie. The swearing in this film may be one reason, although to my mind it's well used, realistic and adds to the enjoyment rather than detracts from it.Another reason may be the wholly forgettable title. Just as some average films have been given a boost by their titles, this one is muffled by a throwaway phrase that means little and has no wit about it. A more deserving title and I think more people would recognise this film for the slice of comic genius that it is.De Niro is perfectly cast as the grumpy, blue-collar, perennially irritable Jack Walsh. Grodin is perfectly cast as the liberal, well-meaning white-collar criminal he's sent to bring back to LA. Together they bring out the absolute best in each other, with a wonderful supporting cast (why is no one using John Ashton properly in mainstream flicks any more?? It defies logic).The plot is so complex, yet so tight, that it allows for liberal ad-libbed scenes to play out, lending each scene a gem-like quality to be treasured, before the film moves along again at a cracking pace. Every character is given their space and their moment, and in a film that's this pacey and this packed with characters, that's a real achievement. The pacing really is perfect in this movie, and the growing bond between DeNiro and Grodin is absolutely spot on, never skirting the shoals of sentimentality but only of mutual respect and real affection.The movie's one quiet centre - the scene where Walsh goes to see his ex-wife and daughter - is tear-jerkingly sad and yet, seconds later, we're back on track and rolling right along without any sense of having been manipulated, or having our emotions glossed over. It really is a triumph.There's no cop-out ending either - it hits another perfect note in a symphony of 'rightness', and all involve emerge with the highest honour from a movie which still makes my Top Ten list 20 years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better buddy movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an entertaining movie and pretty good for it's type. I'm surprised the movie's makers didn't reduce the swearing in it because that's the only reason I could suggest for it getting an"18" certificate in the UK (well, it did on my video copy anyway). Apart from the bad language the tone of the film is quite light and it's main strength is it's humour. The cast is really good too - De Niro and Grodin make a good double-act as the leads and there are some quality character actors in supporting roles (Dennis Farina, John Ashton, Yaphet Kotto and Joe Pantoliano). I'm not too keen on the soundtrack but then I'm not sure about what kind of music would have been more suitable. There is also a recurrent theme of character's knocking each other out with single punches which I find hard to swallow - can anyone actually do that in real life? Anyway, it isn't real life and I probably shouldn't be so picky - this movie is good fun and recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Favourite Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Run is my favourite movie! I own the soundtrack, the movie poster, and the movie novelization. I first saw the movie on VHS in 1993 and I have seen it now about 300 times and can quote many lines from the film. Now I know you are thinking, What? Why an action film as your favourite movie? Because the characters are so well constructed. These two people, who seem very different at first, have a lot in common. Most people could learn a lot from that life lesson. And second it is very funny. I read that a lot of the movie was improvised and De Niro and Grodin are great together. I became a big Charles Grodin fan after this movie and saw a lot of his other movies (Beethoven/Seems Like Old Times). I really like Martin Brest too, his movies are great (Beverly Hills Cop/Scent of a Woman) even "Going in Style" was OK, a bit slow but an excellent speech at the end! And yes, I do know he made Gee Lee! I refuse to see it. Maybe if it comes on TV, but I am not paying money to see that. The script writer George Gallo is not a bad writer, he went on to direct "29th Street" and "Trapped in Paradise" all OK movies, nothing special. This is a great movie about everything going wrong and finially working out in the end.....a lot like life. And I am pleased to hear the script is taught is comedy screenplay classes (somewhere in the US I think). I also love the music score by Danny Elfman (who was in the rock band Oingo Boingo). This is my favourite score by him, more a rock/honky tonk type score, just excellent! My only regret is not seeing this on the BIG SCREEN! I would love to see a print of it sometime if that is possible. For now the widescreen DVD will have to do. This is a great comedy......Highly recommended! Thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow... a decent buddy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1988, the buddy film was becoming a staple of the Hollywood system. It remained such up until around the mid-1990s, when one of the most iconic series of buddy films in the history of Hollywood, the Lethal Weapon series, completely lost its way. While there were some good buddy movies out there, the vast majority were absolutely terrible. Midnight Run is an example of a better buddy movie, thanks in no small part to the calibre of acting on offer.Although the concept of the buddy movie is fundamentally simple, the plot of Midnight Run is, in fact, rather complex. A burned out police officer who wouldn't get on the take, played with aplomb by Robert De Niro, makes his living by hunting down felons who have skipped bail. In his latest escapade, Joe Pantoliano promises him a hundred thousand dollars to catch Charles Grodin and return him to Los Angeles within a few days. Grodin is due to testify against a mob boss portrayed by Dennis Farina. By a strange coincidence, De Niro was chased out of the Chicago police force by Farina. Farina sends many a hit-man after Grodin, all to no avail. When things start to go south, Pantoliano sends John Ashton to protect his substantial investment.It sounds a lot more complicated than it really is. Most of the film revolves around interaction between De Niro and Grodin, who exchange insults and insights throughout the two hours. It is just as well that they cast such capable actors in these lead roles, because the entire film pretty much rests on their shoulders. Sure, Yaphet Kotto gets in some good screen time as a federal agent De Niro impersonates to get his quarry further along the line, but for seventy-five percent of the running time, it is all about these two.The take for this particular film was rather modest. Estimated to have cost thirty million to make, it took in some thirty-eight at the box office. Film studios must be thanking their stars for the rental business, as many films have become profitable on the back of rentals. Midnight Run, earning another eighteen million at the rental outlets, was one of them. However, when you get right down to it, Midnight Run deserved a lot more. It cost about half as much to make as the third Rambo film, and the results are far more entertaining.If there is one complaint about the film, it is that the film could have done with being a little shorter. Towards the end, the chase gets more and more predictable. It is only because of the leads that the film remains interesting in spite of this. As the chase sequences become more predictable, the chemistry between them becomes more complex and interesting. Indeed, it is a real credit to Grodin, and De Niro in part, that he continues to whine throughout eighty percent of his screen time without becoming irritating. Indeed, very few members of the cast seem less than three-dimensional, thanks to some quick and clever fill-ins with the dialogue. Unfortunately, as the final parts begin to roll, the feeling that the magic is dying out cannot be avoided.I gave Midnight Run an eight out of ten. It's not a great masterpiece, and it isn't going to radically alter one's perspective on life. It is, on the other hand, one of the most entertaining buddy films you'll ever see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flaws do make a Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If everything but the flaws is actually perfect.Some comments about Midnight Run point out certain short-comings regarding story and acting. To get this out of the way: Yes the story is very high-concept and yes some of the acting is more suitable than maybe highly inspired. But Midnight Run is and always will be a milestone within it's own genre. Because the directing, the pacing of the script and even the banter between DeNiro and Grodin are top notch. Because whether be it the screenplay, the directing, acting, you name it, nothing is here for the sake of itself but to serve the story and the characters. How about that for non-egotistical filmmaking!Screenwriter William Goldman ("Misery", "All the Presidents Man", brilliant, "Dreamcatcher", "The Ghost and the Darkness", miserable) once said that directing great entertainment is a lot harder than directing drama. After being confronted with the challenge of writing substantial entertainment, which lies beyond the toilet humor and explosions, I came to realize how truly hard it is to maintain a lighter note in a story and still grab the attention and the hearts of an audience. George Gallo's partly flawed, and because of it even classier script serves as a constant reminder how brilliant popular entertainment can be, especially if you don't notice that your being entertained, and, after all the travails the characters go through in Midnight Run, how absolutely touching it finally is.Bounty hunters or collection agents weren't (and still aren't) a large part of the mainstream storytelling, which makes this tale of a desperate bounty hunter who's paired with a tender good-natured accountant who robbed the mob out of 15 million dollars, all the more gripping.It may be just another version of the "Buddy-Movie" formula, but oh what a version it is. The humor works true magic, and the truthful moments keep the magic alive. Martin Brest managed what doesn't seem to be allowed anymore. A witty, action-adventure with a big heart. Maybe that's why he made "Gigli", but even for a hundred train-wrecks of this sort, no one can take this wonderful movie from him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slick escapist entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the liveliest action adventures of the late 1980s demonstrates how a big commercial blockbuster doesn't need to sacrifice brains for box office appeal, and proves again how even the most routine formula can be revitalized by superior acting and writing. In a rare display (at the time) of his comic talents Robert De Niro plays a veteran bounty hunter hired to deliver unwilling, upscale criminal philanthropist Charles Grodin from New York to Los Angeles in five days, with three sets of adversaries on his heels: the FBI, the Mafia, and a rival bounty hunter. The tightly plotted cross-country chase takes the mismatched pair from the frying pan to the fire and back again; add a little pathos, a few car crashes, and a good deal of profanity, and the result is slick escapist entertainment with just enough street-smarts to give it credibility. De Niro and Grodin are on center stage throughout most of the film, which works in large part precisely because of their conflicting temperaments, balancing De Niro's instinct for action against Grodin's patented, deadpan reactions. It's an unlikely but effective combination of talent, and despite all the noise and gunfire almost enough to restore one's faith in Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Run is a success story on multiple levels. It's funny, brilliantly paced, full of some nice dialogue and really creates an atmosphere of luck and chance. Although Midnight Run has these things going for it, it'll often use them in a way that is frustrating ? merely to further and turn the situation around so that the hero character of Jack Walsh (De Niro) is able to get out of a tough situation.Midnight Run will often submit to flaws that seem to plague films from the 1980s (at least the ones I've seen) and these come in the form of tired dialogue and silly plot twists. After going through a list of phobias that he has; Walsh states to Jonathan (Grodin) that in a minute, he'll have 'fisto-phobia'. I can only assume fisto-phobia is the fear of getting punched in which case Jonathan already has it as do we all anyway. The character of Eddie Moscone (Pantoliano) is also reduced to one of those shouty shady characters who screams profanity down the phone whether he's happy or not. Along with the lack of consistent dialogue is the plot twists as I mentioned. I wasn't entirely sure of how the climax came about but all that I do know is that one minute Walsh is in custody and the next seemingly on his way to riches as he works with the police in trapping another character. How he went from position to position is still a little puzzling but this is what the film does; it turns the plot around just when Walsh needs it to.Along with this, further evidence happens during the film's first and second third. No, I do not think that a train attendant would have the list of every single passenger and their room number easily at hand; no, I do not think that Jack would sleep with his cabin's door unlocked; no, I do not think that his ex-wife would be so understanding after he turns up for the first time in nine years especially since I bet her police captain husband would have something to say when he discovers her aiding and abetting a fugitive. These are all really unrealistic things that pop up during Midnight Run and they do ruin the overall experience. You can't really let the film get away with it, can you? Apart from these inconsistent things, Midnight Run is still highly enjoyable and remains quite clever at times. There are frequent occurrences where small, simple things are done in a manner that makes them seem so much more complicated. Walsh shoots the rear blade of a helicopter causing it to twirl round and explode when really he just needed to shoot the sniper that was sticking out of the side. Another scene is where a character loses control of a car yet can't keep it on the road well enough even though there was a clear track ahead of him as a truck approached ? the script opts for the more dramatic option by having the car chorea off down a sandy hill and into trouble. Further examples happen near the end when multiple police cars fly all over the place whilst chasing down Walsh in a car. Lucky he was in a 4x4, eh? The film is definitely enjoyable but several little things let it down just when you start to enjoy yourself. I never took Jonathan as a criminal for one second and he's clearly too smart to have done what he did: steal millions from a mob boss and give it to charity. The film also comes a little too close to farcical yet retains sensible humour for most of the time. The sequence where Jack and Jonathan rob the diner is funny as is the helicopter chase but Midnight Run still comes close to farce; namely when the police cars are chasing Jack and the little exchange on board the rickety old bi-plane.Most of the time, Midnight Run will feel like a cross between 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' and an Auto Trader magazine advertisement but it does work. The film has heart as evident in the scene when Walsh visits his family (although the motivation is a little unexplained) and the ending gives us a feeling that these characters really have gone on a journey and consequently grown. Midnight Run is fast with the right blend of action and humour but don't expect too much in the form of brains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midnight Run starts in Los Angeles where ex-Chicago cop Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) works as a bounty hunter looking for &amp; capturing criminals who have jumped bail &amp; then collect the reward from bondsman Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano), Jack doesn't like it but it's a living. Eddie ask's Jack to find ex-accountant Jonathan 'the Duke' Mardukas (Charles Grodin) who stole fifteen million dollars from a Las Vegas mobster named Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina) &amp; has run out on Eddie owing him $450,000 in bail money. Eddie needs the Duke back within five days, Jack accepts the job &amp; finds the Duke in New York but getting him back to Los Angeles turns out to more difficult than Jack had thought with the FBI, gangsters &amp; rival bounty hunters on their tails...Produced &amp; directed by Martin Brest (who also has a small cameo in the film as the Airline ticket clerk at Las Vegas) I notice that Midnight Run seems to be a very popular film which I can't relate to at all, in fact I think it's average at best &amp; boring rubbish at worst. The script by George Gallo takes the buddy buddy mismatched partners thrown into some comedy crime caper action thriller template &amp; turns it into a staggeringly uneventful two hours. I am sorry but to me the vast majority of Midnight Run is just bland chit chat between Walsh &amp; the Duke as lots of other interested parties chase them across America. A lot of films use the whole mismatched partner thing &amp; use it to create tensions, be it racial tension as in Lethal Weapon (1987) or class tension as in Tango &amp; Cash (1989) &amp; here in Midnight Run it's the whole criminal vs lawman type tensions. The action scenes are poor &amp; don't live too long in the memory. The script also likes to throw in profanity at every opportunity just for the hell of it, it seems almost every second word is a swear word &amp; while I have nothing against profanity the sheer amount of it in Midnight Run smacks of swearing for swearing's sake. The character's are also poor, we hardly ever find anything out about the Duke, Walsh comes across better but then it's clichés all the way with the typical Las Vegas mobster, the FBI man who Walsh manages to stay one step ahead of all the time &amp; the rival bounty hunter who just can't quite get the better of Walsh. With lots of people chasing around after each I was expecting some sort of huge climax but even that is low key &amp; forgettable. Also I thought Walsh tracked the Duke down rather easily, I mean the FBI couldn't find him, Las Vegas gangsters couldn't find him but little old Jack Walsh could. In the space of a single day too.Director Brest was obviously hired by Paramount to make another comedy action thriller in the vein of his previous film Beverly Hills Cop (1984), which coincidentally also contains a foul mouthed cop character, &amp; wanted to cast Cher as Mardukas, &amp; then Robin Williams but Brest hired Grodin against the studios wishes &amp; Paramount dropped the film with Universal then stepping in to take over production. Apparently Bruce Willis was considered for the Mardukas role but was turned down &amp; as such he went on to make Die Hard (1988), both films opened on the same weekend &amp; it's fair to say Willis would have the last laugh. The action scenes really are forgettable, there's a crashing helicopter, an average car chase &amp; that's it.With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 Midnight Run is well made for what it is but most of it is rather talky for my tastes. The acting is alright, De Niro is just a fine actor anyway but I thought Grodin was poor &amp; uncharismatic.Midnight Run is an average buddy buddy mismatched partner type comedy crime caper, I can't say I hated it but I can't say I loved it either. Followed by three made-for-telly sequels, Another Midnight Run (1994), Midnight Runaround (1994) &amp; Midnight Run for Your Life (1994).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is excellent quality entertainment. It's cleverly written, with lots of side-plots and characters that all add to the fun and comedy of the movie.It's definitely true that the movie side-plots and character do tend to make the movie its plot unnecessary difficult to follow at times but all is forgiven really, since it are mostly that same side-plots and its characters in it that makes this movie perfectly good entertainment to watch.The movie is very well written and has a fun story, in which bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) has to get a former mafia accountant (Charles Grodin) to L.A., to the bail bonder (Joe Pantoliano), the accountant jumped bail from. During that travel, Jack and the accountant are being chased themselves as well, by the Mafia, the F.B.I., another bounty hunter and a couple of other characters that cross their path. Sounds complicated? Don't worry! This movie also works well and entertaining with your brain switched off. This is thanks to the fun characters and actors that portray them, the good comical sequences and excellent written dialog.In essence "Midnight Run" is another mismatched buddy movie, like so many were made of, back in the '80's. This movie is better and definitely more entertaining than most of those movies due to the fact that the comedy feels non-forced and the story itself seems more clever and well written.The power of this movie is also in its casting. Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are great together, mainly due to the fact that they are so different and really don't match. It makes the humor and interaction, also the more serious one, work out very well. Yaphet Kotto is also great in his role. He plays his character in a non-comedy way but his character, through it's seriousness, becomes very hilarious. I mean just the subtle thing, like the way he slams the door when he enters a room, is brilliant. Dennis Farina yet again plays a typical gangster role, like he can do best. Joe Pantoliano is also entertaining in an early role.The movie is well directed. Lots is happening in this movie, also with many different side-plots but the movie never strays away from its main plot. It makes the movie coherent and constant to watch, with a good quick pace. Too bad that with "Gigli" director Martin Brest threw away most of his credit as director.The movie is actually quite simple made. It doesn't feature an awful lot of action or complicated sequences. It makes "Midnight Run" a fun 'little movie' that offers some great entertainment. With all sequences shot on location, standard camera-work and a simple musical score.Fun, well made movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in Los Angeles going to school, to become a therapist. While there I lived in the home of an 86-year old, VERY proper lady. Every Sunday afternoon I'd take her to dinner and a movie. One week I took her to see Midnight Run, knowing nothing about it. As the movie progressed I slumped farther and farther down in my seat due to the constant use of the word "f***". Finally this 86-year old lady turned to me and said, "This should not have been called Midnight Run, but F*** Run." I relaxed and was able to enjoy the rest of the movie.It is a fun movie and Grodin and De Nero have good chemistry. Having seen it on TV with "f***" bleeped out, it seems that well over half the dialog has been bleeped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Schizophrenic, but a must see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midnight Run has every potential to be the best film ever made. It has a solid plot, a magnificent cast, superb dialog and a budget to back all this up. Unfortunately, it is directed by a schizophrenic named Martin Brest. I have no idea if Martin is actually insane or if he just acts like it, but it makes little difference as his movies all turn out the same: a good idea with good casting ruined by stupid decisions. He's like a mad scientist that builds a space ship, but then wants to fly it to Oregon to build an Indian casino.This is a frustrating movie as it is always so close to being brilliant, then *POW* out of nowhere, and for no reason, it will turn into the Dukes of Hazard. This is the only film I can think of that I would love to see remade with its original cast. For the latter it is a must see. I can't remember liking DeNiro more than I did in this film, Grodin gives the best performance of his career and is just fantastic, Farina is perfect, Joey Pants is hilarious (I love Pants in almost everything he does mostly because I get the feeling he's not really acting).When the movie works, it relies heavily on the talents of it's actors and the scripts great dialog. It's a very clever and smartly written comedy, but also a keen study of human emotions and relationships. This is probably at it's height in a heart wrenching scene between De Niro and his "abandoned" 14 year old daughter, a small part played perfectly by Danielle DuClos. The film rapidly deteriorates, however, every time it tries to pick up the action. Cue the goofy b-movie chase music, cue the bullets that just barely miss hundreds of times, cue the national guard sized force that just can't seem to get the job done. Cue dozens of eye rolling clichés and impossible escapes. Martin.... why? I firmly believe that if rather than the cartoonish action sequences, the film would have delved into a gritty, perhaps even frightening realism it could have been AFI top 100 material. The talent was certainly all there.There is no getting around the bad parts of this film, they are too intertwined to avoid, but do not let that stop you from seeing it. The scenes with De Niro and Grodin (et. al.) are so good it should be on everyone's must see list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My most favorite film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watch this film each time it appears on TV. One of DiNiro's best roles. Grodin and Khotto are also very good. It is a very funny movie with some action, which is also sometimes funny, and some suspense. Terrific film. You will not disappointed if you buy or rent it. DiNiro is a bounty hunter who has to travel cross country with his catch, Grodin, using a variety of modes of transportation and resources, while evading others who would like to get their hands on Grodin. Not a dull moment in the entire film and plenty of humor. Great dialogue.</fullReview>

DeNero is good but it's difficult to decide if he is playing a bumbler or a hard done by professional. Grodins' character is easier figure out and sympathise with.Considered 6/10 but in the end gave DeNero the benefit of the doubt and went for7/10 well worth watching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good afternoon in front of the tube flick. The script and direction are solid but the real key is the relationship of Walsh (Deniro) and Mardukas (Grodin). Together they explore the fine line between good and bad, and the gray area that exits between. Walsh provides the connection between the luridness of the underworld (though technically he is in the "right" as a bounty hunter) and the rectitude of Mardukas (though technically a "wanted criminal" he actually lives the more moral existence of the two). The incongruity provides the platform for funniness of the film. Also the other characters are well-acted and colorful. Good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the truth of late 80'e films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>generally i like to back up my opinion on my films with extensive knowledge on the actual makers but this one i have no idea, i just own and appreciate as a regular consumer rather than a film maker. All i can say is that it really reflects the style of films during the mid to late 80's and it is a "feel good movie" which everyone can understand and enjoy. It has a simple plot, with a simple journey. I guess what captured me most of the film was the scene where Jack Walsh's daughter is willing to give up her baby sitting money to help her semi-unknown father get out of a jam and it made me think how films used to be made. It definitely brought back the simplicity of earlier films where it wasnt based on special effects and abstract endings. And ofcourse the ending of the film was closed successfully. Although this film is mainly fiction, isnt that something you want after a while....? A plain out escape from what were used to that ends with a smile?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't very well known,very undeservedly might I add.I had a bummer of a time to find it in my video store.Anyway,it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I have to admit, I love Robert DeNiro. He is the (arguably) greatest actor still making movies. But DeNiro's performance is not what carries the movie. In fact,even without him,the movie might have still been potent. But with him, it becomes an excellent movie. It is a action/comedy road movie. Now,knowing DeNiro's past,this movie could have been extremely violent. But,it's not. There is actually very little violence to speak of. That does not mean thatt it doesn't make a good action movie.The movie never,ever stops being funny and never slows down from its breakneck speed. The dialogue sparkles,the action scenes are entertaining,the performances are top notch. You can't ask for much more. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Street-tough bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) is a former Chicago cop. Bondsman Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) needs his help. Mob accountant Jonathan Mardukas (Charles Grodin) is on the run and Moscone is out $450k unless Walsh brings him back. Moscone insists that it's an easy Midnight Run. Mardukas had stolen $15M from mobster Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina). Walsh had a history with Serrano. FBI agent Alonzo Mosely (Yaphet Kotto) is also after Mardukas and doesn't want Walsh getting in the way. Walsh steals Mosely's ID. When Walsh finds Mardukas, the mob, the FBI and fellow bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton) come after the prize.Charles Grodin is more annoying than funny. It's fine line that he's walking. He just needs to be a little lighter and nicer. He does have a fun comic chemistry with De Niro. Sometimes it's funny. It is a good wild ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Midnight Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like a good cop movie, and that it what I assumed this was, I wasn't far off, but I was watching regardless of whatever because of the leading star in it, from director Martin Brest (Beverly Hills Cop, Scent of a Woman, Meet Joe Black). Basically Jack Walsh (Golden Globe nominated Robert De Niro) used to be a cop in Chicago, before he was framed by a criminal he was after, he now makes a living as a bounty hunter in Los Angeles, i.e. bringing in people for arrest. Bail bondsman Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) wants him to bring in Jonathan Mardukas aka 'The Duke' (Beethoven's Charles Grodin), an accountant who embezzled $15 million from Las Vegas mobster Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina), and if Moscone doesn't get him back within five days he loses the bond he gave to Mardukas and he loses his business. This is obviously the "midnight run" of the title, but of course it is no easy journey as Jack is forced to take Jonathan by car and train, as the accountant has a fear of flying. As they travel using various land transports they realise they are being pursued, by two sides, the cops and FBI who are after Jack to get to his boss, and the gangsters after Jonathan for his swindling. Jack has demanded $100,000 for this job, but Moscone is getting increasingly irritated that he is not arriving on the deadline they originally planned, and that time is running out, so he has sent rival bounty hunter to Jack, Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton). Dorfler does manage to cancel the card Jack uses to pay and get around, making the journey even more difficult to continue with lack of cash, but they just about get by, thanks to Jonathan's clever conning, and the fact that they have a police badge to use. Jonathan does try a couple of times to escape, but slowly he finds empathy and friendship with Jack, who even though grouchy and uninterested in conversation with him does seem to slowly like him as well. Jack reveals he plans to retire after this last job so that he can open his own coffee shop, and the two men on the run do get to know each other well enough to trust each other in the chase and very close call situations. In the end, after some complications, the gangsters caught, and the FBI and police, led by Alonzo Mosely (Yaphet Kotto), the man Jack has been impersonating constantly, allowing them to go, Jack does get Jonathan to Los Angeles, but he lets him go, and Jonathan leaves Jack with $300,000 from the money he stole. Also starring Richard Foronjy as Tony Darvo, Robert Miranda as Joey, Jack Kehoe as Jerry Geisler and Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Sidney. De Niro is good being the moody, swearing bounty hunter, Grodin gets many giggles as the simple but often helpful man he is taking, and the supporting stars do their bits as well, it works as both a bickering eventually liking buddy movie and a road trip movie, and there are plenty of action and funny moments to keep you watching, a fun comedy thriller. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent Midnight Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favourite 'feel-good' movie of all time - if only because of the farewell scene (one of the most moving I know) between De Niro and Grodin.Jack (De Niro)has just concluded a phone call to his cheating bail bondsman Eddie Moscone by telling him that he's got his quarry and now ...'I'm letting him go...' Eddie's howls of chagrin are cut off as Jack hangs up.Mardukas: (with a gratitude almost beyond words)'Oh ... Thanks!' Jack 'No, Thank YOU!' (i.e. for the lessons he's learnt from the Duke about being human) He concludes '.. See you in the next life.' 'Mardukas (mumbling) '...in the next life.' Other than that, the issue of Jack's wife Gail's betrayal of him by (having presumably divorced Jack) marrying the crooked cop instrumental in framing Jack is a funny one. Partly because Jack has been not a nice, convenient, 'supportive' husband, the movie itself appears (using "critics' shorthand") to 'like' Gail, at a guess because she's had to put up with his (at worst irritating) behaviour. But we've all been powerfully schooled in PC - by popular culture in general and the movies in particular - to take the side of the woman;- as I think the movie itself must be (tongue-in-cheek) aware.One message board poster somewhere complains of the 'ease' with which people get knocked out in the movie. Nonsense - it's the reverse; it's the ease with which they recover from being e.g. hit full force in the face by a rifle butt and come up not much later not showing a mark.Last line (from De Niro, as a taxi driver refuses to take him since all he has is a $1000 bill): 'Looks like I'm walking!' And of course the subtext is that 'walking' means 'free' to go - on with his new life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, But Not the Great Film Some Make It Out to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert DeNiro) is enlisted by bail bondsman Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) to bring accountant Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas (Charles Grodin) back to L.A.I want to call your attention to this: The film's score was composed by Danny Elfman, with the album released by MCA Records. I have to give Elfman a lot of credit. His scores are always good, and usually they are very distinctive. His work for Tim Burton stands out as some of the most iconic music of the 20th century. And this was so different from that, you might never guess it was Elfman.The film itself is good. The mix of cops, bounty hunters, the mob, and all that makes for a good story. Any story of one group chasing another is a good story, and the more you mix in the better. But of all the crime tales out there, this one is not as great as some make it out to be. And as far as "action comedies", when compared to director Martin Brest's last film ("Beverly Hills Cop"), this is something of a dud.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of "Midnight Run"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Martin Brest presents "Midnight Run" the story of a bounty hunter (DeNiro) who is offered $100,000 to transport a convicted felon (Grodin) across the country. Now I initially heard about this movie through my Father. He loved the film and I can honestly say that I liked it too. The comedy was simple, but it's still funny. The funniest part of the entire movie though was the chemistry between Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin. The two really developed a thick love- hate relationship that really was the masterstroke of everything this film had to offer. The dialogue was pretty good, the story was rather original, the camera-work was clean, and the soundtrack was decent (In all it's 80's glory) . I'd say that "Midnight Run" was a fun time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like De Niro and Grodin, this is definitely the film for you to enjoy. These two actors can do some very fancy and quick speaking lines back and forth with each other that will make you laugh. Along with some very deep thoughts which are tossed around by both of them, and a very sad scene facing his daughter after many years absence. Robert DeNiro,(Jack Walsh),"Heat",was an ex-cop who had a rough time and had not seen his wife or daughter for nine years and has the task of trying to transport Charles Grodin,(Jonathan Mardukas),"Beethoven",'92, to Los Angles by a certain date and time. Naturally there are bondsmen involved and Mob guys who do some very comical mistakes trying to catch Jonathan Mardukas. There are car chases, railroad freight car rides, and even a brief duster plane along with many many different types of cars. This is a very Classic film and worth seeing over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Disappointing, But Still Worth Seeing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Martin Brest's comedy "Midnight Run" was a pretty big disappointment for me. I had heard a lot of good things about it--but in the end I was very disappointed.It involves bounty hunter Robert De Niro going on a mission for loan shark Joe Pantoliano. A man who took a loan from Joey never paid him back, and now he's stolen millions from a mafia boss. De Niro's mission is to bring him in to Pantoliano for a large fee. So De Niro goes and finds Charles Grodin, the man with all the stolen cash, and slaps some handcuffs on him. But it's getting him back that will be the tough part. Grodin doesn't fly. Nor does he like small spaces. He's a paranoid yet calm little freak who single-handedly begins to drive De Niro crazy.And now, with time running out, Pantoliano has sent out another bounty hunter to find De Niro and Grodin and bring them both in."Midnight Run" has one main problem: it moves slow. I mean, the plot moves quick, but once De Niro finds Grodin it starts to move very slowly. Then it turns from loose comedy to slapstick--in a matter of minutes. One second the film is throwing small gags around, then there's one scene where they are being chased into a river and it's pure slapstick.And are we to believe that the ending can be wrapped up so typically?I caught this movie on TV a while back, and while the movie isn't bad--it is pretty good-- I thought it was going to be great. That's why, for me, it was a pretty big disappointment. I'm a big fan of both De Niro, Grodin, and I even like Joe Pantoliano, better known for his roles in "The Fugitive," "Memento" and "The Matrix." But I didn't see a big spark of chemistry between De Niro and Grodin here. The film could have played for many more gags involving the two, but it seems that after the train ride in the beginning the director has decided, "We've spent enough time on character contrast--onto the action!" This movie would have been a lot better if Grodin had been a bit more talkative, if De Niro had responded a bit more, and if they had better dialogue for the actors. The train scene itself seems wandering.Perhaps next time I see this movie I'll enjoy it more, but the first time was a pretty disappointing ride.3/5 stars--John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd Couple evading capture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although overly long and having a contrived and predictable plot, this film succeeds due to its witty dialogue and the genuine 'odd couple' relationship between the hardbitten Walsh (de Niro) and the pedantic Duke (Grodin). The semi-improvisatory nature of their exchanges is delightful at times. The relationship between Walsh and his daughter, although only momentarily touched upon, is actually touching and perhaps more could have been made of it.I personally think that they could have reined in the f-laden language somewhat; it is out of place in a cartoonish film like this. Some editing would have been beneficial too, especially in the final third. It has to be said that it runs of steam sometime before midnight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impossible to dislike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>De Niro has, I think, a very funny, dry kind of persona when it comes to this kind of comedy. He's basically playing the same kind of character he later played in RONIN, but here he's doing it for laughs. It's a shame his talents are nowadays wasted in the likes of those awful MEET THE PARENTS sequels.This is a light-hearted gangster comedy, blessed with lightning pacing and a decent script for once. Although there's plenty of action and chase scenarios to move it along, there's always time put aside for characterisation, too. De Niro's tough, no-nonsense bounty hunter has a great foil in the quietly hilarious Charles Grodin, who I think gives the best performance here.Add in genuine laughs, ignore one or two plot contrivances, and enjoy other great turns from Yaphet Kotto as a tough FBI agent, Dennis Farina as a tough mob boss and John Ashton as a rival bounty hunter. Oh yeah, he's tough too. With all this you have one of the better buddy-buddy comedies out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bounty hunter Jack Walsh apprehends bail jumper Jonathan Mardukas and attempts to take him to the other side of America unaware a rival bounty hunter , the mob and the feds are on their tales The above premise is all there is to the plot as Jack and Johnathan escape their rivals and that`s to the movies benefit , no one tries too hard to disguise MIDNIGHT RUN as being anything more than aa enjoyable slice of commercial comedy thriller , Jack and Johnathan make a good double act mainly down to the character interaction and on screen performances . DeNiro at the time was a legend due to his roles in very memorable movies like TAXI DRIVER , RAGING BULL and ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA and I can remember thinking at the time why would he want to appear in such a commercial movie , but he`s not disappointing in what`s essentially a straight role . Such a pity he seems to confine himself to mediocre commercial movies these daysA word of warning though - Never watch a TV version of this movie because it ruins all the jokes , an example being " I`ve got two words for you - Shut the f**k up " which is transmitted on TV as " I`ve got two words for you - Shut up " which does kill the humour of the lines</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Martin Brest's 'Midnight Run' is a very funny and action-packed movie that will generally appeal to a wide range of audiences. Robert DeNiro is absolutely hysterical as the foul-mouthed, hard-boiled bounty hunter hired by his boss (played by The Sopranos' Joe Pantoliano) to bring back an accountant on the lam who ripped off the mob played by Charles Grodin (whose also very humorous in this). DeNiro and Grodin make a nice 'odd-couple' and both have very funny one-liners throughout the film when they argue or verbally abuse each other. The movie also stars John Ashton (Beverly Hills Cop, Breaking Away) , Dennis Farina (Law &amp; Order, Snatch) as the mob boss, Philip Seymour Hoffman (Magnolia, Detective Bookman from 'Seinfeld) as the mob boss' consigliere and Yaphet Kotto (Alien, Homocide) as the F.B.I. agent trying to capture DeNiro and Grodin before DeNiro gets Grodin back to his boss for a $100,000 reward. In conclusion, the 80s crime/adventure flick 'Midnight Run' isn't a great film, but it's a very enjoyable film. Rent it, you'll definitely enjoy it. Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro Elevates a Potentially Generic Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a few years removed from his most grizzled, death-rattle-serious work, Robert De Niro decides to go after some lighter fare for a change of pace and realizes it's not a bad fit. As an ex-cop bounty hunter with good intentions, De Niro takes a potentially flavorless role and shapes it into something deeper, adding personality and character where it's clear none was hinted in the script. Director Martin Brest deserves credit for allowing his cast the chance to ad-lib, as the film enjoys a much more honest, believable central relationship as a result. While the plot bears more than a passing resemblance to "Planes, Trains and Automobiles," it's more straight-laced than that and never completely steps across the line into full-on comedy, though it does test those boundaries once or twice. An overachieving, tenuous buddy film in the same vein as "48 HRS", it maintains a quick pace on a winding path without throwing its passengers.</fullReview>

Its as though he didn't want to do the movie in the first place. Very lack lusted performance. Charles Grodin. God I had never heard of him but he really annoyed me and i will never watch his movies again. He is dreadful.The partnership in De Niro and Grodin just does not work. Grodin would be better replaced by a quick witted spindly unpredictable looking character, not some slow repetitive dull bell end. They both have the comic timing of an anus.The FBI chasing them ...what are they up to in this.
