		<shortDescription>A masterpiece for this decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was mesmerized by this 7-hour long 1994 Hungarian film called "Satantango." Filmed entirely in black and white, director Bela Tarr has created some of the most stunning images I've seen on film. The opening shot, about 10 minutes long, is an enormous tracking shot following a herd of cows wandering through an otherwise desolate village. Then there's this 10-minute take of a window at dawn. Everything but the window is dark, then ever so slowly morning light brings the objects in the room into view, a character finally enters, peers out the window, then goes back to bed. There's a 5-minute tracking shot of two characters hurrying down the street in a horrendous wind while a veritable tornado of garbage and litter whirls about them. There's a stark, almost surreal woods strewn with fog. No take is less than a minute long, and there are about a dozen around 10 minutes. The average edited shot in a Hollywood film is less than 10 seconds. It's almost mind-boggling the logistical and practical difficulties of sustaining such long takes. In a great many, Tarr utilizes extensive camera movement. The camera tracks and weaves and gives you a sense of space found in few other films -- maybe those of a Welles, Ophuls, or Kubrick. The dance in the middle of the film from which the film takes its title is shown in one 10-minute take. It cuts away to a little girl watching the dance for a few minutes, then cuts back to the dance for another 10-minute take. And nothing about this sequence is boring. The eight actors in the scene carry on heartily. Another inspired shot has the camera revolving around seven sleeping characters while a narrator describes the dreams of each.The story concerns a group of poor villagers who gets conned by a smart talker who was once one of their own into giving up all their money to go live on a non-existent communal farm. The first 4-1/2 hours is made up of 5 "stories" from the perspective of different characters over the course of the same day. Some of the events in each story overlap, so you see them occur again and again, but each time from a different perspective since they occur in the context of a different character's life. It is not unlike what Tarantino does with a segment in "Jackie Brown," but whereas Tarantino's technique is tiresome because it is plot-related, Tarr's is a grand achievement in tone.The first story shows us Futaki, who while having an affair with Mrs. Schmid, finds out that her husband is planning to make off with the money that eight villagers have come into through one of conman Irimias's schemes. Then they both discover Irimias, who was thought to be dead, has returned to their village. The second story follows Irimias and his trying to evade trouble with the law. The third shows us a doctor who observes the other villagers and who writes down everything he experiences in journals that he keeps. The fourth has a young girl taking out her miseries in life on a cat and contemplates suicide. The fifth shows all the pertinent villagers gather together at a bar and drinking and dancing until they are all in a drunken stupor.Satantango is one of the grand achievements in cinema of this decade.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satantango (1994) **** Satantango, Bela Tarr's 1994 7.5 hour masterpiece is incredible first and foremost in that despite its length and multiple shots of literally nothing taking place it is never, I repeat, never boring. This is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen. Complied of only 150 shots, many of which last for over 10 minutes, Tarr and his cinematographer manage to create a hypnotic and beautiful depiction of a desolated communal farm in post-communism Hungary. The scenery is at once withered and ugly, yet compellingly beautiful. The land is muddy and the buildings are in shambles. There are two scenes where main characters walk with the camera following as multitudes of trash blow along with them in the wind, creating a somehow hypnotic effect.The film opens with literally a 10 minute shot following a herd of cows wandering through a seemingly rundown farm town. The camera makes what has to be one of the most incredible pans in cinematic history panning to the left for most of the ten minute scene. Who else but Bela Tarr would try such a thing; and who else but Bela Tarr could make it work so well.The film follows the people of the farm in essentially three sections. The first section begins by showing Futaki having an affair with Schmidt's wife. Schmidt we find out is planning to run away with the money the town has made over the past year but comes home and is confronted by Futaki who has suck out only to come right back and knock on the door. They hear that the smooth talking Irimias and his sidekick Patrina, who have been believed dead by the town, are on their way back to town. The other residents, who all plan to take their money and leave town, seem to be under the thumb of Irimias and after hearing of his return meet at the local pub and discuss what to do and wait nervously for Irimias's arrival.The scenes are broken down into 12 steps, such as in a Tango. Nearly all of which are connected in that we see what has already happened from another perspective. The first section as noted involves Schmidt and Futaki; the second and one of the most hypnotic in the film is of an overweight and frail doctor who sits in front of his window documenting the actions of the townspeople. He details how Futaki is slipping out of Schmidt's house, and then goes back in, a scene which we've already seen except this time it's from the window of the doctor's house. The doctor hulks around and then realizes he must leave his home to get more alcohol. Scenes go on like this weaving in out and out the story line from different points of view. The first third of the film deals with the realization of Irimias' return, and exposes the corruption of the citizen's capitalism by their greed. The second third is the post powerful. It documents a little girl who is conned by her brother and ignored by her mother. The only thing she has power over is her cat, and in order to feel that superiority she tortures and poisons the cat. I will not reveal how, but this section turns to tragedy which will be exploited by the smooth talking Irimias.The final third deals with the corruption of Irimias's communist plan for the farm. He convinces them to give him the power and all the money that has been saved up only to con them. This section is brooding with satire, as is the first in some ways, and has shades of Orwell's animal farm ? the dumb and obedient townspeople conned into subjugation by the charming Irimias.Essentially, Satantango is a 2 hour movie shown without its cuts bringing it to 7.5 hours. The film never uses its drawn out scenes to further the narrative, but neither does it use them for simply aesthetic purposes either. The film's length and incredibly long shots seem to be rubbing the atmosphere right in our nose. Many shots have the camera move, raising and weaving and circling defining space like no other film. Some of the extended scenes are incredibly funny in bizarre ways, such as an extended dance seen (from which the film gets its title) where the villagers get drunk waiting for Irimias and Patrina, dancing to accordion music while the little girl peers in through the window; and another scene that circles the room while two officers dictate and type out Irimias's statement, cleverly changing vulgar statements (which I found hilarious) and in the middle of it all, sitting down and having a snack in real time! These scenes sound perhaps boring, but somehow Tarr makes them seem riveting and when they end it's almost sad to see it. Another incredible extended sequence sees the camera facing down at the sleeping villagers circling them ever so slowing as a narrator describes their dreams.Satantango is a film like no other. Its scope is breathtaking and its style is beautifully crafted. Tarr's films are almost like ballets: the camera moves always gracefully and in ways that we would only imagine that a cut was necessary, never faltering and always creating incredibly beautiful dances, and they set a mood perhaps better than anyone else. Satantango is Tarr's masterwork, epic in every sense of the word. If you get the chance to see this one, do yourself a favor and experience all 7 and a half hours of its majestic and drab atmosphere. Satantango is film for the sake of film and art for the sake of art.4/4</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly eight hours of pure bliss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite film of all time and its such a pity that it gets screened so rarely, but who can blame the cinemas as not too many people are prepared to take Tarr's advice and call in sick in order to spend eight hours at the movies instead of going to work. Also, I reckon this is one of the very few films you actually have to see on a big screen, so even if it was available on DVD, it wouldn't do much good. I've seen it three times so far and I got blown away every single time. So I really urge you to give it a go if this epic masterpiece comes anywhere near you. First time I saw it was on the Berlin Film Festival in 94 and I have to admit I wasn't really prepared to sit through the whole thing, but after three hours I was completely hooked and when the credits finally rolled in, I was rather sad that it was over. I would have liked to spend another few hours in this strange and compelling world. OK, the plot in itself is kinda depressing and bearing in mind that it runs for so many hours, not that much happens, but to complain about the absence of jolly dialog and action packed stunts would be completely beside the point. You just have to be willing to go along with Tarr's approach and once you accept that storytelling here is a bit different to what you are used to, the whole thing it is more exciting, entertaining and gripping than everything you've ever seen. Tarr's main achievement in my view is that he creates a completely new form of imagery and its so utterly convincing that I still wonder why it never caught on big time. Instead of editing the takes into a scene during post production, he shots almost everything in one go with the help of a steady cam. As the takes are as long as 7 minutes (just a spirited guess, I never timed them) and involve occasionally more than 9 actors its just utterly amazing how Tarr choreographs actors and camera in a way that it seems perfectly natural and you get to see exactly what you need to see. Well its pretty hard to explain if you haven't seen it as it really is so different from everything else. What can I tell you? Every single frame is aesthetically a revelation, thus making this an utter delight from start to finish. I could harp on endlessly about why I love this film so much. About the absolutely convincing atmosphere, the great acting, the inventive use of lighting, how the story unfolds, the subtle use of humor, but as it is with all great love affairs, words fail to even hint at the magnificence of Sátántangó. Go, see and believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful 7.5 hour black and white film of muddy country side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at a Bela Taar festival and I remember it having 3 or 4 breaks because it was so long. But it was worth it. I am constantly remembering the images from this piece, I don´t even remember the exact story, but the images, the sequences, were just lovely. If you ever have a chance to see this film projected, take it. Don´t worry if you can´t sit through the whole thing, just see some of it, you won´t forget it. Marvelous long takes, wonderful characters. That first scene with the tracking shot of the cows and the two guys walking down the street with the garbage blowing in the wind around them. Wonderful black and white film. I advise all cat lovers to stay away. Bela Taar is one of the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A short movie which lasts 7.5 hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movies I've seen, as the film is not boring and tiring during more than seven hours. The beautiful long shots about this deserted country-side and it's people are so rich, that they crucially contribute to the understanding of the story. When we see somebody walking for ten minutes in the forest we have the possibility to know all his/her life. In order to understand the plot it's not enough to listen to dialogues and pay attention to the classical narrative elements. You have to contemplate and study every image, the gestures, the cloth, the environment. The long shots allow also us also to include in the film's perception our own experiences of the world. We understand the events based on our own experiences: we have the time to remember what is it like walking in mud, touching a cat, etc. If you let yourself taught by director Béla Tarr, your perception will change in 1 or 2 hours, and you will be able to feel and understand images much more deeper than before. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It grows!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw SATANTANGO about ten years ago. At that time, I found it impressive, but quite an ordeal to sit through. But then, years later, I realized I kept thinking back to the images and rhythms of this film. It grows. I also saw other very long movies with very long takes, like TAIGA by Ulrike Ottinger (8 hours) and FROST by Tarr's student Fred Kelemen (4 hours); they didn't work. SATANTANGO stayed with me, like two other films by Tarr, DAMNATION and WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES. Today I consider it as one of the greatest movie experiences I ever had. I do not know how Tarr pulls this off; his most effective takes often seem simple and straightforward. It must be magic. By the way, Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT uses similar techniques at times (long shots of people walking), and Van Sant acknowledged Tarr's influence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My name is George Zoes and I am the assistant director of Theo Angelopoulos, the famous director from Greece. I just finished watching the movie and I am in state of cinematic nirvana. I only thought Theo Angelopoulos had the secans shots but I was mistaken.Bela Tar knows what he is doing. For the people who are addicted to post modern cinema this movie would be a nervous breakdown. But for the people who love the power of images, who keep their minds open, who investigate the same art of cinema, its a miracle this film exists.The time games that Bela Tar plays with the shots from a different angle are unique and the atmosphere that he creates conviced me that this is a parrarel universe rather than a cinema story. Its a purgative cinema that personally gave me trust to make my own feature film. The visual story seems greater than the written one but its not. I have the feeling that this form is the most suitable for this content. Its like the flesh and the blood, you cant distinguish them.Thank you Bela Tar and to your screenwriter.I am ready to leave Theo to work with you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tantric Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really is no way to evaluate this film without assessing it as a 7 1/2 hour death trudge. The runtime is the purpose of the film and Bela Tarr knows it. There really is no way to spoil this film because it barely has a plot and does its best to divert itself from it once it gets going. Even if you know the sort of repetitious psychological torture you're about to subject yourself to you still have to endure it.Although I certainly took it as a tantric cinematic experience, I won't say that I enjoyed it nor that I particularly expected to enjoy it. So far as I know nobody has ever been forced to sit through this film Clockwork Orange style. As a voluntary experience the film is just a method for the audience to confront its own masochism and the dreariness of its existence.That said, I think that in the 7 hours I spent watching it (about 25 minutes were lost due to it being a Pal conversion and running imperceptibly faster than usual) maybe 2 1/2 hours were brilliant. Of course, I can't assess whether those moments of brilliance coming later on in the film were actually brilliant or of I had just begun to submit to the film the way interrogation subjects start to crack after sleep deprivation.The film has some very strong suits, namely the cinematography and setting. There were some moments where I laughed more than I had ever laughed in a film but I think that might have just been from cracking under pressure. I did think the last shot was perfect, although it would have been better without the final voice over.Also, the one game that I played throughout the film that kept me going was "Which Andrei Tarkovsky film does this most resemble?" While I do think that Bela Tarr has certainly championed his own form of patent miserablism, I did notice about eight shots (amounting to about an hour of the film if not more) that looked entirely cribbed from Tarkovsky's repertoire. Maybe someday I'll edit out the Tarkovsky film located within this film and see if I can pass it off on anyone unfamiliar with Tarr.That said, I'm... happy(???) that I sat through the whole thing, if only because afterward I got to go for a nice long bike ride and enjoy the fact that the world is in color and I don't live in a post communist society. Maybe that's how Albert Hoffmann felt.I will say that I was disappointed in the film. Although that's kind of like being disappointed with the melody in a John Cage piece. I really loved Werckmeister Harmonies but I despised Damnation. This one falls pretty evenly between the two, it just happens to fall from space, burn up on re-entry and take seven hours to hit the ground.In the end the audience only has the same thing to hold on to as the characters living in these miserable conditions; that they endured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beginner's guide to Satantango</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Goaded on by curiosity, I saw SATANTANGO at the Pacific Film Archive several years ago. Critics gushed that SATANTANGO was without parallel - but two hours into the movie, I was less than impressed. Very little plot. Black and gray photography. Segments that went on seemingly forever, with no clear point. Much of the audience filed out early, and I left early, too. Was the director, Bela Tarr, trying to make the film an endurance contest? More recently, I consulted the Internet Movie Database to see what was written about SATANTANGO. The cumulative rating of 8.5 of 10 was impressive, as were the write-ups. "A stunning experience," says one viewer. "Biggest cinematic experience in history," says another. The kudos go on and on. But if you scroll down the database, you'll also find the negative reviews. "Self- indulgent, annoying," one writer says. One of the more measured responses is, "I do not regret that I saw this movie, but I certainly to not think it was a day well-spent" - after giving the film a 1 of 10 rating. So, I decided to see the film again - this time on DVD - to determine if my initial dismissal at the PFA was warranted. And I learned how to appreciate a different kind of movie - and even come to enjoy it. My hints to a naive viewer:- Calibrate your attention span. The individual takes of SATANTANGO are unusually long; the first scene, set outside a pen for steers and chickens, lasts over eight minutes, with no cuts. Just a single tracking shot. This happens through the entire film; in fact, the long takes and slow tracking shots give the film its rhythm and style. If you go into SATANTANGO expecting a film paced to contemporary standards, you'll be disappointed. If you can, take a few breaks between segments - and ask questions.- Learn about recent European history. It's possible to enjoy SATANTANGO on its own merits, but understanding recent history helps greatly. The film dramatizes the economic depression that gripped the break-up of the Soviet blok, and things gone very bad, indeed. There's crumbling infrastructure everywhere. People struggle to get by, just barely, by depending on agricultural collectives (like the one depicted in SATANTANGO). This gray, depressing worldview would eventually engulf the region. - Structure, structure, structure. The key to appreciating SATANTANGO lies in understanding the film's structure. Another reviewer here aptly mentioned Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, wherein the film's narrative is defined by a single event - told in entirely different ways by the main characters. SATANTANGO uses a similar technique; several characters experience the same segment of time from different points of view. The eight-minute "preface" introduces us to the collective itself - where the barebones infrastructure is shown. From here, each segment of the film is separated by an inter-title; when a new segment starts, we see the same action - from a new character's POV. But nearly every segment involves leaving this wet, cold, impoverished piece of hell - or try to exploit it. - Dance "the Satantango." The musical segments can open the way to appreciating and even enjoying SATANTANGO. Music is important for Tarr, and the repeating figures of dance are a metaphor. The tango is a repeating dance that abides by the rule, "one step forward, two steps back." It's reflected in the lives of the characters, who take one step forward in their lives, but always end up two steps back. The "chapters" of the film don't move forward like a typical narrative work; it repeats the same segment of time, over and over again. If you're frustrated by the fact that the movie seems static - that's the point. SATANTANGO is a story that can't move forward; it repeats the same familiar song, over and over - until a development determines a new course of action for the characters.I didn't enjoy SATANTANGO when I saw it the first time, but I've since become a fan. The investment of time may seem extreme to some, but it's more than worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece by any measure, one of the deep, dark wonders of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's any proof of god, it's "Satantango", Tarr's impetuous yet melancholic, beautiful and sublime, unforgettable and dark, dark, dark masterpiece which is one of cinema's greatest treasures -- rich with darkness and wonder. At 7 hours long, it is as if it were life itself, and it really is, as everything -- tone, pace, tempo -- is in real time; essentially, it feels, and is, a tango. Tarr, again, demonstrates his mastery through the long take, as it beautifully portrays its subject and feelings of them. It's just such a film one can not even describe in words; it's simple art. This magnus opum of cinema has changed the value of that very term to me. Not many films can do that. I will never forget this film until the day I die, for "Satantango" should be a required viewing -- for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll take the middle of the road on this one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished the film. I watched it on DVD over a period of a few days. I refused to watch it all at once. I know some will criticize my method of viewing. I also know nobody in my social circle who would watch this with me. Sadly I am not able to talk about with this film with them so I came to this website yet again. I am not one of those people who are going to claim the film a masterpiece and the most amazing film I've ever seen. Nor am I going to be one of those people that call this film a boring self indulgent mess. I can see both sides and I think both opinions have some merit. I like art cinema but I too have limits. I didn't sit through an entire Tarkovsky film at a theater and I found David Lynch's Inland Empire excruciating. But I saw Werkmesiter Harmonies and I was so mesmerized that I had to check out Satantango. The movie is basically a series of beautifully stark and minimal black and white photographs that move. The heavy atmosphere is quite palpable and I appreciated visiting this world where no technology, cars, or plumbing exist (and when you see a static laden TV later in the film you will be startled by it's seemingly alien presence in this film's environment). I liked the score which was alternately eerie, pretty, and even zany. I was impressed by images of tumbling windswept litter, roaming cows in what appears to be an abandoned farm village (perhaps my favorite shot), the gradual emergence and gradual dimming of light, a stark journey by foot into darkness and rain by a character who seems to border on death more than once, and an owl spying on some sleeping newcomers. I also loved the same periods of time being revisited from different points of view. This film was indeed boring in places. Anyone telling you that they were not bored at all during this film is not an ordinary person. For the most part, the long tracking shots and real time pacing create a hypnotic effect or give you a heightened sense of really being in the "here and now" with the film but there were many scenes that were simply mundane (getting dressed, breaking for lunch, packing for a trip) or absurd (long silences with actors simply looking into each others eyes before finally speaking). Finally, I absolutely hated the cat torture scene which lasted much longer than I expected. I almost quit viewing the film as I felt privy to a feline snuff film. The director has told people that the cat did not really die and he actually owns the cat as a pet. Be that as it may, you will still be watching a vulnerable and innocent animal being brutalized for an extended period mind you and I can't abide by that. This part of the story was indeed one of the more fascinating elements but the treatment of this animal for the sake of the film was rather inhumane. I wish more people would criticize this directorial choice but many don't even bring it up. I'm glad I made it through the film. I wanted to test my patience. I wanted to meditate on the images and the unique sense of time. But I can't say that I was moved by the story or it's characters. It was a fascinating exercise for me and nothing more. I enjoyed Werckmeister Harmonies much more and consider it a superior but less ambitious film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in Tarr's version, humanity is sealing themselves into his all-consuming darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that features such powerful imagery, that years from now, after having seen this film, images will continue to circulate in our collective imaginations. Revealing very "mild spoilers," without giving away anything vital about the storyline, but only to suggest some of the powerful themes and imagery which interconnect throughout this 7 hour film, the opening sequence features cows fornicating in the mud and rain which renders no harm to anyone, and is in complete balance with nature, but then sequence after sequence of tortured souls reveals the unbalanced state of man that thrives on lies, deceit and treachery, believing in false icons, following false prophets, captured in the net of their own fear, like the image of the spiders weaving their tiny nets over the satantango dancers in the bar sequence, only to do it again night after night so that their delusions, and the hold this falseness has over them, reoccurs again every day just as sure as the sun rises......and the bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells......like Edgar Allan Poe, who knows who sounds the bells that captures the attention of our imaginations? What about Odysseus tied to the mast by his shipmates as he sails past the luring voices of the Sirens, whose sound is intoxicating, but is the key to luring unknowing sailors only to be eaten alive when they set foot on land... ...or like the false Prince in Tarr's most recent film, "Werckmeister Harmonies," who knows the source of evil? How many of us ever see the face? But we are lured by so many influences, not the least of which are the temptations of man so prominently featured in this film, the face of evil... ...fear, conspiracy, perdition, and all the many demons that live inside the human soul that perpetuate delusions of grandeur and evil, the evil that is human...SATANTANGO is a unique film experience requiring the audience to sit through the incredible duration and severity of this film, filled with unbelievably compelling images of bleakness and despair, literally holding the audience captive, sealed into the already darkened room of a movie theater. In Tarr's version, humanity, it seems, is sealing themselves into the same total darkness. In this film, there is no light, there is only rain and a consuming darkness, and in the distance, the sound of bells..."And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconventional, unique, devastating, beautiful - an enthralling dance with the devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The dance with the devil based on novelist László Krasznahorkai's novel about the aftermath of the fall of communism for sure has to rank very high up when it gets to unconventional motion pictures. Filmed in beautiful black and white by Hungarian director Béla Tarr in the early Nineties, the movie consists of twelve parts and lasts seven and a half hours with single tracking shots up to ten minutes, often with very little or only repetitive action on screen. And it rains and rains and rains. Make no mistake: Despite its length Satantango is not an epic narration, but rather achieves long lasting impressions by pointing the camera on banalities inspired by the bleakness of the scenery, perfectly enhanced by the director's choices what to show and how to show it in order to induce a trance-like reaction in the viewer. And while doing so Satantango mesmerizes, shocks, devastates, enthralls.The time line is a bit unclear and episodes overlap or could have happened the same way at another time. Yet there is a main thread of story about a con-man in the messiah's disguise, a seemingly eternally lasting dance in the very middle, and an essential episode about a little girl representing the core of the film - a symbol of the disillusionment and victim of betrayal, desperately searching for ways to exert some power herself in her forlorn reality. Not that much is happening in Satantango, and some things remain vague, but reality is also transcended at key points adding to the allegorical impact. The aesthetics of the experience and its ultimate conclusion will remain with those who are open for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bela Tarr's seven hour rambling film about the people in a collective in Hungary around the fall of communism.Its good but seeing this in what was a largely single marathon sitting was trying.It's got some wonderful segments and is good over all, but it's a long slog thanks to Tarr's style of long takes and shooting things like the table while action happens off screen. It's a good film and I intend on watching it again down the road, but I don't think I'll be able to sit for the 7 plus hours it took to watch this in one sitting the first time. I'll break it up by sections.Yes I know the length of the film should not come in to play,a good film is a good film, but at the same time this is a slow seven hours.Worth seeing but in bits and pieces</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest and most thought-provoking film in decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a 7 hour long film, whose long takes slowly start to creep under your skin and ultimately leaves you enchanted. In an almost abandoned village, the remaining villagers plot and scheme to get away with the money, but are all conned out of it by the false prophet Irimias. The story might appear to be about the end of communism or the exploitations of capitalism, but this is not the case. At the heart of this story lies the plight of a traumatized child (Estike) and an old recluse (Doctor). They are the true victims of a monstrous scheme which deprived them not of their money, but of their hope for a full, rich and human life and ultimately of their lives as such. What they were confronted with was a picture of a society in which cold, heartless human beings destroyed their own lives and those of others through their low-life plodding, drinking, fornicating - in short - through their unrelenting, drunken dance of Satan. It was this picture that killed them.What is perhaps most striking is the relation between this film and Tarkvosky's work. I think that, although this remains highly speculative, Tarr has taken up Tarkovsky's work as the thesis of a Hegelian dialectical triad. The thesis is the subjective, poetic and intimate splendor of a girl, Estike, sitting perfectly still with a purring a cat on her lap, a scene which lasts for minutes! So far Tarr's images are the offspring of Tarkovsky's work, although Tarr's long takes seem to capture the core of someone's existence with concrete textures in an almost sculpture-like way, whereas Tarkovsky's images seem to revolve entirely around their poetic nature. The antithesis however is the introduction of an ethical dimension: we learn that Estike is not only a deep girl who has an openness towards the sublime, but is actually a traumatized child with very very deep psychological problems, because we actually see her torturing and killing her cat and finally killing herself. Thus the poetic image is suddenly interrupted by an objective antithesis, although this ethical moment is also revealed as something which was always already present in the existential renderings of the film's characters: this is perhaps Tarr's critique of Tarkovsky! This ethical moment ultimately solidifies itself as a social and political moment, in that society's nihilism is identified as the cause of Estike's tragedy. However, the ethical, the social and the political are ultimately dismissed as one-sided, because the conduct of Irimias and the total abandonment of Doctor shows us that the ethical fate of society and the individual human being, cannot ultimately be determined by political means alone, but also demands a more radical transformation of man, perhaps an openness towards the sublime, which yields a synthesis between, the poetical, the intimate and the sublime with the ethical the social and the political. What is thoroughly un-Hegelian however, is the way in which Tarr ultimately sketches a very bleak picture of society, in which this synthesis is far from realized, and gives us nothing in the way of assurances that it is in fact realizable: on the contrary, it shows us only the dance of Satan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Instead of trying to present a coherent thesis, I'm going to make a few disconnected points. If I have a larger point, it's simply that there's a lot going on here, and the film resists easy categorization or any kind of didactic reduction.First, the film is very long. The extra time isn't used simply to put more stuff in -- it's used to change the way you look at what's going on. Normally in movies action is compressed, and you get a sort of unrealistically compressed summary of events. This is so common we don't even notice it or think about it.But here, we watch things slowly, at a pace that's much closer to real time. But it's still cinematic -- you can stare at someone, scrutinize them, without them looking back, or knowing you're there.This is kind of a heady experience when you watch the movie.Second, the film manages to pack a very powerful punch on a human level. The scenes with the little girl and the cat, trudging through the rain, are sort of terribly and holy at the same time. It's one of those scenes that stays with you forever.Third, it's not really clear, at least not to me, what it means. The film seems to be an allegory about the end of communism. But the story predates that historical event. I think it says things about politics and power that have enough validity to them that as history unfolded a few years later, it tended to run down the same tracks as the story in the film.It's kind of funny in parts, in a grim way.Every now and then you see a film that really stretches you out. This is one of those films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A promising outfit for a deceiving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarr has shown to be a quite talented director, just see "Werckmeister Harmonies" and you'll know why, he is famous for using extremely long shots, and with this film it's the apex of what his cinema has to offer: very long shots, beautiful landscapes, deep sadness and human's evilness. But unfortunately, "Sátántangó" had pretty much everything to be the so called masterpiece, but the film's idea is greater than the film itself, which is a shame. The film is build up like this: the characters by little start to connect with each other. It has many histories but the central one involves the comeback of a man who will try to create a better society using the money of the residents of the community. It's interesting what Tarr tries to do here and the concept is great, but the way Tarr made the film ended up making this a film that sometimes fells too short, other incredibly long. There are amazing things about this film which make it at least worth watching, for example the breathtaking cinematography and the incredible soundtrack (which sometimes are used with mastery by Tarr making some scenes that you can almost feel that you are in that place with those characters, but not most of the time), and some of the "sub stories" are very interesting both in concept and the way it's developed, but this is just a little bit of the film. In the beginning it doesn't sound exaggerated his use of long shots, but for a film that is seven hours long, soon or late the film will get boring, and when it does it becomes almost impossible to still watch it. One could say that he uses long shots so the viewer can pretty much "feel" that he is on that place with that people, it works sometimes but not most of the time. The characters come and go (most come back) but Tarr does not let the public to create empathy with pretty much all of them. The main problem of this film is not only that it has long (very long) length, but Tarr fools the audience with smart monologues, the beautiful landscape and the soundtrack, but when actually on the ground there is nothing too much complex about it. Tarr tries to point how community (not just from the film but in general) is corrupted and how people are evil, but besides the film's beautiful long shots, there is nothing too original about the film. You can admire Tarr for beautiful and heartbreaking moments he creates such as the Estike part (might be Tarr's greatest and most moving moment) and others you can despise him for using extremely long shots that after sometime starts to sound annoying and pretentious. And the same happens with most of the characters: in the beginning, you get that they are real human beings with a evil side just like everyone, but then after some hours that they start to get superficial and implausible, they start to sound only like human beings with no "good" side and only moved by greed and alcohol (I also wonder if one of the reasons why Tarr chosen to make this a seven hour film is that when the film shows some problem you won't notice that because or he is fooling the audience with the film's beautiful landscape or the viewer is already too much tired to notice any problem). Even thought Sátántangó can be the apex of Tarr's self indulgence it also can be a good exploration of how a community work, it is a haunting film, filled with great cinematography and some memorable dialogues and moments, and he does have a message to tell and sometimes he is able to tell it in a very good way, but his pretentiousness and distance won't help much, therefore, it is a film you can admire for wanting to say something "new" with a original touch by Tarr but himself does not allows the audience to admire it for other reasons that are emotionally related. A film that disguises itself as a film that has a lot to tell when actually it's ambition does not let it go too much far, a film filled with exaggerations (and I'm not just saying that only because of the time of the film but also because some "sub stories" does not sound necessary to the plot and it's not interesting to watch, and even if there is a message there, the boredom won't let see)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4th Dimension Of Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an exhaustive experience watching Sátántangó (and I completed my third viewing in only 6 months) because you feel like you have spent your entire life with these people.Despite the minimalism of the film, duly note that the minimalism is illusory - there were many ordinary images and sounds (which we take for granted but for the characters comprised their world) which are not normally accentuated in regular films but are given gratuitous attention by Tarr - the sounds you mentioned (coins on counter, clocks ticking, raindrops ticking, etc) and muddy cows, boggy landscapes, bare and broken tree limbs, benches, debris flowing forward in the wind, sideboards and cabinets, wooden floors, shot glasses, curtains, average faces, stormy skies, the blackness of night, etc.Every single frame is indeed exquisitely and virtuously photographed, the film is a visual Baroque Hymnal, a Baroque Requiem to fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.His flawless tracking shots, the film's plot structure, and the sequence of events, are all serpentine, cyclical, sequences within the film that begin at the ending and end at the beginning, sequences that intersect geometrically, sequences that have equal-but-reversed spatial, temporal, and narrational points of view.There is also a plot thread (girl-cat) that serves as a cycle within each half of the film (one cycle starts near the end and moves forward, the other cycle starts at the beginning and leads into the end), both sequences not only overlap, but act as mirrors to each other.By creating micro and macro spatial and temporal arrangements (which are based on the pattern if the tango) he literally founded the 4th dimension of cinema, something that Tarkovsky was trying to do and gave us glimpses of, he may have succeeded had he lived longer.The film is 10/10 profoundly challenging and lateral flight through time and space during which no time passes and you are consumed by exquisite photography of a drearily drenched cosmos filled with the rhythms of ticking clocks and pattering rain and whirring fans and clicking glasses, your skin feels rain-drenched, your shoes are all muddy, you danced all night, your mind and body are trapped in a tango pattern that walking on and on fails to escape, when you land, you miss the artistry of the debris in flight and the cigarette smoke and the light shining in during the most inactive empty moments and the characters' sardonic wit and the clamourous rant of the drunk man and the girl you want to smack for what she does to the cat, then you realize you forgot the doctor and you want to hear the bells in the steeple...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven hours that kept me completely glued to the screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SÁTÁNTAGÓ is a 1992 film by Béla Tarr that takes the Hungarian director's characteristic style to the extreme: this black and white production, based on an eponymous novel by László Krasznahorkai on the dissolution of a Hungarian collective farm in the 1980s, tells its story through a series of long takes, features little dialogue, and runs for over seven hours. While this kind of cinema is certainly not for everyone, if you have watched and enjoyed the longest films by Andrei Tarkovsky (namely ANDREI RUBLEV and STALKER), the director to whom Tarr is most often compared, then this is something for you.I invited some friends over to watch the SÁTÁNTAGÓ on my projector, expecting this to be a trial of endurance where we would give up well before the end. Instead, we were enthralled and watched the whole thing without the slightest complaint. The length of this film is a plus, not a minus, as it places the viewer into a hyper-aware state in which one comes to reflect deeply on the detailed world Tarr depicts. One reason that the film runs as long as it does is that Tarr depicts the same action over 24 hours from different characters' perspectives, so we revisit the events again and again, learning something new each time, and this keeps the suspense up.As the film opens, eight shareholders in a collective farm in rapidly-privatizing Hungary are waiting to get a large payout for the sale of their cattle, and they expect to then go their separate ways. These farmers are deeply flawed (aren't we all?) and intrigues abound. Some of them are already scheming to sneak away with the others' money. Others await the dissolution of their little community with dread: the collective's doctor, obese and alcoholic, is bound to starve without anyone to look after him, and the youngest child feels something evil is in the air. Enter the sinister figure of Irimiás, who had disappeared from the farm long before and was believed dead. He returns with mysterious links to the state, and the last third of the film sets the bickering farmers against the vast country in which they live. While Tarr has denied that he does allegory, his Krasznahorkai source material does seem linked to contemporary Hungary as much as the human experience in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the longest movie i have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is truly an art house movie, and i love art house movies, this entire film consists of the most unconventional long continuous takes i have ever seen, every take goes on for eternity, in a way i cannot help but admire. the characters are diverse by what we see, although some seem rather similar in terms of personality, their traits are different enough. but are we really watching this for the characters? no, we're in this for the visuals.every shot looks like it took days to set up, it really is no wonder it took three years to shoot. the movie is a style, it's a powerpoint presentation, if you want anything other than visuals then you'll find yourself in a bit of bother here, if you love action then i'm not entirely sure why you would even consider watching it. if you love camera work, visuals and art movies, you should check it out. surprisingly there isn't a whole lot to say about a movie that runs over 7 hours but there are two things i want to bring to light.first, the cat scene, i highly doubt this cat was actually injured or harmed in anyway, if they can train horses to fall over i'm pretty sure they can train cats to stay put when someone is rolling around with them, it doesn't appear to try and get away, the sounds of pain occur when we cannot see it's mouth, so the sounds could have been added later, and it seems very cal my for a cat that is apparently getting squeezed. i have enough trouble grooming my dog so i have to assume that cat torture is fake when the cat is very relaxed looking. camera trickery can do many wonderful things here people, and i really have a huge doubt this cat was hurt in anyway.secondly, the only problem i have with this movie is that, on disc three, there is a small section that actually began to get slow, in a movie like this, that's problem, but only a small one, i still recommend it to hipsters and art house fans.i'm really glad i watched it, maybe one day i will again, a long runtime unfortunately denies much room in life for a second viewing, i'm proud to own it and proud i watched it in one go. thank god for the intermissions otherwise i would have gone insane, apparently the director said it should be watched WITHOUT interruption, clearly he lost his mind a long time ago.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never-Ending Crescendo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Béla Tarr's "Sátántangó" (1994) for the first time in 2005 with a friend of mine, and ever since we've seen it annually on that day with a gathering of friends. Needless to say, it's a wonderful film just as it is a wonderful experience. An utterly gorgeous black-and-white cinematography and use of chiaroscuro, Tarr's brilliant remaining of László Krasznahorkai's novel is like reinventing time in cinematic terms. The first four hours are mystical, energetic, a seemingly never-ending crescendo of expectation and thrill. There the set-up is carefully planned, everything put in place, the environment made familiar to us and a slew of characters waltzed in front of us. Irimiás is our Iagoan, satanic genius, the man behind the arras, and his ghostly presence hovers over the mundane chores of the villagers and everything they do, and don't do.Having seen the film a dozen times, it always fizzles out a bit after Irimiás' brilliant monologue, which is a central showpiece of manipulative power. Then, unfortunately, the release after the four-hour crescendo fails to impress. It lags, seems to lose focus and meander aimlessly, just like its characters. The last thirty minutes, however, regain the film's majestic stamina: in fact, I think the last half an hour is poignant, chilling, and cinema filmed by Tarr, including the best of "Kárhozat" (1988) and the finale of "Werckmeister harmóniák" (2000).Films that are longer than usual often teach us a lot about ourselves as people. I, for one, find this one a lot easier to sit through than Tarr's swan song, "A torinói ló" (2011). "Sátántangó" is humorous just as it is bleak, but there's still life in it that is rekindled, whereas Tarr's last film approaches the heights of "King Lear" as the ultimate portrayal of emptiness.</fullReview>

Marvelous long takes, wonderful characters. That first scene with the tracking shot of the cows and the two guys walking down the street with the garbage blowing in the wind around them.

		<shortDescription>the probably biggest cinematic experience in history..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bela Tarr's film Satantango is indeed one of the visually most intense, beautiful, and hypnotic movie experiences in cinema. Not only does this film offer amazing cinematography, camera and technical skills, it also gives the audience one of the most fascinating, honest, and deepest character studies. Yes it is 7 hours long, but it does never feel stretched, boring, never-ending, or exaggerated. Ever single minute fits, every frame and every additional camera angle is necessary to provide this unique experience. The mind of the spectator very soon adapts to it's glacial movement, and even though some cuts are of unusual length, they are so subtly placed, so carefully directed, and so rich of details that it will hardly be realized, let alone feel long or boring. The film is set in a Hungarian village, in the 80s. It is one of those villages, which used to prosper, be rich, and have a very high status of social interactions before the onset of Communism. However, this film, as many describe or try to explain, is not about Communism, or politics. It is about humanity. For people who haven't experienced the changes Communism made, a prequel to this film would actually be quite handy. Those villages haven't always been poor, dark, and stripped of every hope for prosperity. This movie shows how the human mind and soul fall apart and get lost, practically parallel to the surroundings they are set in.Satantango is a film to be seen, witnessed, and felt. However, I do have to make clear that this film is indeed not for everyone. The audience for this film has to be ready to be very slowly, but very intensely be pulled into a place that seems to have lost every last bit of hope. To fully understand and appreciate the movie, it helps to have some ethnic knowledge on rural life in Eastern Europe during the second half of the 20th century. Or on the other hand, this is a cinematic piece for people who want to experience a film created with sheer beauty, full of detail, patience, and breathtaking visual strength.Undoubtedly, it is one of the biggest achievements in the history of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant, masterful, ad infinitum scarcely begin to describe the unbelievable experience that is Bela Tarr's gargantuan Satantango. It's obvious from the outset that this will be unlike anything seen previous, and this is due to an entrancing 8 minute dolly shot of cows strolling through a dilapidated village corral. There is no excuse for something like this to work this well and in fact would blatantly invite criticisms of "pretentious!" and "self indulgent garbage!" But alas, every single shot (with an average length of 6-8 minutes) in all 7+ hours serves its purpose of enveloping the viewer into the murky bog of Irimias's treachery. The fascistic control exerted over every glide and push of the camera, besides never ceasing to impress, gives extended takes of craggy male faces to be little else than riveting. This is a tale that could easily be told in two hours with conventional methods, but would never once exude the power that it can with an epic length.There is a tension that I've never experiences previous to my marathon viewing of this picture. Granted, many filmmakers use slinking dolly shots, slow push-ins etc. to create to intensify moments, but it has never succeeded so fully before or since Satantango. The movement never exceeds a certain speed, and even though you begin to beg for it to dart over to where the action is, it would never nearly be as effective if done so. The trudges across peeling walls become an adventure in and of themselves while you hear the conflict off to the side, making the eventual completion of the journey like a visual exhalation, where you think you can relax but then realize the uncomfortable conflict must now be witnessed in staggering detail.There is a pervading sense of dread percolating under every frame, and outside of the unparalleled cinematography this can be attributed to the trance-like performances of all the actors, who slow down speech to point of making Kubrick's characters seem like they are starring in Brick. Their zombified line readings, often behind mustachioed frowns, created an unrelenting atmosphere of both despair and wonder. It's a fantasy world that seems absolutely acceptable and true to life. This kind of dichotomous thinking is inevitable with such an obtuse yet simple film. There is no cinematic experience comparable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satan's Tango: You can tell from the first 10 minute enormous tracking shot following cattle meandering in the rain through a devastated, crumbling, seemingly deserted village, that it was going to be THAT kind of film.This is Hungary after the withdrawal of the Soviet occupation of 40 years, and we are at a collective farm on the Hungarian great plain that has collapsed along with Communism.Surreal, mesmerizing, sinister it challenges the mindful viewer to look closely, and listen, rather read closely, except I was lucky to do both. This film is for more mature audiences. I would compare it to plunging into Shakespeare drama that is really hard to follow at first, but pulls you on regardless, even if you are not getting everything, with a big payload.I could not believe I was watching it from when I got home from work till after midnight. One main theme that stuck out for me was how developing a public persona, and the art of speech can be so powerful. The enigmatic central figure, Irimiás, is an epitome of this. Good looking, tall, educated, and with a golden tongue, he sure has a Satanic allure for whom the disparaged, uneducated villagers dance the tango.There are some really funny parts too, the old doc watching and writing everything down in an alcoholic haze, then especially when the two officers rewrite Irimiás' letter and how they describe the villagers. The scene with the little girl and her cat is a heart stopper. I did not get everything to a T and want to read more about this, and want to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dismal Masterpiece, An Immersion Into A World Bereft of Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say this film isn't The Sound of Music is putting it mildly; it is a hard film to like, but for those who love the art of film, easy to admire. I do not love this film, and often did not particularly like it watching it--but I gave it a top rating because it is surely a masterpiece of its kind. Grim, dark, and brutal, Satantango moves at a pace that is almost glacial, but is completely one of a kind, a close examination of a people left behind by a government too busy to notice, left behind by a world beset by technological advances, left behind because nobody cares.Not one character in this lengthy film is particularly attractive, and in one section we watch for nearly an hour as a local Doctor becomes staggeringly drunk and lurches outside into the mud and the dark to refill his jug.This film is an immersion into the lifestyle and the textures and the surroundings of a small village in winter, a place where the villagers have put their faith in a man who has clearly decided to leave them in ruins; the film is seven hours long, and frequently a puzzlement. And if you allow yourself to be hypnotized by its dark, careful composition, unforgettable. This is absolutely not an entertainment in the usual sense of the word; be forewarned--but if you want a visual puzzle, an intellectual challenge, and a cinematic world all its own, Satantango is inimitable</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The seduction of a dancing dinosaur</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it is true that real masterworks are reached by geniuses only once in their life, but mostly never (cf. Meyrink's "Golem", Gondjarov's "Oblomov", Murnau's "Faust"), one could say that Béla Tarr has already surpassed his horizon line. None of the movies that he made before "Sátánangó" seem to announce this gigantic film, and none of the movies that Tarr has made since reflect it even in details.However, if one does not agree with what I just wrote, someone could say that the "Werckmeister Hármoniák" is the little brother of Satans' Tango - both formally and from the content. And perhaps, this is true. Like a gigantic black whole with its typical deafening noise the "apparatus" with the fossil fairground presentations comes into the village, a gigantic ghost train which can exist only, if a metaphor has been re-transformed into a flesh-like, nauseating, enigmatic and highly semiotic form. The same happens in "Satantango": The noise starts just at the beginning of the movie, the camera is so slow that it seems to look from where the "apparatus" is coming. Something must be coming, because something is always coming. The silence on the farmland is lethal, people hide, the air will give birth to an even more Pantagruel monster than that in the "Werckmeister". Are these Tarr's "harmonies"? The mechanical noise, creeping into ones bones with its repetitive regularity? It takes a long time until the tango will be there. People are fore-mostly concerned not with preparing the arrival of the Satan, but with trying to anticipate and therefore to inverse the order of reason and effect. Somebody has seen "Irimiás-és-Petrina" - ONE name, the two-fold Satan as opposite to the three-fold Christ. Repetitively over a dozen of minutes the drunk laborer tells one and the same fragment of his story in the local inn: "And I was plodding, and plodding, and plodding, and plodding", always 4 times, thus breaking off the trinity even in the repetition of what has not yet happened.Like the dance, the "Sátántangó has 6 steps forward and 6 steps back to go. The structure of the movie is similar to a watch. Something must happen because there is always something to happen: (1) The News that They are Coming; (2) We are Resurrected; (3) Knowing Something; (4) The Work of the Spider I; (5) The Net Tears; (6) The Work of the Spider II; (7) Irimiás Speaks; (8) The Perspective, when from the Front; (9) Ascension? Feverdream?; (10) The Perspective, when from Behind; (11) Nothing but Worries, Nothing but Work; (12) The Circle Closes.The film is a whole gigantic rotating monster whose epicycles imitate a full-length tango forward and backward. A dancing dinosaur represented by the highly suspect couple of Irimiás and his friend Petrina. There is no light, mostly scarce fruitless soil, loneliness in this once gigantic land called Hungary whose extension was between the Styrian Alps in the West and a puddle jump in front of the Black Sea in the East; between the Bohemian Forest in the North and Belgrad in the South. A land so wonderful to loose oneself, an authentic peace of Eastern Europe how it had been described so lovely, so patiently and so seductively by nobody else than Joseph Roth. It does not exist anymore since 1920. In films like Béla Tarr's stroke of genius, it still lives again, for 7 and 1/2 hours. Do what the director is suggesting, do not go to work, but install yourself on your sofa with enough food and most of all drinks. At last then, when the long chapter with the village doctor comes, in an Oscar-worth role played by Peter Berling, you will have this magic movie deeply in your body, you do not even want to get up anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it would be about time that so-called "artistic" goals stopped being achieved by using animal turture. This movie uses this little "nice" trick and every time i see that in movies i think: is it REALLY needed it? does it REALLY add value to the movie? but especially, i think: what is wrong with Bela Tarr and all those directors who speculate on the lives of animals for a movie's sake? And btw im not a PETA guy... What is wrong with all you people giving 10 stars to this marathon of stale cinema? It's true that the movie has something appreciable and quite rare to find compared to what can be found by the average movies nowadays, but I also think after reading most of the comments. it's been WAY WAY WAY OVERVALUED..FAR FROM A MASTERPIECE... Let's face it.. all that length was not necessary... 5 in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 15th greatest film of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? A seven hour long documentary-style study of a closely-knit and decadent rural life in Hungary using a group of fictional misfits and an abandoned, isolated machinery plant as the medium. Why? That's really quite an essential question regarding Sátántangó, despite the fact that you might not realise it quite yet. Why did this film happen? As Nick Pinkerton of Village Voice accurately pointed out: its seven hour runtime is unattractive and impractical to prospective viewers, ipso facto the one-screening-a-day bulk structure defies profit motive and its characters, proclaimed 'poor, ugly, sad and damned people' deny expectations of pleasure. So, why? By process of elimination upon pre-viewing research: to make a statement, and after viewing: obsession. Such a transition of outlook opens new avenues for filmmakers and audiences to explore the two most important parameters that structure the medium: space and time. An accomplishment with such calibre is worthy of considerable attention and acclaim. Now everybody is sitting comfortably, I can give Sátántangó my share. Drunken amounts of synergy emerge from the screenplay of this film, which redefines the phrase 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts'. Its effect is puzzling but as sincerely lifting as the finest of wines. What does spring to mind, of all things, is a young Ludwig Wittgenstein and his theory of 'language games'. In his work, he writes of an attitude towards faith and trust in God, and how those who take part in this 'game' will be able to understand the specific, exclusive language used within it and be rewarded eschatologically (after death). A similar attitude, although sometimes difficult and certainly impractical, if taken toward Sátántangó, yields equal bounty cometh the close of the seven and a half hours of slow, drunkenly beautiful meandering shots and marmite characters both bickering and caring amongst and for each other. Cometh the close, I felt many things: relief, depression, for all I can concentrate: Stockholm Syndrome (after being locked in with a set of the most flamboyant lovable and hateable characters I've ever seen) and scepticism to whether European cinema could ever match the immaculate and painstakingly poured over directing of Sátántangó during my lifetime. To see being invoked within me such a reaction from a single piece of artwork was giddy. It's a film with a stature and a reputation about it, one too leviathan to be shunned, one too long and that requires too much of a commitment to slander for no good reason. Sátántangó, the 1990s golden seal of artistic merit and power amidst claptrap crime spin-offs and rushed all-American 'masterpieces', is something of almighty reward and calibre that sits sentinel and humble in the face of those it will influence and the audience that it shall seduce and accept as one of its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Hungarian film was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it is most likely I would never have heard of or even watched this, and despite the length I was determined to try it. Basically, set in 1980's, Hungary, in a small ruined and decaying village, at the time near the end of Communism, the farming community is gradually collapsing, and life has become a virtual standstill. Many of the villagers are expecting large cash payments, and they plan to leave after receiving it, but there is the return of Irimiás (Mihály Vig), a smooth talker, and he was thought to be dead for two years. The plot of the film mostly revolves around what his return has done and how it has impacted the various villagers, whether it be the money problems, the lack of things to do, the personal and family hardships and tragedies, and some finding the will to leave after all. You could argue that the film has hardly any plot or story at all, as it has many long takes of random and slow moving events. These include some cows standing in a barnyard, a POV walk down a gravel path, a doctor walking, a person lying on floor, men in a pub as camera pulls away, a little girl torturing a cat, her standing in the corner looking at the cat, the girl walking with the cat down a path, a long accordion dance with some villagers - barnyard style, a tango with the accordion music, a dead girl in an open coffin, loads of men sleeping, horses in a courtyard that have escaped the slaughterhouse, a man in an abandoned house, a drive in the pouring rain, three men walking down a street in strong wind and rain, a man typewriting, a man sitting alone in his chair, a sweep over some marsh land, man enters church where man is ringing and repeating "Turks are coming!", and many more long and meaningless events. Also starring Putyi Horváth as Petrina, László Lugossy as Schmidt, Éva Almássy Albert as Mrs. Schmidt, János Derzsi as Kráner, Irén Szajki as Mrs. Kráner, Alfréd Járai as Halics, Miklós Székely B. as Futaki, Erzsébet Gaál as Mrs. Halics, Erika Bók as Estike and Peter Berling as Doctor. The film is almost seven hours long, and with uncut takes lasting sometimes ten minutes this is understandable, the longest take definitely being the dancing before the tango with that repetitive music tune that goes on and goes, as does the dancing. I will admit I didn't see much of a plot, if there was one, but some of the long takes were interesting to watch, just for the fact that almost nothing happened, it is not your conventional film, no fast moving action and mostly real time footage, it has developed a cult following which is understandable, you have to be very patient and open for this epic black and white drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was familiar with Tarr's "Harmonies of Werkmeister", but i think there is noway that they match this unprecedented masterpiece! Take 7 hours of your lifetime and watch the film, not a single minute is needless! Perfect cinematography, pace, music, photography. Acting was flawless and i think that many of the actors were amateurs. The whole child's episode offered one of the most moving performances in the history of cinema! Tarkovsky sure is an influence for Tarr. While watching it the only scene that seemed needless was the Doctor-episode, but the end of the film put the things in order - or not? Nothing less than an heroic feat in the history of cinema! Right from the famous opening scene i was mesmerized. Cyclical time is the main subject of this movie (others are human seek for purpose, truth, religion) based on a Hungarian novel and i think that a basic key to try to grasp this movie's meaning is the art of intellectual creation trying to alter or transcend time and space (novel in a novel - movie in a movie). I'm going to watch "Damnation", as soon as I find the just position for Satantango in my top 10 movie list of all time, why not contesting my number 1, which is of course "Citizen Cane".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A personal interpretation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving this film high points, not as some have suggested because I want to be in with the in crowd but because I really enjoyed it and even after a month of seeing it I am still thinking of the significance of various parts.In my view, the reason the film is so long is because Bela Tarr wanted the viewer to be the characters, to feel what it is like to live their lives, squalor and all and not simply be a voyeur to the unfolding of the storyline as in other conventional films. The reason I don't in this case have a problem to give spoilers is that the Police Captain's speech when Irimias and Petrina are summoned before him is the heart of the matter for most of what follows. It is listed above in the Memorable Quotes section but so you don't have to go looking for it I will C&amp;P it here."Captain: Not that human life was so highly valued. Keeping order appears to be the business of the authorities, but in fact it's the business of all. Order. Freedom, however, has nothing human. It's something divine, something... our lives are too short for us to know properly. If you're looking for a link, think of Pericles, order and freedom are linked by passion. We have to believe in both, we suffer from both. Both from order and freedom. But human life is meaningful, rich, beautiful and filthy. It links everything. It mistreats freedom only... wasting it, as if it was junk. People don't like freedom, they are afraid of it. The strange thing is there is nothing to fear about freedom... order, on the other hand, can often be frightening." This is so profound that most of the important themes in the film flow from this short speech. Probably the most important one is the observation (paraphrased) that people like the concept of freedom but they don't actually like to be free. It is usual to hear that people who, to one degree or another, live under oppression want to throw off the yoke of whatever system it happens to be but when they actually have their freedom they don't know what to do with it. In the film there is much talk about clearing off with the money from the sale of the farm, either fairly or unfairly divided and living lives of their own making. What follows is that Irimias appoints himself as the group's leader and everybody falls in line thus voluntarily placing themselves in a hierarchy.The other major theme from the Captain's speech is this. "But human life?..links everything". Every living thing is connected to every other living thing. Do you remember the voice over following the little girl's death? It talked of this connection existing between her mother; her brother who cheated her out of her savings; the cat the doctor and herself and she knew that after she was dead her angels would protect her. We then move forward towards the end of the drunken scene where we are presented with the analogy of the spider weaving a web over all of the drunken people. If a single strand in the web moves then the spider knows. In real life this could be a look backwards to the operating methods of the KGB. Also forwards to such things as the Patriot Act which legalised wire tapping and social networks like Facebook which was conceived by the CIA to farm information about individuals which could not be found in any other way.If someone has control over another living thing then they use that power without remorse. Examples of this are the little girl and the cat; Irimias and the group and the police captain and Irimias. Compare this in real life to what happened in the Stanford prison experiment.Without self discipline and left to their own devices people will become immoral. Examples of this are Irimias representing some unwholesome elitist class; the Schmidts planning to abscond with the money; The little girls brother stealing her savings; Mrs Schmidt with Futaki; the little girl's mother, no different to the cattle in the farmyard. The Police captain using Irimias for spying; the police gathering apparently useless information; the doctor's spying.We should be on our guard to beware of false prophets of hope. In the film this was represented by Irimias and Petrina. When the silver tongued Irimias gave his speech he moved seamlessly from "This event is tragic beyond all comprehension" to "You can achieve a better life by giving me your money". In everyday life I would include most off planet redemption religions together with our political leaders who by and large represent themselves first, lobbyists second and for the represented they do just enough to get re-elected.Beware of false prophets of doom. The man banging on the pipe in the ruined church shouting "The Turks are coming" when there were quite clearly no Turks in any direction.My interpretation of the incredibly sad final scene is that if this is the way we choose to group as a society, sandwiched between false prophets of hope and false prophets of doom and without any self discipline then there is no light at the end of the tunnel. if people had self discipline combined with freedom and self order, as the police Captain suggests, there would be no need for authority but since they don't they are confused between these false prophets of hope and false prophets of doom, therefore all attempts to continue as a workable society are ultimately bound to fail.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some words commonly used in reviews of this movie: "It has no plot" "Nothing happens" "It's very long" "It's too long" "Beautiful" "Brilliant" "Masterpiece" "Boring" etc, etc...Every word you read about this movie is true. Including the ones that criticize it.It's not a matter of opinion so much as a matter of fact.Every opinion about this movie is acceptable, there is no right or wrong. Which is something that cannot be said about most other movies.The story of Satantango can be interpreted in many ways, you can make up your own mind.Is it ostensibly about the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, when people in unprofitable collective farms found themselves left without a future, when the milk of human kindness stopped flowing from the abundant teat of the Communist State, when empty ideology finally gave way to grim reality? Possibly. The metaphors abound if you want to look for them.Or maybe it's just a boring story of some boring people in a muddy village who get conned by a bloke they thought was dead, filmed by someone who didn't know when to shout "Cut!"Why should you watch this very long black and white movie, where nothing much appears to be happening, about a group of forlorn and hopeless people living in a broken down village in the middle of nowhere, where it's either windy or raining all the time, waiting for a mysterious and slightly sinister con man to take their money in the hope of a better life?Well, it really depends on you.Few movies can match Satantango for beautiful photography and majestic cinematography. The camera either moves in glorious long tracking shots; slow, circling crane shots and long steadi-cam walking shots or it records long takes from a fixed tripod as the action, or sometimes lack of it, takes place. The few movies that can match it are mostly made by Bela Tarr.Those that say nothing happens are watching from the narrow brief of what happens in other movies, which is that they exist to entertain. Satantango is not one of these.Just as in Tarkovsky's movies, to which Bela Tarr's movies are closely related, time is just as an important dimension as space. Real time, as opposed to edited time fragments chopped together to present a story in non-linear real time representation. In other words, a movie edited to present a complete story in 90 minutes. A beginning, a middle and an end. Satantango is not a complete story. What it portrays begins before we start watching and continues after the cameras stop recording it. We are merely observing the minutiae of everything that happens, just as in real life we observe every moment of our life passing, it cannot be edited.Maybe that's the key to Satantango.Life cannot be edited.Or maybe I'm just another pretentious reviewer who loves beautiful black and white movies like this one.You decide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie for the first time almost 10 year ago. It was shown all night long on one of Italy's public TV channel. I watched it, mainly because I was attracted by its enormous lenght. I didn't expect I would have been watching one of the best (if not the best) movie I've ever seen. Cinema is entertaining, no doubt. But most of everything, cinema is ART. And this movie is nothing else but art. Watching this movie is like take a long walk through an art gallery, enjoying each and every painting for a long time. The movie is the art gallery, and each long-take is a single painting of the gallery. I don't understand how is even possible to sleep or to be bored by such a movie. Every time I can, I try to speak about this movie to more people possible. I try to describe its poetry, its deep beauty. And, all the time that is possible, I also try to show some parts of it to friends, co-workers, etc. And, generally, all I got are positive comments while the usual complain is about the language and the need of subs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no film like this. Tarr's penchant is for long takes and slow tracking shots with close-ups of peeling walls, dilapidated barns, leaky roofs, fat sows wallowing in mud. There is an oppressive yet enveloping atmosphere of grey rain, mud, and decay everywhere in this film. The characters are largely speechless, downtrodden, prone to all kinds of addictions (drugs, sex) and one of the best sequences involves an indigent, bored and lonely little girl and her pet cat. For a seven and a half hour film, it's never boring, always compelling, and though the latter half of the film seems to be a bit discontiguous with the first half - involving a kind of scam perpetrated on a group of villagers by a Mephistopholes-like con artist - the conclusion, will leave you haunted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>wow. really, really, very, good. I felt like celebrating by the end of it. Why? Because it was perfect. Any negative criticism of this movie comes from the audience's lack of knowledge. Lack of knowledge as to what a true film going experience should be. Not about entertainment, but about showing you a whole new way of looking at the world. For 7 1/2 hours, you see the world through the eyes of Bela Tarr. And it's a fantastic, deeply meaningful world with so many layers of meaning built within a single image. This is why the shots go on for so long. Because Bela Tarr wants you to see all those layers, not just the ones on the surface. If you see one more movie in your life, see Satantango. Don't watch it in multiple sittings; watch it all at once, in a dark room, on a big screen, Without any interruptions except for the bare essentials. For a rating It deserves an 11 but I could only give it a 10. An 11 because it goes further than any movie has ever gone with the exception of a few, To show you something truly incredible, something you've never seen before. Breathtaking Devine Surreal Utterly beautiful. I can't recommend this enough. wow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Written and directed by Bela Tarr. Adapted from a novel, the movie if it can be called such ( it is so slow in places, it can hardly be called moving ) is more like a series of portraits. l came to this movie without knowing a single thing about it, l had no prior knowledge of it, l left it wanting those stolen seven and hours of my life back. This film will appeal to those interested in the technical side of film making, but the technical tricks do nothing to hide the lack of substance. l know in advance my views on this film will not be popular here, well popularity is not something l am seeking. Set sometime in the 1980's the movie has more the look and feel of the 1950's when Hungary was under Soviet control. Since there is little context given, l have to think this is a deliberate construct of the director, to remove the characters from any set time or place. The end result is that much of the film takes place in a featureless landscape, where the gray tones are unrelenting, just like much of the film, which l found tedious to the extreme. There are a few characters, but most of them are made out to be grotesque figures in hand me down clothes, whose only real past time is drinking copious amounts of alcohol, and falling over often. No one really works, there is no work to be done. It is as if they are all waiting for the Hungarian equivalent of Godot, but Beckett does not translate well it appears. The dialogue as such is sparse and contains few gems. One of the style devices used in the screenplay, is the repeating of certain lines, over and over. This is particularly annoying in one scene when that is all an old drunk does for about 10 minutes, over and over, while other characters are trying to speak. No one tells him to shut up, the characters keep on talking, even though he is just relentless. Many things about this film are also relentless. The rain being the most obvious. More than half the running time of the film is during the rain. Another relentless device, is the over use of tracking shots. Characters are shown walking great distances in the rain or the wind ( more on that later ) with the camera showing them walking the whole distance to where they are going. The most noticeable of these is perhaps the first shot of the movie, when cows are shown walking through a farmyard. The cows are quite loud and yet no people come to attend to them. After a while the cows get the idea that no one is coming, so they just wander off to wherever it is they were going in the first place and are never seen again. People are also shown in the same manner, walking everywhere, as there is not only a lack of people in the derelict towns depicted, but only a couple of motorized vehicles in the entire film. This lack of technology is one of the things that removes the film from any narrow context. The only thing that really can be used to date the film in any way is an electric type writer and that is not shown until almost at the end. A wind machine is also used, or in this case over used in a couple of scenes, to blow an absolute storm through the town as the camera follows certain characters down the deserted streets. A few times music is used on the soundtrack, but like much of the dialogue it is sparse, and the badly played tunes are repeated often, most notably on a Hohner piano accordion. At other times, some bells are used and they have an eerie, almost menacing effect. l say almost menacing as you would have to care about the effect of the bells first, but by the end of this film, l really could not have cared less. Yes the film has some neat stylistic devices, none better than when two clerks get together to rewrite an official report on the main characters, ( with some hilarious results ) where the camera circles twice around the desks of the two men, first in a clockwise motion, then it stops and does the same thing in reverse. Neat, but it does nothing to enhance our understanding or appreciation of the film itself, like so many of the other tricks used in the film, it becomes a self conscious aspect of the film that we notice more, because there is a lack of other things that would be of more benefit to the film itself, such as plot development, narrative, more decent characterization, or even a decent script. Perhaps this film was made to inspire us to seek out the original text. lf so it is an abject failure. There are no memorable characters, there is no one really deserving of any type of sympathy here or who commands audience interest. The whole film is a massive exercise in self indulgence. The end credits indicate that it took 3 years to make, that is about 2 years and nine months too long. So, what is so important or riveting that it takes over 7 and a half hours to depict ? The answer is nothing. Masterpiece ? Spare me.</fullReview>

A child actor of approximately 12-13 years old performs all these acts for the camera. Christ knows what mental effect it had on her.If this film had been made by a western director, critics would be excoriating it and its director.

		<fullReview>Who knew emptiness could be so beautiful? Bela Tarr's 7-hour Hungarian epic revolves around the lives of villagers in a small-town, as they face with greed, deception, betrayal, and loss. Tarr's cinematography here exceeds anything else ever captured on celluloid. I could list 1,000 reasons why this is the best film ever made: from its fascinating, anomalous structure, to its sensible, brooding, and dark portrayal of human nature, to its lyrical, ravishing portrait of forlorn desolation, to its false, but beautifully authentic sense of hope. As a visceral experience alone, this is the greatest film ever made, but add a touch of arguably sardonic symbolism, and it's beyond that. Bela Tarr has touched on a realm of cinema I never thought possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1994, Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr released a seven hour black and white film called Satantango (Satan's Tango in English) that presented a conundrum for both the purveyors of plot-driven, character-empty Lowest Common Denominator blockbuster action summer movies and those who favor the cerebral, pretentious, film school fawning indulgences of Eurotrash (aka World Cinema) film-making. The conundrum was how can time be manipulated by the artist (filmmaker) so that the viewer (percipient) is removed from its passage? No, that theme is never directly stated nor implied in the film's frames, but it is there, and Satantango is a film that, like Chris Marker's La Jetee, will stand as a milestone in cinema history. Like Marker's film, Satantango is a great film, and I will detail and argue such in this essay. But, I believe that it could well be the sort of film that, decades hence, serves as the template for what remains of modern cinema culture.Critics are often the worst judges of what is original and important when an art form seeks out new means- an online scan of film reviews of old classics often shows how off the mark old line critics were. On a soft tangent, an often abused term crops up far too often in reviews of Satantango, and that is the word 'epic.' In fact, epic is something this film most definitely is not. Epic implies huge spectacle and grand consequences, whereas this film, despite its length, is anything but that. It is intimate and, if anything, anti-epical. In fact, it is almost like a Beckett play on steroids, and one that tests the very premises Beckett based his whole career upon, pushing them to the very limits of their own dictates, and then into something even better, for it has a richness, depth, and humanity that no Beckett play has. Yet, while not epic, the film is very much a visionary work. Many people confuse the two ideals, as if they both connote a grandness, whereas only epic does. Vision, on the other hand, can be small. Quality of her verse aside, much can be stated in favor of the argument that Emily Dickinson was a visionary poet. Her 'vision,' though, was exceedingly small, and this is true of Satantango. The very smallness which makes it an anti-epic also makes it visionary for its vision is that of the microscope, not the telescope, where epics are writ so large. But large things often diffuse, whereas Satantango's length does naught but clarify, even in its depths. And the use of macguffins acts almost as leukocytes to defend the film's narrative from its own length's possible excesses.This defense system is one of the many reasons Satantango is not only a great film, but an important and historic one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Zero stars for animal cruelty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you agree with the following statement, then read on; otherwise skip my entire review.The torturing/killing of living things is NEVER justified if the reason is "for entertainment", or worse, "for art".Good, you're still here which means there's hope for the human race. SATANTANGO features a scene where a real cat is shaken, flipped around, rolled in the dirt, rolled over, shaken again, stuck in a bag and hung on a wall. The torture lasts about 10 minutes and can be seen on Youtube by searching "Satantango cat".Not all countries have animal protection laws, and not all directors respect animal life. Oddly enough, it's often the "enlightened", well-respected filmmakers who are the worst offenders. Watch out for Tarr (Satantango - cat tortured), Tarkovsky (Andrei Rublov - cow lit on fire, horse shot and thrown down stairs), Herzog (Even Dwarfs Started Small - monkey crucified, chickens thrown through window), Von Trier (Manderlay - donkey slaughtered), Coppola (Apocalypse Now - water buffalo partially decapitated), Ki Duk Kim (where to begin?), and the list goes on. You can check all my 1 star reviews for more.To all of the above films I say no thank you, just as I'd prefer not to cheer at a bullfight or adore a Nazi lamp made of human flesh, no matter how "beautiful". I'll stick to directors who show sensitivity and compassion, in front of the lens as well as behind it: Kurosawa, Wenders, Jarmusch, Anno, there are plenty enough films to keep me busy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the Hungarian word for "editor"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There really is a plot to "Sátántangó," and it's an interesting one. We have far too few films that deal with the end of communism in Eastern Europe, and it's a truly fascinating subject. "Sátántangó" does present the problems people face when their way of life changes and examines how communities can come apart.But all of this gets completely diluted by the painfully monotonous cinematography. There are many beautiful scenes and haunting shots in the film, but because they go on forever, they lose their effect.Six hours into this "epic," you lose your regard for the Hungarian countryside and start aching for something -- anything -- to happen, like the appearance of strip mall in the middle of a field, where the peasants can see what the future holds for them.But no, there's still and hour and a half of cinematic root canal to go."Sátántangó" could have been a benchmark film about a significant point in European history . . . if the editor had done his job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best in its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I agree there were some awesome images, specially where all the paper flies around when they walk up the little street. So, I haven't seen anything like this before. A movie three times as long as a normal movie with no plot whatsoever. So yes this is the best movie in its genre, but if I compare it to any other movie I have ever seen that might have been slow, bad or non-existing plot, well those are 100 times better since they aren't as long. I, who am open to every kind of movie thinks that the experience I got from watching this film is that every other film I see will be a good movie. All I have to do is to compare it to Satantango. So I really do not believe that you like this movie really, at least not enjoyed it, either you want to like this movie, only because you don't want to be like everyone else. Or you just aren't as interested in movies as you are in art and paintings, 'cause this is a painting, that you have to look at for more than seven hours. I do not regret that I saw this movie, but I certainly to not think it was a day well-spent.</fullReview>
