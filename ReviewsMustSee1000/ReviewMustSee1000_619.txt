		<fullReview>"If you love something, let it go. If it comes back to you, it's yours forever. If it doesn't, it wasn't meant to be." ? Anonymous Love is about holding on to someone, but it is also about knowing when to let go. This theme defines Jean-Marc Vallée's Café de flore, his second film since the 2005 hit C.R.A.Z.Y., and one of the most poignant films in recent memory. Not only does Café de flore repeat Vallée's earlier success, but goes far beyond it in its extraordinary ability to capture the intensity of deeply-felt human emotion. The title refers not to the famous Paris café, but to a jazzy song with the same name that serves as a connection between each of the film's two parallel stories. In addition to the title song, music plays a large role in the film as it did in C.R.A.Z.Y. with songs from Pink Floyd, Sigur Rós, and The Cure supporting key points in the narrative.Unfolding with a non-linear script that includes multiple flashbacks, flash-forwards, and cross-cutting, the stories take place in two time periods over forty years apart. In the present day, Antoine (Kevin Parent) is a well-to-do middle-aged disc jockey who lives in a suburban home with his partner Rose (Evelyne Brochu) and his two daughters from a former marriage (Joanny Corbeil-Picher, Rosalie Fortier). Everything looks wonderful on the surface except that Antoine is visiting a psychiatrist to handle his feelings about what he feels is betrayal of his family. Antoine's first wife Carole (Hél?ne Florent) is distraught and yearns for reconciliation with the man she has always thought of as her soul mate since they came together as teenagers out of a shared love of music.Carole is urged by friends to let go of Antoine and move on, but she is obsessed with getting him back, telling her friend, "I've never kissed another man." She takes drugs to help her sleep, sleepwalks in the middle of the night, and has dreams and waking visions of a strange woman in Paris many years ago experiencing a similar pain in her relationship. To help her understand her visions, Carole visits a spiritual adviser who tells her that her dreams are not a coincidence. The parallel story is set in Paris in 1969, Jacqueline (Vanessa Paradis), a single mother cares for her young son Laurent (Lucas Bonin) who was born with Down's syndrome. She was abandoned by her husband after Laurent's birth because he did not want to be a "missionary."Jacqueline is a devoted mother, showering her son with love, and intending to ensure that he lives past the norm of twenty-five years for a person with his condition. When she enrolls him in a normal school, she constantly protects him from bullies and also from teachers who are not willing or able to deal with him. Jacqueline wants to train Laurent to defend himself by learning how to box but, when he rebels at the idea, she teaches him to strike back through words which he uses to peak efficiency at the right moment.When Laurent is seven, he develops a close attachment to Veronique, another Down's syndrome child, an attachment that threatens his mother's obsessive protection and leads to an unforeseen turn in their relationship. Café de flore is a passionately performed and spiritually resonant film, one of the best I've seen this year. Reminiscent of Terence Malick's Tree of Life with its voice-overs reflecting the inner thoughts of the characters, it is a haunting experience and the mystical connection between its two stories will keep you in a Donnie Darko-like state of puzzlement long into the night and beyond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, disregard the two previous reviews, for they are both negative and underrate a great film. 'Cafe de Flore' is not quite for everyone, which I can understand. However if you truly want to see this film, ignore other opinions, otherwise you will miss out on a potential Oscar nomination.There are two separate stories occurring. One is about a woman in the 1960s (Paradis) who has to raise her son on her own, because he has Down's syndrome. The other is about a music jockey named Antoine (Parent) who is ready to marry again despite the bond he shares with his ex-wife, who was also his first love. His eldest daughter purposely plays certain songs which remind him of their marriage, since the central idea is how music recalls certain memories. Every time a certain song is heard in the background, one is bound to step inside the characters memories.The other story is the beauty of a mother-son relationship. Paradis is genuine in this role, especially being a real-life mother herself. Her makeup ages her to portray her role well. We see how she encourages her boy to learn despite his disabilities. Remember, this was an era where children like him were discriminated and often sent to institutions.'Cafe de Flore' is truly a story about the power of love. You have to follow closely, therefore if easily distracted the flashbacks may confuse you. The constant repetition of Pink Floyd, which was also a signature band for Jean-Marc Vallee's 'C.R.A.Z.Y.', is synchronized to perfection. The visuals and acting performances are moving, as the film unfolds by layer, to at last reveal how both stories are connected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Unique and Rewarding Film Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can make the leap of faith required in the final portion of the movie, this is a beautiful, haunting work that will stay with you long after you have left the theater. There is no question that this movie asks a lot of one's suspension of disbelief. But I think that movie goers should give it the benefit of a doubt. This is a very unconventional love story, and it may be the most thoughtful movie every made about the idea that one person can be another person's soul mate. The tension of course arises when what does one do when one finds a deeper, more meaningful soul mate. This is a complex work with a totally different way of investigating its romantic themes. It uses music beautifully as a thread that joins elements of the film together, binding emotional themes together and providing transitions between the two stories that it tells. I can't think of another movie that finds such an unique approach to telling its tale.It is also the best Canadian film that I have seen in years. One of the very best movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transcendent. Sublime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Read the full review at nickplusmovies.blogspot.com)Jean-Marc Vallée returns to his beloved Québécois roots with his latest work, "Café de flore", one of the many films that screened at TIFF back in September (and that I was lucky enough to see). The story is composed of two interwoven narratives that-- only at first glance-- seem completely unrelated to one another.The first story is set in present-day Montreal and centers on a recently divorced father of two girls, Antoine Godin (Kevin Parent), who leads a successful life as a professional DJ. Despite having found true happiness in his relationship with his girlfriend Rose (Evelyne Brochu), he feels a little remorseful for having left his ex-wife Carole (Hél?ne Florent), for whom he still cares deeply. Antoine understands that she continues struggling to move on with her life, heartbroken. And to make the situation in which they find themselves even more difficult, their eldest daughter persistently plays their nostalgic love song with hopes of reuniting her parents.The second story is set in Paris in 1969 and focuses on Jacqueline (Vanessa Paradis), a self-sufficient, loving single mother who becomes the embodiment of perseverance and selflessness as she promises to devote herself both physically and spiritually to her son Laurent, who has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. She spends every minute of spare time with her beloved young boy with the goal to elongate his limited life expectancy. One day, when Laurent begins to be infatuated by Véronique, a new girl in his class-- who, incidentally, also has Down syndrome-- Jacqueline is struck by an overwhelming feeling as she fears that her inseparable bond with the only person she loves will be be lost with time.Up until the very end of the film, it seems like the only link between both stories is the music the characters listen to (the jazz album "Café de flore" appears in the second story while a certain remix is featured in the first one), but as we progress further into this mystical mystery, we learn that there is something much deeper tying together the characters and their stories of love and loss. Knowing that "Café de flore" would be composed of intertwined stories, I was initially a little reluctant to seeing it and very worried that its structure would collapse within the first few minutes of the film. To my pleasant surprise, this modern approach to storytelling proved to be ultimately rewarding. I believe credit is due to the film editor, who is-- believe it or not-- Jean-Marc Vallée, again. It's nice to hear that he had control of almost every visual aspect of his own work of art. With Vallée's perfectly orchestrated editing, the audience is able to follow the story without ever sensing an abrupt switch between story lines. In the film's entirety, not once did I feel that some scenes were fragmented or disjointed from others. Vallée always progresses deeper into his creation by carefully and seamlessly shifting between narratives just at the right time, creating a smooth, fluid tempo. Briefly, everything flows like a river. Just like in "C.R.A.Z.Y.", music is a vital element to this film. Jean- Marc Vallée selects many tunes with ethereal, ambient qualities to match the profound thoughts and feelings of all the characters. While he features some more Pink Floyd ("Speak to Me/Breathe"), he makes of Sigur Ros's "Svefn-g-englar" the film's most haunting musical piece-- by far.There are far too many impressive performances in "Café de flore" to name. Vallée must be what one would call an "actor's director", because he seems to continuously squeeze out the most confident, natural performances from all of his actors-- young or old-- in order to achieve his goal to craft a realistic family drama. He even went to the lengths of finding two children who have Down syndrome in real life for the roles of Laurent and Véronique (these are two "performances" that will make your jaw drop). This is proof of his everlasting adherence to realism as a filmmaker.In sum, "Café de flore" is a sensual, deeply touching chef-d'oeuvre that will have you shivering every minute in pure emotional awe. It never comes across as overly sentimental, but rather genuinely heartfelt. I can't recall the last time I found myself on the verge of tears while simultaneously smiling at the bittersweet beauty of a film. Come to think of it, there isn't a single movie from 2011 that I could recommend seeing more than this one. I believe it's an essential viewing for anyone who has felt the most fundamental of human emotions. (That means you... I hope)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All i can say is that I loved this film. Just saw it last night. it's a challenging, intriguing, mesmerizing, intoxicating look at love through two intertwined, overlapping stories -- set in past and present and both in different time periods -- about a man going through a divorce and the mother of a down's syndrome child. You can't explain it. You have to experience it. And whether you believe in past lives or not (i don't and the director says he doesn't either), you will go on an unsettling emotional journey watching this visually stunning, amazingly acted movie. Vanessa Paradis is heartbreaking and almost unrecognizable. The addictive Cafe de Flore music inspired the director to write, direct and edit this film himself. The score is modern, mind-blowing but also includes some classic rock, including some from Pink Floyd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. I usually dislike indie films and their lack of plot (Las Acacias) or often, even endings. This was a real movie, about real emotions, and really imperfect individuals. Beautiful energy as added with the music, the emotions were aptly and strongly felt with its aid. The subplot of past lives makes one wonder whether or not one believes in it, and if so how much? Just breathtaking. Even if you don't love it as much as I do, it is a worthy film worth viewing and giving an open hearted chance to. Who knows? You might be moved, you hard nosed cynicist, you :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Till Fate Do Us Apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I scared myself when I cried with the Sigur Ros song in the film, out of blue, in the dark cinema with only 3 other strange people there. This is a film about dream and love, and what are you supposed to do if your dream is all about the one you love, and what if you spend all your life protecting a dream that never meant to belong to you. This is the question in front of Jacqueline and Carole. After all, having a dream that connected to human beings is a dangerous thing to do.Using two parallel story lines is no more a novelty in film making. Yet the film does not give us much information on the relation between the two very different stories?a single mother, Jacqueline, with her Down's syndrome son, Laurent, in 1960s and a couple (Carole and Antonio) facing betrayal and the sequential mental stress today. The only correlations between them are Carole's strange dreams and "Cafe de Flore"?the songs with the same name that people from two spaces and times happened to play. Two and a half hours is a long duration for an independent art film, and in most of the time, these two stories are separately told, slowly and beautifully, and I thought maybe that's it, there would be no overlap between the two stories, until Carole figured out her connection with the mother and son from the last life.I watched Cafe de Flore by myself in a small cinema in the suburb of London. Tranquillity is all you need when encountering a beautiful film like this. Crying like a baby in the cinema, I had to sit there for a while until the film credits finished in order to give myself some time to look normal before going out. And the film is such a great comfort for some reason, it's cathartic. The original soundtrack is another important reason to make the film so moving. Interestingly, Sigur Ros's music video svefn-g-englar featured with Down's syndrome dancers, could be the initial inspiration of Cafe de Flore?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that haunts you afterwords</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMHO there are two categories of movies: the ones that impress me when I see it, like Hollywood blockbusters which shock me with stunning visual effects, or action scenes, or dramas. There is another category, that don't produce much of an impression when I see it, I get even bored wondering myself why did I pay the ticket for it. But.. suddenly after a couple of hours, or days, they become alive inside me and haunt me after. "Cafe De Flore" is one of those! It doesn't have a story to tell, it is pure art. The authors plant a seed that is intended to grow inside the viewer. It doesn't try to convince you of anything, doesn't draw a conclusion in the end, just places frame after frame and leave the interpretation to you. I would rate it 8 out of 10. regards, Andrei</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another narcissistic tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is visually beautiful, the acting superb. However, I don't recommend it. The "mystical" connection between the two story lines absolutely does not work. The story line with Jacqueline is touching, and occupies far too little of the screen time. Vanessa Paradis is amazing, and her interactions with her son are touching and sad, as you recognize her life revolves completely around him as see struggles to raise him alone after his father leaves. On the other hand, I found the misogynistic tale of Antoine very off-putting. A narcissistic man leaves his beautiful, intelligent wife of 20 years for a vapid, tattooed, insecure younger woman with whom he appears to have no common interest other than sex. How original. Great role model he is for his teenage daughter, who hates him, by the way. Big surprise. Unfortunately, the daughter is the only female who stands up to him and calls him out for the cochon that he is. The other women in his life are just waiting with bated breath to see whether he chooses to allow them to continue making him the center of their worlds. I am really tired of this story line having seen it too many times, and I didn't enjoy this film as a result.</fullReview>

I stopped trying to understand what anything meant about 5 minute into the movie. I just went along for the ride.

		<fullReview>I must take issue with previous reviewers here. I am a generous soul but I set high standards for my movies. I must say this was not good. Indulgent, yes, good, no! Very disappointed with a movie that promised much. A superb cast, acted really well but an uncoordinated narrative that looked as if it had been decided upon afterwards in the editing or cutting room. The supposedly intertwining stories had no relevance at all to each other despite the efforts of the director with his puerile attempt to bring them together. Indulgent and pretentious. With very little merit. Beautifully filmed visually and good sound quality but other than that a total waste of his time and more importantly, ours!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange parallels beautifully filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cafe de Flore proposes two somewhat strange parallel story lines, that of a single mother of a Down's Syndrome boy in 1960's Paris, alongside that of a narcissistic professional DJ living in modern day Montreal, Canada. Throughout the film I expected these two disparate stories to somehow meet in some tangible form, but this part of the film remains a bit of a mystery... perhaps staying in some kind of spiritual realm. That aspect of the film is somewhat confusing, and may be a bit off-putting to many viewers. I thought it a bit strange, but overall I think this is a great film. Even though this parallel story line is pretty bizarre, the filming, especially the Paris scenes, are superb, the acting is great, and the connection between mother and son is incredible. I thought the character of the young Down's syndrome girl could have been fleshed out a bit more, but apart from that its a very watchable film with great music and well crafted performances. Nice work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Café de Flore is one impeccably crafted and shockingly overwhelming movie. I think it's pretty much like The Tree Of Life, but probably easier to see and understand, although equally cosmic and delicate. We'll probably never know if Valée wanted us to believe Jacqueline's story is all in Carole's head or if both stories really merge and soulmates are meant to travel through time and space (I would say by the Notre Dame shot that medium told Carole the truth!). The beauty here is all about the connective tissue who intertwins the two multilayered story lines, the power of music, the rawness and intensity of feelings in dreams and learning to let go.I was on the verge of tears a couple of times... and surely will watch it again pretty soon.</fullReview>

One, set in present-day Montreal, Antoine; a successful club DJ is quite happy with his life ; he has a loving girlfriend(Rose) and 2 children , these children are his with his wife (Carole) of several years;they recently divorced; wife had still some hope that he will come back; some bitterness regarding the divorce but she cant fully hate her because Rose is quite nice. Antoine met the Rose in one of his gig and saw her again in AA meeting and they fell in love. The other story is set in 1960s Paris, Jacqueline a single mother of a child with Down syndrome Laurent. the husband left ( implied) because he cant accept the child. Jacqueline was quite devoted to Laurent and Laurent to her mom. but things changed when Vero came into the picture and Laurent and Vero ( fell in love with each other and don't want to be separated from each other (geez they were 7 y/o). Jacqueline then become so possessive. Laurent, and Véro are killed in a car accident (seemingly on purpose (?), by the driver Jacqueline).

She was Jacqueline in previous life and Antoine and Rose were Laurent and Vero reincarnated. Because she prevented the love of Vero and Laurent in previous life; she will not a hindrance now and give her blessings to the marriage of Antoine and Rose and they were all happy.What a premise of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spiritual Experience For Some. A Self-Indulgent Flick For Others.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intercutting two story lines which at first seem totally unrelated, Café de Flore is an odyssey of love that is told through two intertwined timelines. The first is set in modern day Montreal where a club DJ finds himself torn between his girlfriend &amp; his ex-wife. The other segment is set in 1960s Paris and follows a woman &amp; his son who suffers from Down syndrome.Written, directed &amp; edited by Jean-Marc Vallée (best known for Dallas Buyers Club), Café de Flore isn't an easy film to decipher for the plot unfolds in a very complex manner, employs numerous flashbacks, flash-forwards &amp; cross-cutting moments throughout its runtime while the fragmented narration, thematic elements &amp; symbolisms only make it less accessible.From a technical standpoint, there isn't much wrong with this movie. Cinematography uses its camera amazingly well in addition to its effective use of colour tones &amp; lighting. Editing is a troubled aspect though for it breaks the story into different segments, rearranging them to give a multi-layered structure which may not work out for everyone while the cast chips in with fair performances.However, my favourite aspect of the film is its expert use of music for the chosen songs are seamlessly infused into the plot &amp; make the sitting through a worthwhile affair. On an overall scale, Café de Flore isn't a film for everyone, can be easily dismissed as pretentious cinema, and is a multi-layered experience that's ultimately marred by its convoluted premise, glacial pace &amp; metaphysical complexities. A rich, rewarding &amp; spiritual film for some, a highly self-indulgent flick for others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious but without purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Cafe de Flore' is a an unusual film. It's deceptively ambitious, but unfortunately its ambitions extend only to being ambitious as an end in itself, a movie whose complexity is unmatched by actually having anything to say. It begins as a montage of heartwarming scenes and images, telling us one story of success and happiness, another of pluck and courage, and whose overall message appears to be nothing more than that love is lovely for the beautiful people. But just when you might otherwise be starting to pull out the sick-bags, the film gets darker, although the treatment of the characters' lives remains somewhat superficial: while the aftermath of a break-up between two of the leading protagonists is at the centre of one of the plots, its details are (seemingly deliberately) denied us. What gives the film its structure, however, is the link between the two stories, which at first is also denied us, but is eventually revealed: one of the characters is dreaming (or remembering, from a past existence), the life of an another. The film never quite abandons its realistic underpinnings, but ends up in no-man's land: the link is insufficiently explicit to make this a ghost story, but as a mere suggestion, it's a remarkably flimsy basis to hold the story together. Director Jean-Marc Vallee successfully adds some tension as the brings the two stories to climax in partnership, as if they were really the same story; but from a little distance, it's very unclear what this concordance is supposed to imply or signify. A final clue hidden in the credits provides a 'Shining'-esque conclusion (but one equally unenlightening as the end of that movie)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Café de Flore- Catch It (A-) Café de Floreis a beautiful French movie about LOVE. Its rarely you see a movie about Love &amp; Soul Mates these days so Cafe De Flore is completely refreshing in bringing the purity of love. Café de Flore is a love story about people separated by time and place but connected in profound and mysterious ways. Atmospheric, fantastical, tragic and hopeful, the film chronicles the parallel fates of Jacqueline, a young mother with a disabled son in 1960s Paris, and Antoine, a recently divorced, successful DJ in present day Montreal. What binds the two stories together is love - euphoric, obsessive, tragic, youthful, timeless love.Even though the movie runs in Non-Chronological manner still you would appreciate how it amalgamates two stories beautifully. I'm not huge fan of non-chronological movie because it makes you depressive like Burning Man, We Need to Talk about Kevin &amp; Memento off course.Vanessa Paradis gave a brilliant performance, she lived in that moment and her chemistry with the syndrome child is superb. You completely forget that it's not even real. Kevin Parent is mesmerizing and exudes passion. Can't believe that's his first outing as an actor. Evelyne Broche is beautiful &amp; her chemistry with Kevin Parent is amazing. Helene Florent is great along with syndrome kids Marin Gerrier &amp; Alice Dubois.On the whole, Cafe De Flore is a beautiful heartening movie, which will bring you in tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>now the screenplay, the screenplay writer and the director has provided us with another brand new excuse when you suddenly fall for another man or woman, become an adulterer, abandon what you've already built, a marriage, your faithful wife, your vows, your kids....and blame, self-righteous claim that is karma, an unavoidable fatal attraction to a new person who suddenly appeared in your normal life. a very complicated trans-continental karma like Tibetan's searching for their living Buddah heir. your past life determines your up-to-date life, you have to realize, to cash in, to embrace it. there's no excuse, no escape, no whatsoever you've done, did and doing in your present life.well, this movie will teach you how to have an affair outside your existing marriage and relationship, and how to tell the persons you're gonna ruin that you have to do the unfaithfulness to compensate or redeem, or release the debt, the haunted karma that you have to repay to those who you owed so much in your past life.every adultery always got an excuse. 'sorry, i don't love you any more.' is just too lame and too common. you've got to find some new excuses to justify your deeds that might be against all the social or moral standards.after viewed this movie, i am so assured that the screenplay writer might have been trying to hint that he, too, also faced such crisis and dilemma. he wished his wife would be like that wife so badly hurt by his unfaithfulness and would find peace by her own and wished she could let go and move on.this is a very good movie, but unfortunately, i just can't accept such coward excuse in our real life. asking a 'medium' to give you a 'why' answer is simply absurd. suppose the fate and karma got a twist, it turned out that the woman you fell for was an ugly, older woman, you'd still have to fall for her since it's an inescapable karma that you have to redeem it? karma never promised that your new love would be a handsome man or a younger pretty woman, the spirit might randomly choose any age, any outlook....and what if it turned out to be in the same gender? then, you have to change your sexual preference? give me a break!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Gonna Give You Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From its polished soundtrack to its paranormal twists, this brilliant movie directed by C.R.A.Z.Y.'s Jean-Marc Vallée is worth watching. You're alternately taken to 1969 Paris and 2011 Montréal respectively following a single mother raising her son with Down syndrome and a family coping with parental separation and the father's new soulmate situation. As the plot slowly - Quebec filmmakers take their time - developed on a cloud of Sigur Ros songs, everything I had not expected from this movie happened. The seemingly two unrelated stories only linked by matching tunes turned out to be much more. I thought this would be a heartbreaking drama drowned in 8th grader romance and miserable fatality. It is more of a Vanilla Sky-type intrigue and quite the mindfuck. The cast is absolutely flawless from Vanessa Paradis' portrayal of a mother struggling with societal prejudice to Evelyne Brochu's character of the obviously hated stepmother and stunning new soulmate or even Marin Gerrier who plays Paradis' son. Café de Flore is everything you wanted and more.1 reason to watch it: this is art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful emotional love story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film. You spend a long time wondering what the connection is between the two separate love stories and only find out very close to the end. I found it worth the wait. It completely changed my view of the relationship between Antoine and the younger woman he has left His beloved wife for. You have to watch the whole film and the credits to really get it, but once you do it becomes a much more satisfying and haunting film and i think i'll enjoy it even more second time around. I only saw it yesterday but i'll be watching it again very soon. The music is integral to the story and works perfectly. The performances are excellent from everyone, especially the children. Watch this film, it really is worth two hours of anyone's time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning, i thought that the movie is too slow for me, but then, when i finally let myself to it and just went along with the story, i really loved it. I feel somehow different after watching it, my state of mind has been changed, and i feel so light and heavy at the same time. I appreciate it the most when a movie makes a change in my soul. That's why i gave this movie such a good rating.Other than that, the acting was great, and the story was more or less original. Well, original enough for me. Beautiful music, nicely woven into the plot; excellent photography. This movie has a real potential. Nostalgia-driven, expressive, thought-provoking, at times optimistic and at times deeply sentimental, it teaches about "letting go". And i feel that's a truly important lesson in life. It deserves all the attention it can get.Loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Story Rather Spoiled by Over-Emphatic Visuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in contemporary Montreal and 1960s Paris, CAFE DE FLORE comprises two parallel tales: the first involving Antoine, a contemporary DJ (Kevin Parent), his ex-wife Carole (Helene Florent) and his current girlfriend Rose (Evelyne Brochu): the other set in the Sixties with a mother Jacqueline (Vanessa Paradis) trying to look after her son Laurent (Marrin Gerrier) who suffers from Downs Syndrome. At first it seems that the two stories are completely disparate: in the contemporary tale the main emphasis is on Antoine's desire to rid himself of past associations, yet finding it very difficult when his ex-wife believes that she is still attached to him: in the Sixties tale Jacqueline battles for her son's right to an education in the face of a world that is not just indifferent but actively prejudiced against her son. The only perceptible link between the tales seems to be the use of popular songs (such as "Café de Flore") and the repeated shot of an album cover of songs in praise of women that appears in both tales. As the film unfolds, however, so we understand how director Jean-Marc Vallée is preoccupied with the theme of obsession: both Jacqueline and Carole seem unnaturally attached to their nearest and dearest - so much so, in fact, that they find it increasingly difficult to let go. Jacqueline suffers acute feelings of jealousy when Laurent finds a girl friend Véronique (Alice DuBois), while Carole consults a medium (Emmanuelle Beaugrand- Champagne) to see whether there is anything in her past that might explain her feelings for Antoine. The dénouement reveals that there is more than just a tangential link between Jacqueline and Carole, which has a lot to do with the perpetual presence of the past within the present. Vallée's film has a disjointed narrative structure, with many fast cuts between scenes, as well as the introduction of short dream sequences comprised of bright colors. It takes a bit of getting used to, but at the end we understand that the director is trying to explore the psychological state of mind of his two principal female characters cinematically, as well as telling a story.Whether the film works as a cohesive piece is a different matter. We understand the basic implications of the story by means of an (uncredited) narrator who sets the scene for the film, but she is never heard again after the first thirty minutes. As a screenwriter, Vallée does spring some pleasurable surprises - especially at the end, which is quite upbeat, in view of the subject-matter. He handles character extremely well: the delineations between the two central female protagonists are clearly identified, and extremely well defined by Paradis and Florent. But I was still left feeling that the visuals rather detracted from what was in essence a highly powerful story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematography, the use of music and a very dynamic editing (done by Vallée himself) are the strong features of this movie.Unfortunately, when it comes to the 'meat', script, dialogue and acting, the movie is showing weakness. All the main characters are badly played, partly because they don't have a lot to say, partly because the casting is bad. The only good acting is from the 2 kids with Down syndrome.When he comes to 'explain' the characters, Vallée uses very little dialogue. So half of the movie is just watching the main characters smiling stupidly in front of the camera. Or talking to a psychiatrist (I prefer to understand a character in a way that is not a lazy shortcut like this interview).Overall, a movie that reminds me a little bit of Kie&#x15b;lowski (Double life of Veronique) or Terence Malick (the conflict 'resolution' at the end of Tree Of Life).Ambitious movie that only partially succeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a sap, I hold my hands up, Something like The American Tail sets me off whenever it's on TV. I found myself nearly wiping my snotty nose on the back of the cinema seat in front of me but was saved by a flash of on-screen comedy (not to give anything away).I went to watch this today not knowing anything about it apart that it was directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and that it was sold to me as a supernatural/romance story. Great! i'll give it a go... I was glued to my seat after 5 minutes by it's beautiful cinematography/editing and subject matter. Two stories from different eras. One man, with everything in his life but feels a sense of underlying conflict about his relationship with his ex wife. One woman, caring for her son who has Down's syndrome. The stories are inter-cut (non linear) and unrelated but as we progress we begin to see similarities. You don't want to know the whole story, it really is a hammer to the heart. You feel emotionally involved with what's unfolding (and a whole lot of stuff unfolds) that will leave you either rushing out to declare your true love to someone or, you'll end up walking on your own through a city with an icy heart (I haven't decided which yet). There will be themes that you will be familiar with, broken relationships, jealousy, Maternal obligations/ or not. A brilliant cast and script, important subject matter and a 'diluted Lynchian' ending serves this up to be an essential watch.My advice is don't read too much about the story. Leap of faith ;) Oh and it features some amazing music... but there's a point to that too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in one word: MAGICAL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays there are few films which have ability to provoke thoughts and leave a lasting impression. Cafe de Flore was one movie i was easily going to skip but i forced myself to see the trailer once before cutting the title off my list. The trailer was enough to compel me watch the film and thus i did. Now, i have got to say this is the best movie so far of 2012.The movie is a revelation by all means, it's something we haven't seen before and to experience such a quality cinema these days is a rarity. To write too much about the plot would be unfair but it revolves around to parallel stories, one in Paris 1960's about a mother and her mongoloid son and the other in contemporary Montreal about a DJ who give up his first love for another girl.The acting in this ensemble drama is a complete standout. The ones which leave a mark are Vanessa Paradis, Kevin Parent and child star Marin Gerrier.I would have to praise the director Jean-Marc Vallee for making a film with such innovation in film making. His style and approach is completely different, the movie is in fragments put together. Different characters, periods, ages and subplots all jumbled and the element that binds the movie together is music. Movie uses the music in a best way possible, it transcends the movie high and creates an effect which would be impossible to create without such brilliant use of music.I could have given the film 10 but a little improvement towards the ending could have helped make it a masterpiece. I won't write about that. Also a little further development in few characters would have been better.I think the movie wouldn't have been of such intensity if it wasn't made in such bizarre manner, it confuses you, gives answers and makes you think. Still i believe the movie won't be praised by everyone, it requires people who like experiencing something unconventional and strange yet plausible. Perfect example of modern movie making and totally unique love story with near perfect impact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not too keen to check this one out because I have an aversion to Vanessa Paradis but all I can say is that I am glad I did see it and will happily see it again and certainly buy the DVD when it becomes available. It is, of course, no secret that the French are past masters of delicate, fragile even, emotional story telling on celluloid and clearly French Canadians are not far behind. It takes a while - say a good two reels - to get its emotional claws into you but once it does ... There are two stories unravelling here some forty years apart; in present day Montreal a successful disc jockey, father of two young daughters, meets a woman he feels is his soul mate and albeit reluctantly divorces his wife. He does not do this lightly - in fact guilt drives him to seek psychiatric help - for he had known his wife since they were children. She in turn has never even kissed another man and is distraught at the break. The eldest daughter is also unhappy at the fragmenting of her life and loses no opportunity to play her parents' 'special' song in an effort to drive her father back into her mother's arms. Meanwhile in Paris Vanessa Paradis gives birth to a son with Down's syndrome in 1969. It is too much for the husband who is all for placing the child in a home specializing in care for such children but when Paradis will not entertain such a notion he abandons both wife and child. Paradis, with little money, becomes a single working mother lavishing love on the child and they become sufficiently close to verge on the unhealthy. At the age of seven the son meets and immediately bonds with a girl who is similarly afflicted. The two become inseparable to the point where Paradis intervenes, clearly unable to face sharing her son's unconditional love. The two stories are obviously linked - or else why show us both - and we switch fluidly between the two in awe of - whilst at the same time basking in - the power of love as manifested in two entirely different forms. The acting by everyone concerned is outstanding as is the writing and directing yet I fear it may fail to find its audience which would be a tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb movie- It touches you in a deep and unrevealed way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything went right in this movie. An absolute art piece of acting, directing &amp; production. The story, common. They used two trivial real life examples and made it sound like beauty. Pure touching beauty, that we keep to ourselves everyday. The pain that we ignore in it everyday. It wakes us up to the real meaning of love, marriage, relationships, signs, God. It explains the meaning of existence through a different set of characters always connected- like we all are. At the end, it makes you wish to go back in time and chose your life all over again, differently. And then, as you can't, it makes you accept life, as what it is meant to be will be.Not sure if the entire audience will appreciate the "soulmate" concept explored in it but doubt this amazing film will get bad reviews. The soundtrack, camera, actors made it impossible despite the message in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am afraid I do not agree with the acclaim this film has received on IDMB. It's just an OK film, which towards the end takes a mystic turn which spoils it entirely for me. Other reviews have mentioned "if you can suspend your disbelief," well I suppose that in the context of this film, I can't. Of course, one could try to refuse the mystic reading, and that would work up to the end credits. In greater detail, I found the contemporary (Canadian) part of the story excellent, believable, interesting, true, engaging and very well told. On the contrary, I found the sixties (Parisienne) part of the story dull and boring, and difficult to believe. All in all, certainly a dignified effort from the director and screenwriters, but a film that I would only recommend half-heartedly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first third of the film, I kind of enjoyed the part of the story that was set in Paris in the 1960s, and was willing to go along with the modern-day story, even though it wasn't all that convincing. But the modern-day part of the film just kept getting worse as it went along -- unconvincing acting and storyline, and the "spiritual" and "romantic" aspect really came across as the enactment of a middle-aged guy's fantasy of having everything you want, and having everyone love you for essentially being a jerk. I left the theater feeling annoyed and ripped off. It would have been a much better film if the director had stuck with the Paris in the 1960s plot line and developed it better. That part of the film had some real potential, but unfortunately the whole thing didn't add up to a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cafe de Flore or a coffee on every rebirth. Whether behind our actions stand reasons set out in the untouchable past or we should not deepen so much? At least one thing is certain - the actions we do draw our future destinies, and our relationships with others are the most important.About what we should not be, about - to trust more on our intuition and most importantly, to seek peace and love. You know the saying - if you love something, let it go and if it comes back to you, no one wants it. About breaking with childhood and building a complete figures based on clearly conscious desires and ideas.I give this high rate, because I liked also the boldness of the film. Because its quality did not suffer from the "vulgar" storyline, because it showed that electronic music has messages as worldviews. Because it showed that money does not make happiness - happiness does not depend on them, but the opposite. it needs a balance. And because through the mouth of the medium it connected the world of faith and reason.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, but difficult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IF you have the patience, then this is a potentially rewarding film for art house film buffs. The acting, photography and especially the use of musical emotional cues are all excellent. However it must be stated that the frequent jump cuts and fake (yes fake! its all in Carols head!) flashbacks will make this a very hard film to follow in the first viewing.The movie tries to balance a fine line between spirituality and something I would call normal life, without that kind of artificial psychological helper mechanisms, but it does end up being somewhat confused in that regard. Clearly the writer has met some pretty disturbed personalities in his life. Personally I am a cold fish, so this movie is an interesting look into the life of people who are clearly guided by pure emotion, but it is pretty obvious to me at least that most of the characters here would be better served with a little less reliance on feelings :-) - but that is just me...One thing that honestly annoyed me is the Canadian french spoken in the Montreal part of the movie - I'm not a native french speaker, but I do have 3 years of high school french, and it was a lot easier to understand the French in the Paris parts, and it was obvious to me that most of the Canadian sections would have been better served with the characters speaking English instead. So be warned and watch it with subtitles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Café De Flore is everything I love about French Canadian movies : story that lingers for quite some time in your mind, amazing soundtrack, charismatic leads, great images.The movie travels through time and space (Montréal and Paris) and explores several relationships which eventually merge into one. There's the DJ from Montréal, who is torn between two women and his daugthers, and the Parisian mother of a Down syndrome child, interpreted by a very convincing Vanessa Paradis. Both protagonists try to find a balance in order to love without causing any pain to themselves and others.The song that gave its title to the movie is pervasive but never annoying and it leads the characters to their common end like notes on a music sheet.Café De Flore explores the idea of reincarnation, karma, relationships, love, family and human suffering in a very modern and poetic way.Jean Marc Vallée made a great job in living up to the expectation of anyone who's seen and like CRAZY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cafe de Flore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Café de Flore is a Canadian and French film in French with English subtitles. The film focuses on a number of different stories that seem to be connected somehow, but what remains true in all of them and is the focus and I think I should say, goal of the movie is to show love in various different forms. The film shows a young mother's love of her son who lives with Down syndrome, the film shows a 40 year old DJ who seems to have just fallen out of love with what he thought was his soul mate and the wife he leaves behind who thinks there is still a connection to all this. Jacqueline is the mother of Laurent, and they live in late 1960's Paris, France. Jacqueline has raised Laurent, on her own now for seven years. She never seems to be lonely or in despair that she is alone because all the love, affection and attention she could ever want, or have is shown through her curious, but incredibly insightful and gifted son, Laurent. Laurent is the apple of Jacqueline's eye and just means the world to her. Laurent, having had no other real close friends and no father figure has also grown incredibly attached to his mother. They seem as if they are real soul mates. Things take a turn however when at school Laurent meets another student who likes him just for who he is and he can share the some bond with them and the same type of love which he has for Jacqueline, which at first is exciting, but then all too soon is almost catastrophic for her because she does not want to lose the one and most important love in her life to another. The disc jockey is named Antoine and since he was a teen he shared his passionate love of music with his girlfriend Carole. She not only loved the same music and things as he did, but they both genuinely loved each other and thought they would forever. What changed though? The film gives no easy answers other than things we piece together such as Antoine perhaps going through a mid life crisis and in some ways maybe not knowing what he really wants. All this is explored throughout these characters and events in Café de Flore and there is also an almost supernatural or other worldly I might say, type of connection that will draw some together and help them cope. Café de Flore was quite an interesting film. It has it's own unique visual style of slow shots set to atmospheric music and I found that it worked well. The central theme and message about the film, being love and showing it in it's many forms, whether they be pleasant, or not, I found to be quite intriguing. The part that I hinted about in this review of an almost supernatural type connection is one part of the film that on one viewing alone, I did not quite understand fully, or even get it's significance, but it was still interesting enough and I don't think it took anything away from the film other than the fact that I may need to see it again to absorb and understand everything and appreciate it more. The acting here is all excellent from the entire cast. They all do great in their different roles and because the writing is so good here the actors and actresses show off such emotion and passion in the scenes they are in and they do a great job because of the well written characters they are playing and also because they are very talented at what they do. I liked the whole theme on love and it's different forms and ways of showing love or even telling one that you care about them. I really enjoyed Jacqueline's story in the film with her son, Laurent. I found it to be completely believable and a love that I could not only understand, but feel compassion and connected to. This is a woman so totally devoted to her son, that in a lot of ways I personally was not all that surprised that Jacqueline later feels threatened and scared of losing him because of how much he is to her world and how much she is to his as well. Antoine's story has a lot more under the surface type of details that we pick more upon as the film goes on. His love and difficulty with it in areas is not always as clear, or as easy to put into words, but I appreciated how the film gave no easy answers and instead gave us a character to ponder and really think about. The film has a style all it's own that I really liked and I also really liked the strong characters and writing as well as the terrific performances. This film will definitely speak to individual viewers on their own levels, or even on their own understandings of love, or what they just saw, but that does not take anything away from the film, it just leaves different ways to understand and appreciate it. That is one of many reasons why this film is highly recommended and a huge success.</fullReview>

Once the story develops you expect to understand the story shortly but you have to wait and wait before understanding the plot. After you find out what the story is all about more than one hour after the beginning of the film you might appreciate it better. However the actors are all superb and the cinematography also. The music is good all through the film. Sometimes it is hard to understand the dialogue with the music being too loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An empty shell, beautifully filmed and great music with a story that want's to be great but is unfortunately kind of empty, the casting of the main characters as a younger version of themselves is so weak, that eventually only through strong dialogue did I get that the actors were playing younger versions of the leads... Bad casting... However the leads are great, namely Helene Florent, Vanessa Paradis and Kevin Parent... The story sucks... Beautiful shots but empty of meanings... A great idea, badly executed! And yet I was SO looking forward to it, as I loved Crazy by the same director. This isn't Dr.Zhivago or the English patient at all... I don't know what it is, and I can't believe the good press it's getting! It's even quite a bit pretentious....</fullReview>
