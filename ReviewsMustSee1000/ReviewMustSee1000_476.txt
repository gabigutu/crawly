		<fullReview>You'll need to inhale, then exhale slowly and relax before plunging into the world of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), lobbyist and bag man for the Tobacco Industry. The laughs are some of the best abdominal exercise I've ever had at the movies. Thank You for Smoking is far and away the best satire to come out of Hollywood in years. The last attempt I remember was WAG THE DOG. This film is far better at true satire, its wit biting do-gooders and do-badders alike. It has been too long since Satire and the Politically Incorrect Sense of Humor have been allowed to point out the absurd in all sides of an issue. If you don't laugh out loud, your sense of humor has become a casualty of malpractice by the Doctors of Spin and the Nursemaids of Political Correctness.Young Jason Reitman's direction and screenplay are deft and light. He is never heavy-handed, or worse, condescending (as may have happened more than once in WAG THE DOG). Based on a novel by Christopher Buckley (the son of William F. Buckley), the script is the star here. The double, triple, and sometimes quadruple entendres are spoken conversationally by a star-studded ensemble cast, who clearly revel in great material and great lines. Every reviewer opines that this will be Aaron Eckhart's break-out role. With his Dudley-Do-Right face and "that guy who always gets the girl----- on crack" charm and glibness, his Nick Naylor is the ultimate purveyor of the spin doctor's prescription: "the means justify the end".The casting director should be congratulated in the same breath as the director. Rob Lowe as the "genius" behind Hollywood "EGO", a consultant firm which helps raise financing for movies with strategic product placement, is note-perfect in a "small role". With William H. Macy, the Vermont Senator who takes on the tobacco industry, Maria Bello, a fellow Merchant of Death lobbyist, and Robert Duvall, the "Captain" of this particular industry--- the cast is jaw-dropping, and sublimely funny. Katie Holmes, pre-TomKat, is gorgeous, seductive, and completely believable as the reporter who stops at nothing to get her story.Nick Naylor's relationship with his son is the lens which focuses Nick on his own behavior. Even that relationship is not treated as a cliché, or completely reverently by the satirist, who remains true to the last frame to the goal of letting the air out of our self-righteousness. It is a breath of fresh air. I not only recommend it, I intend to see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Thank You" for a good satire!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, sorry for the cheesy title. I couldn't help myself. Second of all, "Thank You for Smoking" is, in fact, a darn good satire - one of the best I've seen since "Election". Aaron Eckhart holds the picture together with a witty, charismatic performance as a tobacco lobbyist. The film is basically about his profession as he spins the news, pitches a movie idea, dodges a subpoena, has an affair with a reporter (Katie Holmes), tries to spend time with his son (Cameron Bright), and has lunch with an alcohol lobbyist (Maria Bello) and a firearms rep (David Koechner) - where they literally compare body counts. The performances are excellent across the board, from William H. Macy's crusading Senator to Rob Lowe's smirking Hollywood agent who struts around his office in a kimono. Even Adam Brody is enjoyable as Lowe's hyperactive assistant whose in-joke with a co-worker earned one of the biggest laughs of the movie.The majority of the credit, however, needs to go to first-time feature director Jason (son of Ivan) Reitman. Adapting from Christopher Buckley's novel, Reitman has fashioned an enormously clever script, consistent and strong in character, yet not forgetting to be incredibly funny. The style is also perfect - brisk, light-hearted, with impeccable timing marred only by a tangental subplot including Sam Elliott that is, sadly, not very funny. Overall, however, the pace is fast enough where the laughs keep coming.Reitman also does the unthinkable: he keeps the satire dark and funny to the very end. While most comedies stray blindly into the sentimental, "Thank You" avoids unnecessary emotional tripe and - thankfully - avoids sermonizing about the dangers of smoking or of the flaws of the political process. Eckhart's flawless performance and Reitman's wonderful screenplay anchor an uncommonly perceptive comedy, provided you take yours black. If you need a little cream and sugar, "Fun with Dick and Jane" might still be at the dollar theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thinking Man's Comedy You Can Take Your Parents To</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the most enjoyable film we saw at Sundance. Smart and funny is not an easy pairing to find these days. Thank You For Smoking provides thought provoking content delivered through a network of great acting performances that make this film so thought provokingly hilarious.This comedy, unlike many that grace the screen these days, is clean enough to take your parents to, and funny enough that you will forget you are at the movies with your mom. It was truly refreshing how no one in the film was filmed smoking a cigarette. Rob Lowe's character provides a wonderful satire of the corporate film world. I only hope that the intelligence level of this film does not keep it from gaining mainstream appeal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just saw this as it premiered in Toronto - awesome cast, very funny dialog, and more than skin deep. First time director does a nice job - and the opening credits are noteworthy. RECOMMENDED. Pokes fun at the smoking industry (and lobbyists), but at others as well, and its hard to disagree with the sharp satire. Rob Lowe's small role is priceless, the casting was perfect across the board. Nick Naylor's (Eckart) relationship with his son is center and keeps some genuine qualities through all the laughs. My friend and I both rated this near the top or at the top of the 7 films we saw in Toronto last weekend. Not sure what its distribution / release schedule is yet, as there was still some debate over who had actually purchased the rights to it. Eckart in person came across as very genuine and is also in another great upcoming movie - Neverwas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to say it. but this movie is gonna fail in the box office. for the same reason no one showed up to its screening. but this will be one of the most entertaining cult movies ever. although it lacks the glam and actually will turn a lot of people away before they even get to the box office do to the subject matter, but they will all be missing out on a hilariously made movie. I don't think i've laughed this hard in a long long time. this movie isn't really intended to be anti-smoking propaganda, but there is some of it. Its more of a satire on the reality of people and how much we're willing to believe or willing to be dooped. I see it similar to liar liar not being about about the legal system but the moral and ethical decisions of people within society. overall I would have to saw this is a great great movie. Highly recommend it. And could not imagine this movie to turn out any better than it has already been with the perfect cast and great story line. I think the best way to encompass the movie is paraphrased in the movie's catchy advertising line the main character, Nick Naylor doesn't lie, he filters the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny edu-tainment that doesn't take sides</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie at a screening in DC last night. It was great. Aaron Eckhart, the single leading man with the WORST haircut in Hollywood (full disclosure - I'm damn near bald) matches very well with the direction of Reitman. From the get-go, it's a fast-paced send-up of everyone and everything in the tobacco war. The entire cast does a good job (w/ the exception, maybe, of Katie Holmes). Rob Lowe is hysterical in his cameo, but I have to say Eckhart &amp; his MOD squad buddies (Maria Bello &amp; David Koechner) really light up the screen. Their scenes of discussing the dealing out of death through the industries they represent over drinks are a real strong point of the movie.The fact that this movie doesn't take sides - and really, could be about any issue, because it's more about the MAN behind the spokesperson - but makes fun of all sides in the tobacco issue. The interaction b/w Nick Naylor (Eckhart) &amp; the old Marlboro Man (Sam Elliot) is priceless, as is the back-and-forth between Naylor &amp; Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) towards the end of the film -it's basically good actors doing what they do well - and it's very funny.The movie's also a little bit touchy-feely, focusing for a bit on the relationship b/w Naylor &amp; his son, Joey (Cameron Bright) - the kid's good &amp; some of the lines written for him are priceless.There was one odd, stupid thing - and my wife agrees w/ me on this, so I'm not just being a guy; there are 2 'sex' scenes w/ Eckhart &amp; Katie Holmes, but zero nudity. Nada. Not even partial. We see them having sex in multiple places &amp; positions, but they're almost completely clothed. It just took away from the credibility is all I'm trying to point out here - as I said, my wife actually made the comment before I did.Bottom line, it's a great movie - well worth the price of admission. It's funny, it's entertaining &amp; it moves, what more could you ask for?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny movie: looks at ALL sides of the debate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this at Sundance last night (actually it was a Salt Lake screening, and thus the filmmakers didn't bother to drive 30 miles to talk to us...not that I am bitter...) At first I was a bit worried that this was going to be the old hat anti smoking movie that makes all smokers victims of the eeeeevil tobacco companies, but then I saw that it was based on a Christopher Buckley novel and I relaxed a bit! This pokes fun at all sides of the issue, from the tobacco lobbyist's insistence that there has been "no conclusive proof" that tobacco is harmful, to the legislator's thinking that putting a warning label on cigarettes will actually make someone pick up a cigarette package, read the label, and decide not to smoke...as if ANYONE with half a brain doesn't know that inhaling smoke into your lungs will harm you.Aaron Eckhart did a fine job in his role, as did Sam Elliot, Rob Lowe, Katie Holmes...I could go on and on. It's fascinating to watch Eckhart's character spin and spin so that he brings people around to his way of thinking. He has to be representing one of the most hated industries in the United States, yet he is able to convince people as to the opposite! I highly recommend this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nicotine Kick in satire and sarcasm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EDITED to omit reported 'spoilers'. And by spoilers I don't mean the "Bruce Willis is dead" type, but "Bruce Willis is bald" types. *sigh*Some jobs are harder than others but Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), tobacco industry spokesman, handles his with effortless skill. Along with two other spokespeople for the alcohol- and firearms industry respectively, he is part of the self-appointed M.O.D. squad ("Merchants of Death") whose main objective is to talk. To BS. To spin. To confuse and convince their opponent, and charm their audience. A job of such nature naturally requires a certain moral flexibility, and with smooth-talk and sex appeal, it is apparent that Nick is incredibly gifted in this area.He goes on TV-shows, verbally battles U.S. senators, deems the Cancer Research Foundation "arseholes" ? all the while trying to set an example for his 10-year-old son. This is naturally very difficult, doing what he does. So as Big Tobacco (for whom he is a lobbyist) launches a campaign to reinstate the "cool smoking" image into mainstream Hollywood, and sends Nick to work a producer for the proper product-placement, Nick decides to bring his son along for the ride, to see "how daddy works" in hopes to bond with him.Good satires are hard to come by, but Reitman's "Thank You For Smoking" is so wet with sarcasm and dripping with humour that it is impossible not to enjoy. It navigates the fast-paced industry, the art of talking and spoofs the anti-smoking camp with their chiché "cancer-sick boy in a wheelchair" front (as seen in the opening scene of the film), and it explores the moral flexibility of Americans, without preaching too much in doing so. Only once does it fall prey to predictable moral messages, as when Nick starts reevaluating his work and has moral qualms following his kidnapping by an anti-smoking group, only to swoop down into tongue-and-cheek mode again and return twice as biting ? and twice as funny.Although the film is evenly peppered with fun one-liners and perfect delivery from its cast, the best scene is when the M.O.D. squad are at their usual restaurant hang-out at the end of the day and brag to each other and argue over whose business kills the most people per year. Nick: "How many alcohol-related deaths per day? 100,000? That's what... 270 a day? Wow. 270 people, tragedy. Excuse me if I don't exactly see terrorists getting excited about kidnapping anyone from the alcohol-industry." Maria Bello who plays the detached, funny Moderate Spokeswoman for alcohol has great in-your-face aptitude and attitude, "That's stupid arguing." Aaron Eckhart is also hilarious throughout in a shady businessman way (I now have a major crush on him). Out of all the cast, only Nick's little kid Joe chokes on the well-written lines.In fact, even the cinematography is well-crafted in the film... just the way a scene cuts to another deserves credit, opening with a rapid-fire ironic note. Speaking of which, "Thank You"'s opening montage of cigarette packages as credits is a stroke of genius on Reitman's part. So are the various casting choices ? the amount of respected actors that have been crammed into supporting roles in impressive (Robert Duvall, Sam Elliot, William H. Macy) and give rise to an almost familiar and "feel-good" tone in the film. That said, I wouldn't call this "laugh-out-loud worthy" exactly and I didn't care for the ending but it is clear that a lot of thought has been put into Thank You For Smoking ? every line is a well-articulated kick up the arse to something and delivered by the bucket-load. A very enjoyable little satire.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very smart, funny and interesting movie. I seldom say that about any movie. The story of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry who's job is to put a spin on cigarettes, improve their image, make them cool again, and prevent one senator from getting legislature to mandate that cigarette companies place a large graphic skull and cross bones on each pack sold.Nick Naylors character is brilliant. While he was "selling" the public on his ideas and views and convincing them, his own son, and everyone else that he is correct he actually sold me too with his good looks, charm, and logic.Everyone knows that smoking causes cancer and anyone who attempts to sell or promote it won't garner any sympathy for lagging sales. That's where the spin doctor Nick comes in to teach everyone that smoking is cool.Excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ivan Reitman must be so proud. I'm not kidding, his son Jason has come out with a caustic original comedy all his own. I don't know what people outside Los Angeles may make of this. They may think is science fiction when, in fact, most people who have spent any time there knows that this is as normal as going to church in the Vatican. The scenes inside the CAA like agency are even underplayed if you believe that. Aaron Eckhart is as perfect as they come. The charming monster with human sides. William H Macy, Rob Lowe and the rest of the cast are great fun to watch. I'm rooting for this movie to make a zillion bucks. It'll be nice to have more good writing, good acting and good direction in March for a change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the opening scene of "Thank You for Smoking", Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) Tobacco Lobbyist is a guest on the Joan Lunden Talk Show with a young boy Robin, who is a dying of lung cancer. Nick somewhat sympathetic, makes his argument that it is in his best interest to keep people like Robin alive so they can continue to smoke cigarettes. Nick proclaims that the Tobacco Industry will spend $50 million on campaign to educate kids against smoking. Nick wins over the entire studio audience for his humanitarian stance. A young woman sitting by also watching the movie, voices that "I am very annoyed." She might have been clued in by the movie audience laughter that satire lives and thrives in Jason Reitman's "Thank You for Smoking". Reitman's screenplay based on the book by Christopher Buckley (son of William Buckley), "Thank You for Smoking" is painfully hilarious and a clever dark comedy focused on the multi-billion dollar Tobacco Industry. Writer and Director Rietman has a similar conceit as his main character Nick Naylor as he tells his story in the context of freedom and the consequence of choice?however skewed the context. Aaron Eckhart is amazing as Nick, Time Magazine's "Sultan of Spin". As Nick describes himself, "Michael Jordan plays ball. Charles Manson kills people. I talk." His Nick Naylor is the Vice-President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies, or in English he is a Tobacco Lobbyist. He is a master at what he does. Nick is also the political target of Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who wants to stamp all cigarettes with a "poison" label.Every week Nick has dinner with the MOD squad?that would be the "Merchants of Death." Polly Bailey (smart and sexy Mario Bello) is with the Alcohol Lobby. Bobby Jay Bliss (classic good old boy David Koechner) is with the Firearms Lobby. Big dog Nick reminds Polly that she is only responsible for two deaths per day, only. It turns out that Nick is scheduled for an interview with reporter Heather Holloway (hot and lethal Katie Holmes) who according to Bobby Jay has "spectacular t?s". Of course Nick is never over his head. At the same time Nick's boss BR (absolutely funny JK Simmons) arranges meeting with entertainment agency EGO's CEO Jeff Megall (played by Rob Lowe at his comic straight man best) in Los Angeles. Nick is after getting smoking back in the movies? re-establishing it as sexy and cool. Nick makes a case to his ex-wife Jill (Kim Dickens) that this would be an opportunity for him to spend quality time with their son Joey (kind of eerily played by Cameron Bright). He fails; however Joey presents a winning argument that gains him a trip to Los Angeles with his Dad.In a signature scene reporter Heather (Holmes) asks Nick (Eckhart), "Why do you do what you do?" Unflinching Nick says, "Population control." Then he cops to "Everyone's got to pay the mortgage?" This is funny and dead on. Director Rietman maintains this absurdest ecology?there is no envelop for his material and at the same time he generates genuine sympathy for his characters. And in the business world it is all about the bottom line. In another classic scene Nick delivers a brief case with $25 million to the lung cancer stricken Marlborough Man (a great Sam Elliot)?who can either keep the money for his family; thus shutting his mouth to the media or give it all away to charity. The offer is non-negotiable. Everyone has to pay their mortgage. Walking on the Santa Monica Pier with his son Joey, Nick advises on the virtues of being morally "flexible". The writing in "Thank You for Smoking" is so smart and drop dead funny?so to speak.The performances are equally stunning, starting with Aaron Eckhart as Nick. Eckhart is a great looking leading man who is edgy and has impeccable comedic timing. He plays Nick with the innate charm that tempers his arrogance and aloofness. His Nick is doing his best to spin the tobacco industry's aftermath, and still raise his son to make up his own mind as he grows up. Not easy?even without the cigarettes issue. Cameron Bright is smart and strangely endearing as Joey, who really has the choice of despising or admiring his father. Robert Duvall is at his caricature best as the Captain of the Tobacco Industry. Rob Lowe is another standout as the totally affected EGO head Jeff Megall. There is comic genius when the kimono attired Jeff calls Nick saying that "It's 4 am in Japan. I'm calling from the future." Director Rietman goes where few dare, and makes us laugh at our darker nature. He also tells a story of the responsibilities of freedom and choice, and the consequences all with a sense of humor. See "Thank You for Smoking"?it is one of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At long, long last, a movie for which I can write a positive commentary. And to think I wouldn't have even gone out of my way to see this film, had it not been for the good luck of winning tickets on the radio.Nick Naylor's omnipresent smirk is symbolic of this film's wry wit. Now, its not the vile, "George W. Bush smirk". Its a "kid playing a joke smirk".The writing is clever and human. Except for an absurd kidnapping, the story is very human, as well are the characters. The acting is superb.I found myself laughing out loud. The theater erupted in applause at the conclusion. The American film-going public needs more films like Thank You for Smoking. We need fewer remakes of old classics. We need fewer copfilms, chases, special effects, heists and super heroes and more good writing and original ideas.My hat is off to Jason Reitmann.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was quite the clever satire. But it's not really about smoking. I was reminded of Cinderella Man (last year's best film). That one wasn't really a boxing movie: it was about a man realizing what was important in his life, and boxing was just a means to an end. Thank You for Smoking isn't trying to convince people to smoke, or, not to smoke. It's about choice. Well, that's what the characters are lobbying for, quite literally. Maybe since this is a dark comedy, it doesn't really have any moral high ground. But Aaron Eckhart, who plays the lead role of Tobacco industry spokesperson Nick Naylor, and is playing a character who himself smokes, doesn't actually light up a cigarette on camera.Nick Naylor's job is spin, and he's damn good at it. As he tells his 12 year old son, who idolizes his father, you're never on the wrong side of an argument if you can support your facts, and most importantly, prove the other person wrong. And it's not that Naylor thinks cigarettes are the greatest invention ever: he does what he does for the challenge. His tasks in this film include getting cigarettes back into movies, preferably being used by Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones right after a zero-g sex scene, and to convince a congressional subcommittee to not include a new poison icon on all packs of cigarettes.The movie is full of subplots and great supporting characters, but the movie doesn't seem weighed down by them. It still moves along rather briskly and clocks in at about 90 minutes. But at the same time it never loses its dual focus: that of Naylor's relationship with his son, where he's still trying to be a good role model despite how hated he is by others for what he does, and with the other focus just being the brilliance of Naylor's spin. Eckhart shines in this film. He never rambles. He always gets his two cents in, and more. He's clever throughout, and no matter what evil it is that he may be defending, you can't help but like and admire him.And I must go over some of this supporting cast. Maria Bello and David Koechner join Naylor for lunch once a week, and as respective representatives for the alcohol, firearms, and tobacco industries, they refer to themselves as the Merchants of Death and have quite a lively meal/debate. William H. Macy is Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre, who loves his state of Vermont's cheese and is one of the most outspoken adversaries of Big Tobacco. I loved J.K. Simmons as BR, Naylor's boss. He just has such a loud mouth: I love hearing him swear and rant in movies. You also have Robert Duvall as The Captain: the guy BR has to run policy through and who is idolized by anyone working in Big Tobacco; Sam Elliott as a former Marlboro Man who is dead-set against not shutting up in anger until Naylor spins a few things; Katie Holmes as a reporter Naylor falls for; Rob Lowe as a movie producer who'll take funding from anyone and can spin as well as Naylor, and Dennis Miller as (thankfully) himself.So then, I don't think this movie takes sides at all on tobacco. It's a movie for people actually capable of looking at an issue from both sides, and to find humor in it all. I guess that means it's not for Republicans. And even if you go into this movie thinking you won't be impressed, I think Naylor will work his magic and convince you otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Right Smoked Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lawyers are often asked how they can act for clients who are clearly bad people who ought to be in jail. Once the arguments like "everyone is entitled to a fair trial" and "everyone is presumed innocent" are swept aside, it usually gets down to "well, I've got a mortgage to pay." So it is for lobbyists for unpopular industries. There is no legal industry more unpopular than Big Tobacco and in this film Aaron Eckhart plays with great relish, Nick Naylor, a superb operator with absolutely no shame who prosecutes Big Tobacco's cause at venues ranging from grade school classes to congressional committees.First ?time director Reitman derived his screenplay from Christopher Buckley's 1994 book, and in the book there is a deeper motivation than the "must pay the mortgage" defence. Chris Buckley happens to be the son of the wealthy right-wing columnist and political gadfly William F Buckley and Chris shares his father's politics to some degree. If you are against the state telling people what to do (ie, not smoke) it is logical to support the tobacco companies, who, after all are only providing a substance people are free not to use. The problem with this libertarian position is of course externalities ? others are affected by the smoker's actions through passive smoking and the state will still have to foot the bill for the smoker's medical treatment. So unless our smoker is going to smoke only with other smokers (or alone) and is prepared to pay for their medical treatment, the state has an interest.This issue is only lightly alluded to in what is a very clever, witty, snappily directed and rather superficial satire on lobbyists for pariah industries. The film does come close to being serious when Nick takes his perceptive 12 year old son Joey (wonderfully played by Cameron Bright) to various work engagements. How can a lobbyist for big tobacco justify what he does to his son? He does it, but I won't spoil your enjoyment of the movie by telling you how.The satire here is not subtle, and some of the performances border on caricature. William H Macy, however, as the anti-tobacco Senator for Vermont (home to cheese-created cholesterol), manages to avoid farce and produce a believable character.Christopher Buckley was reportedly pleased with this film though I think his message was obscured somewhat by the pyrotechnics of Aaron Eckhart's performance. Perhaps those champions of individual freedom are actually sociopaths, using liberty as an excuse for doing bad. I don't like being told what to do, or telling other people what to do, but sometimes there is no other choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Argument Or Negotiation?'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Reitman's 'Thank You For Smoking' is a remarkable satire about successful 'B***S***ting'. Oh the things one can get away with, the things one can turn around and twist just through words, charisma and a smile. All the characters are/were hypocrites. Even in the relationship between Nick and his son, we see how his own traits brush off on his son. Not only that, he teaches his own son how to get away with things just by using words. Reitman's execution and screenplay are very intriguing. He uses clever humour and the lines spoken by the actors are absurdly amazing and hilarious. The multiple meanings of the lines particularly stand-out. Also, Reitman's intentions in making this successful satire seem very genuine as the film is not pretentious nor condescending (as is the case with many of the so-called recent satires). There's a stellar cast of which all the actors (except Katie Holmes) naturally fit their parts. Aaron Eckhart carries the film. It's difficult to describe his performance in words as the actor seems to pulls it off with ease. Nick Naylor was meant for him. Acclaimed actors like William Huffman Macy, Maria Bello, Rob Lowe and Robert Duvall all do nothing short of excellence in their acting. Even Adam Brody provokes laughter. Katie Holmes is the weakest link but this can be easily overlooked as she's not there for long and the other actors compensate enough. The cinematography and background score are very effective and the visuals are impressive. The sepia tone and brightness gives the feeling of a classic movie where things are positively exaggerated. While some people find the film offensive because they think it promotes smoking but 'Thank You For Smoking' is not really about smoking. It's pretty much about politics. Political Incorrectness. I'll be watching this movie again because it deserves so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The chief spokesperson and lobbyist Nick Taylor (Aaron Eckhart) is the Vice-President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies. He is talented in speaking and spins argument to defend the cigarette industry in the most difficult situations. His best friends are Polly Bailey (Maria Bello) that works in the Moderation Council in alcohol business, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) of the gun business own advisory group SAFETY. They frequently meet each other in a bar and they self-entitle the Mod Squad a.k.a. Merchants of Death, disputing which industry has killed more people. Nick's greatest enemy is Vermont's Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), who defends in the Senate the use a skull and crossed bones in the cigarette packs. Nick's son Joey Naylor (Cameron Bright) lives with his mother, and has the chance to know his father in a business trip. When the ambitious reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) betrays Nick disclosing confidences he had in bed with her, his life turns upside-down. But Nick is good in what he does for the mortgage."Thank you for Smoking" is a great politically incorrect movie, that satirizes the phobia against smokers and cigarette industry. Aaron Eckhart is simply awesome in the role of a man that has argument and is good in talking. The witty screenplay is original, using cynical lines and amoral characters. I quited smoking almost twenty-five years ago, and I do not like smokers and cigarettes, but Nick Taylor is amazing spinning the truth to defend the cigarette industry to pay his mortgage. Like said in "An Inconvenient Truth": "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Obrigado Por Fumar" ("Thank you for Smoking")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is damn good at his job but that doesn't stop him being any less detested for it- he's a spokesperson for the tobacco companies, cleverly putting slants on 'proven' medical facts and observations. But he's facing a new opponent in the shape of Senator Finistirre (William H Macy) who's challenging him to come to a commitee and stand up against some new anti-smoking material he's discovered. He's also got to struggle to be a positive role model to his 12 year old son Joey (Cameron Bright) who he takes on a cross country trip to try and bond with. And, to top it all off, the tobacco giants are desperate to make smoking appear 'cool' in the movies again, a job they leave at the hands of Nick. But a double crossing reporter (Katie Holmes) and a group threatening to bump off Nick for the 'lives he's ruined', his own life is starting to look pretty bumpy on it's own.Always leave it to the small independent films to produce the best comedies, because they generally do a much better job of it than big over-blown Hollywood productions. TYFS has received a large number of generally glowing reviews up to this point...and I'm glad to say this will be another one.With a title and premise that was guaranteed to spark controversy (or maybe outrage would be a better word?) rather than go for shock value in any other way, this manages to be a consistently clever and sharp stab at the hypocrisy and over-reaction that can cloud those who make it their lives to poo poo tobacco and those who try and defend it, with one of the greatest cinematic characters in a while in Nick. He defends an industry I despise, so it's credit to the film that he struck a chord as such a savvy and charismatic guy who carries the film to the beat of his own tune. Great performances all round also do the film no end of favours, guided along by a screen play that dishes out witty and sparkling dialogue by the bucket-load, making the film a seemingly never-ending glee ride.Thank you for Smoking, Please come Again. ****</fullReview>

The story is very good and the dialogs witty.It is very sarcastic and even caustic but it will make you have a thought on what is the truth in our world. Everything here is discussed : how medias are manipulated, how big companies can decide what we see and what information we get.All the actors are very good, especially Rob Lowe playing president of EGO (nice acronym, huh ?) who is only sleeping on Sundays.If you are not convinced yet to go and rent this movie, I recommend that you take a look at the memorable quotes from the movie (available in the IMDb movie's file), you'll understand how funny and caustic it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A witty satire that doesn't take sides on the smoking controversy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A clever satire of the spin-world (thanks largely to its cast and a witty script by Jason Reitman), Thank You For Smoking comes on like Wag the Dog via The Insider ? it's a painfully honest insight into the tobacco industry, led by the narration of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), the Big Tobacco corporation's chief spokesman. His narcissistic self-infatuation ("Charles Manson kills people; I talk.") and sleazy tactics land him in trouble when he finds himself bribing a lung cancer victim in front of his pre-teen son, who is not yet old enough to smoke but is being influenced by his money-driven father.Nick has a lot on his mind. He's got pressure from an anti-smoking Senator (played brilliantly by William H. Macy), his boss, his ex-wife, fanatical groups on homicidal missions, a double-crossing reporter (Katie Holmes) and a Hollywood producer (Rob Lowe) trying to cast the perfect Hollywood glamorization of smoking (Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones are offered as the leads).The movie, directed by the son of Ivan Reitman (the "Ghosbusters" director/producer extraordinaire), balances absurdity with realism; moments of the film come across as poignant reflection while following scenes are completely the opposite. This balance is thrown off a bit sometimes ? David Koechner's portrayal of an NRA lobbyist is great but feels out of place, as if it belongs in a comedy in the vein of "Anchorman." And ultimately this uneven mix of the deadly serious (literally) with off-the-wall gags does catch up with the film; it eventually falls back upon its very strong script, which supports it (a lesser film might be affected more drastically with a weaker screenplay), but some scenes probably should have been toned down a bit to comply with the subtler and more realistic scenes. For what it's worth, the wacky scenes are extremely hilarious, but they seem to contradict other portions of the material.Jason is a better director than his father, though, and shows a lot of potential here: I'd say the direction is almost deserving of a more serious film. I'd love to see what he could do with a drama in the future.The movie also boasts an excellent lead performance by Aaron Eckhart, who oozes with sleaze, greed, corruption and a hidden sense of morals. He knows what he is doing is wrong, but he's not a stereotypical Hollywood motion picture "good guy" ? even the closing of the picture, without spoiling it, isn't the moralistic cop-out I had expected; the movie isn't a black-and-white painting of the smoking controversy; it doesn't take sides on either side of the debate.This is really being marketed incorrectly as the next "40-Year-Old Virgin" right now, but the film ? for the most part, anyway ? really isn't as hilarious as it is thought-provoking and engaging. Apart from a few aforementioned moments of utter absurdity, the majority of the film's duration involves some pretty serious topics, and it handles them well. It's not a bust-your-gut-funny movie, and it's perhaps not as strong as some reviews would lead you to believe, but it's one of the better satires in recent memory and certainly one of the more effective since Wag the Dog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Independent but Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was expecting to laugh a whole bunch while watching this satirical comedy. Unfortunately this movie has fallen victim to the spoilers of trailers. There were about 2 good laughs that were new to me, but the other 7, I had already seen in those marvelous trailers. I would have probably enjoyed Thank You for Smoking a bit better if I had not seen the trailers. So the lesson is to avoid trailers. Trailers are spoilers. The story was good, maybe because there haven't been any movies about a spokesperson for the tobacco industry. Still, you'll find some, possibly, Hollywood clichés, even if this is supposedly an independent film. I'd think the mainstream audience would enjoy this film, more so than Transamerica. Its style of jokes perhaps is the reason. For example, subtitles or symbols are introduced to add humor, which of course aren't seen by the characters. It doesn't make the movie any worse, but the type of humor is why I'd think casual film goers would enjoy this movie, and the satire is in some ways similar to what is on TV now a days. Sure it had some good jokes and was an interesting story, but as the film ended it just didn't fit together. Don't want to spoil it but there were some mix messages of what the movie was really about? Thank You for Smoking was a nice film, which seemed to have a unique story, but had some Hollywood influence.Spoilers Why didn't I like the ending?The movie was a satire on the people in charge of the tobacco industry. However it did show the good in the people, at least the lobbyist, Nick Naylor. The message was delivered that people had to do their jobs to get by in life, to have money to support it. Another was to decide for yourself and not let a higher power tell you what to believe. Yet in the end the tobacco industry lost and Nick decided not rejoin the industry. Tobacco was seen as the enemy once again. Nick should have rejoined and the industry should have continued. It's contradictory of what the start of he film was. The movie basically told the audience tobacco was bad directly, not through satire. It seemed as if a Hollywood producer got hold of the script and changed it to be morally correct. It just didn't fit. Unless the ending was a satire on how Hollywood movies end; good guys win. I doubt it. Well, it was based on a book, I don't know how it ended but either way I didn't like the ending of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does it feel to be hated by everyone? Nick Naylor is the spokesman of a cigar industry decided to "clean" the image of smoking. His character is poetic, from where he gets the nerve to go on with his job, to his utter manipulative skills and brave charisma. His character transforms those around him with major intelligence.Reitman's job is to execute perfectly the characters into their intentions but not with their way of executing them. That's saying that he does the obvious job to show the morally correct into "stupid" and the manipulative, soul-less pig into a "hero". Etcharkt throws an unseen sparkle, and the script is in charge of putting America into the focus, bringing the movie a smart edge. Nick Naylor's relationship with his son is deep and smart, emotional and vivid.But as Naylor says "think for yourself, don't be guided" don't let the movie convert you into a smoker or brilliant lobbyist.

		<fullReview>This movie rocked on so many levels it hurts. It was furiously funny and intelligent. You would think that from the title and movie image that the movie is about cigarette smoking. Cigarettes are not the main agenda of this movie. It really is about a well crafted, creative Spin Doctor named Nick Naylor. Nick is a lobbyist for cigarette companies. He is a master of talk and spin that could argue and charm anyone about a subject and this is really what the movie is about. I thoroughly enjoyed the Rasputin likeness of the character but he was also sprinkled with human qualities being a father and loving his son. So while we actively see him working as a lobbyist, his son questions his motives and methods and uses the same skill to work for him. I loved this about the movie.I particularly liked the "merchant of death" conversations and the extreme realness of language spoken by all characters. I have not had the pleasure of reading the book but look forward to looking it up and reading it when I get the chance.The movie is really about the freedom to think, I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I've seen come out of the last twenty years of Hollywood schlock.It's a testament to the quality of the script that so many brilliant actors attached themselves to a film that cost $7.5 million to make (chump change in modern productions). Aaron Eckhart owns this movie--he is the life and soul of Nick Naylor and brings every character around him into the world. Talents such as Rob Lowe and Sam Eliot hold pivotal roles but little screen time, in the true sense of what a supporting actor is supposed to be.Nick Naylor should be despised for his defense of an industry which deliberately addicts children and lies to the populace. But you won't. You'll love him for his honesty and intellect and the conviction that everyone deserves a defense, even tobacco companies. This is a movie which will make you think and should be discussed with other passionate, intelligent people.9 out of 10: Proof that comedies can go toe to toe with overwrought dramatic headliners and win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick (Aaron Eckhart) is an attractive, scumbag lobbyist for a pro-tobacco institute. This makes it difficult to raise his young son without damaging the youngster's ability to determine what is right or wrong. There are also problems with his ex-wife, soothing but shamefaced dinners with two fellow lobbyists, and an affair with an attractive reporter (Katie Holmes) on this season's agenda. Will Nick be a hero to anyone? And is his charmed but flawed existence about to take a wrong turn? What a year for lobbyists, indeed. We have Jack Abramoff and, now, Nick Naylor. The very attractive Eckhart is superb as the man whose love for debate supersedes his ethics. Surrounding him are wonderful supporting actors, including Holmes, Robert Duvall, Maria Bello, Sam Elliot, and the talented youngster, Cameron Bright. Let's all bow to concept and top-notch script, however. The movie's storyline is the reason this film is important and laudable.

		<fullReview>Jason Reitman has written and directed a fantastically funny film. It portrays a tobacco lobbyist, Nick Naylor, who will bend over backwards to make a buck. The part of Naylor is done exquisitely by Aaron Eckhart. His associates in crime do likewise for the alcohol and firearms industries. One of the high points of the film is the actor, Sam Elliott, portraying the Marlboro Man, Lorne Lutch, who is dying of lung cancer. He masterfully looks and sounds like the image of this former character of billboards and TV. Rob Lowe plays Jeff Megall, a Hollywood mogul, who is convinced that the plan to add cigarettes to current films will enhance his wallet as well. One expects to see a documentary on the tobacco industry, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a delightful comedy that deserves a great success. It should be on ones list of current films to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How to comment on a film that was this entertaining and at the same time so utterly empty afterwards? A bit like smoking, an intense pleasure when you light up, but when the cigarette is in the ashtray, the thrill is gone. It's been two days since I've seen the movie and I can barely remember if there was a story at all.Some comparisons have been made with WAG THE DOG (1997), a film I never found much more than a mildly amusing satire, which didn't have much of a story as well, but "Thank You" is by far the funniest of the two. This film was clearly made as a comedy and in that department it succeeds, with clever writing, great dialog and each role cast to perfection.Aaron Eckhardt is Nick Naylor, a spokesman for Big Tobacco on a mission to defend the rights of smokers and the tobacco industry. Nick is a master at rhetorical manipulation and - according to a lot of people - a "yuppie Mephistopheles", a "trafficker in human misery". His only real friends are the lobbyists for two other controversial products, alcohol and firearms, who are called "The Merchants of Death", or the the M.O.D. Squad. But he is at a moral crossroad in his life because his twelve-year old son (Cameron Bright) is asking him some serious questions about his father's profession and soon he is faced with some moral dilemmas. It's hard to imagine anyone else playing Nick Naylor than Aaron Eckhardt, who gives an impressive performance. Only after seeing "Thank You", I learned he also played the incredibly annoying too-good-to-be-true motorcycle boyfriend of Julia Roberts in ERIN BROKOVICH. Is this really the same actor? He is supported by quite a phenomenal cast with Robert Duvall as an aging tobacco baron, William H. Macy as Ortolan Finisterre (what a name!), a rabiate anti-smoking Vermont senator, Sam Elliot as the former Marlboro Mana and Rob Lowe as a slick spiritual-minded Hollywood agent. Some slackers though, Cameron Bright must be one of the most annoying little brads I've seen in a long time and Katie Holmes as an ambitious young journalist who double-crosses Nick Naylor, didn't do it for me at all. Cleverly, the film stays clear from supporting any pro- or anti-smoking causes. If anything, the film is about choice. Every American should be able to choose, whether it is smoking, drinking alcohol, buying firearms or eating junk food all day.If you want a sharp intelligent comedy, definitely worth your money. For a 90 minute feature film, I expect a little more than just straight satire. Most of the sharpest pokes are at Hollywood and show business and not at Washington politics or the ridiculous smoking laws in many American States, the satire could have been a little more lasting, but with a cast like this, it's hard to complain.Camera Obscura --- 7/10</fullReview>

The lad lives with his Mother &amp; Stepfather, BUT worships his dad &amp; is with him much of the film.For a delightful change we have an ex-wife who still cares for the ex-hubby &amp; vice versa, its a pleasure to see divorced people portrayed as loving &amp; not hating.There are many other wonderful performances as well.

		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" does what few movies ever know how to do: it hits us all right where it hurts, pointing out everyone's hypocrisy in everything, and the way that our society is based on spin. Aaron Eckhart, whom you may remember from "Erin Brockovich", gets the role of a lifetime as tobacco industry spin doctor Nick Naylor, whose job it is to make his industry look good and win people over. With his good boy looks and worldly charm, he has no problem doing just that.The opening scene features Nick on a talk show with a cancer patient and representatives from anti-smoking groups. He manages to frame the debate so that it looks like the tobacco industry wants to keep the patient alive. That sets up how manipulative this guy is. For meals, he likes to meet with the MOD Squad (meaning "merchants of death") to discuss how to market. This group consists of Polly (Maria Bello) from the alcohol industry and Bobby Jay (David Koechner) of the firearm industry. Nick always reminds Polly and Bobby Jay that he, Nick, has it the hardest; their products kill far fewer people.As for Nick's personal life, he always reminds his son Joey (Cameron Bright) to think for himself - which of course means always question people who say that cigarettes are bad. In fact, he even shows Joey how to present an argument for a class paper, and no one in the class can challenge the argument. That's how good this guy is at PR. But as Nick notes while getting interviewed by reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes): "I do it for the mortgage." That's when the movie really gets good. Nick's boss BR (J.K. Simmons, who played Spiderman's boss), sends Nick to meet with the Captain (Robert Duvall), sort of the head honcho of the tobacco industry in Winston-Salem. The Captain explains to Nick that to market cigarettes, they need to make cigarettes look sexy. So, Nick meets with the ultimate entertainment executive, EGO CEO Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe). They figure that Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones lighting up after having sex in outer space would make a great scene...especially if they release a tie-in cigarette. And when Nick meets with the dying Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott)...well, let's just say that I didn't expect that scene! However, Nick's life might get a lot more complicated. Self-righteous Vermont Sen. Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) wants to put a warning label on cigarettes, and subpoenas Nick about the dangers of his products. But Nick knows just how to get the public on his own side at the hearing ("Isn't heart disease a problem, but your state keeps making cheddar cheese?").All in all, "Thank You for Smoking" is a great look at everything. It's not a polemic at all. Quite simply, it's about how our society is dominated by spin, political diatribes, etc, and both sides are hypocrites, always doing everything possible to make themselves look good. The movie stings like a bee. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" (2005) Directed By: Jason Reitman Starring: Aaron Eckhart, Maria Bello, Cameron Bright, Adam Brody, Sam Elliot, Katie Holmes, David Koechner, Rob Lowe, William H. Macy, J.K. Simmons, Kim Dickens, &amp; Kim Dickens MPAA Rating: "R" (for language and some sexual content) "Thank You for Smoking" is a satirical look at the tobacco industry, corporate America, the media, and just about everything you can imagine. Aaron Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor--one of the most hated men in America--the tobacco industry lobbyist. Called the "Sultan of Spin", Naylor is famous for twisting logic to turn arguments in his favor and believes that simply proving his opponent wrong (by changing the argument completely, no less) is enough to prove him correct. And this theory must be correct, as it has propelled him to success and considerable wealth. For example, Nick is asked to attend his son's school's career day. One little girl says that her mommy says that cigarettes can kill you. Ignoring his son's request to "not ruin his childhood", Nick cross-examines the young girl, asking "Is your mommy a doctor? A scientific researcher of some kind?" The little girl says "No", to which Nick says, "Well then she's hardly a credible expert, is she?" One could almost say that anyone could manipulate a young child and that Nick is nothing special?until you realize that he can manipulate anyone, young or old, just as easily. As Nick so eloquently states: "That's the beauty of argument, if you argue correctly, you're never wrong".The health hazards of cigarettes have become widely-publicized. People are no longer as unknowing about the dangers of tobacco as they once were. Nick Naylor's job is seemingly impossible: promoting cigarettes in a time when almost everyone knows that cigarette smoke can cause a multitude of health problems. Constantly trying to balance his work and his son, Joey (Bright), Nick begins to find his job more and more difficult. Nick meets with members of the MOD (Merchants of Death) squad, which consists of the alcohol lobbyist, Polly Bailey (Bello), and the firearms lobbyist, Bobby Jay Bliss (Koechner), once a month to discuss new techniques for promoting their different products. They often argue about which of their products kills the most people. When a sexy reporter, Heather Holloway (Holmes), wins Nick's trust and takes advantage of it for the sake of the perfectly controversial article, Nick's world begins to tumble down around him. But, always the calculating thinker, Nick prepares for his ultimate comeback.One of my favorite scenes in "Thank You for Smoking" features Nick Naylor as a guest on "The Joan Lunden Show". Sitting next to him is Robin (Eric Haberman), a fifteen-year-old cancer victim. The audience applauds when Joan says that Robin has stopped smoking and they boo when she introduces Nick. You would think that this is Nick's downfall. How could he turn such a damaging situation in his favor? Did I mention that the other people on the stage are all anti-smoking campaigners? Well, they are. Anyway, Nick, smiling confidently, says that it is in the smoking industry's best interest to keep Robin alive, healthy?and smoking, of course. Why would they not care whether or not he lived or died if he is their customer--the source of their financial security? This seems reasonable enough (although, we all surely know that this is merely hogwash). Next, Nick looks straight into the audience, piercing them with his firm stare, and he says that the anti-smoking people are the ones who want Robin to die, because they get more and more support with every casualty. The audience seems completely taken aback for a few moments and then they realize that Nick's attack is completely understandable. We, of course, know that this is simply ludicrous?but there is just something about the way Nick says it. You just cannot help but, at least, consider the idea that he is telling the truth. This scene is a testament to Aaron Eckhart's talent and could very well be the highlight of a career-defining role.When this movie ended, I felt completely satisfied. It revels in its often subtle humor and trying to catch every little joke the first time around is next to impossible. It one of the most politically-incorrect, bold, inspired, and effective comedies of the year. I often criticize comedies for being too safe when deciding what to joke about. "Thank You for Smoking", on the other hand, is a movie that seems as though the filmmakers decided what was too safe to joke about and cut it all out, leaving everything that could be considered offensive in the final cut. Thank God for that! It is about time filmmakers decide that offending some people doesn't matter. If an audience member is so easily-offended, then they shouldn't be watching a satire to begin with. "Thank You for Smoking" is not a movie made to entertain everybody. It was made to entertain the people who would like it, ignoring everyone else. Nick ends the movie by saying, "Michael Jordan plays ball. Charles Manson kills people. I talk. Everyone has a talent". I quite like that line. Everyone does have talent and, clearly, for these filmmakers, their talent is making a movie that is courageous and completely hilarious.Final Thought: "Thank You for Smoking" is one of the best comedies of the year.Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)</fullReview>

Summoned to meet with The General (one of the last great tobacco barons), Nick is put in charge of pushing through new ways of promoting smoking while also defeating a push by Senator Finistirre to put a skull and crossbones on the front of every cigarette packet sold in the country.If the plot summary sounds like this film has a definite narrative flow to it then I'm sorry for misleading you because, although it moves in a certain direction, it isn't that tight a story. It probably didn't help either that I had literally been in a different cinema watching Dr Strangelove an hour before I watched this film because this was never going to be able to compare (no matter what the current IMDb rating says!). The comedy isn't that sharp and in terms of satire this is about as mean as a poodle. This lack of teeth is evident from the very start where the opening credits are kind of cool, comic and fun; in the same way the comedy is cool, funny, enjoyable but not really something that rips into its subject with an acerbic wit that I expected. Part of me was thinking this at times that this was a problem but then I realised that it actually wasn't that big a deal.The reason is that, sure it ain't a sharp satire, but it is a fun comedy with a general swagger and a great ear for dialogue. The story wanders and tends to go off in directions that it drops or doesn't follow through, but by staying with Nick at least we have a focal point that is interesting and engaging. I did have a bit of a problem swallowing Nick's sudden massive lack of professional judgement and the fact that it is a key part of the plot made the film seem to stall for a while, but such moments were mostly covered by the pace and energy of the majority. The targets are easy but the manner of writing produces a great feel of mocking them from the inside rather than being outside throwing stones. The "gentle mocking" approach takes away the edge but it makes the film easier to enjoy. It has a steadily amusing air to it while also throwing in lines, characters and touches that made me laugh out loud. Reitman may not be the future of satire but he can certainly do comedy and this film is all the better for this work as director and screen writer.The cast is deep and everyone gets a piece (albeit mostly small pieces). The film belongs to Eckhart who has proved (Company of Men etc) that he seems to find it easy to play characters whose moral compasses are way off. He is as charming as he is soulless and he is a delight to watch ? a major force in the film being as engaging as it was. The support cast includes some real heavyweight names such as Duvall, Bello, Elliott, Holmes, Macy, Simmons, Lowe and others. Generally the quality is high but I found the presence of Holmes to be a distraction and her "fully clothed" sex scenes to be pretty laughable ? her lack of genuine sex appeal and chemistry here made her part of the plot much harder to buy.Overall then this is not the sharp, acerbic satire that some reviewers would have you believe it is ? it simply hasn't got the teeth or the balls for that. But this shouldn't matter too much because what it does do is produce a consistently fun atmosphere that is cynical without wandering away from being pretty mainstream in delivery. The cast are mostly very good but Eckhart dominates with a great lead role while the material keeps the laughs coming on a fairly regular basis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lobbyst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Baylor is a tobacco lobbyst in Washington. His work is to influence people in Congress about his product: cigarettes. Never mind the usage has long been considered bad for anyone that uses it, Nick will debate anyone and will always have an answer that will make his opponents appear as though they are the bad guys.That is the case when Nick is seen on a talk show, where he sits next to a young man afflicted with cancer caused from smoking, who at the end of the show will have a different opinion of the industry that made him sick. Or take the presentation Nick makes to his son Joey's career day class. When the young girl tells him that her mom says smoking is bad for you, Baylor questions her if her mother is a doctor to have arrived at that conclusion.Baylor's great idea is to try to enlist Hollywood into letting big stars be seen smoking on whatever movies they appear. He presents the idea to a powerful Jeff Megall, an insider man, who is willing to go along for the right price. Nick Baylor is the ultimate salesman. After all, he and his employer have enormous resources to pay the right people in order to get their message across.Nick Baylor loves his son, who now lives with his mother. Nick wants to teach his son a valuable lesson, so that he can fully appreciate what he does for a living. The result is a young boy that begins to see his father side and how the truth, as is perceived, can be manipulated by anyone with the right contacts with people in government.Jason Reitman's adaptation of Christopher Buckley's enormously funny satire about the role of the lobbyst in our society is one of the best films about this subject that have been brought to the screen. Mr. Reitman clearly understands how power and money make a heady combination in the way he presents the story.It's hard to imagine anyone else but Aaron Eckhart playing Nick Baylor. Mr. Eckhart is never obnoxious, or overbearing. His Nick is a man who knows what moves people to do the things they do and has no scruples in getting them done. Cameron Bright, is seen as Nick's son Joey. This young actor was the perfect choice also, because he brings an uncanny intelligence to whatever role he is asked to play. The rest of the ensemble cast do well under Mr. Reitman's direction, with great contributions by Maria Bello, William H. Macy, Rob Lowe, Adam Brody, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes and the rest."Thanks for Smoking" shows a new talented director, Jason Reitman, working with an excellent Aaron Eckhart to great results in a movie that will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great insight into spin doctors! 6/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Review: Although this is an old movie, I still enjoyed it. It shows a different aspect to big business, which, good or bad, every business needs. The acting is great from all of the cast and the writing was witty, even though it is a serious subject. After watching movies like The Insider and many Michael Moore movies which show how big businesses trick the world by making them think that they are doing right by buying there products, it's good to see a lighter side to the subject. It's very well written and entertaining from beginning to end. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Judging by the money that this movie made, it must have touched all audiences, smokers and non-smokers, and the relationship between the leading character and his some gave it a human touch. I've seen this movie a few times on TV so I knew what to expect. In a lot of way, this message is politically incorrect, but once the spin had been applied by the spin doctor, you does twist your mind. By the way, the director cleverly didn't show anyone in the movie smoking so he obviously put his own message across. Budget: $6.5million Worldwide Gross: $40millionI recommend this movie to people who want to learn about the spin doctors who work for the tobacco industry. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent satire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that every year of the new millennium brings with it a bumper crop of political comedies. With "Wag the Dog" as the benchmark, films compete in cheerful, contrarian satire, but what seems to come so easily to the Daily Show writers four nights a week has proved to be quite a challenge for movie script-writers. Few things are sadder than a satire that falls flat, and the past few years are littered with those - from "American Dreamz" to otherwise reliable Mike Judge's "Idiocracy," to (unseen by me, but ill-reviewed) "Man of the Year," to "Fast Food Nation," and many others. This film, at long last, delivers biting sarcasm and takes it to a logical conclusion without pulling punches, but also with taste and restraint.The cast is a dream come true. All the characters come to life and defy their types, from the, for once in movies, intellectually adequate 12-year-old son, to the ingénue reporter, to the crusading crowd-pleaser senator. Holding them all together is Nick Naylor, lobbyist and spokesman extraordinaire. Is there an actor in the world who could have played this role better than Aaron Eckhart? Anything is possible, but I firmly believe that the only person who could match this performance would be the actual best industry spokesperson in America.Now, about Nick Naylor. This man's job is to go out and convince people not to take action against a product that kills thousands every day and offers nothing in return. He does his job, but more than that - he does it with grace, with style, and with inspiration. He lies when he has to, but knows how to use honesty to devastating effect. At the same time, Nick is, within the confines of what he does, a decent person. He has no illusions about public opinion of him or his bosses, nor about the effects of tobacco on human health. He loves his son sincerely and unselfishly, and does whatever he can to be a good father. Why, then, does he do what he does for a living? It seems to be part quasi-libertarian resignation ("somebody's gotta do this"), and, crucially, part love of challenge. Someone as ambitious as Nick is destined to seek out the ever greater challenge, and there are few greater than defending the tobacco industry, even for someone whose forte is debate.And boy, is it ever his forte. In most films where an argument or debate takes place and is won, the winning party suffices to be of normal intelligence and bring arguments any of us could have thought of, to counter stumbling straw-man idiocy from the other side. One of the reasons to love "Thank You For Smoking" is that Nick Naylor wins his debates not due to the subhuman intelligence of his opponents - they are about as smart or smarter than the average audience member - but because he is really, truly, brilliant. I find spin a despicable art, but I found it impossible not to be dazzled and grudgingly admiring for the way Nailor manages to turn the most seemingly hopeless arguments around. It is, again, to the writers' credit that they sell it one hundred percent, and do it not by shortchanging the other characters, but making Nailor so much better at the game than everyone else, despite their honest best efforts.This film is not for everyone, of course. If you feel squeamish about seeing a death-peddling character with charisma and a heart, or hearing extremely convincing arguments for tobacco advertising to teens, stay away. But if you can brave the deadpan, callous cynicism, then one of the best political satires of the decade is waiting for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best black comedies that I have seen. I will rank this at the same level as comedies made by Coen Brother's such as the Big Lebowski and O Brother, Where Art Thou? Where do I start paying a tribute to this movie? I'll start with the script and the direction. The script is taut, engrossing, concise, well paced and funny, hence the previous comparison with Coen Bros. The pauses, voice overs by Ekhart, scene overlays are excellent. The direction is subtle. I hope this does not count as a spoiler - did any one notice that there are NO scenes where ANY character is seen smoking? These are people in high profile jobs with billions of dollars worth of business depending on there ability to present truth as they see it. Very, very intense jobs.The next aspect to be paid a tribute to will have to be acting. The casting could not be more perfect (I may be quoting some other user comments while doing so. I am right there with you pal). Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor is charming, intelligent and a master of presenting his version of truth. He is funny, serious, manipulative and smooth talking 'Sultan of Spin', all in all is great. Maria Bello as Polly Bailey (I like her in any role she has put in) and David Koechner as Bobby Jay Bliss are his friends and perfect foils. The scenes where they meet at the restaurant and exchange ideas how their day went are hilarious. The chemistry between the characters is portrayed very well by the actors. The relation that Nick shares with his son is presented very well - they teach other some very surprisingly valuable lessons. The support cast of Katie Holms as the investigative journalist, Robert Duvall as the cigarette baron and J.K. Simmons as Nick's boss are great. I have always thought that William H. Macy is one of the best medium-profile actors working in Hollywood. His turn as the senator leading an anti-smoking crusade is great contrast to Aaron Eckhart's spin wizard needs to be watched.Once upon a time I used to enjoy Jim Carey's comedy - I still think he is one of the best comic talents but his movies try to teach you a lesson. They start with high octane comedy only to peter out as a lesson of life. Nothing wrong with the format, just presenting a point. This movie on the other hand takes on a seriously emotive issue such as smoking - who hasn't seen an anti-smoking advert on T.V.? - and does it as a completely level-headed black comedy that leaves it up to the viewers to make up their minds about the issue. It does not preach anything, but does a great job in presenting the callousness of the cigarette bloc and the extremism of the non-smoking lobby. I will have you know that I am a non-smoker, I prefer to sit at a non-smoking section of the restaurant and have no agenda pro or anti-smoking. I completely agree with the conclusion of the movie.A strong 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nick Naylor: Would you buy an used car from this man?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Thank You For SPOILERS* Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is vice-president of the Academy Of Tobacco Studies, as well as the spokesman for the tobacco lobby.His motto is 'I don't hide the truth: I filter it' and basically is the embodiment of shamelessness; he would be able to sell freezers to Inuits, just to make an example.Something that his boss BR (J.K. Simmons) undoubtedly appreciates.On the personal front, things are a little shakier; he is divorced, with a son, Joey (Cameron Bright) who wants to get to know his father better, and his only two friends are Polly (Maria Bello), the spokeswoman for the Alcohol Lobby, and Bobby (David Koechner), the spokesman for the Army Lobby; as a group, they call themselves the DODs, Dealers Of Death.But a trip to California to meet with Jeff (Rob Lowe), a Hollywood producer (with a West Wing-y fast-talking and sometimes annoying Seth Cohen-alike assistant, Jack (Adam Brody)), and more importantly a sexy journalist with 'world-class tits', Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes), will change everything.What will Nick do? This is the first movie by Jason Reitman, son of the famous Ivan, and it's really good! I particularly liked how this movie felt fresh, original, intense and cheekily dark. One of the best satires in a very long time (at least it has felt like it!).All the actors (the above mentioned plus Robert Duvall and Sam Elliot) are perfectly in part - even if you'd just like to turn Adam Brody off sometimes -, especially Eckhart, who gives - as usual - an outstanding performance.If you like your satire irreverent and acid, this is a movie to rent/buy! 'Thank You For Smoking': 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Commical Dialogue about a Prevalent Issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" is a great comedy using dialog as its main weapon. Aaron Eckhart plays a spokesman for conglomerated tobacco named Nick Naylor. Known as the Sultan of Spin, Naylor navigates his way around the sensitive subjects of teen smoking and the effects of tobacco on human health by finding unique ways of spinning arguments so that he is always right. Throughout the movie you see him on the "Joan" show, eat food with his buddies from the Alcohol and Gun companies, and have an affair with a reporter who is only interested in screwing him (in a couple of different ways). The movie also illustrates Naylor's family situation. His son, Joey, idolizes his father and picks up many of his father's bantering skills. The last thirty minutes of this movie has a series of great scenes with a mix of irony and just desserts. This is one of the best and most creative comedies I've seen in years. The cast was perfect and the dialog was witty and well thought out.</fullReview>

The great thing, though, is this movie is also extremely smart, which may seem weird as movies are not generally smart AND funny. Aaron Eckhart gives a fantastic and Oscar worthy performance as Nick Naylor, the lobbyist for Big Tobacco. All the other cast (Maria Bello, William H.

I wouldn't be surprised if it gets nominated for an Oscar.Overall this is an extremely funny film with great acting and a witty script. Highly recommended!! 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-star cast in a comedy about how we are victims of 'spin.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As they explain on the DVD extras, this movie is NOT about the tobacco industry, nor about whether smoking is bad for us. In fact, we all pretty well concede that smoking IS bad for you, and the movie uses the subject in humorous ways to show how 'spin' can alter our perception, maybe even to thinking that maybe it isn't bad!! Aaron Eckhart stars as master spin doctor and lobbyist Nick Naylor who works for a big tobacco research institution. He is divorced and his ex is played by Kim Dickens. His 12 year old son is Joey (Cameron Bright) who seems to have dad's gift, and Nick must be careful to show him the right path. Why does Nick do this particular job? "To pay the mortgage." Which is a statement of why most people do their particular jobs.It is possible to give a brief synopsis of the story but that isn't so important. What is important is how they show ways 'spin' affect us every day. Today it is about how the Iraq war is going. Clips show both current president Bush and former president Clinton using 'spin' to take some of the severity off their situations. Who can forget, "IT depends on what the definition of 'is' is."Definitely a movie worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not often that a budding director manages to secure a film that sets a high standard for all future films ? much less a comedy, since all comedies nowadays seem to fall under the categories of: A) soppy, cheesy, romantic comedies with the predictable Happily Ever After ending; or B) teen comedies with gross-out moments and crammed full of gratuitous nudity. But Jason Reitman has achieved this impossible. He must've learned from his father Ivan's mistakes and decided to go in the opposite direction. The result is astonishing: a hilarious send-up of all that is politically correct. Neither side of the smoking debate was safe from the film's scathing wit. And that is the star of the show: Reitman's screenplay (adapted from Christopher Buckley's novel) is sheer genius. The comedy is smart and sophisticated. The clever one-liners came thick and fast, all delivered deadpan by a cast comprised of indie stars. Here is another strong point of the film. The ensemble cast is flawless and not one of them drops the torch which carries the consistent tempo throughout. Of course Aaron Eckhart (Nick Naylor on-screen) is the hero here. He steals the show with such credibility as the smooth-talking, charismatic charmer and manages to coax us into empathising with him, despite being the "villain protagonist" of the film. He personifies the perfect spin doctor; his oratorical rhetoric is practically intoxicating. It was simply empowering and inspiring to watch a master at work, triumphing in the face of all odds in a way that makes you wonder "How the hell did he do that?" minutes later. His supporting cast does exactly that - support. Each of them symbolises someone unique attached to his life and everyone managed to extract the maximum amount of laughs out of their roles, no matter how short their screen time was. Maria Bello and David Koechner provided the perfect backseat commentary to the film ? a much needed relief when the plot accelerates to a terminal velocity. Rob Lowe manages to supply a parallel to Nick, an equal that hints at what the film would be like, had the subject of satire been Hollywood rather than the tobacco industry. William H. Macy as Senator Finistirre is Nick's opposition, destined to trip up against our protagonist and to have his ass handed to him with style. J.K. Simmons was pitch-perfect as the disgruntled boss, Cameron Bright served as the inquisitive product of his father, and Katie Holmes was irresistible enough for us to believe her as the young, seductive reporter who manages to tease the information out of our seemingly-impervious Nick, by the common weakness to all men. The plot itself comes secondary to the artistic style, unsurprising due to the sheer brilliance of it. Nick's life takes various twists and turns while he juggles a threat at work and fatherhood. The soundtrack is a collection of golden oldies from the 1940s and 50s. It gives a solid backbone to the story, especially when Nick spends some time alone to reflect upon his life. A joy to watch and highly recommended if you're looking for one and a half hours of entertainment. Just sit back and bask in the glory of its dry and witty script, perfectly executed and enough to send the audience into a state of mesmerised euphoria.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A spokesman for big tobacco, who fights their battles out on television talk shows and in Congressional hearings, is an odd choice for a protagonist, especially today, with all the telling statistics and the virulent campaign to wipe smoking off the map of the USA. This film takes us into his personal life; divorced with one son whose love and respect mean a lot to him, and committed to his job, not so much out of conviction but because he considers himself a good or even the best arguer out there. And he has to be considering he's fighting a losing battle. That he's one of America's most hated figures is illustrated when he's threatened on a live call-in show and then kidnapped by a group of anti-smoking militants. That in itself (the kidnapping) has got to be one of the most satirical plot lines recently put on film. But before you start chuckling too much, he goes to visit the dying Marlboro man, who's about to go public, with a briefcase full of cash in an attempt to buy him out. One look at the oxygen tanks on his front porch is enough to bring home the true sadness and suffering twenty years of smoking can cause. In the middle is his relationship with his son, who must be learning about how bad cigarettes are in school. The culture of tobacco, specifically the cigarette, from the big tobacco boardrooms to the Virginia mansion of a dying tobacco tycoon are neatly inserted as is Hollywood's use of the cigarette, past, present, and future. And the politics of tobacco, often shrouded in hypocrisy, is nearly brilliantly put out there, maybe relying a little too much on the easy joke but presented astutely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither a martyr nor a saint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is some good entertainment. By that I mean that it's not necessarily original or profound, new or amazing in technique, or really that important. Yet it's a decently written, well-acted observational satire, one that can give or take depending on what you want to receive or expect from it. The trailer gives away some of its best jokes, we know that "everyone will become a better person at the end," and there's nothing really offensive in it. Yet it's still, if anything, a great way to pass your time if you have the opportunity to see it.Frankly, this is the type of movie that Hollywood SHOULD be making while the medium-sized movie (AKA Indies by those who don't know better, AKA Indiewood, AKA movies with stars that aren't expected to be blockbusters) should be attempting something "different." Instead, we have Hollywood making complete crap, medium-sized movies making the well-done formulas like this, and the really independent films trying to make the midsized movie, but with the unfortunate side-effect of selling the frankly ugly and annoying hand-held camera effect as, "that grainy independent feel." But enough about the shoulda coulda woulda. This, a highly comic and entertaining feature by Jason Reitman, is about a guy named Nick Naylor who must defend Big Tobacco against a nation of health warnings, fear of cancer, anti-big-business terrorist groups, and basically everyone in the nation who frankly hates him as a person even though he's a decent, caring guy who really just cares about taking care of his son. What keeps this movie flowing and interesting is its comedic timing, a lot of nice quotables and one-liners that keep the audience at least amused until it finally is able to show the character express what's really on his mind: the importance of personal responsibility towards everything, even morally questionable businesses. For all the talk and spin, Naylor never really says, "Smoke cigarettes", he says, "Make your own decisions." The unfortunate thing is that in order to make a living saying that, he has to do it under the name of Big Tobacco.I, personally, love any movie that's willing to tackle issues of media and able to do it without being condescending or terribly misinformed. That's where a lot of this film's strength lays, in its ability to analyze public relations and various forms of media as they operate without really being all, "Da Media is trying to kill you oh noes!" This movie has some very important lessons to show in terms of understanding spin, how it works, and also understanding that sometimes the talking heads are real people too. However, what really keeps it from being "brilliant" or "progressive" or anything like that is the fact that it really needed to have come out about fifteen years ago or thereabouts. Nowadays such subjects are pretty much common discourse. At least this movie has the ability to humanize it and make us empathize with someone we've been taught to hate.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

I also didn't buy Katie Holmes as a Diane Sawyer type reporter who'd bed her targets for story info. She just looks barely 18 and like in Batman Begins as a DA, just is miscast.Sam Elliott was good in his turn as the Marlboro man to, I want to add.

		<shortDescription>thank you for paying me six figures a day, Monsanto....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is a fine film filled with sarcasm, scary truths, and sadly, an accurate depiction of the times we live in and what we have come to accept as the truth based on advertising, coalitions, and constant bombardment with misleading "information", all in the name of profit. the truth is that there are real Nick Naylors out there, brilliantly portrayed with such cavalier bravado ( a contradiction and a good one for this film) by Aaron Eckhart. He could have been pitching nsaids, otc's, prescription drugs, unnecessary operations, life insurance, pyramid scams...he could be John Edward's agent....heck he could have been one of O.J's lawyers. He is convincing, charismatic, and committed to his actions even as he is aware of the questionable ethics he is engaging in. He is unapologetic, but is far from stupid. THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is a great film that makes a statement about individual rights, gullibility, and freedom. A brilliant mix. Oh, and Monsanto; you guys make me vomit. Literally. Got this one in your collection do you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a good satire with more laughs in spurts than overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank You For Smoking does two things in particular- it shows it's writer/director, Jason Reitman (son of Ivan), should have a good career ahead of him, with this being a promising debut; it also shows how casting decisions do make up then crucial framework for a film like this, where its ensemble form needs the right people. The satire comes in the form of it's lead character, a lobbyist for Tobacco (Aaron Eckhardt, one of his better performances), who has a crises in the midst of a reporter's investigation (Katie Holmes), his own son, and in dealings with a super movie agent (Rob Lowe, one of his very best roles), and even the old Marlboro man (Sam Elliot). His main opponent, from the cheese-head mainstay state of Vermont, is played by William H. Macy in another key role- if there's one thing this man can play it's smarmy and antagonistic, while seeming very professional (i.e. Fargo). It's with this parallel of the two sides of varying hypocrisies, of the tobacco's side and the fervent anti-tobacco side, that Reitman loads his guns, not to mention with the alcohol and tobacco sides represented as the guy's friends (there scenes in the restaurant are some of the funniest in the film).If there is a problem, at least for me, with the film in the overall is that as much as a satire can be clever and have aims, it's needs to balance out its comedy with its storytelling. After the first twenty minutes of the film, which contain some really big laughs (if not by the actors, i.e. JK Simmons, then by the cool style of Reitman's), it goes into its story, and becomes more or less in the realm of being entertaining, but not necessarily as funny as it should or could be. In a way this is one of those films I admire more so for having me grin at a lot of what's going on, and that the shots at the societal tennis match of the tobacco issue do work. There's nothing per-say I can say that should dissuade you from seeing it, and it could very likely become a comedy cult favorite along the lines of the Christopher Guest films (albeit a different sort of cultural satire). That it's less than great though when it becomes sincere, and that the sincerity isn't as matched up with its clever side, is more of an observation than a stone-cold criticism. After all, it's hard to turn down a film that features Lowe in a kimono on a sleep-only-on-Sunday schedule. B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: Thank You for Out of the Box Idea!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank You For Smoking. Some movies really fall into different territory all together. Just think of people who are playing the role of Merchants of Death like our hero Nick Naylor played by super Aaron Eckhart who is a lobbyist on behalf of companies who make billions by selling cigarettes and are root cause of 1200 deaths every day. Our hero just does not defend them, he makes sure no one thinks of them being bad people. Although he has facing a personal battle where he has to justify his stand to his growing son who is so fond of him. Directed by Jason Reitman of Juno and Up In The Air fame, this movie is a little cracker with delicious and witty one liners coming at rat a tat speed, characters which are so well defined and screenplay which as clean as water in mountains. I wish the war with senator was given more length as I felt that movie was over before its due time. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Thank You For Smoking. It is such a delicious comedy and drama with out of box idea that will keep you thinking for days</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad but lacking depth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is pretty good, it's well shot, decent acting, some great dialogs, it just never gets you going. I think the story is pretty lacking. There is no big problem or important events that could keep you at the edge of your seat. Generally this is what one would expect from a movie about a tobacco spokesperson but somehow I expected more. Mainly because this is a Jason Reitman film but clearly this was not the right material to make a class-A movie. So if you have time and want and easy film preferably a comedy, give it a try but don't get too much excited about it. It will be the main reason against the film as it is for me as I'm writing this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank You for Smoking is a comedy-drama film that is based on the satirical novel of the same title by Christopher Buckley. It follows the efforts of Big Tobacco's chief spokesman, Nick Naylor, who lobbies on behalf of cigarettes using heavy spin tactics while also trying to remain a role model for his 12-year-old son.It features Aaron Eckhart together with Cameron Bright, Katie Holmes, Maria Bello, David Koechner, Rob Lowe, Adam Brody, Sam Elliott, William H. Macy, J.K. Simmons, and Robert Duvall. It was written and directed by Jason Reitman.Nick is a man who has turned spinning news and information into a successful career for the tobacco lobby. He plots strategies with his colleagues on how to make other dangerous products more appealing to the American public. Nick ends up going to Hollywood with his young son in order to get a movie producer to include characters smoking in his newest film. Nick is kidnapped by a vigilante group concerned about the harmful nature of his product.The film is delightfully unscrupulous characters and searing cynicism prick all sides of the anti-smoking issue with hilarity and intelligence.It the mostly clever comedy about lobbyists released in years that doesn't preach so much as it encourages you to think for yourself lest you be bamboozled like the rest of the flock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacking anger</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, the tobacco industry encouraged people to smoke while denying something it knew: that cigarettes cause cancer. The governments of the world did nothing to stop it, and continue to encourage domestic firms to exploit the export market; although the U.S. tobacco industry was (bizarrely, in my opinion) made to pay retrospective fines for behaviour that had not been illegal and which they still engage in (with the toleration of the same government that is imposing the fines for doing so in the past). One might also note that, if one believes that prohibition is counter-productive, someone has to make the damn things; and high taxes allow the non-smoking middle classes to feel morally superior while the poor pay the bills. The point of this introductory material is that there's a lot of hypocrisy and cant in the story of tobacco; and the field may appear ripe for satire. However, while always fresh and breezy, 'Thank You for Smoking' doesn't quite hit the mark. It's set in the recent past, but in fact, its world appears more distant than it is supposed to be, harking back to the days when "big tobacco" had it far easier than at any time in recent years; and while its portraits of business, politics and journalism are all quite fun, none of them quite ring true. The film reminded me somewhat of 'I Heart Huckabees'; also a jaunty, imaginative look at corporate America, but also a film not actually interested in how the system really works. Indeed, director Jason Reitman seems to think himself clever for making a tobacco lobbyist a (relatively) sympathetic figure. But while a sense of morality is not necessary for comedy, a film can only wring so many laughs by shocking us for failing to display one where expected. An angrier film (from either viewpoint) might have been a funnier film as well.</fullReview>

Nick also has a group of friends who have similar careers in death such as alcohol and firearms. Nick is smart and cool to me. I don't think that I saw him smoke throughout the whole movie but I could have missed it. The whole movie is about smoking or not smoking and it's like a documentary. Nick is the narrator and he is just working to pay the mortgage. He is good at what he does which is manipulation. I like his arguments and the fact that every one in the movie hates him.

		<shortDescription>Hazy on its own premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a savvy if cynical take on the world's hypocrisy over attacking the bad habits it so richly (in every sense of the word) enjoys. There are some laughs at wry moments and bitter ironies. The part of the worldly wise precocious son is very well played and should have been used much more prominently.But the only problem is that the plot so often errs from the whole premise of the film, that the main character can talk himself into or out of anything, at will. But we see over and over again that's not true. Now, is that the intent of the film, that his braggadocio is false and he is self- deluding? Maybe. But that's not clear. So it takes away from the plot when you find out he has a divorce he couldn't talk his way out of, doesn't have sole custody of his son, gets screwed in more ways than one by several folks...One is never clear whether these are the fault of the character or the writing and it's distracting.In the end, with all the smoke rings of the premise and plot, it's an amusing movie that will make you look at your own foibles and those of society with a smile, if a little discomfort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the many ironies in this blatant satire (which is NOT a documentary) is that at no time is anybody seen smoking! No Hollywood cinematic light ups. Even Nick Naylor, who is vice president of the smoking PR conglomerate, does not actually light up on screen. We see him once look into an empty pack of cigarettes wishing he had one, that's it.The joke on the square is that although this movie is about smoking nobody associated with the movie wants to be accused of supporting smoking in any way. Now you might think that, well, a movie that puts smoking in a bad light as this movie does, certainly is not what the tobacco companies want to see. However, if the movie producers also threw in a few scenes with the stars puffing happily away, the message would surely be mixed.No mixed messages here. Aaron Eckhart who stars as Nick Naylor is a sort of charming sociopath. He describes himself as the kind of guy who could get any woman into bed. In an relentlessly ironic follow up to that we have Katie Holmes playing an intrepid reporter for the "Washington Probe" newspaper who gets him into bed, all the better to get him to reveal all his dirty secrets and dirty tricks. He was owned, so to speak, and taken advantage of sexually.Eckhart is perfect for the part with his handsome winning ways. You may recall that he played a corporate sexist pig sociopath in the critically acclaimed film In the Company of Men (1997), which I highly recommend. (See my review.) Here he is a little sweeter, a little more charming, and amazingly enough a good role model for his son Joey (Cameron Bright), who, by the way, has a lot of sharp lines and delivers them well. How this is pulled off is something to behold, for sure. But basically the rationale is that Nick is doing it all "to pay the mortgage" ("the yuppie Nuremberg defense") and that is the lesson that Joey learns, and presumably he will be able to adapt to more socially correct employment when he grows up.Some satirical bits include the Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott) with cancer getting a bribe; a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy) holding a senate hearing about getting a skull and crossbones logo put on cigarette packages while Nick tells him that the Vermont cows and their cheese are causing clogged arteries and heart attacks; Nick hanging out with a RP person representing the interests of alcohol (Maria Bello), and another (David Koechner) whoring for the gun industry. They like to sit around over dinner and compare the number of people their products have killed.Robert Duvall has a modest part as the "Captain" of tobacco and Rob Lowe gets to play Jeff Megall, a big time, Machiavellian Hollywood money man, who is lining up Catherine Zeta-Jones and I forget who, to play a naked in a space movie with some serious smoking scenes--for a price to be paid for by Big Tobacco. The joke here is that this practice has long been a source of Hollywood film production up-front revenue. There's a scene showing old Hollywood stars with PC touch ups of their movies, showing them with lolly-pops or pencils hanging out of their mouths instead of cigarettes.The script (adapted from a novel by Christopher Buckley, son of conservative pundit William F. Buckley) and direction by Jason Reitman deserve some kind of award for originality. The film is definitely a put down of industry PR people, yet somehow it makes them look human.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

The film was short and told a story without a lot of needless scenes. I prefer it that way. I don't know why such a big deal was made of Katie Holmes. She's hardly in it and isn't convincing as a slutty reporter.I also liked the part where his friends are lobbyists for gun control and alcohol prevention.

		<shortDescription>Lighting up at the movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Reitman's "Thank You For Smoking" would make an interesting companion piece to "Lord of War," since both are sharp, acerbic satires about industries - one tobacco, the other small arms - whose practitioners are often referred to as "merchants of death."Based on the novel by Christopher Buckley, "Thank You For Smoking" centers on Nick Naylor, a smooth-talking lobbyist for Big Tobacco whose job it is to counter all the medical charges leveled against cigarettes so that people will go right on using the product despite the fact that Americans are dropping dead from heart disease, cancer and emphysema, caused primarily by smoking, at the rate of well over 430,000 people a year. The triumph of the film is that it resists the temptation to paint everything in broad strokes or to reduce all its figures to the level of simpleminded caricatures. Naylor may be an amoral bastard in the profession he has chosen to pursue (as he says, with an amused smirk on his face, "to pay the mortgage"), but as played by the brilliant Aaron Eckhart, he also has a bit of a conscience and the semi-redeeming traits of insecurity, vulnerability and a deep and abiding love for his devoted young son. Writer/director Jason Reitman "humanizes" the characters even as he skewers them mercilessly for how they have chosen to live their lives. Naylor, for instance, is part of an informal group labeled "the Mod Squad," - short for "Merchants of Death" - consisting of Naylor plus two other lobbyists, one from the alcohol industry and one from the gun manufacturers, who meet regularly at a local bar to bemoan their standing as social pariahs and to argue over which of the three industries scores the most deaths per annum. These characters could easily have been overdrawn and turned into callous villains, but we find ourselves actually liking them - much as we do Naylor - partly because they remain loyal to their buddy when the going gets tough for him and his world threatens to fall to pieces around him.Indeed it is this feeling of ambivalence we have towards Naylor that makes "Thank You For Smoking" more than just an anti-smoking jeremiad, for the movie beautifully approximates the seductive power of men like Naylor and makes us aware of how easily we too fall under their spell. Eckhart is so charismatic, charming and convincing in the role of Naylor that we find ourselves in the unusual position of practically rooting for him to prevail, even though, intellectually, we can pretty much see through the speciousness of his arguments. The filmmakers are to be commended for not softening the material by turning Naylor into the conventional anti-hero who eventually sees the evils of his ways and does everything in his power to make reparations for the damage and suffering he has caused. For even though Naylor does have a "soft," likable side to his personality, it isn't always enough to make him do the right thing in every situation or to make all the politically correct speeches the audience believes should be coming from the mouth of a reformed wrongdoer. The filmmakers make it clear that Naylor "reforms" only up to a point, for there is still a great deal of flimflamery lurking in the core of his genes. Moreover, Buckley and Reitman don't let the anti-smoking forces entirely off the hook either. It often shows them as extreme (one group even kidnaps and nicotine-poisons Naylor to get him to stop what he's doing) and petty (one senator wants to digitally erase all the cigarettes from old movies).Eckhart, who has always been a very fine actor despite never having achieved superstar status in Hollywood, should have been nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his dazzling, finely-tuned turn here as a man it is easy to criticize but hard to hate. He is bolstered by an outstanding cast that includes J.K. Simmons, Maria Bello, David Koechner, Kim Dickens, William H. Macy, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes, Rob Lowe and Sam Elliott. Special note should be taken of young Cameron Bright ("X-Men 3"), who brings spirit and depth to the role of Naylor's impressionable but clear-eyed and levelheaded teenage son."Thank You For Smoking" is a rarity among American films in that it provides genuine food for thought while amusing the heck out of us at the same time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this age of spin and with a relentless supply of public relations that could make Hitler look like a diplomat in this day and age, 'Thank You for Smoking' has a protagonist (Aaron Eckhart) who speaks on behalf of the tobacco industry and tries to lessen the public's perception of the damaging effects of a lethal product that kills hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. This is a satire of the most ingenious proportions. It is consistently entertaining from both a quirky and truthful point of view and striking that kind of a balance is quite a juggling act. What makes this film most appealing is that while defending the tobacco industry, Eckhart is trying to pass on values to his impressionable 12 year old son. The truth in this film is as important as allowing one to make up their own mind about the important things in life. Remarkable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were around prior to 1971 and saw the Marlboro Man in those cigarette commercials, you never stopped to consider that that was a real person. Actually there was more than one Marlboro Man, and they weren't all cowboys. Watching Sam Elliott portray a former Marlboro Man dying from smoking cigarettes wasn't far off the mark, two actors who portrayed the character did die of lung cancer.Probably better than any other movie, "Thank You For Smoking" shows just how effective both sides of an argument can be when delivered by a talented huckster who can think on his feet. What's the best thing about America? - endless appeals. What's the most frustrating thing about America? - endless appeals. To argue either side requires a moral flexibility that goes beyond most people. Real life Nick Naylor's can be dangerous.Movie Nick Naylor's though are fun to watch. If you're fed up with political correctness, this is just the right ticket. Naylor treads the periphery of human decency as a member of a self appointed 'MOD' Squad, the Merchants of Death, who delight in comparing battlefield casualties among the cigarette, alcohol and firearms industries. Anyone else make the connection between the name Naylor, and an oft used euphemism for a cigarette - a nail? The film's best sight gag - the St. Euthanasius School.Smokers and non smokers alike, I think, will get a kick out of this movie, because there are no moral judgments, and there isn't anything revealed that one doesn't already know about the hazards of smoking. It's about choices, and after that, it's all spin control.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thank You For Smoking" has come in the "nicotine", I mean "nick of time" of spin control madness. Aaron Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, a gabby master of the verbose who is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry. Let's just say that Nick is "Naylored" for their tobacco advocate taste. However, at times Nick does go over the "benson &amp; hedge" by favoring tobacco in the most health-concerned issues. I must clear the air and state that on the bright side, Nick is a very devoted father to his young son Joey who is played by Cameron Bright. Our protagonist cleverly does blow his anti-tobacco proponents away with his witty banter. Writer-Director Jason Reitman was definitely the "reitman" for the job by delivering a cerebral and clever cinematic product. The acting of the film was also, how can I say it, to quote the iconic "The Mask"???. Smokin!!!!!!!!!! Eckhart nailed down his Naylor character, William Macy was once again "amacying" as anti-tobacco Senator Finistirre, Rob Lowe "low and behold" was a scene-stealer as movie product placement executive Jeff Megall, Maria Bello &amp; David Koechner has the right ammunition &amp; substance as the reps of the firearm &amp; alcohol portion of the national "Firearm, Alcohol, and Tobacco Organization" (otherwise known as the M.O.B. Squad). A puff of supporting acting credit also goes to Robert Duvall, Sam Elliot, Todd Louiso, and the bright kid himself Cameron Bright. I do have to mention that Katie Holmes did not cruise on brightly in her role as investigative reporter Heather Holloway; Katie's work was way to hollow for my taste. "Thank You For Smoking" is a satirical film that will take your breath away; Thank you for preparing to now go check out "Thank You For Smoking". Spin It Meeza!!!!!!!!!! **** Good</fullReview>

Aaron "Paycheck" Eckhart as the heroic "bad-guy" Nick Naylor does a lot like his last name and nails it, he takes his weaknesses and uses them as his strength to win more charred hearts and add ashtrays to the tobacco industry! William (Cellular, Mystery Men) Macy as the sinister Finisterre of Vermont is well placed as the wanna-be foil to Nick, a virtuous villain vilified justifiably? Katie Holmes as the reporter who goes all out to put a story to bed really fools the viewer as to her true agenda! However, as a sex symbol she leaves much to be desired...Maria (Duets, Payback &amp; Coyote Ugly) Bello is cool in her usual tough-gal pastiche, like a 21st century Lauren Bacall.The real SPIN of this movie is a number of intertwined plot lines - how most modern situations require a way to justify their jobs they may or may not hate to keep family and roof intact (marketing, public relations or "spin"); the key to being a successful debater by not winning but making sure the other party looks more at fault (altering viewpoints with willing participation) and how does even a so-called "villain" look their children in the eye and convince them not to make the same mistakes they made while earning respect and gaining favour (for that one, watch the movie and see how Eckhart's character shows his love for his son)? A wry commentary on the lies of both Bush Jr and Clinton eras, sorry if you're a Democrat or GOP as that last comment could bring a tear to your eye - maybe it's smoke mirroring the lies? http://bajanreporter.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This a very cool movie as far as it goes. Trouble is, it doesn't go far enough and tries to be everything to all people. Not that it's poor, I just expected a lot more than a silly dialogue movie.It's another movie in two halves - some great voice over and witty dialogue and, behind that, some disturbing and 'wrong' portrayals of people. No way can the lead character be seen as a victim or a hero. This leaves the emotional investment of the audience hanging out to dry. It was an unsatisfactory feeling to be 'rooting' as the Americans say for someone who was so obviously a mental weakling, terrible father and greedy to boot.Nevertheless, it poked fun at big tobacco (and big guns, big oil, big fast food, big whateveryawant really) in probably the only way you can these days. Anything more 'preachy' would be cringe-worthy and anything 'serious' wouldn't work. In the end, I was pleased that the film-makers were able to get their point across so effectively.This isn't the funniest movie I've seen, even in a while, but it does have something. Worth a look anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Tobacco skewered, but lots more, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's like an assignment for a film school student's final project -- make a movie about a spokesman for Big Tobacco, and make viewers sympathize with him. By this measure, "Thank You For Smoking" succeeds.And it succeeds on other counts as well. The expected satire of the tobacco industry is here, and it's intelligent and somewhat enlightening, but it's also nicely restrained, and takes a back seat to bigger topics.Tobacco is just one example, the film seems to say, of larger evils at work in society. Those evils include the sad state of rhetoric and debate in the age of sound bites; media-manipulation across a spectrum that includes movies, talk shows and Congressional hearings; and a morphed definition of personal and career success that suggests that a moral compass is far less important than possessing rare -- and therefore valuable -- skills.A plot device has Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) explaining himself to the viewer by having to explain himself to his son, who travels with Dad as he schmoozes movie execs and bribes cigarette critics, all in a day's work. We see the internal logic that holds together an industry whose products kill 400,000 in the U.S. each year, and the surprisingly reasonable-sounding principles its Golden Boy spokesman leans on to justify his work."Thank You For Smoking" is light on laugh out-loud humor, and there's not much plot exposition, but its breezy style and cleverly framed philosophical questions make it an engaging and worthwhile film.</fullReview>

Though I'm no fan of the smoking industry, or its dirty tactics, I just love this movie for the message it sends. Smoking isn't the only health problem in the world, what about obesity, or cancer caused by overuse of certain chemicals, or disease resistance from overuse of anti-biotics? It also incredibly funny, seeing how our smoking lobbyist (can't remember his name) can use just about anything you say or do against you, he's superb. This movie actually makes the smoking industry look worse for the tactics it uses to defend itself. Top marks, and a recommended for anti-smokers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie good, book better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comments on this movie are based on the fact I read the book first. The book's author, Christopher Buckley, was a speechwriter for a conservative President (forget which one) and had no input into the screenplay written by a Hollywood insider. The contrast between these two extremes just happens to highlight the major differences between them.Up front, my simple assessment is, YES, this is a great movie most anyone would truly enjoy. Real characters, playing current events, and Washington D.C. scenes all work together around hilarious dialogue and situations to scream out the errors of government "spin doctors" and lobbyists with a heavily satirical attitude. Unfortunately, however, the movie fails to fully portray all the aspects of the book's satire and is failing because of it. These weaknesses appear to satisfy politically correct viewpoints, afraid of offending too many different groups, ironically the very theme of the book/movie !!I saw the DVD version, of course, which contains the normal stuff- director commentaries, deleted scenes with commentary, etc, and the most-interesting interview of author, screenwriter, actor, and financier from the Charlie Rose show. Highly recommended, despite the failings !*WARNING* I go on now into some specifics, and some are "spoilers", so if that bothers you, please skip the rest of my comments !Even though the screenwriter states it was easy making the movie from the book, he also admits to creating his own final storyline (Christopher Buckley was interestingly silent for most of the interview). So the major differences with the book show the contrast in authors' viewpoints in several ways:1) The portrayal of smokers and their lobbyists. Some of the most hilarious moments of the book revolve around the absurdity of places where smokers can puff away whenever they want and the physical results of this. The movie NEVER even shows a cigarette, let alone one lit or someone puffing on one. How can a theme based off the smoker's lobby never show a smoker ??? It's crazy, and some producer-type obviously made a decision to nix this ! (Again, contrary to the whole premise of ripping the PC craze).2) Women in general, sex scenes in specific. Another major contribution to the theme from the book involves women and sex-- how the power-hungry use it, especially women in high places using low methods to get their way. Admittedly not a new thought, but the lack of this emphasis in the movie (not typical for Hollywood), lessens the portrayal of the lead character. Nick Naylor is such a self-serving spinner that he thinks everything in his life was a result of his perfect spin; in reality, he slowly realizes he's the one being spun! It's his relations with women that first begin his realization that he is out of control, not in control. The movie totally misses this and simply portrays Nick as a nice guy getting by. It definitely needed to elevate sexual tension, and could have done it tastefully without risking an "MA" or "X" rating (as the novel risks).3) The relation with his boss is totally mis-portrayed. The movie isn't that hurt by this, but Nick discovers some spin there, as well, in the book.4) Another character-development technique used in the book involves Nick's inner monologue. The movie does attempt this with some voice-overs, but much of the novel's comedy generates from them. It seems a simple thing to do, and would've fit (time-wise) if the screenwriter hadn't chosen his most defiant change, described next in #5. I would've used the " 'stop-frame'/scene acting out Nick's inner thoughts/return to stopped frame/continue movie" technique like in the Ally McBeal TV series. It would've been hilarious (while showing Nick's weaknesses/quick mind) !!*LAST WARNING* I've purposely saved the spoilers for the last, so if you don't want the plot spoiled, STOP READING!5) *SPOILERS* The DVD interview with the screenwriter clearly points out his reading of the book was emphasized by the one question to Nick "What would you tell your child?". This one simple line in the novel caused him to totally re-write the final change in the hero (an interesting word for a lying, cheating, no-good, spin doctor!). Nick's estranged wife and son become the central theme and does not exist at all in the book. So the plot goes from a Dickensian Scrooge transformation to the typical Hollywood "children know best and if parents would just listen to them everything would be OK". There is no wrap-up in the movie where Nick actually becomes an anti-smoking lobbyist (as in the book). The movie spends many dozens of precious film-minutes of father/son dialogue and character development which takes away from the theme. Using this time with more of Nick's inner monologue would've vastly improved the movie.Wrapup: SEE THIS MOVIE !! It's an entertaining one. But if you want the full effect of Buckley's satire and Nick's heroic transformation, you have to read the novel. Time for only one ? I would choose the book (even though seeing the movie would actually be faster!!! but you know what I'm saying........)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank You For Smoking has been on my To-Do List for sometime now. And I'm happy to say it's been checked off......that kind of sounds bad. Well, to put that last sentence to rest, Thank You For Smoking was one of the wittiest and funnest(not funniest...well that too) movies I've seen in a little bit.You have Nick Naylor, he's the spokesman for Tobacco Study. It's his job to inform people what's going on with...you guessed it, the study on cigarettes. Nick is a pretty big celebrity in the news, because of his forward answers and decisive arguing mixed with his full-fledged backing of cigarettes. He has mastered the technique of answering questions so it can favor him. The entire film revolves around Nick's life, from his family to the missions he goes on to benefit big tobacco. And each and every step of the way the film flies right by. And that for me is the only drawback to this film. I was hoping it would be a little longer. The acting, directing, writing...the whole production was fantastic. I just wish it was a tad longer.It's a sweet little film that was made with lots of love and care. If you're looking for a really good satire, check out Thank You For Smoking. You'll be glad you did. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a smoker, so I didn't see the movie to be shocked by the well-documented and understood effects of smoking. In fact, I mostly went because this girl I met wanted to go see it.But I found while I was watching that the movie is a fascinating look at the power of language and charisma. In fact, it's almost irrelevant that the movie is about smoking, because the principles that Eckhart's character (Nick Naylor) applies to his "arguments" are universally used by those who deflect attention from their real motives and goals.The script is ingenious. Using Naylor's son as a confidant for Naylor to reveal his methods felt natural and compounded Naylor's sins. My favorite moment of the film, and maybe the most revealing as a comment on how propaganda succeeds, is when Naylor creates an analogy for his son about how arguing over whether smoking causes cancer is similar to an argument over whether vanilla ice cream is better than chocolate. They stage the fake argument and Naylor begins twisting the discussion until he's talking about freedom of choice in ice cream flavors or something like that. Flustered, his son says, "But that's not what we're talking about!""But that's what _I'm_ talking about," emphasizes Naylor.You can almost picture Bush saying this exact thing to a roomful of reporters.Press: "Where are the weapons of mass destruction?" Bush: "We have liberated the Iraqi people from a terrible dictator!" P: "But that's not what we're talking about." B: "But that's what _I'm_ talking about."Fantastic. Also brilliant is the fact that the black comedy remains black to the very end. The entire story, all the plot points, all the character arcs, even the resolution, are straightforward story elements but they are all subverted. This point was kind of lost on the audience I watched the movie with, as dark jokes were sometimes absorbed in puzzlement, especially later on.At the point in the film where most black comedies would have the protagonist starting to realize the error of his ways, Naylor is having an argument with his colleagues over whose profession is most deserving of death threats from terrorists (he unashamedly contends that cigarettes, as a proved killer of a half million people a year, are far more deserving than alcohol or guns of the spite that leads to death threats). Later, at a moment of crisis, when most protagonists would be repenting for their children's' sake, Naylor sticks to his guns and swallows his own propaganda whole.This is also unique because the movie does not paint him. I can't think of another film that achieves such a calculated moral detachment from its repulsive subject. Ultimately this makes it easier for the viewer to pass judgment on Naylor and his moral flexibility, because God knows Americans hate being told what to think.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as daring or biting as I'd expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this movie is sometimes funny and Aaron Eckhart is as good as you expect in his role as Nick Naylor. But it all seems pretty tame compared to stuff done every night on American television on shows like "The Daily Show" and "The Colbert Report," not quite up to the hype and the glowing praise the film has received. At some point "Thank You For Smoking" gets a bit repetitive and seems to go on a bit too long, even though it's barely 90 minutes in length. You "get" it after the first 25 minutes.Rob Lowe and, of course, Robert Duvall are both amusing in their brief appearances in the film, but their appearances seem almost too brief. Still, this hardly seems like a "must see" movie in any respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cynical, perverse, and wonderfully subversive movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read the book I hoped that the movie would keep the droll infectious humor. It did! Having absolutely no memory of anything else about the book I was pleased to be treated to it's perverse message as a fresh experience.This is a funny, smart, cynical look at the world of American spin doctors, and one in particular (Aaron Eckhardt) who plies his trade, with great effectiveness, for the Tobacco Industry. It is of course a satire by the lesser known - but more palatable - of the Buckley brothers, in the tradition of Waugh or, more recently, Condon. Unlike them Buckley's humor zings rather than stings. No blood is drawn, but many a shibboleth is skewered.Nick Naylor (Eckhardt) works for Big Tobacco as a lobbyist. He does this because, as he tells everyone who asks: "to pay the mortgage." To his son he is more honest: "because I am morally flexible." Roundly hated by the morally upright he manages to come out on top in many awkward and potentially dangerous public appearances. His wife has left him for a self pretentious Doctor, and his only friends are: respectively, a lobbyist for the alcohol industry, and the fire arms industry. They have lunch once a week and try to one up each other in war stories, and fatality statistics, and call themselves the MOD (Merchants of Death) Squad. On a TV talk show he is told by a caller that he is marked for death. He is kidnapped, and in one of movies most hilarious "hit" scenes he is plastered with nicotine patches and left for dead in the arms of the Lincoln statue. He only survives because, as a smoker, he has built up tolerance for nicotine. Now as a victim he rises to higher fame.Then he makes the mistake of sleeping with a journalist (Katie Holmes), who he was warned away from, by his MOD buddies. She f***s and tells all about his off the record bragging and inside information. Suddenly he is out of a job. No-one wants to see how sausage is made! In the end he acquits and redeems himself in an appearance before congress (one of the movies few weak scenes) and goes on to sell his expertise to the highest bidder - we last see him coaching the cell phone industry in how to spin brain tumors! This movie will not make much money - the American movie watching public is not big on satire - it's too subtle, but it will please many who like to be amused by well written, intelligent, droll jabs at America's delusion that style is more important than substance.Eckhardt is excellent, using his low key intensity well. Look out for a nice piece of over the top acting by Sam Elliot as a dying Marlboro man. Unfortunately Rob Lowe falls flat in the movie's only leaden, too campy, scene that tries to poke fun at California's "Zen" pretentiousness. It seems his departure from the West Wing was his David Caruso mistake.</fullReview>

No characters smoke on screen. At one point, the main character goes for a cigarette but is out. I think that's the closest we come to seeing someone smoke.Funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, witty, but somewhat hollow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard a lot about this movie before watching it, and all the reviews have been generally positive. Add that to my interest in the tobacco industry and the theme of the movie (a look at a spin-doctor for the tobacco lobby groups), I was probably expecting a little too much. Don't get me wrong, the movie was clever, well acted, and there were some great lines throughout. But I just felt something was missing. I haven't pinpointed what that is, but there doesn't seem to be much of a "point" to the movie. Even with that flaw, I still give it an 8 out of 10 just because of the cleverness and the acting.Aaron Eckhart, known mainly for his role in "The Core", does a brilliant job playing the tobacco spin doctor lobbyist who can seem to talk his way out of ANYTHING. I mean, he's so good he can convince you that killing your friends and parents is a good thing! To play this character, you really need to be suave, yet seem intelligent enough to convince the audience that it's not just an actor reading the lines, but the actual person possessing this miraculous gift that he has. Aaron pulls that off very well. He does it so well that you actually start liking him and rooting for him near the end of the movie, scary! I also enjoyed all the great satire this movie provides. The scenes where the M.O.D. squad (merchants of death) talk about who kills the most people per day, and the one where Aaron's character convinces school kids that smoking is not bad for you, are a pure joy to watch. You laugh at how over the top and un-PC these characters are in the movie, yet if you think about it, the way Aaron crafts his arguments do make sense, and that is the scariness of his talent.As I mentioned before, I wish there was a bit more substance to this movie, and the father-son story could have been reduced a bit. But, I still believe this is a witty and intelligent movie that's for anyone looking for a good laugh and don't get easily offended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you want to sell pigs, start with attractive salespeople</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Reitman's first film constantly and very effectively shows that the most crucial "qualities" required for great success when selling a highly offensive product that alienates many or most people are......physical attractiveness, high intelligence, strong debating talent without regard for the truth, and a mortgage to pay. (Sort of reminds me of a gov't administration and its oil buddies that are getting rich by selling a "war" that most American people don't want.) The film also showed well that the most important thing to do after getting those brilliant and attractive salespeople is to train them well to spin a product that is bad for people into something good for sales, then hard sell that "good" over and above all reasonable and just opposition without any regard or respect for scientific facts. (Again, just like our gov't stating that definitive research proving global warming is "unproven".)This "forget about everything and just sell the product" attitude was convincingly displayed throughout "Thank You...." and was very effective in showing us why selling tobacco in that manner still works for many who don't care about the truth. But, I felt a certain sadness throughout, even though this film is a very entertaining dark comedy, in seeing the obvious truth of the convincing message that many people sell their souls to their employers for the sake "of paying the mortgage". And what is really concerning to me is that it is becoming more and more obvious to anyone in our fragile economic system that real people are willing to do just about anything for their companies in order to keep their jobs(same as in the movie)no matter how wrong it is and how many faceless folks they may hurt while doing it. I personally see this happening almost every day in jobs as low on the professional rung as film rental clerk or telemarketing cell phone salesperson.(When people working at that level will lie to keep their jobs, we are in real trouble as a society.) This film made it clear to anyone watching that slick lies sell, and immoral slick lies really sell, and it's not only OK, the practice is obviously believed in and endorsed by our own gov't. I admit that my film review is a philosophical comment more than a direct film review but this terrific film showed the above truths so well, plus the dark side of that unwritten but abhorrent moral code that some of us endorse either passively or actively, that the damage it can do to us as a society is more important commentary. See this film and enjoy its wonderful entertainment value and good film-making, but also be outraged by its engrossing story of profit-motivated crime by and to humanity.I experienced a similar social awareness while recently watching Cache, a brilliant and quirky French film that also really makes you think about what tragic results selfish and greedy acts can "bring home" when some people are not concerned with fairness or morality toward others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Thank you for Smoking quite a bit. Back in the late 70's when i was in college I knew a girl who interned at Philip Morris and I used to seethe when she described the research on Lung Cancer as "not conclusive".At last a movie that's daring enough to make fun of the whole debate on both sides. It was great fun to watch the lead revel in being on the darkside.The movie's motto is "neither side is snow white". South Park pointed out in their Butt Out episode.While I don't think this must be a big screen movie, it's worth it to go to the theater to hear everyone else laugh so hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reitman and an Inspired Cast Produce a Dagger-Driven Satire Full of Well-Earned Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aaron Eckhart made his first vivid big-screen impression as the misogynistic Chad in Neil LaBute's scathing 1997 "In the Company of Men". Since then, he has been waffling in leading man roles, but luckily, he comes back to form as the appropriately named Nick Naylor, tobacco industry lobbyist extraordinaire, in first-time director/writer Jason Reitman's wonderfully acerbic comedy about the power of media spin around the availability of cigarettes despite inescapable evidence that smoking kills. The film's perspective is ruthlessly cynical and most of the characters morally ambiguous, but those are the primary reasons why this movie sizzles full of shrewd insights about political gamesmanship in both the public and private sectors. The zigzag plot follows Nick from the bogus, cigarette company-funded Academy of Tobacco Studies to the pretentiously Zen office of an equally pretentious Hollywood Studio mogul to a dicey encounter with a former Marlboro man to the welcoming arms of an ambitious reporter. The unpredictable journey provides Reitman an opportunity for both broad, whack-a-mole comedy to piercing, observant zingers that resonate with the truths they expose.Reitman has recruited a first-class cast to bring his brittle satire to life starting with a superb turn by Eckhart, who alternates easily between unapologetically smug and begrudgingly likable. At their favorite watering hole, Nick's two lobbyist buddies are played with barbed precision by David Koechner as the Bush-sound-alike firearms specialist and especially the wondrous Maria Bello as the sharp-tongued alcohol representative. There are also inspired turns from very unlikely sources with Rob Lowe hilarious as Jeff Megall, the honey-voiced, Asia-obsessed mogul; Sam Elliott defiantly cagey as the Marlboro Man; and even Katie Holmes surprisingly convincing as Heather Holloway, the morally bankrupt reporter who appears to be Nick's kindred spirit. Scene stealing is quite democratic with clever turns by Robert Duvall as the tobacco kingpin; William H. Macy as the unctuous, anti-tobacco senator from Vermont looking to put a skull-and-crossbones logo on all packs of cigarettes; J.K. Simmons as Nick's immoral boss BR; and a very funny Adam Brody as Lowe's obnoxious assistant.Beginning with the inventive artwork of the opening credits, the plot goes in unexpected directions, and while the ending is a bit soft, the overall movie more than satisfies. In fact, I doubt if I have laughed harder in a movie theater since last year's "The 40 Year-Old Virgin", but the smart, provocative barbs really make you think about the persistent hypocrisy of big business and government in refreshing ways that are not remotely disdainful. Even the comparatively soft-centered scenes of Nick with his son have a nice edge, and with his translucent blue eyes, Cameron Bright strikes the right, non-judgmental notes as Joey. Reitman seems fully capable of bringing an acidic flavor to the most Capra-esquire situation. This one is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh, the power of words. In what is for all practical purposes his first major film as writer and director, Ivan Reitman's son Jason, gives us an essay on how the spoken word can be a tool or even a weapon.Aaron Eckhart is perfect as the fast talking tobacco lobbyist who smooth talks everyone from his boss to his son to reporters to students. As he says, "Charles Manson kills people ... I talk". And what a talent he has. Reitman, as a writer, shows a nice touch for the big story and some amazingly witty moments. His weakness comes from writing a complete scene. So many times a scene appeared to exist solely for the delivery of one line. Fortunately that does not kill the enjoyment or effectiveness of the story.The other two members of the M.O.D. Squad are a quirky David Koechner and the sadly underutilized Maria Bello. A terrific supporting cast is filled out with William H Macy, Rob Lowe, Robert DuVall and a former Marlboro Man played by the great Sam Elliott. In a small step forward from the usually creepy kid role ("The Butterfly Effect", "Birth") Cameron Bright plays Eckhart's son who wants to learn from his father.Some nice moments in the moments in the film and a wonderful idea make for a very entertaining film. Stopping it from being great are the fragmented scenes that don't seem to flow very well. The film is well acted, has a very creative opening credit scene and the closing song by The Kingston Trio make the credits worth reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank You for Smoking (2005)The premise of this film if hilarious, for those who like a black comedy in a kind of dark grey, nothing too stark. The pro-tobacco lobbyist is played with wit and energy, and really quite brilliantly (never mind his eternal cutesy smile), by Aaron Eckhart, who keeps the film fast and warm. The supporting cast is an array of decent talent not given a lot to work with, though his son, played by Cameron Bright, is a bright spot.But after seeing the previews I had a feeling that I had seen the best moments in the film, and didn't need to see it all through. (And this is sort of true, since the idea of rooting for the villain is great for five minutes, and then the variations on the theme start to run thin.)But then came Juno (2007). Yes, Juno shares the same director, Jason Reitman, and I have seen Juno three times now, surprised that I enjoy the movie each time even though the plot is no surprise. Who is this new director (who has now come up with Up in the Air, just to burnish his creds a little more)? Well, Thank You for Smoking is no great film. For one thing, the story is just for laughs, and this one doesn't pull it off the way other pure comedies, from Airplane to The Big Lebowski, keep the tables spinning and the writing is on fire even though it's all relatively meaningless. For another, Ellen Page and George Clooney are bigger, more lovable, more complicated talents.But (again) you can, in fact, see some of the stylistic traits that are becoming Reitman signatures. One is a matter of fact kind of fast speaking. Another is the way the camera work is edited, including closeups on reactions. Another is a kind of contemporary feel without any overt stylizing, which is no contradiction. Unlike Tarantino or the Coen Brothers (not to match apples and oranges) Reitman works within a standard editing and filming (and acting) framework. But with a fresh, invisible elegance that lets the interior (the acting and writing) blossom. And Reitman (so far) creates an airy kind of innocence to his scenarios, even here, which is anything but innocent.So far. Let's see what's next for him. I realize I haven't said much about the movie here, but that's because it's a throwaway, a fun time that seems too long even at 90 minutes. Yes, there are some great laughs. And there are those harbingers of better things to come, which is great to see and sense for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an old movie of 2006 (10 years!!) that I am reviewing but thought it would be worth it. Thank You For Smoking is one movie I feel everyone should watch. And no, it won't turn you into a smoker. Story (9/10): TYFS throws a satirical light on one of the less heard perspectives of the tobacco industry in the whole anti-smoking debate. However, the writer carefully keeps the main plot as a struggle of a father who works for the tobacco industry but still holds his ground in front of his son in spite of a very hostile environment. The conversations between Nick, the protagonist father, and Joey, his son, are profound as well as humorous. As rightly said, if you can defend tobacco, you can do anything. The part on the art of argumentation is inspiring, to say. Particularly impressive about the story is that all the characters are well defined and have a strong appeal, except may be that of Nick's wife. However, a strong character sketch of Nick Naylor as a handsome, smart, articulate, unapologetic and persuasive lobbyist lifts the whole story to the next level. The MOD trio just scales the topic of the movie to other similar territories. Acting (8/10): Aaron Eckhart has probably given one of his best acting performances in the movie. Though I always imagined De Caprio could have done more justice to this kind of a character. However, Aaron doesn't disappoint at all. The supporting cast, particularly Camaron Bright, the MOD squad, Holmes, Lowe and Macy do an amazing work. Direction (9/10): If the story and the topic makes the movie all so serious - Jason Reitman's direction and screenplay brings in the much required punch of humor (or we may say, satire) to the movie to make it enjoyable. And he saves the best for the last when Nick Naylor brings to the table what is actually needed for the society in the whole anti- smoking debate. Black comedy can be difficult but Reitman nails it beautifully. Overall (9/10): All in all, the movie is a must watch for everyone. One of the best Hollywood movies that you can keep in your collection.</fullReview>

It not just mocks the government's failed attempts against tobacco and shows strategies used by MNCs but also focuses on parenthood. It is shown how society imposes its rules over the kids from a very young age instead of telling them all possible pros and cons of the topic in question and letting them decide for themselves. It portrays how a parent must let the kids to think instead of forcing prejudices. It shows the real face of modern day media and corporations. The psychological tricks used in advertising to convince the customers is mocked as well. The actors have played their part perfectly. Not to mention the soundtrack is amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie Thank You for Smoking is focused around the life of a man named Nick Naylor who is big tobaccos chief lobbyist. Aaron Eckhart does a great job of portraying the silver tongued lobbyist Nick Naylor who is an extremely charismatic man who has enough charisma o convince the entire nation to pick up the habit of smoking. Naylor's job is to help maintain the reputation of tobacco companies and keep cigarettes in the mouth of the greater American public. The movie was created as a satire trying to show the ludicrous dealings and operations of big tobacco companies. There are scenes in which the shady dealings of these companies are shown to the audience in a hilarious manor. Such as when Naylor uses a large amount of money to bribe an individual from testifying that his cancer was brought on by his use of tobacco, this scene showed audiences the amount of money that big tobacco has puts them in a greater position of power in which they can easily manipulate things into their favor. Naylor's closest friends consist of two individuals, one being Polly Bailey a representative of the alcohol industry and the other being Bobby Jay Bliss a representative of the fire arm industry. Together the collective call themselves the merchants of death and they pride themselves over how many deaths the industry they represent rack up. In one of the more ironic scenes of the movie Naylor gets kidnapped by individuals who want him to speak out against the tobacco companies, so as a method of torture they begin pacing multiple nicotine patches on Naylor, they placed so many patches that Naylor had a near death experience. The only thing that kept Naylor alive was the fact that he was a cigarette smoker so his body was already used to the immense amount of nicotine that he was dosed with. Towards the end of the movie there is a funny scene in which the three of them are all arguing over which ones industry accumulates the highest death tool within the year, and Naylor brags about how the smoking industry is related to more deaths than fire arm use and alcohol consumption. This movie does a great job of informing the audience of the effects of tobacco use in a very comedic way that's so natural to the story progression that most individuals who watch this film won't even realize that they are gaining this information. This is why the movie is so effective in its purpose to inform and yet entertain the audience. The film never feels too pushy on the audience with its underlying message of trying to get current smokers to quit and to get people informed about the unfair tactics employed by big tobacco companies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sticks with you for a very long time after watching it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I really love about Thank You For Smoking and what stands out the most about it is that it doesn't take any sides. It is neither a pro-smoking nor an anti-smoking film. It actually gives both sides to the argument and it allows you to decide for yourself. It is also very thought provoking and it sort of gave me another interesting side to the repetitive and combed over "smoking is bad" argument.Nick Naylor is a tobacco lobbyist and the vice-president of a tobacco lobby known as the "Academy of Tobacco Studies". The people who work there have been researching the effects of tobacco smoking and lung cancer for 15 years. They claim that their research (which is mostly funded by tobacco companies) have found no correlation whatsoever of lung cancer being a side effect. Nick Naylor is challenged to convince as many people as possible not to smoke. One of the people he has to get by is the Senator of Vermont, Ortolan Finistirre, who is really anti-smoking.The fact that this film doesn't take any sides is what makes it so special. The film is focused more on Nick Naylor and the arguments he used in the movie which were far ahead of the time when it came out. This film makes fun of both sides of the tobacco industry. The finale when Nick Naylor goes up against Ortolan Finistirre is the best scene in the film. It allows you to see smoking in a different way and it is one of the most thought provoking scenes I've ever seen in cinema. It's timeless.Also, to say that its plot is daring is an understatement. It's very shocking in a way that the characters who promote smoking and try to get more people to do the act of it are the good guys, and the characters such as the senator who try to promote good health are labeled as the bad guys in the film. Also, the film says that big corporations are good and large body counts leads to long lasting friendships. These portions of its plot make it stand out amongst most comedies and this makes it a very smart film.Also, the movie actually got me to dislike that senator who was trying to promote good health with a burning passion. Overall, I felt like the senator was wasting his time trying to put pictures on cigarette packages. I think this because I'm willing to bet that 99.9% of everyone who smokes has at one point heard that smoking is bad for you. That hasn't stopped them from smoking so I don't think that Senator Ortolan Finistirre's plan would decrease the amount of smokers that much. I'm not a smoker, but if I wanted to start, I wouldn't be persuaded not to do so just by looking at the pictures on the boxes. The warning labels we already have are just fine. Also, I felt that Nick did a much better job in his debates with him because he made his point more firm and sometimes, his points were so good that the Senator couldn't think of anything to say after he made his point. Also, the senator often spent more time in the debates asking him questions which weren't that good instead of disagreeing with things he said before. I won't spoil what the Senator does at the very end of the movie because it is really funny but he appears to lose his mind by the end.If a movie has me liking a character trying to convince others to smoke and if it has me disliking a Senator trying to promote good health, I'd say that it definitely did something right. Some may argue whether this is a good or a bad thing, but I think that this is a good thing because it shows the many things that movies can do. I can't think of any other movie which has done this before.Also, the acting is pretty great. Aaron Eckhart's performance as Nick Naylor is outstanding. He easily carries the whole movies as he is able to deliver his lines with a sense of courage and fearlessness when he is in debates with other people. When he goes up against big people, he treats it like it's just another day at the office. He was the only actor who impressed me, but that's not to say that the other actors did a bad job. They still did a good job as well. Adam Brody, William H. Brady, and J.K. Simmons were good actors too. However, they didn't have the same charm as Aaron Eckhart did in the film.Like most great, underrated movies however, it's not without its flaws. The pacing can get to be a little tiresome near the middle of the film and some scenes can drag on a little too long, but this is about the only thing which bothered me and even when I felt a bit bored, the film always managed to suck me back in at the next scene.In conclusion, Thank You For Smoking is a smart and entertaining comedy which will stick with you long after viewing it. It doesn't take any sides and it also has a thought provoking and well thought out meaning behind it. The acting is also pretty good as well. It may have a few drawn out scenes which can get tiresome, but this is a minor criticism on my part. This movie should be viewed by everyone. It is quite an experience to watch it just because it gives you another side of the argument which is very valid and thought provoking. It is a film which definitely flew under the radar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satires don't get much better than this !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Thank You for Smoking' is a satire film written and directed by Jason Reitman based on the satirical novel of the same name by Christopher Buckley. The story follows Nick Naylor played by Aaron Eckhart, a lobbyist for the tobacco industry. We see him navigating his way through the ordeal of having to defend a seemingly 'evil' industry while facing the heat of hatred from senators, journalists and the public while simultaneously trying to be a role model for his 12 year old son.This is a film that truly surprised me because it doesn't shy away from throwing punches. Considering this was Reitman's debut, I can't praise him highly enough for his brilliant screenplay and almost masterful directorial work. The film is extremely funny and the dialogues are absolutely razor sharp ornamented with extreme wit. Reitman portrays both sides of the tobacco divide at their most genuine, raw and sometimes hypocritical and obnoxious states without pledging alliance to either of them. The voice-over narration and some other elements of the film did remind me of Goodfellas, but the film that it reminded me the most of was Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange'. This comparison is not based on how disturbing the two movies are because 'A Clockwork Orange' is much more disturbing than 'Thank You for Smoking'. I make this comparison because of the moral ambiguity of both films. Both films tactfully refuse to take sides in the morality conflict happening at the core of them. Another important factor that connects these two films is how critical a role 'free will' plays in them. In the end 'Thank You for Smoking' is less about the tobacco industry and more about the character Nick Naylor and his philosophies in life which he tries to share with his son. Having said that the tobacco angle in the film is still substantial and that makes this a great companion piece with the much more serious 'The Insider'. You can also find a lot of real life Hollywood references in 'Thank You for Smoking' which makes the themes in the film all the more relevant and poignant.Although the film has brilliant performances all across the board from actors like J.K. Simmons, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe,etc., but this film does not work at all without the stupendous Aaron Eckhart. He drives this movie forward at times single-handedly. He is brilliant with his line delivery, he is charming and he is ravishingly funny without compromising the need to build a real character of Nick Naylor around the comedy.In my eyes, this is one of the best debuts that have materialised in Hollywood after the fall of the century. I have read that Reitman made many changes from the original novel for his screenplay and as far as I am concerned everything worked. His direction is brilliant. The tone remains light-hearted and humorous even though sensitive issues are being explored which is the best thing for a satire. I tried very hard to find a reservation that I might have against the movie, but I couldn't find any. This is a comedic near- masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank You For Thank You For Smoking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank You for Smoking (2005): Dir: Jason Reitman / Cast: Aaron Eckhart, Robert Duvall, William H. Macy, Katie Holmes, Maria Bello: Brilliant comedy about opposing arguments. Aaron Eckhart plays Nick Naylor, spokesperson for cigarettes. He is gifted in debates that have his unhealthy product applauded simply because he can talk. He is divorced, and while his ex-wife is involved with another man, his son is growing to take after his father. Film debut for director Jason Rietman backed with a screenplay of overwhelming flair. Eckhart is hilarious as Naylor whose gift for talking not only sells cigarettes but it also opens him up to mass hatred and danger. Robert Duvall steals scenes as his father who pioneered the business in much the same manner. William H. Macy steals scenes as a politician lobbying against cigarettes thus left frustrated in hilarious debates against Naylor. Katie Holmes plays a crooked reporter who seduces Naylor for information that eventually costs him. The karma headed her way is priceless when Naylor takes control again. Maria Bello plays a spokeswoman for the alcohol industry who also weighs in on this controversy. This is easily one of the best films of the year with its humorous dialogue and clever arguments. Regardless of one's thoughts on cigarettes we should thank Rietman for this clever and amusing debate. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>really frustrating movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is the slick, amoral, sharp-tongue vice-President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies. He can spin any argument in favor of tobacco. BR (J.K. Simmons) is his loud bombastic boss. His best friends are alcohol lobby Moderation Council's Polly Bailey (Maria Bello) and gun lobby SAFETY's Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner). Their biggest opposition is Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy). Tobacco baron, the Captain (Robert Duvall) puts him in charge of bringing tobacco back to Hollywood. His son Joey (Cameron Bright) guilts his ex-wife Jill (Kim Dickens) to let him go on the LA trip. Reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) has a fling with him and betrays him.Jason Reitman has filmed a brilliant and smart movie. The problem is that people are too stupid except for Nick. It's really frustrating to see stupid people failing to argue with Nick. The other problem is that the characters are all caricatures which takes away any poignancy. It also takes away the comedy. There are too many things that annoy which is the opposite of funny. It also feels too light and bright for the subject matter. Nick needs to be hiding something dark and ugly. He's more of a robot than a fully developed human being. Anything with Dennis Miller smirking is not funny. I don't feel for the guy or that annoying kid. The only guy I'm interested in is the guy who threatened him on Dennis Miller's show. It's one of the few moments where reality seeped into the performances and the movie. Even the kidnapping scene is problematic. Any kidnapper would want to shut him up by duct taping his mouth. The whole medical thing sounds unreal. This is such a smartly written movie but the general feeling from it is one of frustrating annoyance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank You for Smoking is the directorial debut by Jason Reitman, who would later direct contemporary classics such as Juno and Up in the Air. This film is a sharp, hilarious satire about smoking and how it plays a role in the political process. Recently, smoking has become a political question due to the health hazards it possess, so this this a very timely movie. The script, without a question, is one of the best scripts of recent memory. The dialog is just so smooth and witty and a good screenplay often means a good movie, like we have here.Jason Reitman's film is about a tobacco lobbyist named Nick Naylor who has a way with words. He invokes the wrath of a Senator named Ortolan Finistirre who vehemently opposes smoking and proposes that a skull and bones logo to be added on the cartons. So now Nick must try to advocate smoking, while remaining as a role model for his twelve-year-old son.The film has a great cast and they all do well. Aaron Eckhart was fantastic as the smooth-talking Nick and he has great chemistry with everyone. I like J.K Simmons as Nick's backstabbing boss, and Robert Duvall as the boss's boss. Katie Holmes was excellent as the seductive news reporter. My favorite scenes of the movie consists of Nick meeting with his friends in the alcohol and firearm industries respectively played by Maria Bello and David Koechner.Overall, Thank You for Smoking is an incredibly excellent film. As a satire, it can hardly get any better than this. With a great screenplay and fantastic acting, the film exceeded my expectations. Jason Reitman is a truly gifted director. Like father, like son. I hate smoking, so I was pleased to see a film that have messages of anti-smoking, even if they are subliminal. A fantastic directorial debut by Reitman. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comedic outlook on the competition between tobacco companies and anti-smoking activists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I've noticed several reviews that discuss the bad effects of smoking rather than the quality of the movie itself. I'm not going to get into that; I know smokers who are happy with their lifestyle and aren't sick and they've been smoking for years. I also know smokers who have gotten cancer. There may never be a right or wrong and I won't waste your time getting into all that.This movie is a laugh-riot, with very minimal crude humor and a look at the point of view of a spokesperson for tobacco. Nick lives a wealthy life money-wise, but standing up in favor of tobacco has cost him his marriage, many friendships, the respect of people nationwide and if he isn't careful, his career might also cost him his twelve-year-old son, who is conflicted between the anti-smoking propaganda at his school, and the information from his father. He has to decide which is more important, his family or his job.This is not an environmental hippie propaganda crud movie, which made me ecstatic since I love polluting things on purpose. It was nice to find a movie that explained both sides of the matter. Although it sort of shows the tobacco corporation in a bad light, Nick is not an "evil businessman monster", h truly does care about his son although taking Joey on a business trip to Big Tobacco likely wasn't the best idea, nor was the comedic parent-teacher scene. The real sleazeball in this movie is Brad, Joey's step-dad.If you're a smoker, don't worry, this movie doesn't shove all that anti-smoking crud down your throat; anything anti-smoking related in it is no different than what you see on those cigarette packages. I will warn that if you don't have a sense of humor with this type of movie, or if you don't enjoy movies like Silkwood, A Civil Action or The Insider, you may find yourself bored or annoyed at the movie.I highly recommend Thank You For Smoking. The acting for the most part is really good, the soundtrack is great and the plot is original. Definitely worth seeing at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharply written satire with a great performance from Aaron Eckhart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every now and then, a movie will come along that will show a side of the world not often open to public scrutiny. The tobacco industry is probably one of the most mysterious in the world, with a number of restrictions placed on them over advertising and health warnings meaning we don't really have an idea of how they work. If Jason Reitman's Thank You For Smoking is anything to go by, they are every bit as despicable as you would believe.Thank You For Smoking follows Nick Naylor, a fast talking PR spokesman for tobacco tasked with the unenviable job of making tobacco look good. Aaron Eckhart is absolutely superb in the role of Nick, a man who believes he can win any argument as long as he comes at it from the right angle. And he's right. Throughout the movie you will see Nick worm his way out of sticky situations again and again, with Eckhart's smarminess effectively replacing any sense of logic in his arguments. He's a truly despicable character but you cannot take your eyes off him and, as the movie progresses, you may even find yourself liking him.It is a testament to Eckhart's performance, and the fantastic script, that you find yourself rooting for Nick as he takes on pragmatic politicians, his ex wife and her new husband, a disgruntled former employee and, perhaps most tricky of all, his young son. It may have been risky making a movie about the inner machinations of the tobacco industry but Reitman wisely keeps the tone light throughout, with only a handful of dramatic scenes punctuating the sharp comedy. This may be off-putting to some, due to the serious nature of the subject matter, but Reitman and Co. have clearly aimed for a black satirical comedy and, with a lightning fast script and excellent performances from all involved, it succeeds admirably. A very clever and funny look at the inner workings of the tobacco industry. Some jokes may be too near the knuckle for some but if you're in the mood for some inappropriate laughs then this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick's job is spinning good PR for the tobacco industry, and he is very good at it. Unfortunately, for all his quick thinking and gift of the gab, there are those who feel that he is doing the devil's work and hold him responsible. Nick has to tread a careful line to keep his life in balance.Based on Christopher Buckley's sharply funny satirical novel, Jason Reitman's film is well adapted, well cast and well directed. Nick is the sort of part any actor would leap at, and Aaron Eckhart gives a tour de force performance. There is plenty of food for thought, some decent plot, and a great deal of humour: Nick's sheer nerve in fronting some of the defensive lines he comes up with is funny, funny stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Thank You For Smoking' couldn't be an easy film to sell. It basically tells a lot of people (possibly smokers!) what they don't want to hear, while, at the same time, making that smug smile that only NON-smokers wear, just that little bit more hard to take.However, despite trying to offend most people, it actually works. It's a clever and subtle form of humour which is completely devoid of any (American) 'pie jokes.' It features a great ensemble cast and none one of which lets the side down. It's hard to pick a favourite among so many. You just have to put them all together and let them get on with it (maybe Row Lowe steals every scene?).If you're in the mood for something a little bit more satirical, then give this a go - living proof that Americans DO understand satire just as much as us Brits.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeez, I couldn't come up with any smoking puns that haven't been used</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dang it, that's what I get for waiting 8 years to see this movie. All the other reviewers have already used up all the smoking pun titles. So... without any catchy intro, here's my review."Thank You for Smoking" does something that very few movies can accomplish. It features a character who does reprehensible things, and it makes us genuinely like him, cheer him on, laugh with him &amp; applaud him for doing things which, in real life, would annoy us to the point of heart failure.I'm talking about the "spin doctor", the doublespeaker, the political gasbag who could sell a baby a lollipop made of poop (and count his money as the baby dies of cholera). His name is Nick Naylor (played by Aaron Eckhart), and he is the hero of this movie.You'd think that a movie with this premise could only work as an absurdist comedy like "Airplane!" or "Hot Shots!" or even a Christopher Guest type mockumentary like "Spinal Tap" or "Best in Show". But writer/director Jason Reitman takes the tough road by weaving a straight story with a sane, rational, human protagonist.Yes, this is a satire, so there are plenty of absurdly comical scenes like when Nick shows up at his son's career day and essentially convinces a bunch of 12-year-old kids to smoke. But for the most part, the story is solidly-grounded, logically plausible and probably more truth than it is fiction.In this film, the whole tobacco plot is basically a smokescreen. (Ha, I knew there was a pun left!) The real story is on a human level, and it's the story of a father &amp; his son. Yeah, that might sound a little boring, but that's where the tobacco drama comes in to spice up the tale. In telling the "simple" tale of a father and son, Reitman takes us through many comedic hijinks including traitorous newscasters, psychotic politicians, kidnappers, assassins, shotgun-toting cowboys and a naked guy in the lap of the Lincoln monument. So rest assured, it never gets boring.Nor does the comedy let up, even while telling a sober story of a man attempting to reconcile his amoral career with raising his son in a respectable way. The cute banter between Nick and his son (expertly played by young Cameron Bright) is both philosophical and funny. And that's how Reitman pulls off this amazing achievement. This is a very funny film, but it doesn't depart from reality nor make us emotionally disconnected from the themes at play. It gives you a lot to think about.As far as funny goes, this movie clocked in on my laugh-o-meter with about 1 LOL every 10 minutes and a snicker every 2. Now that's a lot coming from a guy who doesn't usually lol at all. But in the end, it wasn't even the comedy that made this so enjoyable. It was the film's power to make me see a completely different side of a "no brainer" argument like cigarettes &amp; health. The character Nick is so slick-witted and charismatic that he can win any argument (or win the audience over, for that matter) without making any point at all. As he says to his son, "You don't have to prove you're right; you just have to prove your opponent is wrong." Sad but true. And in this case, very funny.I highly recommend this movie to people who are exasperated at all the political doublespeak we hear on the cable news channels every day, to people who can't understand how law &amp; authority &amp; public opinion can get so messed up. It'll make you laugh without upsetting you, and it'll make you see the whole ridiculous debate over smoking as really entertaining. Even though in real life, smoking is a drag ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It provides us with a glimpse of the origins of Reitman's fantastic sense of humour...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's often interesting to see the directorial debut of someone who has gone on to make so many great movies ever since. In so many debuts, like "Duel" or "Following", you can see traces of some of the best tropes or idioms used by a certain director. "Thank You for Smoking" is no different, and provides us with a glimpse of the origins of Jason Reitman's fantastic and often dark sense of humour.The film follows Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for cigarette companies, through various different tasks and problems with his job and family. Nick's relationship with his son is really interesting, and gives the film some of its more touching moments. Plotwise, the film is fairly thin, and takes the shape more of a series of sketches or vignettes with interconnected stories and themes. However, this doesn't bog the film down at all, and just gives it the potential for even more humour and new situations. It's filled with a barrage of fantastic supporting characters too, from Katie Holmes' manipulative journalist, to Rob Lowe's Hollywood agent, and no part of it feels unnecessary or stuck on.The script is the movie's greatest strength, and it reaches a great level of satire, making you think as well as laugh. While smoking is the centre of the movie, it never is encouraged, since we know that Naylor is sweet-talking and slimy. The "Merchants of Death" meetings are a particular stroke of genius, bringing together three controversial industries and making them seem foul. From the very first scene of the film, where Naylor is attempting to put a good spin on cancer when he is opposed greatly on a talk show, even by a boy suffering from lung cancer, you can see that the film is not afraid of being controversial, but manages very well to bring its message across through humour.Lead by a fantastic set of performances and a razor-sharp script, "Thank You for Smoking" is a great start for Jason Reitman, paving the way for his later successes such as "Juno" and "Up in the Air", and manages to be touching, informative and down-right hilarious throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank You for a Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jason Reitman, son of director Ivan Reitman, has forged a nice little career for himself. Is ability to tread the comic minefield of politically incorrect, sly, cynical comedy has resulted in some of the most subversive mainstream comedies to come out in the 2000's. The apex of his short career so far was the topical dramedy Up in the Air (2009) but before his recent successes, he made his feature debut film Thank You for Smoking.Thank You for Smoking tells the story of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) a D.C. lobbyist working for the Institute of Tobacco Studies who shills B.S. for a living with delight. Considered the face of cigarettes at a time when people are up in arms about their health effects, Nick takes on his challenging job with a level of glee and enthusiasm that would wear down a lesser man; all the while the powers that be, including his own boss BR (J.K. Simmons) conspire against him. When not lobbying on behalf of cigarettes, Nick spends his afternoons at a local pub with fellow lobbyists and his weekends with his son Joey (Cameron Bright).Protagonists like Nick are a dime a dozen in modern Hollywood. The viewing public likes a villain like food consumers like fast food; they're not the best role models but their incredibly interesting from a characterization perspective. It is partially for this reason Nick is so irresistible as a character. He lives in the grey area of moral turpitude that many of us have issues with. Of course he's not strictly speaking evil or a villain, not even a scoundrel, he just loves his job so much that he's willing to live with and even enjoy its more dubious moments. He finds it easy while acknowledging that it would be hard for anyone else. He was born to talk.The story of Thank You for Smoking however is not just one about Nick. Reitman expands on the corrosive cynicism of Washington by making nearly every supporting character in the film worse than our hero. Senator Ortolan Finister (William H. Macy) leads the charge in Congress against the tobacco lobby in the movie. His new warning label set to be introduced on the floor for consideration is the main impetus behind many characters' actions. He needlessly demeans his aides and casually and privately supports terrorism against the amiable Nick all while bemoaning the health hazards of cigarettes. Katie Holmes also plays a role as an intrepid reporter who seduces Nick into giving away insider secrets.Nick and Co. eventually get their comeuppance to a degree, yet we're meant to feel sympathy not schadenfreude for him as he addresses the case of freedom of choice. The movie largely succeeds in presenting his plight in large part due to the acting, the directing and the irreverent dialogue. Special mention must be given to Maria Bello and David Koechner for their work as lobbyists for the alcohol and firearm lobby respectively. They help bring a level of brevity that helps move things in a jaunty pace.After Thank You for Smoking Jason Reitman directed the break-away hit Juno (2007) starring Ellen Page; thus catapulting to prominence in the eyes of the viewing public. Soft enough for popular appeal yet sharp enough to evoke wisdom, his films have become a mainstay on the theater marquee. For me however, Thank You for Smoking remains the best of his already impressive, budding career.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes us Sympathise with the Merchants of Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is difficult to tell whether this movie (which is based on a book) an attempt by the tobacco industry to get back at all of the anti-smoking sentiments that are around the place and to try to give smokers a voice, or whether it is simply a satirical look at the lobby industry. I would generally fall towards the second idea though I would not be surprised if funding for this movie, as well as funding for the underlying book, did not find its way from Big Tobacco.Okay, this movie does not put smoking in a good light, but it doesn't put it in a bad light either. What it does is that it follows the tobacco lobbyist Nick Nailer around for a period of probably about a month. There is not real overarching plot to the movie, to point or struggle that he is trying to attain, but rather it is just taking us inside the walls of K-Street and showing us that lobbyists are humans (albeit very highly paid humans) just like us ? namely using their skills to earn a buck so that they can pay the mortgage.The reason that I suspect that there is some ulterior motive coming from this movie is the way that it shifts the perspective of the audience. Basically you sympathise with Nick Nailer, and come to take him as a pretty good bloke, while you begin to see the anti-smoking lobby as a vicious evil monster than uses underhanded tactics to get their point across. There are a couple of instances in the movie where Nailer is attacked, first physically, and then socially, and these two events pretty much swing us around to his side and make us feel that we want to stick up for him.In a way this movie (and I suspect the underlying book) persuades us to see another side of the lobbyist, a side where we begin to sympathise with him, to see that he is actually not a bad bloke, just simply somebody who is paid to spin spin. It is not so much that he lies, rather it is that he changes the topic of discussion, and takes control of the debate. In fact he changes the debate to basically suit his own position, while stealing the limelight away from his opponent.In a way I am not surprised that this film was released by Fox Searchlight. It seems, to me, a satirical response to the rise of independent left theatre, and tries to make us see the good that is in all people, so that we begin to not only sympathise with, and actually begin to like, a type of person that we would normally despise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't force you or even inspires you to smoke. But it really opens your view towards Smoking. Everybody knows how harmful smoking can be, but still lot of us smoke. So the message this movies very smartly tries to give away is that it really a matter of opinion how you view smoking. Thank You For Smoking play a smart comedy on the topic of smoking and people behind the scene who want to eradicate the whole smoking issue by terrorizing people of it's ill effects.Great satirical movie, Aaron Eckhart a real good guy playing a character that some what is a bad guy type.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a well done film, but it's message falls on deaf ears.Even with the exorbitant price of cigarettes, the same people smoke and the industry gains new smokers by the thousands each day, often teenagers (or pre-teens).Frankly, I wish more people would smoke because they would pay into social security and Medicare and die before they benefited. That would increase my social security benefit and decrease my Medicare premium. As voiced in the film 'Wall Street,'.........'greed is good.' As we see from Robert Ringer's 'Looking Out For #1,' published in 1977, I am the most important person on earth. Abortion kills more people than cigarettes, but that is another topic for another day.If the film makes us think, it is worthwhile; but, it presents a parody, as stated, which will not persuade smokers or wannabee smokers from using tobacco. For a never smoker like me, who cares about people (but not smokers), the film was amusing, which is why I rate it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaron Eckhart made his first big-screen impression in Neil LaBute's 1997 flick "In the Company of Men". Since then, he not been given good enough leading man roles, but luckily, this time was not the case as he stars as Nick Naylor, tobacco industry lobbyist extraordinaire, in first-time director/writer Jason Reitman's (later directed Juno and Up in the Air) wonderfully acerbic comedy about the power of media spin around the availability of cigarettes despite inescapable evidence that smoking kills. Nick's two lobbyist buddies are played with barbed precision by David Koechner as the Bush-sound-alike firearms specialist and the wonderful Maria Bello as the sharp-tongued alcohol representative. The film's perspective is ruthlessly cynical and most of the characters are morally ambiguous, but those are the primary reasons why this movie sizzles full of shrewd insights about political gamesmanship in both the public and private sectors. Aaron Eckhart is used to great measure to portray a character who has a moral black hole and an eager disposition to show just how black it is.Nick's lobbying powers make him a god in his world. He cannot do wrong, he flies coach and mingles with the people (and induces them to smoke), and he's become the favorite of the tobacco czar (Robert Duvall) who is using his own money to bribe a former Marlboro man dying of cancer, played by Sam Neill, not to talk against the industry and to use the money for a charity. He's also trying to negotiate a smart move (against his bosses' wishes) with a Hollywood super-agent (Rob Lowe) to re-introduce smoking in films because nowadays, only Europeans and psycho-villains smoke -- it's deglamorized Hollywood. They suggest bringing Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones in a movie about smoking in space. (Listen to them talk, and listen to how they would resolve the "minor" issue that smoking cannot be done in space.) Beginning with the inventive artwork of the opening credits, the plot goes in unexpected directions, and while the ending is a bit soft, overall the movie satisfies. The smart, provocative characters really make you think about the persistent hypocrisy of big business and government in refreshing ways that are not remotely disdainful. . Don't miss the scenes involving MOD Squad and how Katie Holmes exploits Nick. Even the comparatively soft-centered scenes of Nick with his son have a nice edge, and with his translucent blue eyes, Cameron Bright strikes the right, non-judgmental notes as Joey. Reitman seems fully capable of bringing an acidic flavor to the most Capra-esquire situation. Reitman has recruited a first-class cast to bring his brittle satire to life starting with a superb turn by Eckhart, who alternates easily between unapologetically smug and begrudgingly likable..My Rating- 9/10</fullReview>

It being the first one (i doubt its the first one ever, but for the sake of the argument) a lot had to be done in making you like this character doomed and for good reasons hated by everyone else. You might hate him in real life, but not here. Its a man who has a job, who is good at is, who likes it and tries to live a normal life. things, naturally go out of control a bit, but you still continue rooting for him. I recommend this movie highly. i regret not watching it earlier actually. Its dialog based, funny with its own jokes and very nice acting worthy of such a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Thank You for Smoking' is to tobacco what 'Sideways' is to wine and 'Casino' is to the casinos of Las Vegas.The movie is about the life of a lobbyist, Nick Naylor, spokesperson for a major tobacco firm, whose gift of gab and ability to shut the fellow debaters on national television draws admirers from the industry but at the same time increases the number of concerned citizens, who campaign for the ban of tobacco in all forms, by a manifold.Nick, a divorcée with a teenage son, tries his best to not influence his son to take up what he campaigns for- tobacco, and rather lets him choose what is best for himself. We get to see the functioning of the tobacco industry, how deals are made, how dissidents are bought off with money, how the company disowns its employees when a plan goes awry and how trying to save one's job puts one's life at jeopardy.The movie does not necessarily edify the viewers but it does provide what we seek-entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film of humour that rightfully landed Jason Reitman on the map</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I never read the novel but god i wanted to see this concept deliver and the trailer had me spellbound. In the end, Thank You for Smoking does deliver. It gives out humor that have broad appeal along with a satirical plot that is not convoluted as it's plot is brought out in style. Jason Reitman is a boss. I loved his work in Up in the Air and Juno was fantastic. He deserves all the praise he gets as far as I'm concerned and it started with this film. WITH GOOD REASON. Thank You for Smoking takes full advantage of it's comical concept and becomes a tour de force. You can see it in its editing. The characterization and the voice overs of Eckhart(don't get me started with Eckhart) in match with the still shots just matches so perfectly bringing out a nice appealing and straight story to get integrated with. The performances of all the actors are great. Except Katie Holmes, there's just something artificial about her. Im so sorry Katie but god Aaron Eckhart blows this one out of the park. He takes the role so simply and encompasses it with the way he talks and the body language. It really does not feel like he's doing any effort at all, as if it's all a natural part of him. Comical dialogue and satire were brought in at the right times and it never felt too strange or out of place. The soundtrack can sometimes be the simple use of single percussion or strings but it's simplicity adds the feeling needed for the occasion.Thank You for Smoking is stylish, witty and filled with entertainment. You don't have to understand the political concerns or the general knowledge about something as controversial as smoking. Just go in, take a load off and watch the film pioneered by the wonders of Jason Reitman. The film is bound to give smiles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The humour of this movie comes from depicting actual behaviour of big tobacco in the in the mouth of a completely insincere charmer. The absurdity is magnified.The cleverest parts of the movie come between Aaron Eckhart as the handsome Nick Naylor, unscrupulous tobacco lobbyist and Cameron Bright as 12-year old Joey Naylor who idolises and mimics his father. They even look a bit alike. Joey longs to be as amoral as his dad.Joey's lines often use vocabulary too advanced, that he can barely pronounce. You realise that other characters are feeding them to him. Yet near the end of the movie, he persists in the same delivery. It is a subtle sort of joke, that now the writer his handing him the lines.Naylor is the protagonist, so you tend to sympathise with him. He is is such a sleaze, that you want him punished. The movie, with comedic improbability, tries to satisfy both audience urges.Big tobacco's arguments use the most sleazy and outrageous arguments (selected from real life), flummoxing the anti-smoking people with their audaciousness.The movie is somewhat predictable since it spoofs real events, but it is fun just the same. I might describe it as a romp where seasoned actors were given reign to ham it up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smoke them if you got them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aaron Eckhart stars as Nick Naylor, the too slick Big Tobacco spokesman whom uses arguments that always capable of deflecting criticism of his clients. While he may win with his excellent debating abilities he is never really "right" (although he may claim otherwise). This juxtaposition of never being wrong and never being right is what Nick attempts to resolve in a way conducive to bringing up his 12 year old son whom is a smart young man trying to figure out the world and what his father's place in it is. This movie satirizes virtually anything that fits into the movie including lobbyists, journalists, senators, the film industry, Big Tobacco, daytime talk shows and more. The supporting cast is great, in the way they are subtle, hilarious, and natural. William H. Macy plays the antagonist to Naylor, whom is a Senator wanting to eradicating smoking by putting an warning label on every package of cigarettes. Rob Lowe is the quirk movie executive with a penchant for everything Asian and is extremely worry to Naylor's plan to get smoking back into movies. Katie Holmes plays the love interest, as a reporter willing to go to great lengths for her cover story of Naylor. Maria Bello and David Koechner play Naylor's lobbyists buddies known in the inner circle as the M.O.D (Merchants of Death). Rob Lowe is the quirk movie executive with a penchant for everything Asian and is extremely against to Naylor's plan to get smoking back into movies. Robert Duvall and J.K. Simmons play stereotypical over the top characters working with Big Tobacco. Last is the Sam Elliot's cameo as an the original Marlboro Man dying of lung cancer which seems peak into reality truth.This movies main weakness is that it is only 92 minutes long. Audiences willing to see such a smart film are willing to devote a full two hours to getting a little more complex story. The resolution of the film wasn't very satisfying but certainly held well to Naylor's non-judgemental Laissez-faire worldview. Still, Thank you For Smoking is an extremely smart, well written, and stylish film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh and lovable satire that promises a great career from Jason Reitman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being able to see where this movie got Jason Reitman makes me able to appreciate it even more. Even though it's good enough on its own. 'Thank You for Smoking' is a satire about the inner workings of tobacco marketing. Think of a funny 'Mad Men'. Nick Naylor (Eckhart) is the heart of cigarette marketing after his controversial statements on some talk show. And while the bad press for cigarettes is heating up, a journalist (Holmes) throws herself into Nick's personal life to learn everything she can. Nick has multiple social groups, such as the MOD, upper-management, and (ex-)family. To start off, Aaron Eckhart smashes the role of Nick Naylor and makes me wonder why he doesn't land more leading roles. He was spot-on while playing the egotistic and stubborn cigarette exec, but he had enough charm and humor to make him feel like a real person. And among his life, he wants to teach his son about what he does and why he does it. And I know someone who has said that this is a 1 1/2 hour cigarette commercial, but I can assure you he's out of his mind. If anything, this is a 1 1/2 hour anti-smoking commercial. The entire dilemma throughout the movie is how the cigarette company is going to stay alive in light of the new health discoveries. It also touches on how to get fooled by spokespeople and shows you their conniving tricks. The message isn't very subtle because, after all, this is a satire.This movie is a satire, but do not confuse that with comedy. Sure, this movie gives its laughs, but it also has more heart and plot than a comedy. Turning your brain off for mindless laughs will not get you through this movie. The comedy is there, but you still have to think throughout the film and see the true emotion it gives you.All in all, I loved this movie. It's a satire for the ages that will give you laughs, heart, and pure interest. I honestly couldn't take my eyes off of this movie. Hopefully you'll love it as much as I did, because I do know that this isn't for everyone. But hey, I loved it. {A}</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguing out of moral quandaries and into a place among classic satirical comedies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) talks. He could argue why America is the best government in the world (igorning errors in syntax) even if they sound like arguments for why it isn't. What he does is spin smoking cigarettes into a good thing. He's the spokesperson for Big Tobacco and he doesn't have to convince you that smoking is good for you, he just has to convince you that it's not not good for you."Thank You for Smoking" is a satirical comedy that is as funny as it is true. We follow Nick as he goes through the political and cultural centres of the country, seeing what he does for a living. He's passionate about what he does mostly because he likes talking. But when a certain, pretty, young reporter comes knocking he's ready to say that he does it to pay the mortgage. "Perhaps the world would be a better place if everybody rented." Nick, of course, does both. He pays the mortgage on the house that his son, his ex-wife and her new boyfriend live in, and then he rents his own apartment. As attractive as Eckhart is, and as smart and funny as his character is, it's not surprising that he's single. After one too many arguments turned into negotiations, I would be out the door too.But the film isn't just about Nick, it's about his relationship with his son and how that affects him and his job. Things said and done to a certain, pretty, young reporter also affect his job. The certain, pretty, young reporter is played by Katie Holmes and she is just one of many supporting characters who turn in hilarious performances. Nick's best friends are Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), an advocate for guns, and Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), an "alcohol is good for you" spokesperson. Together they are the Merchants of Death, the MOD Squad.J.K. Simmons plays his boss, and Robert Duvall plays The Captain, and Sam Elliot plays a cowboy (and remember, cowboys don't like bribes). You probably couldn't find better casting. The funniest roles have William H. Macy as a Senator from the fine state of Vermont who always finds himself defending cheese rather than bringing down cigarettes; Rob Lowe as a Hollywood agent who's better at his job than Nick is at his; Adam Brody also seems to talk for a living but in a much different way than our "hero".One of the main reasons "Thank You for Smoking" is a success is because of the screenplay by Jason Reitman, based on the novel by Christopher Buckley. It's smart and funny; two qualities severely lacking in most comedies. When you're not laughing out loud at the moral quandaries that Nick talks his way out of, you're probably learning a trick or two to use in debate class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious portrayal of the farce that is our nation's politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nine times out of ten, when I read a book before seeing the movie, I enjoy the book much more; but the movie "Thank You For Smoking" (TYFS) is that rare occurrence of a movie which is the equal of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the book TYFS, which I still rate as one of Christopher Buckley's best. In movie form TYFS is even more impactful, due to the stronger sensory experience of the cinema, while being equally funny and insightful - but not, of course, as pleasingly long or in-depth.What makes TYFS succeed so brilliantly is Buckley's satirical behind-the-scenes view of how Washington politics and politicians work, and what they say, feel and do, both in public and behind closed doors (which, of course, is quite a contrast). Although certain scenes in TYFS are a bit over-the-top, and one might quibble with certain things the characters say and do, one gets the sense that there is a lot more truth about our political system in TYFS than there is in today's 6 o'clock evening news.Movie writer/director Jason Reitman faithfully transfers Buckley's views to the silver screen, and the production values of TYFS are top-notch. Aaron Eckhart us simply amazing as lead character Nick Naylor: he is perfectly cast as the handsome, well-spoken lead lobbyist for the tobacco industry, and he gives a great performance. The supporting cast also turns in a series of fine performances: notable are Katie Holmes as an unscrupulous investigative reporter, Maria Bello as a fellow lobbyist (for the alcoholic beverages industry), Robert Duvall as the patriarch of the tobacco industry, and Sam Elliott as the original Marlboro Man. The settings and cinematography are outstanding, and the producers even got Joan Lunden and Dennis Miller for a couple of talk show scenes. Any quibbles about the movie aren't worth mentioning, aside from the fact that the movie is definitely for adults, even though there's nothing explicit about the visual images.So if you are someone who takes a skeptical, perhaps cynical, view of the goings-on in Washington D.C., and would enjoy laughing at how you suspect Washington really works, then you will thoroughly enjoy "Thank You For Smoking".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eckhart manages to make you like the unlikable... again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without the right Nick Naylor this film sinks without a trace, or more likely isn't made.That is because Nick Naylor is pro-smoking, or if that is unacceptable at least he is anti-anti smoking. His day to day involves going on a myriad of talk shows and current affairs programs and being the bad guy, the guy that continually says "come on it's not that bad", or "there is no medical evidence that categorically shows that", and when that fails tries to distract and lead the conversation elsewhere by any means necessary.While I was watching Thank You for Smoking I kept thinking about In The Company of Men, a film where the lead character was such a prick yet so sorta likable that you cringed whenever he said or did something horrible, but you couldn't wait to see what he would say or try to get away with next. In the Company of Men featured a virtually unknown (at the time) Aaron Eckhart? Guess who plays Nick Naylor? Nick knows in advance that he is the bad guy in each and every conversation and meeting, but he seems to relish the challenge of taking on all the anti-smoking crusaders that takes pot shots at him, and he basks in every glory even though he never lets down the vaguely smarmy and hurt "I can't believe you're having a crack at smoking" face, like it is the anti-smoking guys who are evil and despicable.Nick's only friends are his employers who know how important he is to there cancer-causing cause, and similarly shady advocates/defenders of other industries perceived as nasty at various times, the gun and the alcohol lobbyists, they regularly catch up and trade war stories about battles won and how they spun an unfortunate event into something that didn't reflect poorly on their product. They also secretly fight for bragging rights as to which industry actually kills more, (Yay alcohol!) Nick's adventures take him to Los Angeles as it is decided that to make smoking cool again it must be featured in films, more importantly it must be the right actors who smoke, not the villains or the weak, but the heroes and movie stars to cast the right light? so to speak.Through the film Nick meets an ambitious young journalist played by Katie Holmes, who he promptly bangs, a slick talking Hollywood big-shot played by Rob Lowe who is willing to help with the smoking industry's goal ? for a (large) price, and the unfortunate man who was the Marlboro Man equivalent that is totally non-ironically dying of cancer himself. Nick's nemesis is played by Bill Macy as the senator who has made anti-smoking his personal platform, only he is constantly coming off second best in his battles and is forever wondering why when he obviously has the high moral ground.Thank You for Smoking is one of those clever little films that is perhaps a little too clever for a large audience, even though there aren't too many twists and turns a lot of the humour is in exactly how Nick manages to turn a seemingly hopeless scenario in his favour, and how he puts down the well meaning and basically correct detractors of smoking without ever making them look bad, only confused. This sort of humour probably doesn't mesh well with the "drinks his own wee-wee by mistake" stuff that panders to the 11 brain cell crowd, and in truth it isn't as funny as a lot of those films. What it is though is an example of how Aaron Eckhart might be the most unlikely likable bad guy in films at the moment, his Nick Naylor is smooth talking, smarmy, quick, convincing: and 100% full of sh*t. But as a spin doctor charged with protecting the reputation of the most evil of all habits he is simply the best.What is perhaps more scary is that you just know there are hundreds like him out there all being paid vast sums of money to do the same thing in real life.As a guy Nick Naylor is essentially a reprehensible piece of work, as a film Thank You for Smoking doesn't merit such scorn. It is punchy, clever and fast paced without being laugh a minute or world-changing, and solidifies Aaron Eckhart as the guy you didn't even know you liked but do.Final Rating ? 7.5 / 10. The strange thing is that this isn't the sort of film that I would normally choose to watch, that doesn't mean it isn't any good though. By the way, I don't think I remember one scene where someone actually takes a drag on a smoke in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaron Eckhart (Nick Naylor) gives a very strong performance as a professional "B.S." spokesman for the cigarette industry. The cast was rounded with J.K.

I tried it but, I just couldn't start it. I am very happy for that point. This movie gets your juices rolling on whether or not you are a smoker or an non-smoker.

		<shortDescription>The Great State Of Vermont Will Not Apologise For Its Cheese !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Naylor is the chief spokesman for a tobacco lobby group and spends most of his time promoting smoking by arguing for freedom of choice. But when a health-conscious politician proposes a bill to label all cigarettes as poison, Nick will need all his debating skills to appear before a Senate Hearing on the issue.I think there's an unfair view in some quarters that Americans do not produce good satire. The reverse is true. Whilst it may be a rare sub-genre within Hollywood comedies, when it appears it's often razor-sharp (Dr Strangelove, Winter Kills), and this movie about the awkward, complicated, incestuous relationship between smoking and politics is hilarious and insightful from start to finish. Nick may not be the nicest guy, but it's hard not to respond to his good-natured intelligence, love of what he does and disdain for those who take the simplistic moral high ground. The story also keeps pitching him against wacky and intriguing characters, particularly the amusing Merchants Of Death lobbyist meetings with Bello and Koechner. Eckhart is great - wry, unpretentious and totally focused. The scene where he uses reverse moral indignation to buy Elliott's silence is a little piece of comic perfection. Nick's relationship with his son Joey is seamlessly woven into the story and each serves as a moral focus for the other. The whole thing zooms along at a terrific pace with hardly a shot or a moment wasted; the only bum note for me was the reporter played by Holmes, who's a bit predictable (not to mention creepy). Everyone knows that all tobacco companies are just inflated legalised street-corner drug-pushers - that's hardly a secret. What's less obvious is that those who oppose them are frequently self-appointed, self-righteous and patronising, with questionable agendas of their own. This movie takes careful aim at both sides and scores a double bullseye. A funny, well-crafted and thought-provoking debut feature from Jason Reitman (son of Ghostbusters man Ivan Reitman), based on a fine book by former White House speechwriter Christopher Buckley.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reitman Jr.'s First and Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a lampoon both slashing and refined, a dart rather than a bullet. Thank You for Smoking aims at the pro-smoking lobby with a bleak admiration for human nature. It stars Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor, a spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies. We meet him on The Joan Lunden Show, sitting next to a chemo-ridden 15-year-old boy dying of cancer, but has stopped smoking. Nick steps gracefully up to the plate: "It's in our best interests to keep Robin alive and smoking," he explains. "The anti-smoking people want Robin to die." Nick Naylor is an upbeat, suave career lobbyist who is divorced, loves his son Joey (Cameron Bright, who seemed to be in a good cluster of movies between 2004-06 before just evaporating) and addresses the kid's class on career day. "Please don't ruin my childhood," Joey begs, yet his dad gives a little girl the third degree whose mother says cigarettes can kill you: "Is your mother a doctor?" Once a week he eats with the MOD Squad, whose other affiliates are alcohol lobbyist Mario Bello and firearms lobbyist David Koechner. They debate over which of their products kills the most people. It always makes me laugh because one always wonders who would be these people's friends? Each other, most likely.The movie was directed by Jason Reitman, then 29. It is his least successful so far, but his best so far. What's most impressive in his first feature is his mastery of pitch. He conveys a particular impartial reasoning to his approach, such as how Nick arbitrates with Hollywood producer Rob Lowe on the question of how to get movie stars to smoke on screen again. Nowdays, they concur, no one smokes in the movies save for villains and Europeans. The stars would have to smoke in historical pictures, because in a contemporary film other characters would invariably be asking them why they smoke. Or, why not in the future, after cigarettes are better? Smoking in a space station? Reitman's father directed Twins, Dave and the Ghostbusters films. However junior has his own M.O., subversive and downplayed. Rather than occupying his movie with people smoking and coughing and wheezing, he presents not one person smoking, except Robert Duvall's antiquated Captain, kingpin of the tobacco industry, who sports a cigar more like a pistol than a luxury. Instead, the film's delightful soundtrack harks back to popular hits that glorified smoking in the 1940s, '50s and '60s. And Eckhart is beaming, upbeat, and even confiding. He's not incapable of being taken advantage of himself on occasion; he's just resilient when that occurs.Based on a novel (written by no other than Christopher Buckley, the Obama-supporting son of poster-boy Republican William F. Buckley), Reitman's own screenplay keeps the erudite tang. I greatly appreciate the film's sense of form. Nick Naylor is not pompous or vainglorious so much as an impartial witness of his own grandeur. It is the movie's intention to humble him, but he never stoops, even in an especially tight pickle still relying on his proficiency at spinning anything to his advantage. His antagonist in the film is William H. Macy, a Vermont environmentalist Senator whose office desk is populated with all his hoarded maple syrup bottles. The senator has proposed a bill ordering a skull and crossbones to be put on every cigarette pack, usurping the government health warning. The insignia is superior to the words, he says, as "They want those who do not speak English to die." The film's inflection is so adept that it can even make a villain out of a politician who's actually doing something about public health and environmental safety. And the movie does it tastefully even.Should the movie be more biting? Many have lost their lives to cigarettes while many others, including myself, smoke themselves silly, though it's unlikely that more vitriol would better it. All smokers and non-smokers know cigarettes can kill you, yet they stay purchasable and make billions of dollars in taxes. Ground zero of the movie is not nearly as much tobacco as lobbying altogether, which along with advertising and spin-control makes a vast assortment of affliction and decay tolerable to the people. You can discern when something is not good for you by the amount of work done to persuade you it is innocuous or favorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Told from the perspective of a lobbyist, this film takes a satirical look at the tobacco industry. It is really not about smoking - it's about spin doctoring and how big business manipulates consumers. This black comedy has chuckles here and there, but mostly leaves a lukewarm impression. It tries very hard to be hip, but the comedy is not funny enough and the satire is not edgy enough to rise above mediocrity. It gets off to a good start with an amusing opening scene on a TV talk show, but the script is somewhat meandering and simplistic and runs out of steam. It has a terrific cast headed by Eckhart, well suited to the role of the slimy salesman.</fullReview>

Kudos to the director Reitman for a good film.The movie is basically a satire on well many 'x'doings around(U can decide for yourself what is X - good or bad). To name a few :- Smoking/No smoking, hypocrite politicians, fanatic bosses who keep ordering around for their own good, reporters going limitless for a 'STORY'......The most important part of the film is the father-son relationship which is handled with great care. The father does not force but allows his son to decide what is bad and what is good and if anything is good and then go Argue for it....do not negotiate..!!!The film has a good cast ensemble with Eckhart, Simmons, Macy, Holmes all playing their part well...!! The movie has a great message...no no not about smoking but 'Everybody has a talent'....!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheeky, somewhat precious send-up of amoral big business...good laugh lines and an expert cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cleverly-balanced comedy juggles dark-hued elements within an inviting package. The moral ambiguities of a smooth-talking, quick-thinking lobbyist for the tobacco industry come under fire while he continues to work for a heartless organization that panics when cigarette sales drop even the slightest percent and children with cancer turn up on TV talk shows. Writer-director Jason Reitman doesn't attempt to use sneaky reverse psychology on the audience; he boldly displays the smug recklessness of not only the tobacco industry, but the squawk-boxes for the alcohol and firearms people as well. We see them for the bloodsuckers they are, bragging about doing their dirty work "for the mortgage"...Reitman even manages to make them funny. Aaron Eckhart was the perfect casting choice for this "Sultan of Spin"; with his creamy pseudo-charm and unbridled arrogance, Eckhart knows just how to play the devil incarnate and make him both wily and buffoonish. Reitman's film-making style is amusingly jaded in a glossy format; he wrings big laughs out of the quotable dialogue, though there's no weight behind his verbal (and visual) slings and arrows. The movie's edges are blunted in its quest to be likable--it's just a send-up of the outrageous behavior we read about or see on the daily news. There's nothing here which goes beyond the cheeky, sideways-slanted humor which deliberately dominates, though the entire cast makes it a fun jaunt. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a great film, mainly for the fact that it poked fun at all sides of the smoking debate; from the tobacco lobbyists repeatedly stating that there is "no conclusive proof" that cigarettes are harmful, to the anti-smoking legislators who think that putting a stamp on the front of a pack of cigarettes will actually stop people from smoking, everyone gets poked fun at.I though Aaron Eckhart did a great job in his role as Nick Naylor, a man trying to be the spokesman for Big Tobacco and at the same time, trying to remain a role model for his twelve year old son.All in all, I thought this movie did a great job at balancing the line between sad and funny, and came out with a wonderful movie.

		<shortDescription>Fun, Smart Movie On A Unique Subject</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" took a subject that could have been a little iffy and really made a smart, fun movie out of it. The idea of a lobbyist for smoking companies fighting for smoking rights is a good idea for a movie. Everyone these days knows that smoking is bad for you, but some people still desire to smoke, so it really makes sense.It is funny enough, yet serious enough to play towards a couple different emotions successfully. We root for Nick Naylor throughout the film, whether he is fighting for the tobacco companies or whether he denounces them. I like his character and I like the way that he deals with his kid. He is not going to win any parent of the year awards, but he speaks to him with intelligence and as an equal.I like the cast of this movie as well. I have always found Aaron Eckhart to be likable and he continues to be in this role. I'm not usually a fan of kid actors, but I thought that Cameron Bright did a pretty decent job as Nick's son. I also really like JK Simmons in most every role he is in, this one included.This is a very fun movie on a subject that could have easily failed. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thank You For Smoking" takes us to the other side of cigarettes - those poor companies that manufacture them, and focuses in on a lobbyist, Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) and his efforts to defend cigarettes. The story starts out on the "Joan Lunden Show" with Naylor as the only pro-cigarette voice, up against the antis, including "Cancer Boy," a 15-year-old bald kid who has cancer but has quit smoking. As usual, Naylor gets one up on a Senator (Bill Macy) who has sent his assistant to appear on the show. Naylor also meets with two other unpopular people, a pro-gun official (David Koechner) and a pro-alcohol one (Maria Bello), and the three discuss which activity kills the most people. One of Naylor's jobs is to bring a briefcase loaded with money from his boss (Robert Duval) to the former Marlboro man (Sam Elliott) who is now stricken with cancer. Naylor is clever in his discussions about smoking and the freedom of choice, and his son (Cameron Bright) learns a lot from him as he watches him work. Naylor, though, runs into problems when engages in pillow talk with an ambitious reporter (Katie Holmes).The best scenes take place in Hollywood with Rob Lowe as a top agent arranging for the cigarette company to finance a futuristic film that will again make cigarettes look sexy. One can tell that Reitman has had lots of dealings in Hollywood with the supplicant assistant, the slick-talking agent, the fast phony friendship, and the way deals are put together.Irreverent, funny, and outrageous, "Thank You for Smoking" benefits from solid, sharp direction from Jason Reitman and his clever script, as well as very good performances. The points made are good ones: It's all about the spin, we have the ability to decide for ourselves, and whatever happened to personal responsibility?Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although there have been tons of comedies this decade that are based on nothing but swear words, sexual references and obscenity, there are definitely some that are smart and enjoyable. Is this one of them? Why yes, it is. The storyline is great. The protagonist is a person who twists the truth in order to defend smoking. The dialogue is pretty good. There is swearing but it's not nearly as much as a lot of the comedies that come out nowadays. The acting is impressive as well, except perhaps the main character's son who is a bit emotionless.The only problem with this movie that there aren't nearly as much funny moments as I'd like. Sure, there are some parts that made me smile, even chuckle a bit but overall solely as a comedy, it's not that great. But as a general movie, it definitely is.In the end, this a very entertaining movie, though if you're looking solely for laughs, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

He plays a character named Nick Naylor who is a lobbyist and the speaker for the tobacco industry and the guy knows how to talk. This film has some smart and witty humor that will keep you chuckling or at least amused. Just about every cast of this movie did there part well and have no complaints. Nick Naylor's son actually plays a big part in the movie as well and didn't seem like some plot device and the relationship between they is intriguing. This film also does a great job with satire and although it may go a bit over the top at times, it was very entertaining. As a matter of fact I saw it twice cause it was just that fun and the message of the film didn't feel forced at all. Aaron Eckhart is flawless in this film to the point every time I see him in any other movie, this movie always comes to my mind. This film is a brilliant satire and is definitely worth checking out.8.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies giving education and lecturing about ill-effects of smoking, doping etc can be boring and predictable . But if the same message is given with a touch of satire, then the concept becomes interesting. The story is about one Nick Naylor (Eckhart) who earns a living by speaking for smoking and taking the side of tobacco. People obviously hate him and call him a devil, monster etc. But he has the knack to get out of a tricky situation because of his wit and "talking" talent. He is friends with two people having similar jobs (One speaks for alcohol and the other for fire arms). They call themselves the 'Mod Squad'. They always argue about which of them is the most hated and which obsession kills people the most (All The Mod Squad scenes are the funniest in the movie). The life of Naylor changes when he takes his son with him on a trip and then gets kidnapped by one of his haters. This movie can surely be called an educational movie without the lecturing. You can call this 'Moral Preaching' without the actual preaching .Aaron Eckhart(He became popular recently for acting in The Dark Knight playing Two Face/Harvey Dent), has played his part to perfection. He convinces that he is really taking the side of the deadly addiction. The scenes with his son are also very good. Katie Holmes as the seductress reporter who "uses" Naylor for information is a sizzler. Was pleased to see Robert Duvall after a long time even if it was for a very short role. This movie In short is Education with entertainment.Rating : 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't remember when I last watched this hilarious a film. To get it out of the way, I have not read the novel, and was not aware that it existed until I came on here. This is the first I've seen of by Jason Reitman, though I've been wanting to for a long time, and when I heard about this four years ago, I instantly knew that I was going to watch it. My high expectations were met and surpassed. This movie has razor-sharp powerful satire, and in copious amounts. The plot is excellent, and it doesn't lose you at any point. This is well-paced, and the almost 90 minutes seem to pass very quickly. The story-telling is magnificent, and the narration is perfectly used. Acting is spot-on, every performance is flawless and all roles well-cast. The cinematography and editing are impeccable, and the stylization hits the balance with incredible precision, never taking the focus away from the subject matter. Dialog is well-delivered, and all of the writing in this is amazing, so much said with so little, and the message clearly stated without coming off as preachy. The humor is verbal, clever, pitch black and hits the mark. Not a single joke or gag tries too hard. The subject of spin is dealt with in such a respectful manner, without talking down to the audience, in a way that you only an indie flick can. There is a lot of strong language and brief sexual content, but no nudity. The DVD holds trailers and a well-done, entertaining and smart five-minute featurette. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine they would enjoy it. Why aren't all wake-up calls this funny? 8/10</fullReview>

After having started to believe Comedy movies could not be anymore a good entertainer as it was before, i got to correct the notion after seeing this film. Well a voguish, fun filled comedy entertainer is back. The movie is all about a never failing lobbyist trying to delude those people who believe Cigarettes are harmful. There was not a single moment when i saw the movie did i get bored. The way the plot moves is great enough to keep you hooked to the film right from the beginning till the end. Well the dialogs were intellectual and well when i say dialogs do let me quote one. The favorite one i had in this movie, 'if you argue correctly, you're never wrong'. It's a great fun watching Nick Naylor in the movie using his smart convincing ability on people. Well that kinda sums up the movie. well i don't want to get in to the plot and make this comment more of a spoiler but rather i would be doing the right thing to recommend this flick to anyone who would like to be entertained with a thoughtful, intellectual and a funny movie, be it a smoker or a non-smoker :) Check this movie for yourself and you will know that this movie has got all ingredients to make it a perfect entertainer. The acting performances by Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor and Cameron Bright as Joey Naylor are really good and is worth mentioning. Now Thanks for Reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picture-perfect movie about a tobacco lobbyist who makes a living out of shilling fags and selling the message: hey, so cigarettes are deadly, but let's for the love of god not ever think about banning them. The movie loosely follows the concept of "Meet The Osbournes", porn documentaries and "Goodfellas" in that it allows us to spend time with people who fascinate us, but whom we'd rather avoid actually meeting, and would in all truth prefer to have shot or locked up.Director Jason Reitman (son of director Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame) deftly uses Christopher Buckley's novel (Chris being the son of William F. Buckley) by adopting much of the dialogue while focusing much of the story on our antihero's surprisingly unglamorous, everyday trials and tribulations, such as dealing with his estranged son and the ruins of his marriage. I think that this is a very smart move as it gives the movie depth and story, and compliments the sardonic dialogue nicely.The lead is played by Aaron Eckhart, by the way, who is the son of Eckhart the elder, who also had a very big chin but never amounted to anything. Fascinating bit of trivia there.</fullReview>

Nick Naylor is well aware that smoke kills people and is just generally being a jerk about it, but he's somewhat likable because all the other characters are even worse than him. As he states, they all have a mortgage to pay. I love how mean some of these scenes are, like when they're forced to make an expensive anti-smoke ad for teenagers and immediately want to find out how to make it as unconvincing as possible. I mean, of course that's how it goes in real life, but seeing it on screen just makes it that much closer. This movie really just goes from one in your face scene to another without too much of a plot, and I must say I like it that way. It's just some days in the life of a guy with no morals, not specifically a story about him, just everyday life. That kind of approach really helped. This movie is also really witty, by the way, I'd almost forget. There are some really awesome lines in there, and those are always welcome. Truly a great satire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally speaking, there are three kinds of satire: Toothless, effective, and rabid. Thank You For Smoking falls very firmly into the third category. While its heart sometimes seems to be in the right place, its facts are sometimes dodgy, and the whole thing comes off as hating America. There is a scene in which the anti-hero tells his son why America is such a terrible place, conveniently ignoring the fact that there is virtually nowhere better in Asia, Africa, or South America. Europe is more arguable, but the movie does not realize any of this. It sees the world as one filled with corruption and lies on both sides of the battle lines. Only the writer himself seems to be blameless in this scenario. A mixed pleasure, overall, but this movie still has its moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie turned out to be a very pleasant surprise as I was expecting your run-of-the-mill comedy. Not only is it witty in a subtle, sophisticated way, but it is also extremely intelligent in its approach to the subject - spin doctors and the stories they spin.It is the story of Nick Naylor who is the major spokesman for big tobacco and his quest to keep his job as well as establish a strong bond of communication with his pre-adolescent son. His major foe in the public eye is Senator Ortolan Finistirre of Vermont. It has been decided by the big bosses that Nick should travel to Hollywood in order to arrange for the romantic stars of a movie be smokers as were the stars of yesteryear - think of Bette Davis and Paul Henreid in Now, Voyager which contains probably the greatest cigarette lighting and smoking scene ever filmed. Along the way, Nick faces the problems of an investigative reporter and The Marlboro Man who is dying of lung cancer and suing big tobacco. Probably the most subtle and humorous irony of all of this is that there in not one cigarette smoked in the entire film.Aaron Eckhart does a bang-up job of portraying Nick Naylor. He makes the viewer really believe this character even though such blatant lies come from his mouth. All the while you wonder at this outwardly totally amoral man and his loving relationship with his son. Speaking of his son, Cameron Bright gives that character just the right combination of innocence and savvy of a budding young man trying to relate to his father.Nick's machinations are supported by no less than Robert Duvall and Rob Lowe who turn in great tongue-in-cheek performances.As Senator Finistirre, William H. Macy almost steals the film - as is often the case considering his ultimate acting skills. As a young man, Macy attended Goddard College in Vermont. Having experienced Goddard at that time through my brother who both taught and was an administrator there, it surely becomes clear that Macy used some of the "characters" he knew at Goddard to create a humorously definitive Vermonter.If you love intelligent and very witty satirical humor and enjoy watching good actors at their craft, you won't be disappointed with Thank You for Smoking</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very funny movie not so much about the dangers of smoking, but the importance of freedom of choice in the US. Katie Holmes aside, the cast is excellent. Robert DuVall is especially great, and JK Simmons is hysterical, as usual. I would recommend the film to anybody who is interested in the tobacco industry, or the incredibly twisted story of our attempts to legislate smoking. In reality, truth is even stranger than fiction, but Thank You For Smoking does an excellent job of dramatizing some of the madness of American lawmakers and lobbyists. Well done. As the old saying goes, and like the movie suggests, smoke if you got em!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not a political statement or a documentary. It's a film about one of the most despised man on the planet. Nick Nayler. A representive of Big tobbacoo. This film has one of the greatest Monolauges by the star, and not only that, it was a great pick of stars and is defintly something that will make you laugh and think of this movie. But the main draw? It's a Neutral movie. And a movie About the Ciggerete company's at that! But it isn't advertising for Ciggeretes ( There's not even anyone smoking in this movie) And it shows that these people are not doing it to kill your grandfather...their doing it for the mortgauge. It also shows the extremists of anti Tobacco. Like the man who kidnaps Nick and sticks almost 100's of Nicotine Patchs on him. And the senater who trie's to remove Cigerretes from movies...and it all is the trouble of Nick. Michial jordan plays ball, Mason kills people, I give this a 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satirical Success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the subject matter has and always will be contentious - the film, which was always created to have a comedic charm is a satirical success.Aaron Eckhart, who is engaging throughout, plays a lobbyist for the multi-national tobacco industry. Although we are meant to dislike such a figure he is so charming, well-mannered, well-conversed that you cannot help but be happy to be follow his escapades.The film works very well on the satirical level. The script is very good because it can mix the comedic nature of the film with the undercurrent of the issues it is trying to address. On a personal level the way in which Eckhart delivers his defence of the tobacco industry is an engaging insight into the world of spin.It is pleasing to see a film that is not prolonged in running time, and finishes at just the right moment. Entertaining and informative, with the right amount of fun and laughter 'Thank you for Smoking' is a well delivered piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was just a coincidence that I watched this film a few days ago, when the polemic approval of the law "anti-tobacco" was the subject of many debates here in Mexico. This film is just a perfect parody of what happened with that law. And it's really funny but it makes you think about that vice, which is not going to be over with a simple law. The film is about Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) who is the Vice President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies. He must defend and promote the cigarette industry and deal with Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) who is having a campaign against cigarettes. Also he must be a role model for his son, Joey (Cameron Bright) who is confused about who is really his father.Nick Naylor is the classic good worker whose only goal is to be terrific in his work no matter if he must defend a killer. And yes, he is terrific for his job being much more clever than the people who are against the cigarette industry. And because of his job, his only three friends are persons who defend similar subjects like alcohol and guns. Their meetings are, for me, the funniest scenes of the film, showing how those three persons don't care about anything, just for what they are defending. The talk of which subject kills more persons by year is just a hilarious scene showing how pathetic this persons are just for their jobs. A similar scene is when the Senator is angry because of the kid that they put on TV, showing that he was doing everything just for his interests. In the end all those situations put Nick as the most honest and intelligent character in the film because he believes in freedom and in the family values, leaving in yourself the decision to smoke or not. Because finally, everybody knows that cigarettes are a cancer for us.And I said that this film was the perfect parody for the "anti-tobacco" law because it's a fact that now in Mexico nobody will smoke in public places like restaurants or schools and that's fine because of the passive smokers but if you smoke you can do it in your place so the pollution to the world and to ourselves will be the same. So, where's the damn solution?, it's absurd all the polemic because to smoke or not is a personal decision, nobody can force you.Conclusion: I really like this film. The cast is great, specially Aaron Eckhart and the great William H. Macy. The visual style of the film is terrific (the opening credits are amazingly great) and the final message too. I recommend this film to anyone, smokers or non smokers. 8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any character can be made to look heroic under the right circumstances. Turning a film ostensibly about smoking, into a film about one ciggarette executives triumph over impossible odds, is what makes the film a pretty good satire and not just a marginal comedy. The lead becomes like the cowboy image of big tabacco, representative of the independence, liberty, sex, and cool. Morality is not an issue in the film, only argument. And that ultimately is what make it endearing.It's funny, insightfull, clever enough to avoid being didactic, well acted, and well though out. This is not just a movie about cigarettes bieng bad, it's about a culture of spin, like Wag The Dag, where anything can be made to seem good, which is a much more important and relevant idea, than a movie about getting rid of something. A relevant, smart, comedy that lets you have a cigarette, and eat it too.</fullReview>

It's basically Big Tobacco vs the government,, senators, health advocates, congress. They even bring out the Marlboro Man.. Sam Elliot, good choice, Robert Duvall as the Captain, very good also,, but he needed some more screen time. i loved the movie because of the wit, satire, and how it poked fun at the talk shows, the government, basically spin control, if you argue correctly, you're never wrong, wait that's my daughter also.. anyway a great thumbs up to the actors, actresses, producers, and director for this movie. also i liked the opening credits, and i'm really never a fan of credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny, Yet Dark, Sature of the American Lobby Business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is very good at what he does. And what he does is talk on behalf of the American tobacco companies. As the political and health climate of America changes, how will Nick face off against the government, the doctors, a dying Marlboro Man and his own son? Can Nick Naylor really talk his way out of anything? This film blew me away. It had been talked up to me from a variety of people, but I just never got around to it until now. And I was pleasantly surprised. This film takes jabs at the government, tobacco companies, anti-smoking advocates and the lobbies of America (tobacco, guns, alcohol, nuclear waste and more). It's like the funny version of "The Insider" or "Good Night and Good Luck". Somehow, the humor makes it all the more powerful in the way the points are driven home.Aaron Eckhart, whom I'm not familiar with, is amazing and was perfectly cast. He's supposed to be the guy who can talk any girl into a date or talk out of any situation. And he does -- with me believing him all the way. Sure, many of his arguments are not logical, but they also aren't untruthful. This is, of course, exactly the way the lobbyists work in real life, as do advertising agencies. They sell you a product with things they never actually said, and we buy them on that hidden promise.The supporting cast is also great. William H. Macy as a Vermont senator, Robert Duvall as the head of Big Tobacco, Rob Lowe as an Asia-obsessed media mogul, and I'd especially like to give credit to Sam Elliott as the Marlboro Man. In all seriousness, if you asked yourself who could play an old, retired cowboy better tan anyone else on Earth, who would you pick? Sam Elliott. And not just because of "The Big Lebowski" -- Elliott embodies the image of a cowboy (even when he's not one, such as "Road House" or "The Legacy").My only disappointment -- and the reason this film received 9 rather than 10 -- is with Katie Holmes. Just like "Batman Begins", I found her character to be weak and just not a solid part of the film. Holmes is a poor actress and always has been. Would Nick Naylor fall for such a pathetic person? Of course not. And neither would Bruce Wayne. Bruce needs Vicki Vale, Catwoman or someone strong and feminist. So does Nick, and Katie Holmes just isn't her.If you want something besides humor and satire, there's also the father-son-divorce scenario. Some people like emotional movies, and this has some emotion to offer as the three family members have a strained relationship (each one is strained with each other). I found this to be a downer of the film, but it also really added a human side to Naylor that was probably needed to ground him from being superhuman. He may be a demi-god, but he's no Green Lantern.Absolutely see this film. I don't care if you like comedies, horror, action, Westerns or something else -- if you're a conservative or a liberal, a smoker or non-smoker. See this film and see it soon. You probably won't learn anything new about lobbyists or advertisers and it probably won't change your mind, but it puts the whole issue in a light that no film has yet and no film ever will again. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very sharp little satire that Paddy Cheyefsky would have wholeheartedly approved of. Wickedly funny, the quality of this movie suggests that director Jason Reitman is even more talented than his father Ivan.THANK YOU FOR SMOKING incorporates a couple of real events into its storyline, including a fanciful imagining of the way Hollywood was "influenced" to have more characters smoke in films (how amusing that Aaron Eckhard co-stars with Catherine Zeta-Jones in his latest film, given the way her name is used in this one). And, yes, the Marlboro Man did, indeed, die of cancer, though we have no way of knowing if the tobacco lobby paid him a visit as we see in this movie.Part of the brilliance of THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is that the satire doesn't just target the tobacco industry; with it's "I do it for the mortgage" tone it's really attacking corporate culture everywhere.Smart, and quite funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dark and Scathing Satire that features an Oscar-Worthy Screenplay and a Winning Cast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is a bold and gutsy satire that takes a politically-sensitive issue and turns it on its ear in a manner that will thoroughly entertain those who view it in the way it is intended...as a satire. Written and directed by Jason Reitman (son of famed director Ivan Reitman), the film stars Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor, who works as a lobbyist/mouthpiece for an organization called The Academy of Tobacco Studies, where his job boils down to being a goodwill ambassador for the tobacco industry. His current endeavors include negotiating a multi-million dollar movie deal for a futuristic sci-fi movie starring Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones where they would smoke throughout the film, opposing a campaign being spearheaded by a US Senator to put a new label on cigarettes that says "Poison" and has a skull and crossbones underneath it, and delivering a suitcase full of money to the original Marlboro Man, who is now dying of cancer, in order to get him to stop badmouthing smoking. Between these duties and his interview with a reporter (Katie Holmes)that reveals just a little too much, Nick actually finds his life in danger. This is one of the smartest and most original satires to hit the silver screen in a long time and as long as you keep in mind that it is a satire, the film is richly entertaining. We all know that smoking is bad and this film just takes a pointed and off beat look at the issue from the side of the tobacco industry in a world where their side of the issue would matter. However, beautifully balancing Nick's twisted world and the sometimes perverted requirements of his job is his relationship with his son, whose hero worship of his dad makes Nick question whether or not he should be a role model to his son. In the spirit of films like NETWORK and ALL ABOUT EVE, the real star of this film is the razor-sharp screenplay by Reitman, based on a novel by Christopher Buckley, that humorously skewers the tobacco, advertising, and entertainment industries and should have been nominated for an Oscar. Reitman's kinetic direction works perfectly for this dark and brittle story, beautifully executed by a great cast...Eckhart (best known prior to this as Julia Roberts' boy toy in ERIN BROCKOVICH) turns in a charismatic and riveting performance as Nick Naylor and gets flawless support from JK Simmons as his boss, Rob Lowe as a fast talking movie studio exec,William H. Macy as the Senator heading the poison label campaign, and in a brilliantly understated turn, Sam Elliott as the dying Marlboro Man. A truly unique and daring movie that breaks some bold new ground and should establish Jason Reitman as an important new force in film-making. A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satire at Its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a divided world of smokers and non-smokers, there is little hope of harmony between these two groups of people. Constant conflict over second-hand smoke and smoking in public places fires up both sides. Nick Naylor, lobbyist for Big Tobacco, spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, member of the M.O.D. Squad (Merchants of Death), and an all-around jerk can talk his way out of any pickle. From wriggling out of a national-television attack on the Joan Lunden Show to stopping the cancer-ridden Marlboro Man from bashing cigarettes, Nick has a talent. His talent lights up brilliantly in a film that dares to test the boundaries concerning cigarette smoking and the world of spin. Naylor never had trouble being the most hated man in America. Sure, being a "mass murderer" and a "profiteer," oh, and a "yuppie Mephistopheles," can take its toll, but Naylor nevertheless happily defends an industry that kills 1,200 people a day. Even when his son, Joey, begs of him at his school's career day, "Please, don't ruin my childhood." On the other side of the issue is Senator Finisterre of Vermont, who dedicates his life to condemning Naylor and his work. His endeavor has him packaging all cigarettes with a poison label represented by skull and crossbones. The warning claims to be "a reminder of the dangers of smoking." Naylor agrees. And since heart failure is the number one killer in the United States, Naylor also feels cholesterol-filled Vermont Cheddar Cheese should carry the label as well. Reporter Heather Holloway also has some flexible morals of her own, as she employs her rather evident sex appeal in an exclusive interview with Nick Naylor. Exposing most of his darkest secrets in her poignant article, Naylor is unable to defend his ruined reputation. But Holloway, like all evil villains, is eventually brought to justice. An incredible cast, featuring Aaron Eckhart, Robert Duvall, William H. Macy, Katie Holmes, Rob Lowe, Maria Bello, David Koechner, Adam Brody, and Dennis Miller, shines under the directorial genius of Jason Reitman. Reitman, son of film director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Kindergarten Cop, &amp; Evolution), provides an originality to the picture necessary for color and a satirical tone. Reitman creates a unique style of humor throughout the picture. A film with a message and witty delivery is rare to come by in modern motion pictures. The screenplay was adapted from the 1993 novel, Thank You for Smoking, by Christopher Buckley; also an amazing read and maybe funnier than the film.</fullReview>

This is an intelligently written movie and I'll remember many of the lines for quite some time.The lead character's son asks: "Why is the US government the best government in the world?" Dad responds: "Because of its endless appeals system" (you really have to see this in context to fully get it). The one word that sums up this movie is "clever".The movie is about a very quick-witted and intelligent tobacco lobbyist. Hearing him brilliantly respond to the many accusations/problems/facts about the cigarette industry is just plain fun to watch. It is so well done, both the screen writers and Eckhart are to be commended.The style of this movie was somewhat unfamiliar to me - I'm used to documentaries, "mockumentaries" and normal movies. This a fictional movie which is based on facts, but is non-historical. It took me a little while to start "getting" this movie - but was entirely worth it.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys clever use of language and an intelligently written script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the spokesperson for Big Tobacco, Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) spends his life defending cigarettes and the tobacco companies from those who try to keep people from smoking. When a Vermont senator (William Macy) wants to put a poison label on cigarettes, Naylor must use all of his wits and charm to keep his job at the Academy of Tobacco Studios, by launching new campaigns exclaiming the virtues of nicotine.Thank You for Smoking is a hilarious and successful comedy. It combines a great screenplay and a fun cast. I have to give most of the credit to Jason Reitman and Aaron Eckhart. Reitman did a wonderful job both behind the camera and with the script. He didn't go over the top with the satire and he managed to produce many memorable and entertaining scenes. Aaron Eckhart played a scumbag yet he was still very likable. I usually find him to be a bland actor but here he's charismatic and he looks like he's having a blast too, which always helps. I know it won't happen but I think Eckhart and the screenplay are Oscar worthy.While Aaron is good, no one else is really on his level. The other performances weren't bad, they just weren't as good. Maria Bello was okay as was Katie Holmes. David Koechner had a few funny lines though he wasn't in the film for very long. William H. Macy and Robert Duvall were both pretty un-notable which was surprising given their history. Rob Lowe was too creepy for me while Adam Brody was just his usual annoying self. Cameron Bright gave the worst performance. He kept the same expression on his face throughout the entire thing. It amazes me that he's been so lucky with all these roles since he's a horrible actor.The first forty five minutes were fast and consistently funny. It then went a little slower and it took a serious turn. It still held a few entertaining moments but all the scenes with Nick Naylor and his son weren't handled very well. After a small bump, the film picked up again and ended with a bang. Besides for a couple of performances and a weak middle, the film is defiantly worth checking out. In the end, Thank You for Smoking is a pleasant comedy. Rating 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While everyone is referring to Thank You For Smoking as "That tobacco industry movie", i think that is very misleading. It is more about a good guy who has a despicable job that he takes very seriously. He is a spokesmen for Big Tobacco, and it's his job to tell the truth, and make it as publicly acceptable as possible. That is were the movie shines. It is not pro-smoking or anti-smoking. It really isn't about smoking at all. It's about how people spin the truth to become more politically correct. Not only does Big Tobacco do it, newscasters do it, corporations do it, even the government does it (duh!).The heart and soul of the movie is Aaron Eckhart's performance as said spin doctor, Nick Naylor. He has such a charming personality and friendly face that he could probably do the job very well in real life. He hits all the right notes in the comedy and dramatic departments. I think he should get an Oscar nod but probably won't. If you have read my other reviews you know how much i dislike the Oscars. Among the supporters is a great little role from Rob Lowe as a cigarette-friendly movie agent, JK Simmons as head of Nick's company, and Adam Brody as Lowe's assistant. I haven't explained any of the funny parts because they can't be explained and they are very subtle. This not 40-Year Old Year Virgin or American Pie. It's funnier, but quieter.Anyway, whether you smoke or not, this movie will neither offend nor defend you. It only uses Big Tobacco as a backdrop for it's real message: think for yourself! 8/10</fullReview>

Just from the start when Nick introduces us to his world, the scientists, lawyers and his part as spokesman is to spin it in the other direction, its going to be a thrill. Immediately on the talk show you can see he's damn good at his job (for all the money he'd make you'd think so).Remembering JK Simmons from Spiderman, he is almost the same newspaper chief, here hes Nicks boss.It ended well with Nick making his own choice at the end, for the benefit of his son and his own health.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's something to be said for a film that makes no apologies for being completely politically incorrect, and THANK YOU FOR SMOKING certainly has something to say.That audiences may find themselves cheering on "the bad guy" will make this movie all the more entertaining. Aaron Eckhart (SUSPECT ZERO) stars as Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for the tobacco companies, and he's very good at what he does. One of his sayings is "If you argue well enough, you're never wrong." The moral flexibility Nick has is akin to an ethical gymnast. But his son Joey (Cameron Blight, ULTRAVIOLET) is growing up fast and is learning the ways of the father. We see Nick navigating these parental waters with a touch of dignity and a splash of chagrin. Can he be a good father while towing the line for the tobacco companies and telling everyone that cigarettes are a personal choice rather than a death sentence? William H. Macy (EDMOND) stars as Senator Finistirre, "the good guy" who is trying to get a skull and crossbones image stamped on every carton of cigarettes. But he's also a politician, trying to further his own career. He represents a state that produces tons of fatty cheeses, thus adding to Americans weight and cholesterol problems. And he most certainly isn't above taking campaign contributions from businesses, is he? That the film is filled with contradictions and hilarious moral dilemmas is a tribute to the author of the book, Christopher Buckley. That he can turn the tables on alcohol, tobacco and firearms (all of which are addressed in the name of "business") is a testament to some damn fine writing.What makes the movie work so well is Aaron Eckhart's affable portrayal of Nick. He's so darn likable yet utterly incomprehensible (in the moral sense) that the audience will be grudgingly cheering him on. That he can out-maneuver his opponent (Macy) makes the movie-watcher dislike whom they really should be cheering for! What a turnabout! The ensemble cast is incredible, too. In addition to Eckhart, Macy and Blight, there's Mario Bello (A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE), Sam Elliot (TOMBSTONE), Katie Holmes (PIECES OF APRIL), Rob Lowe (THE WEST WING, TV series), Robert Duvall (THE APOSTLE), and quite a few other notables.This film must certainly be on people's top-ten list of movies to watch ...if they haven't caught it already.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'In the end you have to pay the mortgage'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that everyone (well, almost) will do anything for money - the mortgage must be paid - is only one of the subversive elements placed on the table of this bitingly satirical film. Based on the very edgy novel by Christopher Buckley, director Jason Reitman has adapted the story for the screen, populated his diatribe with a fine cast of actors, and directs the whole concept with deft precision. While many not familiar with the book's bite will be put off by the title, rest assured that no one escapes this exploration of the tobacco industry, the health industry, and the political industry unscathed.Aaron Eckhart is spot on as the tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor, a man of style and spin who can talk his way through any confrontational encounter and come out the winner. He is supported by the tobacco kings Budd 'BR' Rohrbacher (J.K. Simmons) and 'The Captain' (Robert Duvall), the movie mogul Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), by his buddies in crime Maria Bello and David Koechner with similar lobbyist roles in alcohol and firearms, and confronted by Senator Finistirre (William H. Macy in another jewel of a role), ex-Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott), and journalist Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes). How he manages to make all of these folk satisfied with his message comprises the bulk of this flimflam man story, a tale that butchers the tobacco industry with the same vehemence as the anti-smoking brigade.The lines are fast and furious and Eckhart is superb in his role. Somehow the emphasis of the relationship and frothy philosophy sessions between Eckhart and his son (Cameron Bright - as monochromatic a child actor as there is in the industry today) make the movie fairly boring just when is should be picking up momentum, but that is Hollywood covering its tracks. Not a great movie, but a movie that is much better than you would expect! Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" appears on the outside to arguably be the counterpoint in every conceivable fashion to "The Insider", that near brilliant messenger for the anti-smoking movement starring Russell Crowe. This film presents us with Nick Naylor (portrayed by Bill Pullman look-alike Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist for Big Tobacco with a penchant for attractive chesty women, and an undying drive to one-up his ex-wife in the parent department. He could easily be considered a morally reprehensible figure and a God awful role model for his young son if he weren't so damned charming.This is a film about spin in every possible variation, whether it be what Washington D.C. dishes out, or what Hollywood presents as God's honest truth, or perhaps by what persuasions the media might utilize to get their story. The satire here is so sharp and works so effortlessly from one unexpected scene to the next that the viewer is completely taken in and engrossed by the proceedings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" (2005) is a hilarious satirical romp of a comedy. Directed by Jason Reitman (son of another comic genius Ivan Reitman), this film had me in its addictive grips from its unique title to it's intriguing plot. Who would have ever thought to get into a mind of a tobacco lobbyist (in this case, Aaron Eckhart who is perfectly suited for the role of the aforementioned lobbyist, Nick Naylor). His charm and charisma will make anyone a believer in whatever he says. Also hilarious is his "rival" in the film, William H. Macy in a humorous performance as Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre - it's not about the "cheese"!). The cinematography is also a big plus in this film. All in all, a rousing 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaron Eckhart grins and swaggers his way through Jason "son of Ivan" Reitman's amusing satire about tobacco lobbying, having appropriate digs at both the tobacco warlords and the people trying to take them down. At the end of it all you will hopefully have a decent appreciation for the people's right to smoke, as well as a stern face of disapproval at the obvious nasties coughing up their cancerous tobacco money in corporate America.Nick Naylor gets paid to talk. A lot. At the beginning of 'Thank You For Smoking' he appears be the worst man in the world: a spin doctor for the tobacco companies. Yet, as the movie goes along we start to like Nick. He appears to be a good father (despite having a messy relationship with the ex-wife) and, at least, has a winning charm, owed in no small part to the film's lead - Aaron Eckhart. Naylor teaches his son that he must "think for himself" when learning that his school has set him an assignment of "Why is the US government the best in the world?". Abit strange that, seeing that Naylor's job involves twisting the truth about nicotine addiction and lung cancer. He takes his son to LA where he attempts to convince a movie producer to get actors to smoke more on screen. He also tries to bribe the former "Marlboro Man" to keep his dying trap shut about the real effects of long-term fag puffing. Along the way he, and his boy, learn some obvious life lessons.Reitman's film isn't going to shake things up in the way that something like Morgan Spurlock's "Super Size Me" managed to do. Since that 2004 documentary, Macdonald's have gone to great lengths to re-evaluate their image and produce. "Thank You For Smoking" provided me with a perfectly fine movie that manges to achieve its goals to no real lasting effect. But that isn't to say it didn't work. I liked it. Quite a bit in most places. Despite the odd sub-plot gone wrong (the kidnapping was a bit too distracting), 'Thank You For Smoking' provided enough laughs and, even if the satire was usually never more than requisite, it would be extremely harsh to call this a failure. The tobacco industry is probably a fairly obvious target for anyone to poke fun at, which is why the two way system deployed by Reitman makes this a more than intriguing experience. The cast do there utmost with a script full of delicious lines (William H. Macy gobbles his way through some of the best as the ever-so-slightly nasty senator Ortolan K. Finistirre) and the movie breezes along at an affordable pace. There may well be better films on the potentially explosive subject of tobacco - Michael Mann made a killer of a movie with 1999's The Insider - but that shouldn't deter anyone. It certainly has enough puff to sustain it's momentum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a name like "Thank You For Smoking", you really don't know what to expect going into this film; thankfully, that's what is so good about it. This dark satire is a breath of badly needed fresh air. And by a first time director, no less.The movie is about a tobacco lobbyist named Nick Naylor who, as he describes it, "talks" for a living. His character, which is one of the best I've ever seen, is described wholly in one line. "You know that guy who can pick up any girl? I'm that guy?On crack.". The story line in this film, takes a backseat to the wonderful character exploration which Director Jason Reitman navigates with ease.Nick Naylor is played to perfection by Aaron Eckhart. It would have been too easy to overly sensitize this character, or to make him a soulless monster, but Eckhart strikes the perfect balance. He makes the character charming and likable, but never retracts Naylor's wicked edge. It's seems impossible to like, much less, root for a character who peddles cigarettes, but Eckhart will have you standing and applauding. He gives the performance of a seasoned veteran. Bravo.The bulk of the supporting cast give very good performances, as well. Rob Lowe gives what could be the finest performance of his career, Cameron Bright is great as Naylor's son who idolizes him, and J.K. Simmons has never been funnier as Naylor's boss. These entertaining performances are, for the most part, a product of the brilliant screenplay.Like I said, this is the screenplay to beat this year. I don't have any idea how the Oscars could ignore this labor of love. The script has a very stylish feel to it that transferred very well to the silver screen. Every joke in this movie is funny. That is an incredible feat. I have never seen a movie where I did not roll my eyes during at least one of the jokes, but every one in this film was good. Some were only good, while others had me in the floor like only Arrested Development can. Especially Naylor's jokes. His flat and dry delivery is absolutely brilliant.With all that being said, this movie is far from perfect. William H. Macy, who is normally a safe bet, came off feeling a bit detached from the picture. He worked, but it just wasn't his usual greatness. Maria Bello is excellent in her role, but feels extremely underutilized. They could have cast anyone in this role. Katie Holmes proves once again, that she is nothing more than a washed up teen soap star. And a horribly miscast soap star, at that. At least in Batman Begins I could see her in that role. But here, she plays a seductive reporter (is there any other kind?) who tricks Naylor into revealing his life secrets. She is stiff, and plain boring to watch.I'm someone who watched The Island (and didn't hate it), so I'm no stranger to "huh" plot twists, but this one was a whopper. I won't spoil it for those who have not seen the film, but trust me, you'll know when it comes. At first, it seems like a darkly clever move by the screenwriters, but turns out to be purely story serving, and frankly, a bit ridiculous.As a whole, this movie kept me more than thoroughly entertained for the entire screen time. Between Eckhart's pitch perfect rendering of a man, who should have no morals, but is a real person, and Reitman's rapid-fire script, this is not a movie to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thank you for smoking" is not a big budget super blockbuster like the ones flooding our cinemas in recent weeks, but it is definitely an impressive gem worth a watch. Do not be misled by the title; this show takes on a neither pro nor anti-smoking stance. The show revolves around a persistent tobacco lobbyist trying to promote the act of "smoking", while at the same time having to deal with consequences, such as an equally persistent senator bent on crushing the whole tobacco industry, death threats, and general negative feelings of the people around him with regards to what he's doing."TYFS" does not delve deep into the issue of smoking; even the final "discussion" on whether to put graphic labels on cigarette packs is reduced to arguments that probably at high school level we will be able to bring out. But that is not the point; TYFS is not a satire on smoking, but rather on the art of arguments and persuasion. The tobacco lobbyist is not the only one who resorts to various fallacious means to promote his stance on smoking; the senator himself isn't portrayed in a positive light either, as seen in a hilarious scene where he harshly rebuked his representative for choosing a "healthy-looking" cancer boy to bring out the harmful effects of smoking to the public, which negates whatever impact he could have caused. As can be seen, thank you for smoking pokes fun at just almost anyone on both sides of the debate, including journalists, senators, and even Hollywood agents.It is the tongue-in-cheek style that the show uses in its display of adult themes that makes it amusing to watch, in a guilty way. The whole black comedic atmosphere has already been set up right immediately after the beginning credits, and the humour ranges from the absolutely politically incorrect to the very occasional slapstick ones, which surprisingly end up being really funny as well. I am not a good judge of acting skill, but i am biased towards Maria Bello (simply love all the shows she stars in, and this one is no exception) Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing I liked about this movie is that it doesn't just deal with each side's arguments in the "cigarette debate", but it actually looks at the concept of argument itself, particularly politically. It points out the spin that influences what the public believes, regarding everything from government to medical research. And it mocks the concept of impartiality, all while being witty and unpatronizing.You'll appreciate this movie regardless of your take on smoking. The film does have a slightly anti-tobacco company subplot, but it's not anti-smoker. It doesn't seek to vilify anyone. It's an equal opportunity offender.</fullReview>

Is it a satire on how the cigarette industry behaves - no, not really. Is it about spin - not really.After some thought I think it is about us. We know that what Nick is doing is not right but in some way we all want to be Nick. We admire him because he is smooth and generally gets what he wants. As much as we like to be idealists we all make pragmatic decisions in life to "pay the mortgage." Nick, I think just, does it in style. Maybe that is what the writer is telling us.The movie will make you laugh but will be something different from what you expect. Go and see it and then spend countless hours discussing what it was about with your friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it quite rare that I enjoy a 'modern' movie, ie one made this decade. This is a welcome exception. Thought-provoking, but not in a whiny manner, the film entertains and intrigues in equal measure. The lead character is Nick Naylor, a super-smooth tobacco lobbyist who can spin any yarn to anybody. Faced with a challenge from a Democrat senator, he has to unleash his skills. Without going into the plot too deeply, the film ends on a refreshingly different note to the one I expected. I was waiting for the traditional Hollywood happy ending where a 'baddy' finds his morals and reforms his behaviour. Not so in this picture. This film essentially pokes fun at all sides of the tobacco debate, from the merciless cigarette barons to the annoying left-wing killjoys who become consumed with such hatred of their opposition that they lose sight of the original issue. The acting is spot on, whilst at around 90 minutes its well paced and doesn't drag. Worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good grown-up satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An extremely twisted fairy tale, a darkly amusing tale about a tobacco lobbyist so good named Nick Naylor (the excellent Aaron Eckhart) at his job that you nearly like him. You do at least respect his ability to misrepresent and confuse the issue so that, on reflection, the tobacco industry is not seen as opportunistic or money-grubbing. This is the role of a lifetime for Aaron Eckhart and he knocks it out of the park. His square jaw projects an air of decency that is not undermined by his seemingly honest smile in this film. However, what is most impressive about his ability as a lobbyist is his ability to distort the discussion so that one is not arguing whether one likes one thing or another, but whether one's freedom is under attack. As he tells his son, in illuminating his modus operandi, that of changing the discussion from whether one likes one thing or another to whether one's (even children's) rights are being curbed in restricting their access to tobacco advertising, "I don't have to convince you, I have to convince them", he says, referring to large audiences who watch and also to the fact that he obviously did not convince his son that one thing was better than another, but only that those watching on television might be convinced that a man selling tobacco might be correct.An interesting part of the film for me was his relationship with his son (the talented Cameron Bright as Joey Naylor). It was interesting, and is credit to the sharp-as-a-tack Christopher Buckley who wrote the short story on which Chris Reitman (yes, that Reitman) bases his screenplay (he also directs), that someone as "morally flexible" as Eckhart might be a good parent. It seems difficult for him to resolve his talking out of both sides of his mouth for the majority of the movie, but ultimately, while he has seemed like quite a good parent, he does make a decision which will allow him to look his son in the eyes a bit more. AS the film progresses and it seems that he is a good parent but a soul-sucking fraud professionally, the contradiction between those two roles becomes more distinct and one hopes for a positive resolution. The contradiction between these two parts, during the film, makes for some entertaining scenes between father and son though. For instance, his explanation of his professional obligations to his son essentially specifies that one has to have certain lax moral standards in order to do his job. He explains his ability as a parent by suggesting to his intelligent, but obviously impressionable tweener son, that the only way to reconcile his professional dishonesty and personal integrity was that you had to be a lawyer.The film is still very entertaining and a scabrous, but not harsh take on some characters who could be reprehensible if they were not depicted as human beings with personalities and an understanding of the work they did. The filmmakers are more than generous to lobbyists for some harmful interests. The weekly meetings between the chief lobbyists of the alcohol (Maria Bello, very crisp and poised as Polly Bailey), tobacco (Eckhart), and gun (David Koechner as the honest and redneck-out-of-water Bobby Jay Bailey) lobbies (who dryly refer to themselves as the MOD (Merchants of Death)) shows professionals well aware of the harm that their products pose and who joke darkly about which of them has been most penalized for promoting their product. They boast about which has been most sanctioned for the impropriety of their advertising and promotion.Katie Holmes has a role as a prominent Washington reporter named Heather Holloway who sells out some of Eckhart's indefensible lobbying tactics after they become involved. He claims to have been sold out while she maintains that she is not doing anything other than leveraging her sources in a way less unethical than he. Her presence on stage seems quite thin and she does not have the emotional or dramatic heft to convey the aura of a highly connected Washington reporter. William H. Macy is typically excellent as the supposedly liberal northeastern senator (with the wacky old money Senate name of Ortolan K. Finisterre and at least an outward commitment to supposedly stereotypical liberal causes, if Birkenstocks and socks are some indication) who is committed to weakening the tobacco lobby and who works hard and earnestly to do so. He is furious when one of his top aides is rhetorically twisted in knots by Eckhart and he finally extracts some revenge when he is able to reveal the essentially unethical nature of Eckhart's job description-to defend the promotional activities of tobacco companies. Adam Brody as the assistant to a Hollywood honcho is hilarious in his scene in which he spreads office pap in passing, and Rob Lowe is at his smarmy, straight-man best as a Hollywood exec who seems expectedly pompous and humorless but is revealed to be more than a bit weird. JK Simmons, perhaps most famous from his recurring role as the psychiatrist on Law and Order is excellent as the lobbying company head who seems only mildly competent but fears the wrath of tobacco company honchos and, while wishing to appear tough, would drive off a cliff for his boss. Ultimately, this is a very generously spirited film which doesn't demean lobbyists but recognizes them as people while at the same time revealing how outrageous some of their claims are.</fullReview>

I now have a large screen surround-sound home theater that is a perfectly acceptable alternative once the movie is available on NetFlix.Having said all of that, I loved Thank you for smoking and particularly loved the Merchants of Death sequence and characters. I would go to the theater to see a sequel that explores the back stories of the alcohol and firearms merchants in much the same way this movie delved into the tobacco lobby.

Holmes, however, was just a little too average in her delivery for the part. The lines of morality that are crossed, and sometimes trampled upon (like when he says, "I'll buy him his first pack.") require the viewer to become uncomfortable not because of what they are watching, but rather because they know that society does include people like that.

		<fullReview>www.kajatm.com Thank You for Smoking is a satirical comedy about the Sultan of Spin, Tobacco Lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhardt) and his job as professional talker for Big Tobacco. Throughout the movie we follow Nick on his career for Big Tobacco, his struggle to raise his son Joey Naylor (Cameron Bright) in a way that won't go against his stance for Big Tobacco, his meetings with his MOD (Merchant of Death) friends, his professional fight with Vermont Senator Ortolan K. Finnistirre (William H. Macy) and his love relationship with Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes).The movie opens up with Nick Naylor being a guest on a talk show that includes a panel of anti-tobacco group members and "Cancer Boy" who at the age of 15 has been diagnosed with cancer from smoking. The opening scene of this movie really sets the tone by showing how Nick Naylor and Big Tobacco have the ability to put a spin on any negative situation.During the beginning of the movie Nick meets up with an up and coming newspaper reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) who is doing a piece on Big Tobacco. She uses Nick by sleeping with him to gain information that is supposed to off the record about Big Tobacco and his MOD friends. This results in Heather Holloway having the ability to gain inside information to write an article that is going to advance her career. This wasn't much of an acting stretch for Katie as this role is very similar to her current life. At some point in her life I bet that her agent came to her and said "Hey I have a great idea, you sleep with Tom Cruise and you'll be able to advance her career." Good job on whoring yourself out not only on screen but in real life too. Your parents must be proud.Robert Duvall plays the original Master of Spin, Doak "The Capitan" Boykin who is a father figure to Nick Naylor. Impressed with his ability to make any situation positive for Big Tobacco, The Capitan assigns Nick to visit Hollywood Super Agent Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe) to try to convince Hollywood to put the sexiness of smoking back on screen. While visiting Jeff Megall, The Capitan wants Nick to visit Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliot), the original Marlboro Man who is dying of cancer from his years of smoking and "give" him a case of money in an attempt to bribe him from speaking out against Big Tobacco. These two scenes were some of my favorite in the movie. First, the scene with Jeff Megall really shows how Hollywood individuals can make anything possible on screen. This is best demonstrated by one line of a dialog. Jeff and Nick are talking about having a new movie in space where the main characters will smoke in a 100% oxygen environment. Since smoking in that kind of environment would cause an explosion Jeff decides that this can be fixed with the line, "Thank God we created the XXXXX, which gives us the ability to smoke". Second, the scene with Lorne Lutch truly demonstrates how greedy people really are. Even though Lorne is dying from his years of smoking the case of money that Big Tobacco is offering really changes his mind. I think that I really like this scene because Nick does an excellent job of using reverse psychology to get Lorne to take the money.The movie ends with a one on one show down between Senator Finistirre and Nick Naylor in a Senate hearing that is discussing adding skull and cross bones to cigarette labels so that everyone is aware that cigarettes are poison. Nick makes some good points in his argument against adding the labels including that everyone knows cigarettes are bad for you and showing that cigarettes aren't really much worse than eating cheese from the State of Vermont because in the end both of them are eventually going to kill you. One of my biggest issues with this scene is that Nick argues that is a parent's responsibility to educate their kids on the harmful effects of cigarettes and then in the next breath he says that if his son wants a cigarette on his 18th B-Day he would buy him his first pack. Correct me if I am wrong but isn't Nick kind of being a hypocrite? This movie has quite the star studded cast including Katie Holmes, William H. Macy, Maria Bello, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot and Robert Duvall. Between William H. Macy, Sam Elliot and Robert Duvall this was bound to be a good movie. Honestly I could watch a movie of these three guys if the entire movie consisted of them just going to the Zoo for the day. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend anyone seeing it. I think that I would have enjoyed it a lot more if all the good lines to the movie weren't shown in the trailers that I had seen. It wasn't as good at The World Fastest Indian or Match Point, but it came in a close second.But then again, what do I know?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THANK YOU FOR SMOKING Written and Directed by Jason ReitmanTobacco lobbyist, Nick Naylor, imparts many practical approaches to life's many problems upon all the people he deals with. He tells people how to see things for a living and knows that they're listening to him. No one person is perhaps listening to him more than his own son. And though Nick's confidence might blind him into a false sense of security in life, he is not so far removed as to not know that the molding of his son's mind is his most important job. Thus, when he tells his son that if you argue correctly then you are never wrong, it is not only the true beauty of argument but it is also a strong, decisive direction to give your son. In that moment, he is a good father and not one of the most hated faces in America. This dichotomy between person and persona is what makes Nick Naylor real and Aaron Echkart's portrayal of Naylor, as it is guided along it's unexpected journey by director Jason Reitman, is what makes THANK YOU FOR SMOKING a real smart comedy.Anyone I know who has avoided seeing this film has done so because they didn't want to see satirical look at smoking. The shame there is that this film avoids clichés whenever it can and doesn't bother wasting its or our time positioning Naylor to learn a lesson about tobacco being bad. The lesson Naylor must learn is about pride as his is shaken during the course of the film by a disparaging piece of journalism. When life kicks you to the floor, it does not necessarily mean that everything you knew beforehand was wrong. (Ironically, the last time life did that to me is when I started smoking.) Naylor had a pretty good idea about how to make life work for him but he stopped believing in himself. And when you can't convince yourself of something, you certainly can't convince others. Further to the root of this hilarious film are purpose and drive. Naylor's biggest criticism from those who know him is pointed at his choice to lobby for big tobacco. It seems an easy place to start but it negates that Naylor is good at what he does. He can argue well for those who no one else would dream to argue for. It therefore becomes an inspiration to push yourself as far as possible when you find what you're truly good at. And once you're doing something, you might as well do it as well as you can because at the end of the day, everyone's got their mortgage to pay for and you can't come back with nothing. That's a little approach to life I learned from a smooth-talking guy named Nick Naylor.Son of director Ivan Reitman, Jason has clearly found what he's good at. THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is his first full-length film and it is sharp and witty. It has an energy that is infectious and a style that is both cool and hip, much in the way one sees smokers, minus the cancer, yellow teeth and bad breath. From the flashy pop-art of the opening credits shaped into cigarette packages to the usage of split screens, ironic subtitling and video, Reitman crafts a sexy, slick film that could have easily turned any of it's viewers on to smoking. However, in perhaps what is Reitman's most brilliant touch to this film, not one character ever lights up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I adored this movie and laughed my way through it. Aaron Eckhart was a perfect casting choice; the only other person I can think of who has that kind of million-watt grin is George Clooney, but I honestly don't think even he could have carried this role so well. The only flaw was Katie Holmes; it's not so much that she's a bad actor, or has the Tom Cruise taint, as that she just looks too young. And given that she's ten years younger that Eckhart, maybe she simply IS too young. I don't think she was horrible, just that she was so poorly cast, and frankly couldn't hold her own in such a fantastic ensemble.Nevertheless, the constant tongue-in-cheek wittiness throughout the film keeps it flowing along even at the slowest moments. Naylor's comeback to Heather Holloway's expose is classic and hysterical. Rob Lowe shines and deserved more screen time, and William H. Macy, as always, takes what could have been a stereotyped character and gives it a real personality.Where I think the movie excels, however, is its ending. If Naylor had backed down at the end and had a Hollywood-style change of heart, it would have ruined the whole film for me. This movie wasn't about a happy ending; it was a satire, pure and simple. Naylor admitting he wouldn't let his son smoke and then moving on to be a lobbyist for Amnesty International wouldn't have been satisfying or true to the film.Reitman deserves major kudos, not only for refusing to moralizing at the end, but also for making his debut film such a success. If he continues to follow in his father's footsteps, I expect great things to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good debut for Jason Reitman. I read Thank You For Smoking about five years ago. At the time, I didn't know Chris Buckley was the son of good-ole William. But the book is funny. Satire is funny, right? The movie is well-acted and the parts very carefully-chosen from what I've read. Reitman assembled an excellent cast, with the possible exception of Katie Holmes, but as long as everybody likes her. . . The sections that people seem to have problems with are those that didn't make it into the script for time concerns. When Nick Naylor is forced into a van in the book, after multiple investigations, the police and the FBI believe that Naylor has faked his kidnapping as a publicity stunt. He survives, in both, because of his excessive smoking which allows him not to be killed from his entire body being covered with nicotine patches. This is funny, right? The only problem I have with this movie is that no one smokes on screen. A very conscious decision, I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" was a part comical/ part surreal, if you will. Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) plays a hated speaker for the smoking industry and is high up in the authority chain of the business. Hated by all but his employees and his son Joey Naylor (Cameron Bright).Jill Naylor (Kim Dickens) divorced from Nick to try and raise their son up right but every time Nick gets a chance with young Joey, he always teaches him something that Joey will use to persuade his mother to letting him do things.In the end, something occurs to him forcing him into quitting. My final rating, 10 of 10. A must see.</fullReview>

But the whole carrying yourself with confidence and rolling with it was great. I love the idea that you argue to win the others, not who your arguing with. Overall, I felt it was a good movie and worth the view. I wish they could have expanded on Rob Lowe's part, but hey, what can you expect from a novel adaptation. The kid in the movie was great, though. The whole segue with the mod-squad idea was comedic but to the point.

I was wondering if anyone else noticed this, or maybe it was either an error or a specific edit from the movie theater which i attend. I would appreciate any feedback you guys have i found this to be quite interesting.

		<fullReview>I have to say by far Thank You for Smoking is the best movie I have seen this year to-date. I had first had my doubts thinking this movie would be one, which the viewer sits through two hours of a biases political statement showing how Hollywood feels if a person is willing to spend $8.50 on a movie ticket. Then the viewer is willing to listen to $8.50 worth of worthless propaganda. My doubts were disproved when the movie in a very satirical manner showed the ludicrous ideas behind the witch-hunt people in the U.S. find themselves in trying to stop people from smoking, along with that of the smoking companies trying to prove that it is not a dangerous product. Overall if you can laugh at a moving skillfully poking fun at the peoples' shortcomings, and can handle a bit of vulgarity, anyone would enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From previous reviews in the media, I expected a satire on smoking and the tobacco industry. But this film has an even broader reach than that; it also parodies the techniques and deftness of the masters of spin who can, say, convince a child that vanilla is a better flavor of ice cream than the child's previously preferred chocolate. And the things many people will do to pay their mortgages.Eckhardt as Nick Naylor is the driving force of this movie and he does a superb job although with great assistance from other cast members: I particularly liked the boy who plays his son, the Marlboro man, and the characters played by Robert Duvall, William Macy, and Rob Lowe. But all were good.There's liberal use of adult (often sexual) language plus some sexual scenes so it's not suitable for children unless you want to explain what those words mean, why the child shouldn't say them, and why that couple kept humping each other that way.But it's a fun movie for adults to see -- and possibly far more enjoyable if they are non-smokers or former smokers?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Funny how this film seems so unpretentious, and yet, it's probably the high point of this movie season in terms of exposing an important but neglected topic. Aaron Eckhart's performance as the wonderfully written lead, Nick Naylor, is flawless and memorable. His attitude as one of tobacco's top public relations men is so palpably American it seems almost treasonous to suggest that it might be as destructive as napalm. But the movie courageously gives us a clear-eyed view of the strategic thinking that goes on at a top PR firm on behalf of one of our most profitable industries. Too bad it couldn't just go on to skewer all the blowhards we're confronted with in other aspects of our everyday life. I smiled all the way through this film, and I can't imagine any other film doing as good a job pointing out how untroubled these PR people are. Nick's not so far-fetched handling of dubious grade schoolers is a great example. Aaron grew up as a Mormon, I understand, and that's a juicy bit to try to keep in mind as you watch him do his thing. He reminds me of the young Bruce Willis in Moonlighting but with less of a conscience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To 'Merchants of Death' Add Many Other Lobbies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is most pleasing about "Thank You for Smoking" is its skewering of the public relations/lobbying professionals who shield interest groups from public scrutiny. Aaron Eckhart does excellent work embodying the conscienceless types that inhabit these roles. However, his change of heart at the end is both unconvincing and contrary to the reality of Washington behavior. To the tobacco and gun lobbies spotlighted here, one could easily add many lobbies that defend the defensible on behalf of the business sector. Recent performances of spokesmen for the oil and drug lobbies are a case in point. William Macy is a superb foil as the tobacco lobby's senatorial foe who has some skeletons rattling around in his own closet. However, I would have made him a senator from Wisconsin instead of Vermont. Wisconsin is the main cheese-supplying state. Perhaps it's Chris Buckley's background that led him to make Macy's character a senator from the Northeast instead of the Midwest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" is one of the few movies that have nearly mastered one of the most important elements in a plot, characterization. The filmmaker's talent is assiduously shown through the characters in the film. During the film, we are evenly acquainted to the lesser mentioned characters of the story while being predominantly focused on our main character. Even though these other characters are not mentioned as much as our protagonist, we feel that we know just as much about them as we do him.Our story begins at the daytime talk show "The Joan Lunden Show." We meet our main character, Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist that supports the Big Tobacco Company. On the show, Nick is faced with anti-tobacco activists and a 'cancer boy.' The whole crowd is against Nick, booing him as he is mentioned. Nick does not change his expression, for he is confident that he will be able to convince the crowd that he is defending an innocent cooperation. He reverses the crowd's opinion of him onto the anti-tobacco activists, saying that the Big Tobacco Company wants to keep the 'cancer boy' alive, while the anti-tobacco activists want him dead, so it supports their cause. After this scene, the audiences is introduced to Nick's God-given talent, arguing.After the talk show, Nick is commended at his office, where we meet his scabrous boss, BR (J.K. Simmons), which is only one of the many characters we meet throughout the movie. Along with BR, we are also acquainted to the MOD (Merchants of Death) squad, which consist of Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), a spokesman for the Department of Fire Arms, and Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), the spokesman for alcohol products. Each Friday the MOD squad meets at a restaurant and talk about recent events with sales and other subjects related to their jobs. We also see Nick's opponent, Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), a female reporter named Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes), and Nick's son, Joey Naylor (Cameron Bright). Though I do not give too much information on each of these characters due to the risk of spoiling the movie, each of these characters is wonderfully built out. From the minute they speak, we feel we have already known them. We are given enough information of each character to fully satisfy us, which is the high point of the movie, because each character is memorable and humorous in their ways.The movie gives our main character two major conflicts, facing his opponent, Senator Finistirre, and remaining a role model to his son. While he still has many setbacks, Nick handles these problems with a smooth style that we love to see. We are thoroughly interested in Nick's life throughout the movie, and we want to see more.This movie appeals to a wide audience. That audience is anyone that enjoys a smart comedy. Children are not recommended for this movie, for there are many explicit references and scenes. Profanity is constant, and parents might not like their children to see a movie where there is a positive message in smoking, although it is backed up with a fair balanced debate of how it is also terrible for your health. Teenagers will love this movie, but the main focus is middle-aged men and women, for they can relate to many of the characters' conflicts and beliefs.I loved "Thank You for Smoking" because it did not focus mainly on the way the tobacco company is constantly panned by the media, it focuses on one man's ability to talk his way out of anything and how it benefits his life. Nick's philosophy in life is 'if you argue right, you are right,' and this movie continuously proves that statement throughout the film. The acting is great, the story is gripping, and the humor is smart and sassy. This movie is one of the best movies of the year so far, and I definitely recommend seeing it in theaters.8.9/10 -Z.

		<shortDescription>Hilarious and poignant satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I originally heard about Thank you For Smoking, I expected to be walking into a very funny (I was quite impressed by the trailer, I admit) anti-smoking smear campaign. Which, to be fair, it is easy to see this movie becoming, but director/screenwriter Jason Reitman is much more intelligent than that. He doesn't try to turn his movie into some huge, Michael Moore style aggressive takedown, but instead refrains from taking sides on the issue at hand, as doing so would make the film no better than what it satirises. Instead, Reitman focuses less on the right/wrong of the industry, and more on the man who represents it: Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart, perfectly cast) chief lobbyist and spin artist for the tobacco industry. The film chronicles the journey of Naylor as he peruses through his daily life, spinning, sweet talking, and basically trying his absolute hardest to win as many people as possible over to the idea that smoking is cool. As would be suspected, near the end, Naylor begins to question the morality of his work - a decision which is definitely helped by a very near death experience, a horrifyingly confidential news article written by a seductive reporter (Katie Holmes) and the constant nagging sense that he is being a bad father by permitting his son (a brilliant Cameron Bright) to idolise his less than morally sound profession. The storyline is compelling indeed, with a rapid-fire and very clever script always managing to stay one step ahead of itself and the audience all the way through. At many occasions during the movie, the storyline seems to hint at stumbling a bit, which leads us to fear the pace might be broken and the mood ruined. (ie: the introduction of a romance element, Naylor's relationship with his son both hint at being too sentimental) Needless to say, this never happens, Reitman is far too intelligent to fall prey to such common storytelling traps, and the plot moves along quickly and surely, never faltering along the way. One might interpret the character of Naylor as an antagonistic figure, but Eckhart's wonderfully skewed charisma keeps us rooting for the character even if his winning speeches become more and more disgusting. (declaring on public television that he wouldn't want a cancerous 15 year old to die because he would be losing a customer has to set some new standards of low) But Eckhart's wonderful lead performance is backed by several other highly entertaining inputs from the talented supporting cast. What seems surprising is how youngest cast member, 13 year old Cameron Bright delivers one of the most impressive performances (although it does help that he gets some of the best lines the superb script has to offer - "please don't ruin my childhood" when his father appears to talk to his class) However, some of the film's funniest scenes are also provided by Naylor's "Mod Squad", comprised of himself and the main spokespeople for the alcohol and firearms industries (Maria Bello and David Koechner, both hilarious, in particular Koechner) and there are also enjoyable little roles from Robert Duvall as the head of the tobacco industry, Sam Elliot as the grizzled, former face of Marlboros cigarettes, Rob Lowe, Adam Brody, and J.K. Simmons as Naylor's very J. Jonah Jameson esq, yet still unreasonably enjoyable boss. All in all, Thank you for Smoking is one of those few films that manage to be funny, profound, and just draw the line before preaching and overt sentimentalism. It makes some genuinely important points about media, society's reaction to it, and, well... smoking in general. (it's also interesting to note that despite the subject matter, never once do we see anyone light up throughout the entire film) Thank you for smoking is a very relevant film, and would prove important and thought provoking viewing for the majority of society. And hell, it's really well made, intelligent and, above all else, funny as well... what's to lose really? -9/10</fullReview>

The movie brought some good laughs while bringing people back to earth.It makes a good argument to those who are holier-than-thou when it comes to anti-smoking. At the same time when I'm nodding to what is said about the anti-smoking campaign, I want to vomit sometimes when you consider the way they market cigarettes.

		<shortDescription>Thursday Night Movie Club Review by Adam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Judging by the title, one would likely assume that this film was satirical in nature. This much is true. What the audience supposed to take away from this film is something entirely different. The story follows Nick Naylor, a spokesperson for the tobacco industry, played by Aaron Eckhart. Nick is probably one of the most hated people in the country, but he is proud of what he does and he does it well. He doesn't publicly make excuses or apologize for his career. Privately, he is dealing with questions by his young son. Nick is desperately trying to explain/justify his job to him with a positive spin. As time goes on Nick begins to ever so slightly question the job himself.It seems that almost every role in this film is filled out by a well-known actor or at least a recognizable face. All of this talent leads to some wonderful performances and memorable characters. There are definitely some laughs throughout this picture. The jokes are probably best described as those you feel guilty laughing about.This film is in no way preachy about the harmful effects of smoking or anything of the like. So what do we take away from this film? It's hard to say. It doesn't demonize or glorify the spin and propaganda created by large corporations or the people that work for them. One theme that did stick out to me is that everyone has a mortgage to pay. Should we question what people do for a living? Are we or aren't we responsible for the decisions that we make? This film just left me asking a lot of questions. Hopefully that was the intent, not to lecture, but to generate a bit of thought. I don't know if this movie was strong enough for me to recommend everyone to run out and see it. The film won't bore you, but it probably won't wow you either. With the current box office being chock full of horror flicks and almost devoid of comedy this might be your cup of tea.Thursday Night Movie Club Rating: $5.75/$8.00 "Mischief. Mayhem.

		<shortDescription>Smoking prevention/cessation observations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a regular movie goer nor do I follow Hollywood but being active in both youth smoking prevention and adult cessation I thought I'd share a bit different take. TYFNS touches on a number of tobacco control issues, most importantly the influence of teen idol smoking in movies, arguably the largest single influence on youth smoking initiation. Imagine the message sent to Hollywood by a movie whose entire focus is about smoking yet never once does any character smoke. The nearest thing I recall was a pack of Marlboro on the MOD squad's table.Other issues touched upon were industry funded research (which is now using major universities), industry funded youth smoking prevention campaigns (such as Philip Morris' liability limiting corporate responsibility T.V. and magazine campaign of half-truths (which blames everyone but PM USA for youth smoking, primarily parents and peers), parents buying cigarettes for their children (even if 18), and politicians always being three steps behind the industry. The industry truly has co-opted the "liberty" card ("Smoker's Rights") when in the hierarchy of freedoms one person's rights should stop at another person's nose, and in the health hierarchy individual liberties fall somewhere between "life" (438,000 annual U.S. deaths, about 5 million worldwide) and "happiness" (picture 1.2 billion nicotine addicts, 70% of whom would today assert that they want to be free but just can't seem to pull if off).The wildest scene was when anti-smoking zealots kidnapped Nick and attempted to kill him by covering his body in nicotine patches (nicotine's lethal dose is about three drops or 60 mg. for a 160 lb. person - more deadly than arsenic, cyanide, strychnine or diamond back rattlesnake venom). You couldn't pick a better place to leave a half naked chemical slave whose master was about to take his life than in the arms of Honest Abe, the great emancipator. I enjoyed the movie and hope the underlying theme of greed birthing flexible morals is not lost on young viewers. We have an ever growing list of tremendously worthwhile causes and much work before us.John R. Polito, Nicotine Dependency Prevention/Cessation Educator</fullReview>

You cannot help but root for Aaron Eckhart's smarmy tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor, as he embarks on a one-man tobacco crusade. Naylor does not lack in self-confidence, as he tells the audience "Michael Jordan plays ball. Charles Manson kills people. I talk." Some priceless moments include his negotiations with the cancer-stricken Marlboro Man, and his assault on the cheese-eating, Birkenstock-clad William H. Macy, who plays a clever Vermont senator who tries to stand tough on tobacco.

		<fullReview>Few movies actually compel me to take action after viewing it. Sideways made me want to brush up on my wine tasting knowledge; Harold and Kumar go to White Castle made me want to go to White Castle; and now we have another movie to add to the list. Thank You For Smoking. All right, it didn't really make me want to smoke?but it could have.Thank You For Smoking is a satirical comedy that focuses on Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), a lobbyist for the Big Tobacco Companies. We meet Naylor on the Joan Lunden Show as he defends himself against two anti-smoking groups, Robin the Cancer Boy, and Lunden herself. Naylor keeps his cool as he turns and says, "It's in our best interest to keep Robin alive and smoking." We come to learn Nick Naylor is not only a god to the tobacco industry, but he's smart and attractive. "You know the guy who can pick up any girl? I'm him on crack." Nick's also divorced with a son, Joey. He loves his son and even brings him on business trips to Hollywood to bribe an ex-cigarette spokesman to keep him from speaking out against smoking. In the end, we see that Nick is actually a good guy who's just really good at his job. That, and it pays his mortgage. What looks to begin as a satirical comedy about an industry and one man, turns out to be a comedy about a man who's just trying to keep his job, his friends, and his family.Thank You is based off the mid-90s book by Christopher Buckley. It was directed by Jason Reitman, who's made nothing of significance until now. However, his father, Ivan, is the director of my favorite movie of all time, Ghostbusters, which is a huge plus. Reitman handles the material very well in his adaptation to the screen. He's also pretty lucky to have gotten his first-choice actors for every role in his movie. And without knowing how the movie might have been with different actors, we can safely say that Reitman was blessed with his entire cast.Aaron Eckhart has always been a good actor; you'd just never have known it because he hasn't been given much quality material to work with until now. He's great as the suave and smart Nick Naylor. However, what's probably most enjoyable about this film is its supporting cast. William H. Macy, J.K. Simmons, Katie Holmes, Maria Bello and David Koechner all help make this film one of the best indie films of the year.And now to end my review with a shamelessly punny sentence; Thank You For Smoking is a hilariously addictive comedy.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes! * Best Movie out there This Year *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night. My attention didn't waver. There were no lulls in the dialogue or scene changes. The casting was top notch. However, knowing how old Cameron Bright is - a scene of him being carried to bed was a little too much. Maybe the role was intended more for a 7 year old instead. But that's the only nit-picky thing I can say about this movie. Cameron got to say some of the best lines. Actually, everyone in the cast got great lines somewhere. This movie has a strong ensemble cast. Ebert &amp; Roeper were right to give this movie 2 thumbs up."Nick Naylor," is the main character played by Aaron Eckhart. "Nick," works as a living being an advocate for cigarettes. This is Eckhart's breakout film credit. He looks a lot like Scott Thompson from The Kids In The Hall.William H. Macy is always a joy to watch, and he doesn't disappoint in this film. (His character name gets pronounced as: Senator Fennastor) Katie Holmes surprised me, she was good in this movie. Rob Lowe had a great cameo sequence. As did Adam Brody, who's character slayed me.I'm not going to say anything about the storyline itself. The script was thorough, you knew exactly who/what the characters were about, there were interwoven story lines that tied themselves together very, very well. Everything connected. How rare is that. Seriously, if you've forgotten how good movies can be? This movie will remind you of the "olden" days. Where admission wasn't $10, and you didn't have to watch 10 mins of car commercials BEFORE the previews. Your attention span will not wander or tune-out unwanted product placements. Thank-you for Smoking is worth seeing before it comes out on DVD. Ignore the tirades in the IMDb forums. Go to this movie for what it is: An excellently done movie that won't disappoint.I smoked for 25 years, and have quit for two. Don't avoid watching this movie if you're: a smoker, non-smoker, or a quit smoker. This movie addresses all types, except the I-Quit-Smoking-Wingnut. Near the ending was a nudge about something more modern in urgency. That topic has been shuffled under the carpet for a few years now. Go, enjoy this well-made movie. It took ages to make an appearance in a theatre near me. It appears to be in limited release at the moment. It's a sleeper movie. It's a keeper movie. It's worth seeing, and I'd like to see it win more recognition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly say I've never heard more laughs in a theater in my life. The movie did have a good "healthy" dose of black humor and the final punch of the movie had to be one of my favorite lines since I hate cell phones.The movie did take shots at not only the tobacco industry, but also the alcohol and Firearms. . .The film was definitely a good satirically-serious look at how the tobacco industry works to exploit not only kids, minorities, and everyday people.Here are some of the best lines from the movie:Nick Naylor: My job requires a certain . . . moral flexibility.BR: Now go bang your heads on your desks until something *useful* comes out! Michael Jordan plays ball. Charlie Manson kills people. I talk. Kid #3: My Mommy say smoking is bad for you Nick Naylor: Oh, is your Mommy a doctor? Kid #3: No. Nick Naylor: A scientific researcher of some kind? Kid #3: No. Nick Naylor: Well then she's hardly a credible expert, is she?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of 2006 So far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just a non-stop joy of beautiful satirical cinema. Upon viewing many movies of 2006 so far, I find this movie to be the cream of the crop. No doubt the best movie to be released of 2006 this far in the year. The movie tells the story of Tobacco Lobbyist Nick Naylor, who is generally in his profession because he needs to "pay the mortgage." Seems like a good enough excuse to lobby for an industry who is responsible for the deaths of millions per year. However, you do see a side of Mr. Naylor that seems somewhat human. He loves his son like any father would, but in this movie, they really bring it to home. The most hilarious thing about this movie is that nobody is safe from being bashed. News reporters, politicians, senators, lobbyists, mainstream multi-corporations, the movie industry, product placements, everyone is under constant attack. When I went into this movie, I got more than I expected. What I expected was a cute and fun comedy that might be funny but not really. What I got was a hilarious fair and balanced political satire that was relentless from beginning to end. Who really shined through was Aaron Eckhart...and actor who has never really impressed me at all with his acting or choice of roles. He was in Suspect Zero which wasn't really good, and The Core, which was just down right horrible. This movie, however, was incredible and hilarious, and Eckhart was the basis of this remarkable movie making. No one could have done a better job, and if the movie releases continue to be as poor and lack-luster as they are now, I think an Oscar may be in order for Mr. Eckhart here. Other notable performances were J.K. Simmons, who was terrific as BR. He really got the characteristics of an out there hands on boss who isn't afraid to tense up his employees and motivate them. I believed him the entire time and thought it was one of the most extravagant and brilliant performances by him to date. Others might include Katie Holmes who was excellent as the manipulative and in-sensitive reporter who used Naylor to get her story out because of her "terriffic tits." Maria Bello, who pleasantly surprised me due to her other poor attempt at acting in A History of Violence. I loved her in this and thought she was stunning, beautiful, and wickedly funny. As well as the guy who played "Champ" in Anchorman. This guy really does have a sense of comedy because I liked him in movies that really weren't that good such as Anchorman, and Waiting (which actually wasn't terrible because of Ryan Reynolds.) The MOD Squad was perfect in their roles, and did a brilliant job of making the movie how it was supposed to be.In other words, I was graced by this movie and would love to see it over and over and over. This is definitely one on the market that I would love to buy, and keep for myself so that I can enjoy it time and time again. I HIGHLY recommend this movie and I think everyone who is in for a good laugh (who isn't easily offended) should give this movie a try. It is absolutely hilarious and worth every moment of your time. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of the year thus far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this movie, and was intrigued. I wasn't sure what to think overall, as I went to the movie, but came out more than happy. In fact, I went back and saw it again. The diologue in the movie is witty and funny, yet continues the story along. The story itself is interesting, and there are many scenes that stand out in my head as I write this. The best part about the diologue, was the ability of it to connect to all levels of people in the theater. While, there was an occasional witty remark that only those politically up to date or knowledgeable would pick up on, there was much more straight up comedic diologue that engaged the viewer.The story itself is solid, with the main character trying to connect to his son, while doing his job, the job of a lobbyist. I think the part that impressed me the most was how well the story flowed, combined with the brilliant cinematography.If you like anything that you would deem satirical, or simply like a comedy, check this movie out. It is by far one of the better movies I've seen in the past few years, and the best of this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently watched this movie in theaters and I have to say that I was extremely impressed by how clever and smart it was. There was nothing really over the top about the movie, although it had its humorous moments, but overall it seemed extremely well thought out and clever. I recommend this movie to anyone who has felt that there is not much out there in theaters to choose from lately, and while it may not completely redefine your ideas about films, you won't leave the theater feeling like you have just been tricked out of your eight dollars. Thank you for Smoking has a very strong cast of characters, and there is a sort of chemistry between all of them that carries throughout the entire movie and reacts well with the plot line. Go see it and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the funniest films I've seen in awhile. It refused to take sides, and found it's humor in the fact that it managed to insult just about everyone. I loved it! I think the lack of big "names" added to the quality of the story. There were recognizable actors and actresses, but all involved were the kind of ensemble players that work together that make small films really quality products. If the filmmakers worried about finding an audience, the theater I went to this evening had better attendance than Inside Man had a week ago, and the audience reaction was great. I'm going to recommend this to friends, and I really think that word of mouth is going to make this film one of the sleepers of 2006.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well done and witty satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank You for Smoking is one of those classic Indie movies that come from nowhere, and turn out to be so much better on all fronts, than mainstream Hollywood cinema. Packed by an all-star cast and a great script, Smoking is one hell of a funny political satire, and is a definite must-see.Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart in a role that finally uses off his acting chops) is a spinster lobbyist for Big Tobacco. His job, is to take the blame of causing cancer and other diseases off of cigarette companies, and placing it elsewhere. In an early scene, he completely spins around a medical expert's claims on cigarettes causing cancer in a young boy, and gets everyone blaming the medical expert for wanting the boy to die in order to up their statistics to throw at big tobacco.The entirety of the movie revolves around Nick's conquests doing his job, and some of the lengths he has to go to in order to accomplish them. While much of the film rests on Eckhart's shoulders, the supporting cast is terrific in their roles. From William H. Macy as a McCarthian politician, to J.K. Simmons as Nick's boss, to Maria Bello and David Koechner as fellow lobbyists, to even Cameron Bright as Nick's son, everyone comes out swinging. Of particular interest is Rob Lowe, who while tiny in his role, has excellent chemistry with Eckhart. It's just a shame that many of their scenes are in the trailer, and are not left to be seen by the audience for the first time when watching the film.As said previously, the script is great. Jason Reitman does a fabulous job making a bleakly dark comedy out of such a big political issue. If you can contend and laugh at the idea of a movie about a bad guy just doing his job, then you'll be very impressed with this. While the movie starts out great, showing off Nick's smart-assed side right away, it quickly slows down in the second act, only to pick back up in the third. It's not a horrendous slowdown, but it is noticeable when comparing it to the rest of the film.Another issue is Katie Holmes. In this film, like Batman Begins, she serves a very big point to the film, but she just seems useless. She's barely in the film, but her scenes really do not make anywhere near as big a splash as any of the other supporting actors. You can barely see her acting muscle, and she just sticks out like a sore thumb. If there was any other way to get her purpose across in the film, I think Reitman should have taken it, because you can tell why Tom Cruise picked her to help with his publicity stunt.As a whole, Smoking works. There are a couple of issues with it, but the film is still great nonetheless. Yes it's dark, and rift with controversial elements. But that's what makes the film so much fun in the end.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank You for Smoking is a refreshingly witty and entertaining political satire, one of the best since Barry Levinson's Wag the Dog and it qualifies for one of the best movies of the year, so far. The film was directed by Jason Reitman, the son of Ivan Reitman, the director of Stripes and Ghostbusters, and this being his first feature directing debut is pretty impressive. The film is amusing and does a good job at balancing cynical humor with heart and smarts, maybe even too good of a job. The film is at times pretty funny and well-paced, finishing up in only a mere 92 minutes, but some of the comedic timing seems to be a little off in the beginning, but as the film progresses it gets much better when it all comes together in the end.The film's based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Buckley, about the day-in/day-out machinations of Big Tobacco's chief spokesman or "spin doctor", Nick Naylor (played amazingly well by Aaron Eckhart in a star-making role), and about the influence that his job has or might have on his 12-year-old son and the moral/ethical questions about the job he does. Eckhart does a great job at creating a character that you love to hate, but at the same time are still able to sympathize with, even though he may have one of the worst jobs on the planet and you hate him for being so good at what he does for a living. The rest of the cast isn't left in the dust either; they help out the picture tremendously by perfectly supporting and matching Eckhart's performance, taking the entire film up a notch. Among the supporting cast is William H. Macy, Katie Holmes, J.K. Simmons (who played J. Jonah Jameson in Spider-Man), Robert Duvall, David Koechner (who you'll recognize from Anchorman) and Maria Bello (who was great in last year's A History of Violence). And as witty and clever the writing maybe, if it weren't for these supporting performances from this cast the film wouldn't work nearly as well as it does.This is not quite a laugh a minute, bust-your-gut kind of comedy, but it is funny and it is smart, and that's something that is very hard and rare to find in theaters these days. So for that alone I've got to recommend you check out Thank You for Smoking. This is what last year's Lord of War looked like in the trailers; a funny satire, that doesn't necessarily push any one certain political of moral view, and because of that it's all the more easier to be able to sit back and enjoy. So if this film looks interesting to you I would recommend checking it out now, while it's still playing in theaters, because in just a few weeks the madness of the summer movie season is going to start up and you can rest assured that little films like this probably wont stand much of a chance against the big summer titles once they hit theaters. This film lands a solid and respectable score of seven, almost an eight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very entertaining movie. It isn't a documentary. It is, in fact, a fictional comedy. It is about Nick Naylor, a top lobbyist for the tobacco industry. We tend to consider such people as heartless and evil, but they are, in reality, people like us who need "to pay the mortgage." It was certainly satirical however. The guy who plays Nick does a fantastic job of portraying a smooth-talking, quick-witted lobbyist who at the same time realizes that his job is simply a game. Nick must face his role as a parent, and acknowledges the importance of family. Parents play a vital role in the development of their children, showing them the options that open up as their children grow. It is, however, vital to let children be the masters of their own fate. While tackling this, the film also poked at the US government, Nick at one time questioning the validity of an essay question given to his son, asking why America is the best government in the world. It made an effort to point out hypocrisy, using a vehemently righteous, but clueless Vermont Senator (played flawlessly by the ever-flawless William Macy) as the poster-boy of governmental duplicity. The film also brought up intriguing methods of argument, and persuasion that I found highly pertinent, and applicable to certain people's methods of argument, viz. addressing the issue in a manner in which one can never be wrong. It was not a knee-slapping comedy, although some part were certainly hilarious, but it was certainly a good time, made possible by a strong cast (generally&amp;#8213; although brought down a bit by the yet-to-impress Katie Holmes), beautiful cinematography (DC, LA, and elsewhere), creative filming, and above all, fresh ideas. The movie works, and is one so unlike anything else that it won't soon be forgotten. And remember, if it doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time. -Michael</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once and again, Fox Searchlight has given us hope that there really is good American film and solid acting, and in THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, this film portrays all the evils of an American culture that simply brings to light the bullshit that we see today in the USA, from the evils of how "spin doctors" can turn smoking into a "pleasure", and of course, the plasticity and crap created by a major Hollywood talent agency,to the ever present cancer,"Corporatism", which simply places the stockholder and Chief Executive above the rest of us.Aaron Eckhart had better be remembered in the award season ahead as he just makes this film his own from the first frame to the last. And, with his great performance from IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, he just becomes better with every film he makes. The supporting cast is such a delight to watch as they capture their characters superbly. Solid writing, editing and the joy of intelligent performances makes THANK YOU FOR SMOKING one film to be remembered come Oscar 2007.</fullReview>

Coming out of this movie I find myself thinking if I am a bit like Nick Naylor is that so bad? Any movie that leaves me idolizing the bad guy, a merchant of death, no less, is a quality film. The characters in this film are well developed and hilarious. There are one liners in this movie that I defiantly did not see coming and that had me literally gasping for air. One of the best (and most surprising) actors in this film was Rob Lowe. His portrayal of a Hollywood hot shot hit remarkably close to home. Overall this film was witty, sharp and insightful I would highly recommend this film to anyone; smoker, non-smoker, republican, die hard liberal or anyone in between, truly one of the best films to come out in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Your Call Is Important To Us., Oh, and Thank You For Smoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This little film is starting to make its way into the offbeat theaters. I am reading little bits and pieces here and there about it.Aaron Eckhardt, handsome, cleft-chinned male icon, is perfectly sleazy as one third of the K street Merchants of Death triumvirate, MOD, who hang together at the intersection of K and Madison, for shared comfort against the goody-goodies!I can't recall the third leg of this trio. I know there is alcohol, and Aaron represents the tobacco industry. It would make perfect sense if the Asbestos Industry had a public relations arm at the intersection of Madison and K. The filters on Steve McQueen's cigs were sculpted from asbestos you know!William F's vastly more talented son Christopher Buckley authored Thank You For Smoking in the immediate wake of the Henry Waxman Tobacco CEO pledge at a House Hearing in spring, 1994. Another hot smoking title is Cigarettes are Sublime. The Cig Culture is so hopelessly funny, absurd and cynical that it rates right up there with the Holocaust for comic potential.I didn't really warm to it until I learned recently that Ivan Reitman's son Jason, who is in the Mel Gibson film-making entourage, included a scene in his screenplay that is so in violation of current political orthodoxy that he deserves a special Nobel Prize for Cheek!Yes, that's right, he put Buckley's baby seal clubbing scene into the movie. A man with that kind of moxie deserves to have the world at his feet. I never though much of Reitman Senior. He's a scholockmeister. At least his son has the carefully cultivated tastelessness that is so ripe for this age of carelessness and despair. Without it, we wouldn't have this classic film. Think of what the smoking debacle has led to: All fifty states have made deals with Big Tobacco in the period since 1994. Smoking has fallen from 35% to 20% among Americans: NASCAR has become a vehicle for subliminally foisting Winstons on racing car fans; Second-hand smoke has become a nemesis to rival smoking itself, and actors who smoke in film product placements now fake the deep drags they take from their Cigs. I watch Bruce Willis' drags carefully to rate them for sincerity! Reprobate smokers gather in small groups to grieve over their losses, while anti-smokers devise new and even more debasing and malevolent remedies for bringing the remaining reprobates to heel!Truly, Cigarettes, the culture, have become sublime, quixotic and hilarious. Just being alive today is a pleasure. Almost like walking a mile for a camel in 1954.Thanks for Smoking Us Christopher Buckley!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reitman seems to have an opinion about everything.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank You for Smoking reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 2.5 out of 4Last year, Andrew Niccol put out the sly, steely portrait Lord of War. The film followed gun runner Yuri Orlov objectively through his work, sometimes leaving room for splashes of dark comedy and political jibes. The film didn't take a stance on gun running, and only because it didn't have to. The portrait was message enough. We understood the ethics?right and wrong?of gun running and recognized the evils that surrounded it. It worked through the idyllically simple principle of never trying too hard. Enter Thank You for Smoking, debut feature film for Jason Reitman. Thank You for Smoking is a film that tries too hard. Reitman seems to have an opinion about everything. He doesn't just dislike smoking, but wants to point out the hypocrisy in every mode of authority. But often Reitman is tactless, and throws about stabs and pokes and low blows with each of his steps. His point, perhaps, is that behind every authority, no matter how noble a cause, there lies an agenda. Reitman, however, doesn't approach this message smoothly; he attacks it like a deranged hen, often scuttling off into comic fancy and over-indulgent satire. The tact is missing where it should be stockpiled. His film can certainly be funny, but when it needs to count, it clucks. Our character is Nick Naylor, operated coolly by the windswept-blonde Aaron Eckhart. Reitman cuts away to a non-descript batting cage as Nick introduces himself: "You know the guy in high school who could pick up any girl?" he taps the bat against his foot and raises the bat, "I'm him on crack." And he's not kidding. For a living, Nick talks. And for most of Thank You for Smoking, we follow Nick around the globe as he sweet talks everyone from nasty girl reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes), to Senator Ortolan Finistirre (Will Macy), to cigarette mogul Doak "The Captain" Boykin (Robert Duvall) into supporting the cigarette conglomerates. He even yaps his way out of a talk show pitting the Lung Association, the Democratic Party, and a boy dying of cancer against him. He's that good. Joining him at lunch every day is the M.O.D. squad, and acronym that stands for Merchants of Death. Along with Nick, there's Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), the lobbyist of the National Firearms Association and Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), the spokesperson for the alcohol conglomerates. The cast is a loaded weapon, a common happenstance that seems to piggyback films packed with slant politics. But Thank You for Smoking doesn't leave enough room for its veterans. Maria Bello, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes, Adam Brody, and others appear only long enough to make cameo performances. They're effective in their quick draw appearances, but they're only use is to draw in audiences who would, if not for the actors, otherwise not spend money on a ticket. Aaron Eckhart does well enough to make up for the flash-in-the-pan tactics of the other roles, however. I'm surprised he hasn't broken into superstar status yet, seeming to instead hover in art house film radars. He similarly surprised me last year in the near perfect split-screen romance, Conversations with Other Women, a film that has struggled to find a willing distributor. Jason Reitman's direction is quick, ripe, and assured, but it's his writing that the film ultimately stumbles on. He's created a character too endeared to the audience. We somehow relate to Nick Naylor, and are continually finding ourselves rooting for him. Reitman paints an ugly picture of the cigarette industry, but is unwilling to incorporate Nick into it. He doesn't let us criminalize Nick, and instead disconnects him completely. Nick is our, all-access entrance into Reitman's world of all-encompassing hypocrisy, but Nick has little to do with it. Lord of War worked its character to be a part of its politics. The controversy stemmed from Yuri Orlov, whereas in Thank You for Smoking, Nick Naylor swerves and dodges the punches Reitman throws. But this is the consequence of Reitman's roundhouse punch at the world. Reitman wants to hit everybody with this film, and probably keeps Nick detached for this very reason. Nick taking a side would force the audience to take a side. Reitman wants instead for us to laugh at everyone. I just came to laugh at cigarettes.</fullReview>

Any time I have an opportunity to see a movie with Aaron Eckhart, Robert Duval, William H. Macy and Rob Lowe, I will take it. The movie is full of fun politically incorrect humor. An example is where Nick Naylor and his son are waiting outside the office of the Hollywood agent, played by Rob Lowe. On the large television screen hanging on the wall is a video of a whale playing with some sea lions. It is hilarious. Go see this movie, you will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reitman impresses. I am supposing we will lose our taste for his approach over time, and he will start to submerge it under conventional emotional forms. He is already well underway with "Up in the Air." So (as with Kevin Smith) we will have to go to the earlier films to see the sharp thing that made us notice. The usual way of describing this as shifting the frame of reference of an ironic form to the ironic side. In this explanation, we've had so much of irony we are able to see anti-irony as irony. The flaw of course is that the term was used wrong. None of this ever was irony unless you redefine the word. Now that would be ironic. A better way of understanding this is as a narrative layering. We come to stories these days less interested in the story than in how it is presented. Even the end of a South Park episode where we are supposed to come back to the real world and get the moral, the delivery is one that reverses the message. I call this narrative folding. Reitman plays with that reversal. He is hardly the first, but he has the best control in terms of disciplined filmmaking. Even here, you can see the safety valve, the emotional fallback. Here it is the on-screen son who does not get the reversal, and his earnest adoration. Reitman will always have this. My latest example, Matt Aselton, walked without this safety net. Also in these things ? at least for a few years ? we will always have a media reminder, a reminder that we are watching a movie. Here it is the fact that our focus is a media performer with the intent of reversing the truth.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Dark Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jason Reitman was always going to have a lot to live up to, having a dad who was a successful director of the Ghostbusters film and a big player in Hollywood. Studios did see potential in him, offering him the chance to direct Dude Where's My Car, but Reitman did not want to be seen living off his father's coattails. His first feature film ended up being a smaller independent dark comedy taking on the lobby industry, American politics and Hollywood.Thank You for Smoking tells the story of Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), the Vice President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies, and their chief spokesman. He has to defend the indefensible, and proves that he can argue superbly against people with more moral argues. But despite his skills and even humiliating anti-smoking campaigners on national television the Tobacco Industry is under constant assault. Senator Finisterre (William H. Macy), a Democrat from Vermont, proposes a bill to put visial warnings on cigarette packets, and challenges the tobacco lobby to face his sub-committee. Nick believes going on the offensive, accept Finisterre's challenge, face the media, lead by a young journalist, Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) and try and make smoking sexy again by working with a Hollywood superagent, Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), to produce a movie. Nick's personal life also grown, and he grows closer to young son Joey (Cameron Bright), and he teaches him how to debate effective. The two go on trips together, and Nick argues that all he is doing is enfranchising the disenfranchised. But Nick's world is thrown into jeopardy when his life is threaten, and he has to battle the media. He walks a fine line with his boss BR (J.K. Simmons) and with the finer moral line. Jason Reitman shows himself to be very ambitious writer/director, taking on a wide number targets: the smoking lobby, the general lobby industry in American, the political left and shows that Hollywood isn't as liberal as the Conservative Media would have you believe. Reitman is very stylist director, starting out with an effective title sequence, and continuing throughout with little visial tricks and even stock footage. Reitman keeps the humour going throughout the film, telling a very funny story that would please anyone who enjoys good satire. This is film aimed for a very politically aware audience and anyone who enjoys smart, dark comedy will like this film. But as well as the comedy, Reitman does also offer some heart in his film, with a key element of the film being the father and son relationship between Nick and Joey and how it grows, and more hard-hitting scenes like when Nick meets Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott), a former tobacco spokesman who developed lung cancer. There is a fine cast in this film. If Christopher Nolan is be believed that this film landed Aaron Eckhart the role of Harvey Dent in the Dark Knight. Eckhart is perfectly slimy as the tobacco lobbyist who could sell sand to the Egyptians. The great J.K. Simmons is almost like J. Jonah Jameson as Nick's boss and he has been a regular player in Reitman's films. Cameron Bright who is more known for playing a creepy kid in Birth and in the poor X-Men: The Last Stand, give his best performance ever in a film. Katie Holmes shows that she can be a good actress and it was fun to see her as a bit of minx. William H. Macy, a darling of independence American cinema, is very effective as the 'villain' who has a very moral cause. Despite the positives, there are a few problems with this film. Firstly is the problem involving Eckhart's character. Nick is so unlikeable throughout the film that it's hard to root for him. He is too slimy and would have been better a supporting character. It was hard to agree with his arguments, like enfranchising the disenfranchised, ignoring the fact many of these industry have multi-billion dollar profits and can buy all the influence there want. This story would have been very interesting if it was told from Senator Finisterre's, battling against the intensive lobbying from the tobacco industry. The film also missed a trick when it could have shown the tobacco industry making political contributions to politicians at many different levels, state politicians, governors, senators, representatives, being corrupted by their evil. As well, whilst it is mostly the Democrats who take on the tobacco industry, and that big tobacco were one of the biggest supporters of George W. Bush (along with other evils like oil, mining, chemicals, the gun lobby and logging); the film could have twisted on the idea showing a right-wing Republican also taking on tobacco: much like Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch of Utah.This is a clever satire and worth watching if you are interested in American politics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say, it's the truth, no matter how grim it is. Yes the main character (Nick Naylor) is the spokesman for a tobacco company, does he like cigarettes? yes he does. Does he know they're bad for you? yes he does. But that's not the point, it's his job to convince people. His job is to talk and win arguments, and he's a master of it.Now this is one of the most hilarious and most brilliant films I've seen in this year. And don't let the title scare, this movie does not want you to start smoking, if you think so, you've missed the point. It's about freedom, put in a very dark humoured way, in which the moral is, are smokers that much dumber than the rest of the world. There are so many bad things in the world, and just because some people out of they're own free will want to smoke something that dangerous for themselves, well then that's they're choice.It's the ultimate freedom question, told in a very satire form, as long has you don't hurt anyone in the process, you can do whatever the hell you want.And let's not forget the great acting from Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor and many other great supporting characters, especially Cameron Bright as nick's son Joey Naylor. See the film I wont spoil all the characters position in the film. Now I hope you don't misunderstand me, I'm against smoking to, but this movie comes with hilarious, clever and rude arguments in ways you couldn't possibly imagine. For a clever and dark-humoured film, which definitely makes you think, I give this film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An original and well crafted comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I sat down to watch Thank You for Smoking I was expecting a straight forward anti-smoking message but what I got was something a little more complicated. Rather than bombard me with anti-smoking propaganda it sent a message about personal responsibility and free choice. Whether or not I agreed with it I can still respect it for not taking the easy way out.Naylor: I renounce smoking! In fact I will now use my powers of persuasion to bring down big tobacco! Believe me, I was convinced that ending was coming. The ending they do use makes the movie feel more real.But what is a good story without a good script? The dialogue is clever and the way it is delivered is even better. There is not one weak link in this movie as far as acting or writing goes.I highly recommend paying special attention to the scene where Eckhart must deliver a speech to a class room full of children. Not to mention any scene containing the "Mod Squad." The production quality is what really blew me away with this movie. The cinema photography is unusually good for a comedy and the editing is incredibly unique. There are visual treats peppered throughout the film. I felt like I was watching a Cohen brother's flick or a Wes Anderson film the whole time.There's this one part where Naylor is scratching his son's head while he sleeps on his lap and when it cuts to the next scene of him dropping him off he's scratching his head again, it creates the illusion of continuous motion. A very neat trick, If I say so myself.Naylor's narration is another good part of this movie. Everything he says is either funny or insightful and sometimes it's both. Besides one awkward interjection at the beginning of the movie, it manages to cue up at just the right moments.There are two things I find wrong with this movie. Firstly, I think it's rather impossible for someone to receive such a level of nicotine toxicity they can never smoke again in their life.The only other gripe I have with this movie is the ending. Make no mistake, it was a fantastic ending, it just didn't feel like it had that much closure to it.Who knows, maybe I just didn't want the movie to end at all?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great satire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing and enjoying the pleasant surprise of Juno, I was eager to rent director Jason Reitman's first film, Thank You for Smoking. I am happy to say this is one of the better political satires in recent memory. Aaron Eckhart is absolutely brilliant and perfectly cast as Nick Naylor, the main lobbyist for the tobacco industry. What makes this film and this character so fascinating is that they both agree that smoking is not good for you, yet they make a living trying to convince people not that they are good for you, but that they are simply cool. Made on an indie film budget, this movie boasts some great actors, including JK Simmons, William H. Macy, Rob Lowe, Adam Brody, Katie Holmes, and Robert Duvall, who all play their bit parts to perfection. In the end, however, it is Eckhart who drives this story home. He is likable enough to root for, yet he is also a scheming manipulator of the truth who tries to be a role model for his son. Despite its sometimes grim subject material, Reitman keeps it mostly energetic and funny. If you love satire, Thank You for Smoking is one you should get addicted to.</fullReview>

Nick Naylor: -Whoa, Joey I'm never wrong. Joey Naylor: But you can't always be right... Nick Naylor: -Well if it's your job to be right, then you're never wrong. Joey Naylor: But what if you are wrong? Nick Naylor: -OK, let's say that you're defending chocolate, and I'm defending vanilla. Now if I were to say to you: 'Vanilla is the best flavour ice-cream', you'd say: Joey Naylor: No, chocolate is. Nick Naylor: Exactly, but you can't win that argument... so, I'll ask you: so you think chocolate is the end all and the all of ice-cream, do you? Joey Naylor: It's the best ice-cream, I wouldn't order any other. Nick Naylor: -Oh! So it's all chocolate for you is it? Joey Naylor: Yes, chocolate is all I need. Nick Naylor: Well I need more than chocolate, and for that matter I need more than vanilla. I believe that we need freedom. And choice when it comes to our ice-cream, and that Joey Naylor, that is the definition of liberty. Joey Naylor: But that's not what we're talking about Nick Naylor: -Ah! But that's what I'm talking about. Joey Naylor: ...but you didn't prove that vanilla was the best... Nick Naylor: I didn't have to. I proved that you're wrong, and if you're wrong I'm right. Joey Naylor: But you still didn't convince me. Nick Naylor: It's that I'm not after you. I'm after them." ***Points into the crowd***"</fullReview>

Jason Reitman may be a young filmmaker, but he really nailed just about every aspect of this film. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I cared for his characters.All the cast (Rob Lowe, Aaron Eckhart, SK Simmons, Cameron Bright, Robert Duvall) are absolutely brilliant and it was a nice touch for a movie about smoking to not feature a single person smoking throughout. Clever. At the end of the day this might be a serious subject but this is foremost an entertaining and fabulous film.Watch it now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is just an excellent movie, and it's exactly my kind of humor too. The script is so well constructed that it gives me fits, and the movie never falls into the typical modern American comedy pitfalls of idiotic slapstick and "random" moments. Seriously, I've never seen a movie so dependent on dialogue alone that works as well as this does. It not only works, it damn well SHINES! The script alone carries Thank You For Smoking further than one would expect, and if that isn't enough, the clever use of irony (how nobody in the entire movie is actually seen smoking, and more similar gems) accentuates it further.Thank You For Smoking is not a conventional comedy, but don't let that deter you - this is just a brilliant movie, with multiple dimensions, charming, devilish wit, and characters that you'll remember long after the credits start to roll.

WMDs, Guantanamo, The Patriot Act, and "Stay the course" promoters used all of the techniques and arguments found in this film to create the bubbling, flaming, exploding cauldron that is Iraq. I have a similar problem with "Wag The Dog," but, hey, it's a dangerous world out here, and it's better to think for yourself...isn't it? Time has caught up with this film, so I'm viewing "The Great Dictator" or PBS' "The War." There's a reason that "The Greatest Generation" is admired; they didn't spin anything. Faced with an economy that tanked or world war, they didn't hesitate to step up and be counted, even if it led to real estate only sufficient for a grave and headstone. It's a shame that they're leaving this life just when their counsel is most needed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you for smoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was on my list of viewing because it was shown and ran at Amsterdam theatres for long; but not in the Pathe theatres where I hold my pass. So when Pathe was running these special PAC movies re-run, I grabbed the opportunity to see the movie with my colleague's son Felix who had come for a flying visit from Zurich to meet his Dad.The story is about Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) who is lobbyist for the smoking industry in US. His job is to convince people that smoking is not actually bad ? no scientific research has proved it so. It is as bad as eating cheese that increases cholesterol levels. He is an argumentative talker who can confidently find logic to prove that he is right. The movie tries to project the American culture and way of life ? the alcohol, the gun, the press, the senators ? all of them, at what levels people can easily stoop to earn a living. As Nick Naylor says, all he does is just to pay the mortgage.The movie is a satirical comedy and should be seen in that way. It is made from a book with the same title. People, who have read the book, have not liked the movie. But those who have not read the book, for them the movie was pretty good.This is the first time directorial debut for short film maker Jason Reitman. He was done a commendable job here. Aaron Eckhart has tried to play this negative character with great conviction and humor. The other good character I like who plays the senator in the movie is William Macy. He is as good as ever, but little under used.Everyone knows smoking is bad, but Americans ? as their true image ? can sell anything with so much stupid conviction ? that it can become believable. Their confidence, calmness and smiling face in the face of adversity to pull out arguments for something so deadly as smoking is shown is great way.Last thing I would add is ? all humans stoop to do terrible things not for paying mortgage ? but with the desire to get rich. And which other place can there be the best example other than USA. That is America for you on the platter! I liked the movie, go and get a DVD if you want to see the American way of life.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Black Lung Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aaron Eckhart has always deserved to play a role as ferociously incisive as this. Thank You for Smoking fleshes his latent silver-tongued devil in the form of Nick Naylor, a spokesman for Big Tobacco; the type of guy who could sell ice to Eskimos.Movie opens with Nick on one of those daytime talk shows responsible for the redneckification of America, guesting alongside lobbyists against the tobacco industry and - purely as emotive stab against tobacco - Cancer Boy. (Didn't The Kids in the Hall invent Cancer Boy?) Using his gifted gab, Nick skillfully turns the audience aggression against the anti-smoking lobbyists, using Cancer Boy as prime example of Tobacco's good intent, "Though these lobbyists would like to see Cancer Boy die to prove their point, it is in Tobacco's best interests that he LIVES, to continue using our product." Later, giving a speech at his son's school, he tears a new hole for a ten-year-old girl when she offers her mother's opinion that smoking is unhealthy, "Oh, is your mommy a doctor?" From Christopher Buckley's novel, directing and writing his first feature film, Jason Reitman (son of Ghostbuster Ivan) creates a character we rarely see in Hollywood movies: a hero quite aware of, and at peace with, his moral flexibility.Robert Duvall is the industry's Puff Daddy - a Big Tobacco CEO; William H. Macy now officially owns the character he plays here - Senator Ortolan Finistirre, yet another perplexed dexter, trying not to stumble under the pressure of Nick's smooth operator; Sam Elliott could not be better cast as an ex-Marlboro Man, and J.K. Simmons has been honing this gruff boss routine since Spiderman.Unconvincing Katie Holmes plays a reporter who seduces incriminating info from Nick, precipitating the loss of his job. Her vapid acting skills bear out the theory that she should still be plying her trade in teen romantic comedies. Or amateur porn.Nick's lunchtime buddies, lobbyists for alcohol (Maria Bello) and guns (David Koechner), who take a perverse pleasure in terming themselves the MOD Squad ("Merchants Of Death"), bond over wicked lobbying anecdotes and their respective industry's death tolls. Bello would have indisputably made a more convincing underhanded reporter than Holmes. (I'm not advocating they swap roles. I'm saying Holmes should find employment more suited to her unique talents - maybe a toilet cleaner at Wal-Mart.) The thin plot finds Nick commissioning a super-agent (smarmy Rob Lowe in a kimono) to get cigarettes back into the lips of A-List stars in A-List movies - like smoking's glory days with Bogey and Bacall; when men were men and women were not she-males.This simple story only exists to give Nick something to do while the movie studies his incorrigible character; his relationship as a divorced parent to his young son carries more thematic weight, yet the movie's ultimate purpose is deeper than even this usually-maudlin aspect - Thank You For Smoking is a quick-witted satire on how Spin has crept into every aspect of our modern lives. Smoking lobbyists are the subject here but their deceitful nature has only been nurtured by society itself: fat chicks call themselves "thick"; we tell prospective buyers that our car with the massive oil leak "runs well"; 19 months into a stalemated war, a Mission Accomplished sign flies high at a Presidential address; and a drug which causes irregular heartbeat, dizziness, high blood pressure, nausea, diarrhea, headaches and blurred vision is marketed as an ANTI-DEPRESSANT to make you more sociable! (Either way you end up staying home - from imagined anxiety, or real anxiety that you may crap your pants and have a heart attack while trying to get it up.) More dangerous than heroin, they call it Zoloft.Nick is kidnapped by anti-smoking fanatics, forced to overdose on nicotine patches and, in a tableau reminiscent of Michelangelo's Piet?, left to die in the lap of Daniel French's Lincoln statue. The imagery is portentous because Nick effects a resurrection of sorts: his tolerance to nicotine, through smoking, kept him alive - and is woven into the fabric of his spin thereafter: "Smoking saved my life!" Zealously embracing his job as Sultan of Spin, Nick is a mixture of forest fire (machine-gunning his dialog in short, sharp bursts, savagely taking down all comers), and innocence (Eckhart retaining that disarming demeanor he displayed in Your Friends and Neighbors). We "don't see him coming" - unlike the Cruise of Magnolia or the Martin of Leap of Faith - slamming home runs with every fallacious, roundabout rebuttal.To prime his son Joey for a school debate, Nick espouses: "If you argue correctly, you're never wrong" - which, being true, is an indictment not just against lobbyists (on any side) and their unholy string-pulling in congress, but also against the current legal system, the entertainment industry and any forum where the slickest LIE will triumph over a mundane Truth.Thank You For Smoking is a biting rejoinder to the mentally-vapid acceptance of all things politically correct. It reminds us to educate ourselves in the face of staggering obstacles. And it illustrates that the obstacles to truth are sometimes the very people exhorting you to seek it.If the movie is, in fact, sending a message about Choice, isn't it intriguing that no one is actually seen smoking in the movie? Even the mighty John Wayne (seen in a snippet from Sands of Iwo Jima, 1949) is shot down as he prepares to light up. Relating back to this film's plot - getting an A-Movie Hero to smoke on screen - was this non-smoking decision true irony on the film-makers' part, or simply the MPAA enforcing their non-smoking edicts on this major release film, making it a victim of the very condition it rails against? Put that in your pipe and smoke it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THANK YOU FOR SMOKING: starring Aaron Eckhart, Maria Bello, Sam Elliott, Rob Lowe, William H. Macy, Katie Holmes, David Koechner, and Robert Duvall. Warning: This film may cause side splitting laugh attacks, and introspective thought provoked by politically incorrect humor. Pregnant women can safely view the following. 'Thank You for Smoking' is based on the Christopher Buckley novel, and is directed by Jason Reitman, the son of famed Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman. This satirical take on "spin" in today's America centers on Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), the tobacco industry's main lobbyist in Washington, DC, and spokesman for the "Academy of Tobacco Studies". He is the quintessential anti-hero, fronting an organization that has legally killed many millions of people. He advocates personal freedom for the many that choose to light up and smoke, nimbly surviving landmine questions in his public dealings, with answers that twist the questions onto the accuser. Nick Naylor's only two real friends are representatives of organizations that also get cast a lot of blame for society's ills ? the alcohol industry's Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), head of the Moderation Council, and the firearm industry's Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), who heads the gun advisory group Safety. At their frequent dinner meetings they compare fatality stats from their own respective products like an ESPN announcer: 30 daily firearm related deaths, 270 daily alcohol related deaths, and tobacco, the overwhelming champion with 1,200 daily deaths. Together the three lobbyists are known as the Merchants of Death. Nick Naylor is in the center of the bulls-eye as Vermont Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre (William H. Macy) pursues a bill that would make it mandatory for a skull and crossbones to be put on the sides of all packs of cigarettes. Jeff Magell (Rob Lowe) is the Hollywood super agent that Nick goes to about the product placement of cigarettes in films, because (as he points out), the majority of people who smoke in films today are Russians, Arabs, or villains. Nick has joint custody of his son Joey with his wife Jill, and as the film progresses, he makes an effort to reach out to him, answering frank questions about how he can do such a morally questionable job that causes him to be despised, hated, and the object of death threats and scorn. In his dealings across the country, he has to placate the ex-Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott), who now has cancer, fend off zealous reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes), and report to the "captain" of the tobacco industry Doak Boykin (Robert Duvall). The thing about this film which is utterly fascinating is that not one cigarette is smoked, and there is not a clear bias as to which side you should belong to, or which beliefs you should subscribe to. Whatever your feelings are, you will be forced to examine them after watching this movie. 'Thank You for Smoking' takes an objective look at a taboo subject, and gives you the unfiltered truth - a behind the scenes peek at how "spin" impacts and shapes our culture. The moral of this story is to examine the "talk" that we are in the midst of on a daily basis, whether we know it or not, and to take responsibility for your choices, and not to be duped by spin tactics. Every side pushes their own agenda, with many of us caught unwittingly in the middle. Because of its raw visage, this is not a completely easy film to watch, but it is a satire after all, so do not take everything "as is". The M.P.A.A. has deemed it necessary to label this film rated R.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Thank You for Smoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was attracted to the movie because of its title - Thank You for Smoking. It's not politically correct - where's the "not"? And the trailer looked like it was a whole lot of fun as well, with a tobacco evangelist spreading the good news about smoking and cigarettes. Coincidentally, this movie also turned out to be this week's GV Surprise Screening selection.I like movies with ensemble cast too, and this one consisted of Aaron Eckhart, Maria Bello, Sam Elliot, Rob Lowe, William H Macy, JK Simmons, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes and Cameron Bright. Not the usual big names, but a stellar cast nonetheless, some of whom you would've come across in other big budgeted movies, like JK Simmons - the James Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's Spidey, or Cameron Bright - the most over-under utilized kid from Ultraviolet and X3.The opening credits played to the song "Smoke, Smoke, Smoke that Cigarette!", consisting of colourful cigarette boxes, already got me hooked, and the protagonist of Nick Naylor (Eckhart), the tobacco industry lobbyist, is one heck of an interesting character, and holds one heck of a dream job. He's not a lawyer, but can sure talk like one, and has the same uncanny ability to turn black into white with his wit and persuasion. There are plenty of witty lines and dialogue in this movie, played out with some cheese and infused with comedy at the right moments. My favourite moments are those in which Nick teaches his son Joey (Bright) how to win arguments, which he's the best at the business at. About the flawed but sounds-so-sexily correct logic which is employed to break down the arguments of another.He has few friends, since anti-smoking lobbyists are a dime a dozen, and counts amongst his circle of trust, the Mod Squad, consisting of fellow spin doctors from the Alcohol and Firearms industry (Maria Bello and David Koechner respectively). Their chill out get together dinner sessions are a hoot to watch, as they go about sharing ideas, spinning techniques, and rant about their collective enemies.If there's a lesson to take away from this picture, it's not to sleep and tell, especially if the reporter has glorious tits, in the mould of Katie Holmes. Bent on exposing the slickest in the business, you thought that Nick would be beaten down with a scandal. But as they say, it's always tough to keep a good man down! Besides the romantic entanglement, there's a little sub plot about office politics, like having a "leaning mountain" in the form of your boss's boss, and the trouble that will inevitably knock on your door when he's no longer around. Compelling stuff.In a movie which seemed to be pro-tobacco, you'd be surprised that NONE of the characters actually light up on screen! The closest we got to was from a movie "Sands of Iwo Jima" shown on television, but he got shot when he was distributing ciggies to his mates. How's that for irony? And I have no idea why the local rating is M18 for sexual references. Sure there was sex, but you can't see a thing, and it got truncated badly anyway. Why can't the censors get straight to the point that it's M18 - Pro-Cigarette movie, which would align with local laws that cigarettes cannot be sold to those under 18 years of age? One wonders.Then again, as addressed in the movie, I liked the part where there was a commotion over the effectiveness of having horrible pictures of death printed on the cigarette boxes. You must watch and see if you agree with the arguments presented. But the bottom line is, it's all about choice. Everyone, unless you're extremely ignorant, should already be aware of the dangers. If you want to, go ahead. If not, that's fine too.Now where's my cigarette? (should I, too, stick an M18 warning or attach some grotesque pictures? :P)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nick Naylor Makes Me Want To Smoke"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Naylor, a lobbyist on behalf of Tobacco industries, is a smart, good-looking, fast talking S.O.B. Naylor travels to different locations for these Tobacco industries as their spokesman, on this trip he takes his son and tries to be a role model while keeping his image good in the public eye.Is there any kind of plot behind Thank you For Smoking, on the surface not really. Smoking is a film that is more character driven. It's in the comedic style of a David O. Russell film or maybe even a Wes Anderson film. Smoking is a quirky, in your face, dark, odd comedy that actually works. Too often we see films that are too dark and not comedic enough with it's material, Duplex and Ice Harvest to name some. Here, Reitman takes a controversial topic and puts a comedic spin on it. The film doesn't take one side or the other, but in the end tells you to make your mind up for yourself.It may take a pretty sick and twisted individual to laugh at some scenes, such as "Cancer Boy" or the topics that the "M.O.D" have at their dinner table. Ladies and Gentlmen, I am a sick and twisted individual and I enjoyed this film. It made light of a heavy topic and actually make you like the lead character who is the one killing people...more or less. How can we like such a character? Well, it does help when the character is an intelligent, smooth talking, good looking guy, who gets to bang Katie Holmes. The other reason is that the character is played extremely well by Aaron Eckhart. Hands down his best role to date and hopefully one where he will be able to get more recognition. Bottom Linbe, Nick Naylor make me want to smoke, because he is so convincing at what he does, as it's the only thing he's good at.Smoking speaks the truth, in a sick and twisted funny way. The main character gets kidnapped and gets a couple dozen smoking patches slapped onto his body, then left to rot in the Lincoln memorial lap. We then find out that it was smoking that saved his life, Naylor's response? "Can I quote you on that?" This is what the whole movie is like, smart a witty dialogue with cool and funny characters. Some of the best scenes are between Eckhart and Lowe, who play very well off each other in a scene where they try to promote smoking in the films. The need a role model to show that smoking is cool, someone like Indiana Jones meets Jerry Maguire, on two packs a day. The only downfall of the film is Naylor's son, who is a kid that you may end up hating, just because of the kid being the way he is. It's the same kid from Birth and Godsend. There is just something about his acting that annoys me, it could be his emotionless face...but then again, I'm not a big fan of many child actors. The supporting cast includes Maria Bello, J.K. Simmons, William H. Macy, Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot and Katie Holmes. All Holmes does in the movie is have sex with Naylor, then write an article...not much more, so if you're a lover or hater of the one half of TOMKAT, she has no impact on the film, her screen time maxes out at about ten minutes.Thank You For Smoking is a film that is definitely not for everyone, it's not laugh out loud funny, it's comedic style is a little bit more intelligent. Using it's comedy in it's dialogue and it's subject matter. The film doesn't say Smoking is good for you, or that it's bad, it expects you to know the answer already. Thank You For Smoking is an early contender for a top ten list and is an underdog in every sense of the word. It won't get much recognition from the public, or probably even the critics, but as it stands this film is...smokin'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humor that's actually clever and smart? This is rare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like your laughs to come at the expense of smart and clever writing then you obviously like Johnny Betts' work, but there's also a better-than-average chance you'll enjoy Thank You for Smoking.I know what you're thinking: "Hey! Is this one of those propaganda pieces that does nothing but preach against the evils of tobacco?" No, actually, it isn't. Sure, it has some fun at the expense of Eckhart's tobacco lobbyist character, but reporters, Hollywood, and hypocritical politicians with their own agendas all get a little lampooning as well. It's a film that never really narrows its target on one group. And why should it when it can have more fun lambasting all sides? What makes the movie really work is the running storyline of how William H. Macy wants to put a big picture of a skull and crossbones on cigarette boxes. He brings in a doctor to testify that people have an 80% greater response rate to imagery than they do text. I like how statistics such as this are cleverly employed in a way that educates and entertains at the same time; never making us feel like we're sitting in a boring college lecture.A member from the Hispanic community also complains that many Mexicans can't read English; therefore, pictures are needed to warn them of the dangers of smoking. Not satisfied with this level of irresponsibility he's already showing, Mr. Hispanic makes the bold, and ridiculous, claim that "they" want people who can't speak English to die.Eckhart, on the other hand, wonders why we don't just slap a warning label on everything that can cause death. How about Michigan propose a skull and crossbones picture for their cars? And how can Macy, Senator from Vermont that he is, not take responsibility for the fact that his state is proud of their cheddar, which also leads to high cholesterol which leads to heart disease which is, yep, you guessed it - the #1 killer in America? This exchange leads to the great, yet most likely unappreciated line, "The great state of Vermont will not apologize for its cheese!" Eckhart also takes it to Macy on the Dennis Miller show. How can he advocate slashing and burning tobacco farms one morning and then later that afternoon ride around on a tractor and bemoan the plight of the American farmer? It doesn't take a Johnny Betts to realize this is a film interested in reminding us all to check just how brightly our halo is shining before we selfishly go about fulfilling our own agendas at the expense of criticizing others.According to Eckhart, we're living in a world where 99% of everything that is done, good or bad, is done to pay the mortgage. Thank You for Smoking gives us the opportunity to watch this play out. In a country being overrun with political correctness and the extreme lack of desire to take personal responsibility, this is a sharp political satire that is written to appeal to adults, a rarity these days, and simply wants to state that education comes from teachers and parents, not the side of a cigarette carton.THE GIST Thank You for Smoking is a rare brand of smart, adult humor for those of you who want to laugh but know The Benchwarmers and Phat Girlz won't come close to doing the trick. If you like your comedy a little dark and wry then give this a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic satire-sure to be a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the funniest satires I have seen in years, reminiscent of the ones from the 1970's and early 80's (think "Network," "Serial," "9 to 5"). Aaron Eckhart does a tremendous job with turning on the charm and charisma with a character who would in true life be seen as heinous and manipulative. His comic timing is impeccable, the narration is brilliant, and he brings so much passion and enthusiasm to Nick Naylor that it makes it impossible to dislike him. The supporting cast (including Katie Holmes in a surprisingly good performance as a femme fatale Washington Reporter, Maria Bello as a cynical alcohol lobbyist, and the incomparable Sam Elliott as an embittered former spokesperson for Marlboro cigarettes) brings a flavor to the movie that makes it the perfect recipe for black comedy. The remaining ingredients (besides the amazing leading man) are a terrific script and great direction by Jason Reitman-a true chip off the old block of dad Ivan. Each actor brings an energy to the film that matches Eckhart's completely. I hope this movie goes into wide-release, because audiences everywhere deserve to view this gem!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Thought-Provoking look at Tobacco and Spin.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thank You For Smoking" is a fun-filled satire of spin doctors with the backdrop of an easy target: the tobacco industry.The plot of the film revolves around Nick Naylor, top spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, whose job is to convince America that cigarettes and smoking is acceptable. Throughout the film he undergoes moral dilemma, an attack of conscience, and a person who wants him dead for spreading the tobacco gospel.The film is deeper than the typical smoking debates, though. The real power of the film lies in the impartial critiques of BOTH sides of the issue, focusing on the differing amounts of spin each side presents to sway the American public to side with their cause. This part of the film is very thought-provoking and is perhaps one of the two great strengths this film presents. At the end of the film, you might find yourself questioning both sides.The other strength lies in the supporting cast. Katie Holmes plays an excellent journalist hoping for a big bombshell story. William Macy plays an excellent foil to Aaron Eckhart's Naylor in Senator Finistirre, a man who will stop at nothing and try everything to break the tobacco industry. Rob Lowe, however, might have the best scenes in the movie as the quirky talent agent to the stars.The script is filled with many moments of dark humor which might not rub everyone the right way. But its placement fits with the critique of the spin doctors so while not always funny it's at least understandable.Additionally, the film is short so at times the dialogue feels rushed. Some of the humor and plot points are tough to follow. Overall, though, the film flows well."Thank You For Smoking" is certainly worth a view or two. It's thought-provoking, funny, and well-acted. has some excellent acting throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sound bytes that I heard on NPR's coverage of "Thank You For Smoking" were the best moments in the movie. It shouldn't come as a surprise that the best things in a movie about spin should be watching the process of spin in action, and spin is all about sound bytes. Aaron Eckhart is wonderful as the cigarette spin doctor and he is supported by an A-team of character actors including William H. Macy as a Vermont senator, Robert Duvall as "the Captain" of big tobacco, Sam Elliott as a Marlboro Man diagnosed with cancer and J.K. Simmons as Eckhart's boss. Rob Lowe steals the show as a Hollywood product placement mogul only too eager to find a place for cigarettes somewhere in "the future." The film's strength, the joyful fun it has with a very deadly issue, is also the key to its weakness. The targets are easy and the plot turns contrived. Katie Holmes is weak as a femme fatale reporter but so is her contrived story line. The movie is definitely worth seeing for its brilliant flashes of comedy but it leaves you with a craving for more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lorax for Adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're not supposed to like Nick Naylor, the spokesman for "Big Tobacco." He's not supposed to have 'sexual relations' with an absurdly cute newspaper reporter. But we do. And he does.Thank You For Smoking, adapted from Christopher Buckley's novel, gives us the resulting slow-moving train wreck. And gives us a primer on how to get lots more people smoking, or drinking, shooting, drilling....Throughout the film (and especially during the 'train wreck') there are cringe moments. Sometimes it's brutal honesty: "We sell cigarettes. They're addictive. The job is almost done for us." There's the profanity, which isn't strong by movie standards, but sounds startlingly profane for some reason. Sometimes it's the shake-the-head-and-look down cringe when we're glad we're not in their shoes.The film is funny and smart, and doesn't take a clear stand on the issue of smoking. The issue in the film is spin, and Nick makes clear to his 12-year-old son that a quick tongue means never having to say you're wrong.The tone of the film swings between plausible and parody, and occasionally strays too far on the parody side. The assistant to the Hollywood super-agent is over-caffeinated. A terrorist plot is almost entirely removed from the original novel, but it still lurks. The reporter in back-to-back scenes delivers one of the film's best lines followed by the film's worst slapstick moment.All in all, an entertaining and smart flick. Parent / kid safe, minus some swear words. Will watch it again to catch all the hidden jokes (background signs, acronyms, etc.) By the way, Rob Lowe cameos as the Hollywood super (and I mean super) agent. Warning: May contain humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not that funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for Thank You For Smoking, a satire about smoking and the way the media, politicians and people in general act in relation to the issues it generates. I found it to be disappointingly tame in its derision of the hypocrisies and manipulation of the various groups and characters in the film. Sure, it presents a number of interesting ideas, but most of them just don't really go anywhere. William H. Macy's character in particular seems plainly unoriginal and pointless.However, the real problem for me is that this just isn't nearly as funny as it ought to be. Although some bits of it are pretty funny and others original and thought provoking, the remaining sections are often to be quite frank, dull. Much of the humour misses (in my opinion) and some scenes are borderline boring. The occasional witty line is not enough to engage an audience and tell a meaningful story. Furthermore, I found the film confusing in its tone. It's too silly for its plot to be taken seriously, but then it spends so much time on establishing an elaborate plot that goes nowhere in particular.Aaron Eckhart is very good as Nick Naylor while the supporting cast is solid. However, none of the characters are explored deeply enough to truly add any depth to the movie with perhaps the exception of Nick Naylor and his son. In fact, some of the most intelligent and memorable lines come from the son but for me they were still unrealistic and lacked subtlety. That's a problem with the movie as a whole; the characters aren't real and as good as some of lines may be, they don't fit in with the characters and situations.Another odd problem with the movie was the colour. It often seemed to have some kind of yellow tint to it - I thought there was a problem with our DVD player or something. Also, the cinematography felt limited and languid, accentuating the slower, weaker parts of the movie. The music by Rolfe Kent, although probably alright per se similarly added nothing in my opinion (unlike the use of his music in Sideways for example).Perhaps the worst thing about Thank You For Smoking is how forgettable it is. I remember I enjoyed some bits but I find it difficult to recall any of them. Thinking back I am primarily reminded of how much of a missed opportunity it ended up being.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A comment from a non smoker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My father and I are the only non smokers in the family, and even my dad was a smoker way back but quite. I haven't caved into the peer pressure, or at least yet, but probably won't. Why? Smoking, from what I've learned, is a very deadly and addictive substance, it's like putting poison in your body. But I don't judge other smokers, never have since I grew up around them, but I always wondered why and how someone could get into it. Tobacco companies for years have been trying to be convincing on how they care and are trying to stop other possible young buyers, lol! Thank You For Smoking is one of the most intelligent and funny movies I have seen in a while. It mixes the truth with comedy, not to mention that the lead character's voice makes such an impact and argues so well. He'd make you want to easily start smoking because he is so charming and smooth. It was also interesting that he had a son, you spend some of the movie debating wither or not he's trying to make his son like him socially or just teach him how to survive in the world of constant arguments.Like I said, this is one of the most intelligent movies that moves so well and was brilliantly made. The cast brought so much to this story that could've been disastrous, but turned into a total masterpiece of a movie and a great debate for many. You gotta love a movie that keeps you thinking way after you finish watching it.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" was an entertaining movie. I enjoyed the portrayal of corporate shenanigans and its satire of Hollywood types. The acting was good and all players did their jobs well but I was a bit put off by the smirking 'we're so smart and hip attitude' of the movie. A bit of humbleness is appealing. There was too much youthful snarkyness associated with the jokes. That arrogance caused me to feel very little towards the characters. I was glad they were just characters on the screen and that I would never really meet them. If you are young and enjoy the meanness and arrogant attitudes so common on TV and in popular media maybe you'll like the movie better than I. It's a shame because there was lots to like about the movie but it was too snarky for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you...for making this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be too early to begin giving films headlines such as "One of the Best of the Year". After all, when movies like The Shaggy Dog and Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector can both crack and maintain their stays amongst top 10 weekly releases, you don't have to be Roger Ebert to realize (..or hope) that the best is yet to come.However, every once and a while, an earlier studio release catches the eye and maintains our interest throughout all the summer blockbusters and winter Oscar hopefuls. Crash did it last year and both The Silence of the Lambs and Gladiator were early out-of-the-gaters that etched a space in our frontal lobes long enough to have us remember it when the golden statues were being handed out almost a year after their release.Thank You For Smoking is one of those films. Based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Christopher Buckley Thank You For Smoking stars Aaron Eckhart as cigarette lobbyist Nick Naylor. Nick is probably the nicest guy that you could imagine working for an industry long fallen out of public favor. He has a sudden charm about him and coupled with his rugged good looks, you almost don't even seem to mind if he is twisting your words or making it so that the argument becomes so convoluted that you almost forget your first original thought.That makes Nick Naylor the perfect fit for Big Tobacco and his unique argumentative skills are showcased in the very first scene where he sits amongst a panel of anti-smokers and a young boy stricken with cancer on the Joan Lunden talk show. Before the first commercial break, he hasn't so much as turned the audience over to his way of thinking, but he has them thinking in a different direction and that, my friends, is what he gets paid to do.Thank You For Smoking is interesting in that although it makes its argument, the film uses the tobacco industry as a backdrop to tell the story of the struggles that Nick endures with family, with friends and with those that find him the most despicable person on the earth this side of Hitler.His family of note is an ex-wife to which still speaks cordially, but otherwise has split with amicably and his young son, Joey (Cameron Bright). Joey is at that age where he is curious about everything his father does, and his interest allows Nick to bring him on business trips where Joey has the opportunity to be mentored in argumentative studies.His friends are part of a self proclaimed MOD Squad (Merchants of Death) and consist of one pro-alcohol lobbyist (Maria Bello) and one pro-firearms representative (David Koechner). The three of them meet regularly and have intricately trivial and engaging conversations that include a provocative discussion on who represents the most worst product based on annual deaths in America.Complicating matters are Nick's enemies which come in the form of many faces. There is the horny newspaper journalist, Heather Holloway (the soon to be Mrs. Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes) who seems to be using all of her God given assets to get information from Naylor for her article. There is the Senator from Vermont, played wonderfully by William H. Macy that has as his personal goal to warn the American public about the poisons of Nick's product. And to round out the trio of Anti-Naylor's is the general public that includes mysterious men who one day kidnap Nick and riddle him so full of Nicotine that it puts his life in jeopardy.The supporting characters on both sides hit just the right notes to further Nick's ego and to allow us to be fascinated without being disgusted with Nick's line of business. Throw in Rob Lowe as a Hollywood hot shot that is negotiating with Nick to have Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones smoke after sex in a new Science Fiction film, Robert Duvall as the Captain of Big Tobacco and Sam Elliot as the elderly Malboro Man who is dying of lung cancer and is being paid for his silence. Each fascinating and how Nick deals with each persons situation, mesmerizing.Thank You For Smoking is not going to be a movie that will show up in the top five of the film grosser any week. It isn't a film that is going to command the presence of a hundred copies at your local DVD store. But what Thank You for Smoking is, is a fantastic character study about the life of someone that ultimately sells death. And he does it so well.www.robertsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" isn't especially meaty, and it likely won't give you much to chew on after viewing it, but as a funny, clever 90-minute diversion, you could do much worse.The chameleon actor Aaron Eckhart is perfect casting as a gifted spin doctor working on behalf of big tobacco companies. The film is effective in that it makes the motives of every other faction in the smoking debate (awareness groups, liberal campaigners, Hollywood, journalists) so questionable that you have no choice but to root for Eckhart's character, however morally repugnant you may find him to be. There is some validity in his arguments for speaking out for cigarette companies; after all, at some point American consumers have to take responsibility and conclude on their own that smoking is an awful habit. We can't allow brow-beating consumer awareness groups or agenda-pushing Democrats or scary labels stuck on cigarette packages to make up peoples' minds for them. If people, knowing everything they know about the dangers of smoking, are going to be stupid enough to continue supporting the cigarette industry, then why shouldn't corporations try to take advantage of that? After all, that's the American way; every company and politician does the same thing.This film is reminiscent of "Election" in its satirical tone and its style. If you liked that film, you'll probably like this one. A fine supporting cast is assembled, including Maria Bello, Katie Holmes, William H. Macy and an underused Robert Duvall. But the movie sticks pretty closely to Eckhart and doesn't give anyone else much to do. It's glib and superficial, but enjoyable.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mildly amusing if too "Filtered" satire on the Tobacco Industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, from its ironic title down to its cast has all the earmarks of an indie satire. The film hits it's target on occasion, but, to use a cigarette metaphor, its smoking with a very thick filter on. What Writer-Director Reitman had to do was to tear that filter off and go full out and inhale all the tar and nicotine he could handle.There are some fine bits (some no doubt taken from the book by Christopher Buckley) such as the "MOD" squad trio - Tobacco, Firearms and Alcohol (here played by Aaron Eckhart, David Koechner and Maria Bello respectively) and the way Nick Naylor (Eckhart) cons the original "Marlboro Man" (Sam Elliot) into taking a payoff.But, too often, the satire is too mild as if it were playing it safe, not wanting to take the chance that it risk going "too far". Indeed, the funniest bit in the film is a clip from an old John Wayne movie, not any of the original footage. And, may I ask, "Why is Katie Holmes an alleged 'Star'?" If the intent were to keep the film "believable" it falls short there as well. The film's big "revelation" that supposedly sandbags Nick Naylor's career is that the tobacco industry is lying to the public? THAT could hardly have been surprising even when the Surgeon General's report came out 40+ years ago. Part of the problem with the film is that moments like this "revelation" feel very passé. The book came out 12 years ago, and the public has simply too much on the ball to believe that the public would swallow Naylor's riffs so easily. Speaking of passé, having one of Naylor's big TV moments occur on the DENNIS MILLER SHOW dates it even further.In the end, I'd compare it to IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, which also starred Eckhart. Perhaps I was the only person who felt this way, but I found COMPANY OF MEN lacking because it wasn't offensive ENOUGH. The master of film satire, Billy Wilder knew how to skewer his subjects (find copies of THE BIG CARNIVAL or the criminally overlooked ONE, TWO, THREE). As a former Boston film critic and Film Professor, Nat Segaloff once told me about Wilder, "You know someONE, someWHERE is being offended by him (Wilder)". THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is Mild, when it needed to be more Wild.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Thank You For Smoking" is an interesting yet satirical look at freedom of choice in America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" is a movie based on a novel by the same name. Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) is a lobbyist for the Academy of Tobacco. His job is to spin the negative views and mindsets of smoking into a positive light. But when Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) wants to put a poison sticker on every carton of cigarettes, it's up to Nick to stop it. An interesting and funny movie ensues...I felt very indifferent when I walked out of "Thank You For Smoking" this evening. A part of me really enjoyed it yet another part wasn't sure what to think of it. One thing for certain is "Thank You for Smoking" is not for everyone. This movie is definitely one for people who enjoy thinking when they go to the movies. While the film is overall pretty predictable, the movie keeps the viewer interested and thinking. I can't remember a film in recent memory that actually do this as well as "Thank You For Smoking" does.Some say the subject matter in this film i.e. to smoke or not to smoke is equally weighed. I personally didn't feel that way at all. I felt the overall tone for the movie was geared toward smoking. Personally, I don't smoke but I don't mind that this film is for smoking. What I liked about the film is that it kept my brain going. And like I said majority of this film is predictable, but you do begin to question how free the rights of the American Public are? Should smoking be banned or should smokers have their rights too? Like stated in the film people know smoking is bad yet they still do it. Why? The movie puts a nice spin on the importance of information and looking at things from alternative views.The whole you can never lose if you know how to argue your point was also another part of the film I enjoyed. It's so interesting to see how many views in this country can be won over by just spinning a story and arguing your point. That's what this movie does very nicely. At the end of the movie, Nick says something that you would never think he would say yet he says it and still comes out on top. It's amazing how he was so good at spinning things around that even something he didn't think was a good thing to say turned out to be the right thing to say.It's nice to see Aaron Eckhart play a good solid role for once. I think his performance in this film was excellent and extremely believable. I think after this role we will be seeing him in more movies. William H. Macy also stars and shines yet again. Macy is one of the best actors in Hollywood who for years still never got the appreciation he deserves. Also Katie Holmes does a decent job although her character is extremely predictable. I personally think Holmes does a good job at playing bad girl roles like her role here and in "The Gift". The reason I think that is because she looks so innocent so when she comes out saying something like "I want to f*ck you, when I watch you on TV" it seems out of the ordinary for her. This is also probably another reason why Tom Cruise loves her; she's probably a very bad girl outside the public eye."Thank You For Smoking" is Jason Reitman's first feature film. He is son of famous film director Ivan Reitman. Jason's directing is one to keep an eye on. I feel as the time goes on he will become a very big director just like his father. Being that "Smoking" is his first film, I think he has already hit a home run. I think the guy has talent and as long as he keeps making good movies he will be just as big as his dad is someday.So in conclusion, I like the message behind "Thank You For Smoking" but not the overall subject matter of the film. This movie provides its audience with fine acting, a good script and some nice directing. The film's idea also keeps its audience thinking. It's a good movie to watch with someone and then have a nice long talk with about it afterwards. It's a satirical look at the smoking issue although I still feel it tilts more towards one side than the other. But at the end of the day, it's a good independent film which very few will be able to enjoy and appreciate.MovieManMenzel's final rating for "Thank You For Smoking" is a 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were head of an ethically challenged industry, you'd want Nick Naylor on your side, lobbying the holy crap out of everyone. Nick would have you believing your lung cancer has nothing to do with the industry he represents, Big Tobacco, and that the real issue here is the freedom of adults across America to choose what they want to choose, and isn't that worth fighting for? Nick (Aaron Eckhart) is so slick, he's able to accuse an antismoking advocate of hoping that lung-cancer patients die, because if they lived then he (the advocate) would see his budget slashed. Then he tells a shocked studio audience that his organization is launching a $50 million campaign to discourage kids from smoking. Slick and effective! When not spinning, spinning, and spinning, Nick commiserates with fellow spokespersons for industries of ill repute: Polly (Maria Bello), the liquor companies; and Bobby Jay (David Koechner), the gun companies. Together, they are...... the MOD Squad, wherein MOD stands for Merchants of Death. A little gallows humor is necessary when you peddle mortality.Anyway, the idea is that Nick must spin Smoking Is Good, from deriding "questionable" scientific studies that disagree with his premise to lobbying Hollywood for more product placement (that is, no more would cigarettes be held in movies only by Bad Guys or Europeans - the heroes would get them, too). Oh, and pay off the Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott, who's bitterly dying of cancer. And deal with a duplicitous boss (J. K. Simmons, who plays J. Jonah Jameson in the Spider-Man films). And be spirited about by the Head Honcho of Big Tabacka, The Captain (Robert Duvall).It's a lot for poor ol' Nick, but that's not all - he has to be a role model of sorts to his young son, who dotes upon him while living with his mom (and her boyfriend) in Nick's house, while Nick gets an apartment.But don't feel too bad for Nick, since he gets to shag nearly every female in the story. But not in the movie, since it's not a movie of infinite length. But then I'm comparing the movie to the book by Christopher Buckley, and that's not entirely fair.The problem with the movie is that it's wit, so wicked and sharp in the book, has been dulled a bit; it feels Hollywoodized, as if everything has to be Just So. As if it's okay to point and laugh at the absurdity of pimping for cigarettes from a distance, but not to get in close and snark at the details.The story also suffers from a shifted focus. In the book, Nick's relationship with his son was one of the lesser threads, but in the movie it's at the forefront. My guess is that the makers (including the director and writer, Jason Reitman) figured this would make the movie a better sell across various demographics. This is what happens when a plot gets Hollywoodized - it tries to appeal to too many people. Kind of odd for a movie that wasn't supposed to be a blockbuster, anyway.On the bright side, the casting is spot on, particularly Eckhart, who is aces in roles of dubious morality. Sure, he's an insufferable, randy cad, but he's not a nasty jerk, so we kind of root for him but deplore his intentions.Just about everyone else is a secondary character, except for Nick's son, Joey (Cameron Bright), and thankfully the young actor wasn't melodramatic or maudlin or hammy, or any of a number of thespianic maladies that affect novices. Point of fact, he was quite charming and convincing.Not so convincing was the often-miscast Mrs. Tom Cruise. How is it the Katie Holmes keeps getting grownup roles when she looks like she's about two years late for her high school reunion? (Side note: Holmes' character, a reporter, is described in the book and the movie as having nice breasts. This wasn't weird to see in the book, but it made no sense in the movie, as Holmes herself is, uh, lacking.) The bottom line is that Thank You misses the mark just a tad by way of a shift in plot focus and a dulling of sharp satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smoking is Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank you for smoking. A simple sentence, but one look at the final word and there you have the subversive nature of Jason Reitman's debut film which I had the chance to see Friday March 31 in New York City. As satire, it frolics in going after not only at the smoking industry, but those going after the smoking industry, those in the fringes, former smoking victims, reporters, et. al. No one is sacred and everyone is for grabs in Reitman's sharp screenplay that is closer to the sentiment of the 1970s and uses elements of rapid dialog reminiscent of the 1930s screwball comedy.Aaron Eckhart is again used to great measure to portray a character who has a moral black hole and an eager disposition to show just how black it is. Seeing how he is, early on, described -- his talking, handsome face sped up and the superimposed sound of a drill attacking cement -- you can see how aggressive he can be. His Nick Naylor is the ultimate lobbyist and will convince you, as he himself says, not that you are wrong, but he is right. And he makes no apologies when invited to a talk show. The only person who advocates smoking from the guest panel, he seems destined to lose, but God bless him, he smiles himself out of it and comes out with flying colors. He goes one step father at a lesser level when visiting his son John's school. A little girl tells him her mother is against smoking. Watch his response. You will, like John, recoil.But Nick's lobbying powers make him a god in his world. He cannot do wrong, he flies coach and mingles with the people (and induces them to smoke), and he's become the favorite of the tobacco czar (Robert Duvall) who is using his own money to bribe a former Marlboro man dying of cancer, played by Sam Neill, not to talk against the industry and to use the money for a charity. He's also trying to negotiate a smart move (against his bosses wishes) with a Hollywood super-agent (Rob Lowe) to re-introduce smoking in films because nowadays, only Europeans and psycho-villains smoke -- it's deglamorized Hollywood. They suggest bringing Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones in a movie about smoking in space. (Listen to them talk, and listen to how they would resolve the "minor" issue that smoking cannot be done in space.) He's also not in total control (even though he may think himself to be). In one hilarious sequence, he meets with a sexy female reporter (Katie Holmes), has voracious sex with her (against his better judgment and the warnings from his fellow lunch mates, both lobbyists for the alcohol and firearms industry), and spills so much information it's a wonder he's still alive and careers have not been ruined.The great thing about THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is that it doesn't play by Hollywood rules. Nick is a scapegoat waiting to be flogged by society into submission, and while certainly he gets his just desserts right after a key appearance on Dennis Miller's talk show in which he effectively trumps Vermont Senator Finistree (William H Macy), you would think he'd "see the light" and have a moral reversal, maybe even reconcile with his estranged wife and renounce lobbying for the tobacco industry. After all such a thing has happened in Hollywood tradition -- the Hays Code would not have permitted any other thing. Well one thing... he does leave lobbying. And wouldn't you know it, he bounces right back, in business, better than ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank You is a great film but it only weighs in at a paltry ninety odd minutes. The novel had so much other great material which was excluded. Almost everybody I know who has read the book remembers the nicotine patch episode, but they only allude to the campaign to reduce teen smoking, which was "everything your parents told you about smoking is right." I suppose the truth.com ads about blah blah smoking isn't stupid hit too close to life imitating art.Aaron Eckhart was fantastic as the smarmy spokesman for Big Tobacco, and William Macy outdid himself as the dim-witted Birkenstock wearing liberal senator who decorates his desk with jars of maple syrup, and who is on a crusade to expand the nanny state and make life safe for everybody -- even if that meant changing history.My only complaint was that I had to drive to God-forsaken Bethesda to see it in the white hot core of liberal lawyer hell. It should have gone to mass release from the get-go. It's as funny as a movie can be -- almost as many laughs as Airplane! This one is worth watching a couple of times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lobbyists represent everything that is wrong with our country. Instead of voting for the common good of the people, they are paid in voters and campaign contributions, to vote the way big business wishes them to vote. The result is laws that benefit the few and hurt the many. Thank You For Smoking takes an in depth look at one of these lobbyists, who works for big tobacco. In a satirical way, the film shows how this man is able to achieve his companies goals through bending the facts, bribery, and out right lying in a way that is completely legal under our system of government. Aaron Eckhart is terrific, which will come as little surprise to many, however the film was anything but. Like most films, Thank You For Smoking has it's moments, but overall the film is one short scene that just repeats it's self over and over again. The situations are different and the players are different, but the arguments and agendas are always the same. After watching two hours of the same thing over and over again, I was more than done with this film. No matter how charismatic the actor may be, the fact is that what lobbyists do isn't terribly interesting. It's one meeting and argument after another and the film just completely runs around in circles. The film was critically acclaimed for Eckhart's performance, but nothing else. Some critics think that one outstanding performance makes a film worth seeing, but I don't. Aaron Eckhart is an outstanding actor, who has been great in many other films that are worth seeing. Thank You For Smoking is nothing more than an insult to the American people, that runs forty minutes too long, and just goes around in circles, it's not something I'd recommend wasting your time on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie paints a good picture of what the smoking industry and anti-smoking activists are probably like, and doesn't feed us bullshit. When it comes right down to it, it's a person's own choice whether or not they want to smoke, and while the smoking industry may use shady marketing tactics, every industry out there uses propaganda to get people to buy their product. There's two sides to every argument, and regardless of how you feel about tobacco it's going to be somebody's job to defend it and somebody's job to cut it down.Intelligent, witty, hilarious, and...is that even a hint of sarcasm I sense?

		<fullReview>A film about moral flexibility fits well into our modern day society, because that's what you need if you work in many of the companies. That's what you need, if you go shopping with a limited amount of money. That's what you need, if you get into your car and drive around. And that's also what Nick Naylor (played by Aaron Eckhart) needs, if he plans to continue working for smoking and cell phone companies. "Thank You for Smoking" definitely has some biting lines in it (I love the meetings with the alcohol and firearm industry lobbyists), but also the film is blessed with a pinch of moral flexibility by almost not showing one single cigarette throughout the whole movie (to make it more children-friendly, I guess). I also just don't buy, that Katie Holmes (Katie Holmes!) should be smart and seductive enough to lure out all secrets of an unscrupulous business man like Naylor. All in all it's a nice and funny comedy, but not really a satire.</fullReview>

This kind of movie is very rare, not for the subject handled, but for the witty way such a serious topic may be recounted, so that the plot finally turns into an astute comedy, certainly able to make adults laugh. Aaron Eckart doesn't go off the path, Maria Bello is expressing and convincing. I would watch "Thank you for smoking" if I were a chronic smoker, but I did appreciate it though, not being a smoker. Anyway many people should recognize themselves as the object/aim of the motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film about the inner workings of the tobacco spin game was long overdue. Just think of the comic potential of a story starring a man with the ridiculous task of sticking up for a product as despised as it is deadly. While it is a biting satire that scores high marks for originality, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING never quite lives up to its promise.The biggest fault of THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is that it tries too hard to be sharp. The genuinely hilarious moments, such as when Aaron Eckhart's tobacco spokesman chiding a little girl's mother for speaking the truth about smokes, are much more random than the scenes that fall flat. In an effort to make every bit of dialog witty and original, the writers sacrificed quality for quantity. The end result is empty and, for the most part, unsatisfying. However, the wonderful comic performances of lead Aaron Eckhart and his nemesis William H. Macy help elevate the picture over its weaker moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Streamlined satire of noteworthy proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Biting, constantly engaging lung-black comedy burns away it's 92 minutes without hardly skipping a beat. Young Jason Reitman, adapting the cult novel of the same name, clearly steps out of the shadows of being daddy's boy on his first feature film with this blistering, anti-pc movie. The film centers around Aaron Eckhart (in his first truly noteworthy lead) who plays the man society loves to hate. Nick Naylor is the number one lobbyist for big tobacco, essentially who's job requirements include nothing but spinning grey areas around the "facts" dealing with cigarette related deaths. In a world where everyone wants to play the blame game, Naylor is high on the list of enemies of the public, and must always be thinking on his feet to defend himself from the wildest of accusations. Taking this brilliant character premise, Reitman deftly articulates many of the finer hypocrisies underlying any such moral crusades anti-smoking authorities feel the need to exercises to the people at big tobacco. Anyone who does not relish a black or white reality will be pleased as punch, with mile-wide grins to boot, at how this delicate subject matter was intelligently and unapologetically handled in order to portray the most truthful resonance. Jason Reitman could not have asked for a better debut. The direction is focused, brisk and supremely entertaining, while the impressive supporting cast all make it work for this film's unique tone. Despite the brief lapses into snootyville with it's extra dosages of sarcasm, the movie really does remain a balanced affair and will undoubtedly become one of the year's greatest satires.</fullReview>

It simply bring you the essence of those reports from industrial research agencies full of craps.

And continue with "If you cannot prove me wrong then I m right." Of course we cannot retort since we are not those nerds who spent entire life in lab proving smoking can cause lung cancer. If we think this way, there is nothing right existing in this world. so this movie is telling you a story of how the industry uses different tool to conduct your way of thinking.Good movie~ It make fun of media, tobacco, alcohol, weapon industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>smart satirical comedy on hypocritical politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank You For Smoking is a smart satirical comedy about lobbyist named Nick Naylor who plots and speaks on behalf of a big cigarette company while trying to remain a model for his twelve-year-old son. The film is a Jason Reitman's awaited debut featuring talented well-known actors. Thank You For Smoking contains numerous accurate perceptions concerning hypocritical political environment. The pic goes even further and viewers learn what machinations politics use in order to accomplish their frequently dishonorable aims. The script is cleverly-written and the dialogue is witty and relevant. Another advantage of the film is good, convincing acting from Aaron Eckhart. Without him, the movie would probably lost most of its charm. Good performances are provided also by David Koechner and William H. Macy in supporting roles. On the other side, the flick is at some points too sweet and trifling. As a result, it lacks not only the intensity, but also memorable scenes. What's more, this movie is only moderately funny, which is the biggest shortcoming. All in all, Thank You For Smoking is an excellent satire, but slightly fails as a laughable comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, intellectually exuberant, morally ambivalent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was so enjoyable, so quick and clever in terms of dialogue, casting, god, even locations, that the subject matter somehow gets lost along the way in the Mephistophlean "yipee, what the hell" of it all.They say that the devil has the best tunes, and this movie proves that he also has all the best one-liners. And suits. And arguments. Because essentially, the message is that "the right thing" (for example, doing something about the millions that smoking kills globally each year) is something for stuffy squares, health-bores and crypto-fascists. The latter category is typified by William H. Macy's character, a Senator from Vermont who leads the campaign against big tobacco, and at the end of the film is seen explaining why it's necessary to digitally rework cinema classics to remove the cigarettes from the hands of stars like Bogart, Dietrich and Bergman. He rationalises the action by saying that this is a way of "improving the past". By contrast the movie's hero, Nick Naylor, comes back from being down on the ropes to vindicate himself before a Senate Committee, and goes on to front his own successful consultancy. I can't fault this film as a piece of cinema, and I enjoyed it immensely, from the stunning title sequence to the very end. I'd also agree that satire is a legitimate rhetorical framework for examine serious topics (see Lord of War for more here).But whereas "Lord of War " offers a global vision of the arms business (and its horrendous consequences), "Thank you for Smoking" only skims the surface of the suffering, with the jokey "cancer boy" and the wacko Marlboro man. Make no mistake - I'm not expecting any kind of moral insight on the part of the protagonist (in "Lord of War", Nicolas Cage also completely fails to understand why his actions are wrong) but I think this would have been a stronger work if the joyful world of Washington spin had been accompanied by a deeper exploration of what smoking does to people every day.</fullReview>

Young Jason Reitmann, son of Ivan of Ghostbusters fame has pleased family friends and multiplex customers with a sharp take on the morally 'flexible' world of spin, sin and consumer media. Possibly with a bit too much swearing diluting and distracting both the message and the cleverness of Jason's gen X pen, SMOKING has hilarious and visually witty credits and a great use of some gramophone hits of the 40s underlining its 2006 TV satire targets. the Hoagy Carmichael Cigarette Song "Have another Cigarette" is used on these opening credits and that alone sets the tone for a well researched and creatively aimed cough in the face of spin doctors and ciggy sellers.... gun honchos, hamburger merchants and alcohol lobby each get a serve. Handsome blond Cary Grant style Eckhart is perfectly cast as the amoral 'hero' with William H Macy his well turned frustrated exec as the Cheese Senator from Vermont. A film to be proud of Jason!.

		<fullReview>Lobbyist for the tobacco company Big Tobacco, Nick Naylor isn't morally bankrupt, but morally flexible. Nick's job is to keep America and the world smoking. Fanastic at his job, Nick is a words smith, spinning the truth and facts to his own needs; you're never wrong if you can argue right, and Nick is never wrong. Part of the M.O.D. squad, Nick and his friends; Polly Bailey, Lobbyist for alcohol and Bobby Jay Bliss, Lobbyist for firearms, they all protect and keep their companies running, at the plight of all the activist against them.Thank You for Smoking is a satirical spin on the tobacco industry, based upon Christopher Buckley novel. The depths and avenues taken by Nick and his boss B.R. have such a moral corruption. 1200 people die from smoking and Nick is proud of this achievement. There is a great cultural and modern relevance to the concepts and arguments with Thank You for Smoking. People are looking for an escape goat to blame, though director Jason Reitman shows it's our own decisions we need to look at.Right from the get go, Thank You for Smoking shows this no simple satire. Nick appears on a talk show panel of anti smoking companies and a boy dying of cancer and a crowd booing and spitting at him. Yet Nick spins everything and has the crowd cheering him and cancer boy agreeing with him. The satire is so forked tongued and the wit runs like a chain smoker.The flip side of Thank You for Smoking is its equal ground for both sides. While the tobacco industry is shown evil, yet it runs just like any other company; ie alcohol and firearms, with fast food also not left alone either, selling its product to it's consumers. Government bodies trying to ban smoking and placing disturbing pictures on cigarette packets, show their fascist tendencies. The big picture to Thank You for Smoking is peoples given right to freedom of choice and the end dollar lies in the individuals choice.Finally showing some talent and growing as an actor, Aaron Eckhart is outstanding as Nick. Eckhart shows a great balance between Nick's amoral and moral tendencies, and coolly spinning every arguments in his favour. Maria Bello and David Koechner and great as M.O.D. squad members Polly and Bobby. William H. Macy is amazing as always. Adam Brody and Katie Holmes don't compare yet add fun in this stellar cast.It's a 16mg hit of witty and extremely humorous satire.</fullReview>

For some reason the latter only dawns upon you at the end when Nick moves on to coaching the mobile phone market. However, bringing his son into the equation,in such an uncomfortable yet inevitable way, seems not only dangerous and contentious, but goes on to make this a truly fine display of debating one of the many moral dilemmas we all face today. It is also mighty refreshing to see a director take on such a challenge and execute it brilliantly to encompass all of the above, while making you laugh and also show how we are all prone to being derailed by spin from time to time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this film for a long time and on a flight to London, I finally got to see it and it was worth the wait. This movie is funny, smart, and entertaining. Let's face it, we all know smoking is bad for you just as too much alcohol or anything else. I have never smoked but I know a lot of smokers. They started smoking because they choose too and now they are addictive. Of course, smoking was once hip in the 1950s. My father smoked and probably would have lived longer if he didn't at all but what's done is done. You can't blame the cigarette industry for people lighting up and smoking. There are few places left that they can smoke. Aaron Eckhart does an excellent job in making us feel for the tobacco lobbyist Nick Nailer. He plays devil's advocate. I found Katie Holmes believable as the reporter who would do anything to get a story. I love Maria Bello playing the alcohol lobbyist and that guy from Saturday Night Live playing the firearms lobbyist. The three call themselves the Merchants of Death Squad while lobbying for their causes in Washington D.C. Marianne M. who plays Nick's son's school teacher has a small but worthy role. Sam Elliott who I always mistake for Sam Shepard is the retired Marlboro man in this film suffering from lung cancer. William H. Macy has a great role as the Vermont Senator. Wait until you see what his character wants to do with old films portraying smokers. It's unthinkable. Anyway, the film is just too short in my opinion but the director is the son of Hollywood Director, Ivan Reitman, his name is Jason Reitman. His father directed films like Twins and Junior with Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenneger. For his debut as director, Jason Reitman will probably win an Oscar before his own father.</fullReview>

I have yet to see a movie with a better story and with this great a pace (truely an excellent producer and great writers.)3. As mentioned before it doesn't take sides which is great for all those who simply cannot grasp that a movie is allowed to take sides and end up ruining the movie for everyone because they complain (and loudly I might add) throughout the entire movie.

		<fullReview>More than attacking either side of the tobacco debate too viscously, this film lampoons how our modern society and government often operates and how superficially people are swayed: sound bites rather than substance, demonizing those of the opposing view, statistics and research findings twisted and spun until data fits the agenda, doesn't matter if your statements are truthful just make the other guy look more wrong and most important of all in American life: justify whatever you do as worthwhile as long as it pays the mortgage! The film is smart and searing in a curious, undercurrent way and creates a bleak atmosphere that overshadows the dark comedy. I couldn't help wondering if those in the audience laughing the loudest were the ones who most identified with these characters and were laughing out as a defense mechanism. It has become an increasingly complicated, conflicted society that often makes many seemingly paradoxical demands on it's members and as people struggle for survival, which in America means: "paying the bills" we have become adrift and comical in the way we justify the means by which we meet that end and in the ways we try to influence social change. Sort of childish in the sense that we'll lie, cheat and steal and go to untruthful extremes and feel justified as long as it gets more people to agree with our view than the opposing one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smoke and Mirrors - But No Fire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A satirical look at the life of a pro-tobacco industry lobbyist.Like The Truman Show and Fight Club this is a movie that attempts to engage the audience at the level of ideas. And, like these two movies, it starts with a great premise and full of energy but then fails to maintain the pitch and fudges an opportunity. I agree with those commentators who say it is not really all that satirical - more of a satirical comedy. There are lots of funny moments so it is highly enjoyable and well worth the price of admission.But I wasn't entirely convinced by the crowbar plot moves of both the seduction and the kidnapping. Had the movie relied solely on its wit and language it might have retained much more bite. I could see the point of the like-father-like-son device as a necessary foil for the value-free ethical standpoint of the protagonist, but by the end it seemed that the movie fell back on that old US standby of asserting family values which compromised the satirical intent.Smoking isn't really the point of the movie. Indeed, the best scenes for me were the meetings of the MOD Squad - a group of highly competitive sophists who compete to defend the currently indefensible. These scenes are a compelling and witty illustration of the underlying theme of the movie which is the subversive power of words and rational argumentation to support the most untenable of positions. The triumph is in making the Nick Naylor character a hero and that has everything to do with Aaron Eckhardt's superb performance. Instead of a pantomime villain, it seems that it is he who is a bastion of individual liberty in contemporary democracy. That's the satire - but it is not unsettling in the way that characters such as, say, Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver and Rupert Pupkin in King of Comedy succeed in the end. And significantly, you wont see anyone actually smoking in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can't thank enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick is guy who sincerely believed smoking is a personal, informed choice and that everyone deserves to be given their fair share of slate to voice out their opinion. The underlying message of this movie is serious, that smoking kills, so is laughing at it distasteful? It will be, only if you have no sense of humor.That aside, a lot of the arguments (a lot of it in this movie) are very much valid, either you like it or not. That balanced out the humor and serious side of the topic - smoking.I knew it was kind of a comedy but I didn't expect it to be this entertaining. A movie that tickles you hard simply by dialogues and facial expression is priceless. There isn't a single character that I can find fault with. Aaron, as a guy with no sense of guilt for believing in his principal is simply perfect for the role of Nick. The rest of the big guns worked their role well too. The pace was alright, where you would not think that there is a good time to go ease yourself. Seriously, I can't thank enough that someone made this movie.If you like Snatch, this is a must to watch</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aaron Eckhart delivers an amazing performance as the gleefully obnoxious tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor. He is so convincing, in fact, that you can actually feel yourself being manipulated by his character's scripted wiles. As for his supporting cast, they fits their roles admirably, knowing not to interfere. No complaints about casting. Unfortunately, this film falls well short of its satirical aim. There are plenty of deserving targets in the debate over smoking, and "Thank You..." takes on all of them, just not very effectively. I don't know if its the outlandish premise of the film or something else entirely, but something about it rings hollow. On final review: mildly amusing, generally harmless, goofball satire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>satire of the lobbying industry - main character is a lobbyist for the tobacco industry, is very successful at what he does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe the movie did not go far enough into the dark humor or true satire, such as "Dr Strangelove", for example. It would have been much more effective and powerful if the issues were taken to fantastical ends...otherwise it remained mildly entertaining rather than really original and topical. The the MOD squad is well put together, eery and funny. The lead character is appropriately smooth and, like a true con man, trustworthy. The Katie Holmes character is too lightweight - literally and figuratively. It is hard to believe that professional, jaded DC lobbyists would fall for such a bimbo. She should have been a Katherine, like Kate Winslet or Katharine Hepburn investigative journalist, not a cute Katie. Hard to believe plot twists - not frightening, not deep enough</fullReview>

I watched the movie yesterday and I really enjoyed it, it was quite funny and it also makes you think about the issue.**POSSIBLE SPOILER*** What it came down to was would you make something harmful illegal or would you let each person make that choice for themselves.

		<shortDescription>Who's Afraid of Big Tobacco?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank You for Smoking is an excellent film. I was thoroughly impressed at the quality of the film and the excellent screenplay. It was a hysterical look at the debate over tobacco and how crazy people can be. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the main character Nick Naylor, who is faced with death threats and constant attacks from anti-smoking Nazis. His efforts to downplay the harmful effects of smoking are funny as he twists the facts to fit his message; all while trying to raise his son successfully. His main struggle in the film is with the typical Democrat senator who is trying to put over-sized death stickers on cigarette packages. Naylor is going to testify in front of the Senate on behalf of the tobacco company. The story follows the events leading up to the hearing, including an affair with a reporter who is doing a story about him. The main message of the film, I think, is that there are crazy people on both sides of the issue of smoking, and it also shows that the tobacco companies are not Satanic organizations bent on killing people as many would have us believe. It is mostly the story of a man trying to be successful and raise his son, like most other people; only he is mostly hated by everyone around him. It is one of the best movies of the year. It is certain to win some awards in the near future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Smart, Funny, Delightful Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read the book and would like to say that this is one of the best books I have read in God knows when. The main character Nick is often compared to Satan. The mans wit and humorous comments and politically incorrect facts makes him even more likable. Nick is a spokesperson for Big Tobacco while trying to remain a role model for his 12 year old son. William H. Macy, Robert Duvall, Katie Holmes and Adrien Brody co-star in this hilarious comedy directed by Jason Reitman based on the book with the same title by Christopher Buckley. The most interesting part in the whole movie is how not one cigarette is shown being smoked in the whole movie. This film was the most popular and probably the best at this years Sundance Film Festival. Jason Reitman is an upcoming film director with a lot of potential as shown in this film. Thank You For Smoking gets 2 big thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Smoking' is a Breath of Fresh Air</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Christopher Buckley's novel, Thank You for Smoking is a wickedly funny (and awfully realistic) look at the hypocrisy and corruption engulfing all angles of the political system.Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), the self-proclaimed "Colonel Sanders of Nicotine," makes a living as the smug, smooth-talking mouthpiece for an industry you probably either love or hate: Big Tobacco.So, when liberal "The great state of Vermont will not apologize for its cheese!" Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre (William H. Macy) aims to take on the tobacco corporation by placing poison labels (complete with skull and crossbones) on cigarette packages, Naylor is called into action. Nick's job is to spin you into believing his words?and he's very good at his job.Smoking is a display of how to make political incorrectness, for the lack of a better term, correct. Example: Nick's the tobacco representative in the MOD Squad ('Merchants of Death'), along with the lobbyists for the alcohol (Maria Bello) and firearms (David Koechner) industries?who meet to discuss tactics for dealing with critics and argue over who's a more likely target of terrorists by comparing death tolls.Twisted, you say? That's what's great about dark comedies and satires?cleverness allows you to cross lines, address real issues from a 'radical' yet truthful angle and get away unscathed.Writer-director Jason Reitman's deliciously satirical script blends together the perfect amounts of parody, ridiculousness, honesty and humanity to create a sharp-witted stab at all players in Washington D.C. At times some might think it to be unscrupulous, but then again, how would you describe current politics? Exactly.While the dialogue is the true star of the film, the exceptional all-star cast makes it shine.Eckhart brings just enough sympathy to Nick Naylor, someone most would deem completely despicable in every sense of the word. Specifically, it's the love for his son (Cameron Bright) combined with his own take on what he actually does for a living that bring him into a more relatable realm.Macy's portrayal of a cure-the-world senator is particularly refreshing in his eerily authentic delivery. The wholly under-appreciated J.K. Simmons (Spider-Man, "The Closer") is in his element as Nick's boss B.R.?he has some of the best lines in the film.Anchored by these outstanding performances by Eckhart, Macy and Simmons, the cast of Thank You for Smoking could not be more right on. The film boasts strong supporting showings by Rob Lowe, the ubiquitous Cameron Bright, and a surprisingly good Adam Brody as Lowe's suck-up assistant. Not to mention well-executed appearances by cinematic institutions Robert Duvall and Sam Elliot. Even pre-pregnancy Katie Holmes is respectable in her role as a tempting journalist trying to get a juicy story.Caressed by a soundtrack of vintage smoking tunes, Smoking is a fresh look at the outrageous amounts of spin on all sides of American politics that is spiraling out of control. As much as I feed off satire?it is what helps me survive in a world of who-can-you-trust-to-tell-you-the-truth?I believe it is a travesty that now satire is more accurate than what we are told by politicians and media pundits.With an outstanding cast, piercingly perfect dialogue and a message more true than satirized, Thank You for Smoking is a political dark comedy not to be missed. Do yourself, your livelihood and your sanity a favor: inhale deeply, exhale slowly, as such a well-done commentary won't come again soon.3? out of 4 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was an excellent movie. It was funny and smart. It had an excellent cast and was very well written. I love all the little stabs it takes at the ignorant people of America, and just generally the world. People are always complaining about things like tobacco, alcohol, and firearms, but those are the things that are country was founded and built from. The people we are attacking are the people we depend on. Everyone just needs to open there eyes and see the world for what it really is. Maybe then we could start to change things for the better. All in all I really enjoyed the message of this movie. Not to mention the fact that it was hilarious and very entertaining aside from the message of it.

		<fullReview>Thank You For Smoking: A movie that should most obviously cause some controversy... Why? Because it spits the truth in your face and laughs about it. This movie is one of few movies in recent years that tells the entire truth of organizations and the way they work nowadays.Aaron Eckhart is excellently casted as the over-cocky spokesman/vice-president of The Tobacco Studies (that's not the entire name) organization. He disrespects you and makes you feel like a dumb-ass in front of the people you are trying to protect. He feeds BS to the world watching him. He goes home and bangs a hot reporter in his high-class apartment. What a life.Thank You For Smoking is hilarious in it's own right with lines like "Bang your brains against the desk until something useful comes out" and shots of Rob Lowe in an Asian kimono. This satire shows us what it really takes to be the most hated and loved man in America. Promoting cigarettes? Why? To make money! Duh! It's to sucker those who were born to be suckered. Watch this movie with an open mind, non-controversial thoughts, and a mood for laughter.I only felt that at some points the movie slowed down a little too much and bored me some, but then again it quickly would pick up the pace when Aaron spits some of his wittiest speeches. Definitely Mr. Eckhart's best performance and worth a watch, at least on DVD if you're the cheapy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank you for smoking follows Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) through his eventful career as Big Tobacco's chief spokesman and lobbyist. The plot is essentially about how he distorts and manipulates the real truth about cigarettes while all the time remaining a role model for his 12 year old son. Nick Naylor essentially has no real friends except two other like-minded spin doctors (David Koechner and Maria Bello) who are in the same business of fact distortion and public misinformation. Through their meetings we get an idea of the turmoil and moral quandaries the trio encounter and there ability to deal with the conflict is all too amusing and entertaining. His nemeses Senator Ortolan K. Finistirre (Willaim H Macy) is head of the anti smoking lobby and his futile attempts to smear Nick Nailers spin-doctor routine is what fuels most of the best exchanges. This is perfect material for a good satire and its laid on think and fast with double entente, metaphor and a heavy dose of irony thrown in for good measure. For the most part it works. The script has enough wit and original ideas to keep your interest.In one particular scene he tries to explain to his son in simple terms what exactly he does for a living by using the analogy of the ice cream his son is enjoying during his day trip. He asks his son to prove why his flavor of ice cream is more enjoyable than his Dads. His answer finally appeases the viewers curiosity after almost an hour into the story giving us a glimpse of the reasons behind his actions in a very entertaining fashion while at the same time giving his son a valuable moral lesson on right and wrong. The cast is impressive with Eckhart playing the nice guy protagonist with ease. Willaim H. Macy has a couple of good one liners but Jeff Megallis (Rob Lowe), a Hollywood big wig - is a scene stealer. Katie Holmes is just OK as the reporter and Cameron Bright as the son seemed at odds with some of the more well written lines. His dialog seemed inappropriate but didn't correlate to the mind set of a 13 year old boy. There a few noteworthy scenes after this with the kidnapping scene involving an anti smoking group one to admire. However the court room scenario at the end didn't work for me and lacked the humor and wit that carried earlier exchanges. I hoped the ending would provide some catchy tie-up or amusing anecdote to transcend what was conveyed earlier on but the final scenes seemed hackneyed and failed to continue the good momentum it built up earlier on. An entertaining satire let down by an average ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just viewed the DVD of this film &amp; no doubt this is the best comedy of 2005. As the 150th film I have reviewed on IMDb, this is the best of the newer films I have seen in a long time. It is so brilliant that most audiences who missed it should make an effort to see it now.The film has much more than smoking/anti-smoking. It has a simple message about being a parent (father) which everyone can understand. Then it has a much more complex message about how the media spins the public in the directions it wants the public to go. A perfect example of this spin is any President/Political campaign. Satan could run for office in the US and if they media helped him, he'd win. Then it has an even more complex message about the absurdity of Political Correctness.The film has even more messages, but these main three make the film much better than most films being put out now. The cast is brilliant in all aspects of the film. After watching the deleted scenes, I'd say the editing was brilliant as none of the deleted scenes were needed in the film.An old saying used to say that Satire usually dies late on Saturday Night Live- which has been very true on NBC the last few years. If that is the case, this film was made while satire was still biting &amp; on the mark. This film is the most under rated film I have seen from films since the year 2000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this. What a fantastic, funny and superbly acted satire on the concepts of truth and social responsibility. Its strength lies in its staunch refusal to take sides, or lapse into some personal agenda, while still managing to deliver a very strong message about the nature of truth and the way it can be abused by ANYBODY. There are no cut and dry human heroes or villains in this piece (with the exception of William H Macy's character, perhaps) - the hero is freedom of choice, and the ability to pick through the infinite layers of bullsh*t and information which saturate us every day. It shows how people themselves become nothing but symbols for greater agendas, and that the the only real truth is the one which we choose for ourselves. Absolutely brilliant stuff.

		<fullReview>This was the classic satire film. Now, I felt that the film was inspired by Dr. Strangelove. I know, I know, the two were not that similar, but there was something about the humor, that made me feel that this film was sending a silent homage. There is only one REAL problem that I had with the film, and it's a problem that I've seen a lot lately. Katie Holmes is NOT drop dead gorgeous! She's not even hot by high school standards! OK, she's not grotesque, but when a script reads for a drop dead gorgeous reporter, thats what we need. No, not to ogle them, but to make the movie believable. Holmes appears to be Eckarts daughter, not the reporter that makes him ***SPOILER*** (Spill his secrets, and ruin his career)***End SPOILER*** This was simply not believable. And this is a problem is some of todays movies. It's a problem, the same way, you wouldn't cast a supermodel, as a homeless beggar. And no, its not just about MY taste in women, I could care less if there are any bombshells in a movie....UNLESS the Bombshell, being a Bombshell is relevant to the plot. (For the record, my 2nd most distracting "model being ugly" is Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, for crying out loud she's a supermodel in the comic, not KIRSTEN DUNST, sure, while SOME men MIGHT POSSIBLY find her attractive, she is NOT by conventional standards (like Holmes) a bombshell) Now, let me get back to the movie, which was phenomenal, my favorite, was the gentleman who played the Firearms guy, and Rob Lowe, as a Hollywood Superagent. Arron Eckart was great, and very believable, and the movie is hilarious (and important) from start to finish. Now about Katie Holmes........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was sometimes funny, sometimes scary, and sometimes, it made me angry. However, it was never boring. It's the story of Nick Naylor, the vice president of the Tobacco Research Institute. This is a cigarette-company funded place to reinforce the idea that "there's no direct link between smoking and health problems." In other words, it's filled with double-talk and loads of lies, but it is an insider's look at how Washington works. The M.O.D. scenes were entertaining. Nick is an expert at double talk and has very little to redeem him in the beginning. Gradually, one discovers he's not as evil as he seemed to be at first.

		<fullReview>"Thank You For Smoking" is the movie adaptation based on Christopher Buckley's clever satire on the tobacco industry. The main character, Nick Naylor (plyed by Aaron Eckhart), is a tobacco lobbyist and spin doctor extraordinaire. He knows people hate him for representing a product known to kill thousands. But he has the good looks and charm to win people over. The movie is just as clever as the book, and filled with memorable characters: Rob Lowe as Hollywood super-agent Jeff Megall; Robert Duvall as tobacco baron "The Captain"; and William H. Macy as Senator Finistirre, the politico on an anti-cigarette crusade. The story makes you laugh, but also opens your eyes to the tobacco industry, showing you how they work to attract new smokers. You might even find yourself sympathizing with characters you ordinarily wouldn't like. That just proves the power of spin doctoring!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a worthy comedy of 2006. Pretty much every comedy that came up this year was pure crap, then comes along the new indie comedy 'Thank You For Smoking' with a stellar ensemble cast surrounding the upsides of the Tobacco industry. It's pure satire, and it's pure comic gold. 'Thank You For Smoking' isn't a great movie, however, it's very good and the best comedy of 2006 thus far.Aaron Eckhart plays a man many people refer to as the devil in the flesh -- a tobacco lobbyist. His job consists of lying and persuading the general public to use a substance that when used as intended kills. Eckhart is flawless in his role as the smart-ass, money-hungry, bullshitter. Having previously wowed critics, some audiences and myself alike with his stunning and captivating performance as a misogynistic businessman in 'In the Company of Men', Eckhart revives some of that feeling in this character. The rest of the cast is perfect in their roles including Rob Lowe as a cutthroat Hollywood executive who only sleeps on Sundays, William H. Macy as the pansy governor of Vermont, Maria Bello and David Koechner as the alcohol and firearms lobbyists who are Eckhart's best friends in the film, Adam Brody as the despise-able kiss-ass assistant and of course, veteran film actor Robert Duvall as Eckhart's hardened boss / father figure who is practically in love with nicotine.Jason Reitman provides a slick script, with possibly too many funny one-liners, and he does a so-so job directing. The story is enthralling during the first hour, but loses some of it's initial magic during the final half-hour. 'Thank You For Smoking' is a swift kick in the nuts for Hollywood providing foul-mouthed, morally corrupt entertainment as an alternative to the soft PG-13 comedies Hollywood seems to produce in droves. I recommend 'Thank You For Smoking' if you are looking to laugh and won't take it seriously. Grade: B (*** 1/2 out of ****. Screened at Harkins Camelview 5, Scottsdale, Arizona)</fullReview>

Nick quickly turns on the spin , and soon has everyone wondering , what all the fuss is about . Cleverly written , and always glib, Jason Reitman, Ivan's son, keeps the film on track, and carefully combines all of the elements , that reinforce the Masters of Spin are everywhere you will find the BIG money .From the weekly meeting with the Merchants of Death, friends of Nick's, who discuss the problems they incur because of the nature of work they lobby for , Alcohol, Tobacco , Firearms , to his ambition to get product placements in movies , Nick in always on the move.Sub-Plot,Nick's son,Joey(Cameron Bright), feeling the pains of a joint custody,wants to spend more time bonding with his father, and soon learns that spinning is the only way to achieve it .From traveling across the country with Dad, to help him convince the extremely ill Marlboro Man(Sam Elliot) not to sue, offering him a suitcase of CASH, Joey finds that spin is EVERWHERE .Nick reveals all of his secrets to an ambitious reporter Heather Holloway(Katie Holmes) who LITERALLY screws the truth from him about his life and the objectives he has planned .Well, the movie really gets complicated , with EVERYONE , playing their games , for an all out WAR of Spin.J.K. Simmons is GREAT as Nick's Boss, who takes all the credit, none of the blame . Sen Finistirre (William H. Macy) is the anti-thesis of Nick , yet , the line is blurred , who is the good guy ???In the climactic scene at the subcommittee hearing , is where the movie does not deliver at the moment of truth, I would assume because of all the spin, one has been deluged, maybe the truth becomes diluted, and the viewer desensitized, see what you think, other than that , the film is a GREAT American Work of Satire. And that is what makes this movie GREAT . People who challenge the facts, and question what is TRUTH or FICTION ?Performances by Robert Duvall, Maria Bello, Rob Lowe,and David Koechner, all add to a Terrific Time , and a look at today's world .After laughing , you'll be asking yourself, what is happening ?</fullReview>

I was also disappointed that they changed parts of it.First, no mention of the FBI investigation against him after the kidnapping. He also blamed this on the Senator. It may have been nice to see him under stress.Another thing was that he had not been fired previous to the hearing by the Senator. He was still employed in the book at that time.Third off, the ending. At the end of the book, he was on Larry King promoting a book. In the movie, he starts his own consulting firm. Also, more member to the M.O.D. (Merchants of Death) Squad. What was that.I sorry, I may have enjoyed the movie, but I enjoyed the book a little more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Funny Political Satire But With Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" is the funniest political satire since "Wag the Dog". Amidst uproariously salty language, some of the humor is broad (a gun-laden NRA-type going through security) and some hits familiar targets (a creatively profiteering Hollywood agent), it has unusual heart in Aaron Eckhart's portrayal of tobacco lobbyist "Nick Naylor". His lobbyist is just a guy who does his job and does it well - within the bounds of democratic capitalism he provides equal time within the court of public opinion for a legal product. Rather than doing the politician's trick of not answering the question asked but what he wants asked, his specialty is "I talk." His delivery adds a wry touch to the usually over-used voice-over narration.What helps to create the personal touch (and more than Eckhart gets in how Neil LaBute has used his rugged handsomeness) is his continuing effort to connect with his estranged son, a relationship, according to an interview with the creative and production team on "Charlie Rose", that writer/director Jason Reitman added and was not in Christopher Buckley's original novel which only had him referred to in a single line: "What would your son think?". For once, Cameron Bright's old head on young shoulders works in a non-spooky context, as his dad brings him along on business trips for their bonding potential.While William H. Macy's senator seems a bit too easily flummoxed in a debate for an experienced politician, even one from Vermont, Maria Bello shines as the alcoholic member of the very funny Merchants of Death who exchange tips on making tobacco, liquor and firearms more palatable (and who at the end are joined by an amusing array of co-conspirators). J.K. Simmons does a more hard-driving take on his "Spider-Man" boss. Robert Duvall's last of a dying breed of entrepreneurial captains of industry is more than a little stereotyped. Katie Holmes plays the sweet card well enough as an ambitious reporter (the more pumping than revealing sex scene that was accidentally left out at Sundance is more about the dialog than the visual). Just when you think Sam Elliott's on target portrayal of a former Marlboro Man-type cowboy is touching and meaningful so can't be satirized, this film finds a way to throw in a zinger.Real video footage of the infamous tobacco companies' Congressional testimony is threaded through for an amusing reality check and faux news and TV shows are recreated very realistically. Though the trailer does give away some of the best jokes, the humor is consistent through to the end (though some of the celebrity references may date the script), with the hero getting more cynical, not less, to the Kingston Trio singing "Greenback Dollar". Without giving any spoilers, rest assured that it is delightful that unlike so many movies about such characters he does not end up on a slacker beach or doing humanitarian volunteer work.Even more pop song references to cigarettes could have been selected but the opening use of the full hearing of Tex Williams's "Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette!" is fun. The credits solemnly point out that even though there is a clip of John Wayne smoking in a movie, his family's foundation is against smoking and the health issues around smoking are ironically made personal to the hero. The sold out audience I was with at the opening weekend matinée at a theater playing it every hour had great fun laughing out loud.While "Naylor" references the usual example of morally flexible appearing professions in lawyers who defend serial killers, I've seen his identical type among fund raisers who as hired guns can convince donors to give money for any cause or nonprofit organization. At a fundraisers' conference I saw a confrontation quite similar to one in the film, where a health organization chastised a museum for accepting tobacco money and was coolly responded to that the donor fit depends on the organization's mission. Let alone my brother-in-law the risk communicationist advising corporations around the world. Both my sons were presidents of their high school debate teams so I'm used to living with talkers who at the flip of a coin can switch affirmative or negative on any issue. I just never realized they were in training to be lobbyists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank You For Smoking should have been a hip, irreverent comedy. And it is. It's just not consistently hip, irreverent, or funny.The film starts out with a great premise: seeing the eyes through a less-than-ethical tobacco lobbyist. It does start out very promising. The protagonist's twisted logic justifying a shady profession is outstandingly funny. Hanging out with fellow "sin lobbyists" representing alcohol and firearms is a great addition. The main character explain his actions to his son is priceless. The introduction of Robert Duvall as the lord of the tobacco world is tremendous casting, a brilliant decision, and a great character.But then the movie goes wrong. First, there's the inclusion of the "conscience" character played by the ex-wife. They should have scrapped that character entirely, the down-to-earth element saps the irreverent soul right out of this movie. They should have made her unseemly, that would have added something.Then there's the decision to add in a slimy Hollywood producer. This is a role that has been so overdone, it's basically a caricature of a caricature and is decidedly unfunny. Next the writers throw in a highly unnecessary kidnapping sequence that adds absolutely nothing to the film. This all leads to the inevitable Confrontation on Capitol Hill, which, unfortunately, is patently uninteresting and does not do the main character justice.So, in summary, the beginning is promising, there are some funny bits, but the writers lose their steam halfway through until it's just over.6 out of 10. Higher than it deserves because it is a neat concept.Barky</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THANK YOU FOR SMOKING (2006) ***1/2 Aaron Eckhart, Maria Bello, Cameron Bright, Adam Brody, Sam Elliott, Katie Holmes, David Koechner, William H. Macy, JK Simmons, Robert Duvall, Kim Dickens, Rob Lowe, Todd Louiso, (cameos as themselves: Joan Lunden and Dennis Miller). Wickedly hilarious black comedy/satire based on the novel by Christopher Buckley about a quick-witted, scruples-lacking spokesman for Big Tobacco in the form of Nick Naylor (a never-been better Eckhart) whose penchant for spinning the truth only equals his duplicity until he faces trying to make the right impression for his young son (Bright). Funny, sharp and clever with a dream ensemble cast that is quick retorting gleefully politically incorrectness and with kudos to novice filmmaker Jason Reitman (son of comic auteur Ivan) for an audacious debut with echoes of Alexander Payne's flair for brilliant comic drama. One of the year's best comedies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stuffed with Very Smart Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. At the film festival a few years back, I saw an incredibly accomplished short film called In God We Trust, and I vowed that if young Jason Reitman (son of Canadian director Ivan Reitman) ever made a feature film, I'd run out and see it. I kept my promise, and Reitman delivers on his.Aaron Eckhart is Nick Naylor, the tobacco industry's spin doctor. He is very good at what he does, and manages to be likable while saying and doing despicable things. In this biting satire, Eckhart doesn't really have any epiphanies, but he thinks he does. After an ill-advised affair with the reporter doing a profile on him, his secrets get out and he loses his job. But after a bravura performance at some Senate hearings, Big Tobacco wants him back. Claiming to have a "responsibility" to his young son, he refuses the job. Instead, by the end, he's set himself up in business advising all sorts of other icky corporations.The film is stuffed with very smart laughs, and I liked the fact that Nick emerges unrepentant at the end. It just sharpens the satire, that this man actually thinks he's now a better person. The tone of the film reminded me quite a bit of Alexander Payne's Election, though the comedy is much broader.Reitman loses his deft touch slightly near the end of the film. Up to this point, no one has been seen actually smoking in the film. After a bizarre attempt on his life, Nick is told that he has to quit smoking. It's a bit incongruous and it's never mentioned again. I suspect that this is much funnier in the novel by Christopher Buckley on which the film is based.I would definitely recommend this film, not only for its skewering of the tobacco industry (standing in for all corporations, really), but also for its jabs at Washington and Hollywood as well. No one is spared. You'll even get to see Rob Lowe in a kimono!</fullReview>

The script would have been well suited to a Prozac pushing, psych drug popping lobbyist complete with crazed school kids on Prozac. How about mothers feeding 18 month old with potent life threatening psyhcotropic drugs? I dislike smoke filled rooms that you cannot escape. I do enjoy a cigarette every now and then.

		<fullReview>This is a satirical comedy that follows the plotting of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry whose job is to improve the image of cigarettes, put a spin on them and make them cool again.Even though a senator wants to place a large skull and crossbones on every cigarette packet and state that they are "poison", Nick won't let it happen.The focus of the film is not only on his life and how the public despise him, but his relationship with his son too.This film will be enjoyed by most people, both smokers to non smokers. This film is satire at its best. It is funny, clever and true. I found it very enjoyable and very different from other films I have seen recently.It gets its point across very well to the audience and succeeds with great acting, dialog and structure. The character of Nick Naley, played by Aaron Eckhart is portrayed brilliantly.The Final Word Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you and that it can give you lung cancer and might eventually kill you, but Nick's job is to defend smokers and cigarettes and make people think that cigarettes are cool! That's what makes it so funny. There is nothing worth complaining about when it comes to Thank You For Smoking. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A smart, witty satire, and a remarkable directorial debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Picture this: a 15-year old boy with cancer, caused by smoking, is the subject of a talk show. Along with him are five guests: four of them are there on behalf of various anti-smoke organizations, eager to ban cigarettes for ever; the fifth, on the other hand, is Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart), America's most famous tobacco lobbyist. Now, you wouldn't expect him to win the argument, would you? Yet that happens, he proves us all wrong by pointing out that his employers want to keep Robin (that's the boy's name) alive, as they would lose a potential customer, whereas his opponents would succeed in their campaign only in case the kid died. All of a sudden, the audience is on Nick's side, once more confirming the validity of his mantra: "If you argue correctly, you're never wrong".Defending cigarettes isn't an easy job, but Nick's the best at it for a simple reason: he's brutally honest. He doesn't claim smoking is good for your health, he merely stresses the fact that everyone is free to make their own choice. This attitude will come in handy when he needs to face a Vermont senator (William H. Macy) who's planning to put a drawing of a skull on cigarette packs to tell people this habit is deadly. Before this challenge, though, there's still time to chat with fellow MOD (Merchants Of Death) people (Maria Bello and David Koechner, representing alcohol and firearms respectively), discuss product placement in sci-fi movies ("But wouldn't they blow up in an all-oxygen environment?" he wonders, to which Rob Lowe's marketing expert replies: "Probably. But it's an easy fix. One line of dialogue: Thank God we invented the... you know, whatever device"), pay a visit to the boss (Robert Duvall), watch out for a mischievous journalist (Katie Holmes) and receive death threats, all while trying to ensure his son Joey (Cameron Bright) doesn't end up hating him. Not bad for a guy whose summation of his job reads as follows: "Michael Jordan plays basketball. Charles Manson kills people. I talk".If you think all that's too much for one movie, it's true, and that's the only bad thing about Jason Reitman's audacious directorial debut: he squeezes too much into the film's 90 minutes, rushing through certain segments and thus denying certain characters more screen time. The Hollywood segment, in particular, is a little bit too brief, and it's a shame, since Rob Lowe and Adam Brody have an impeccable comedic talent. Nonetheless, Reitman manages to deliver a movie which is both intelligent and very funny, two qualities missing in his father's (Ivan, director of Ghostbusters) recent body of work. Thank You for Smoking tackles a tricky subject without taking any sides, and therein lies its charm: by favoring neither opinion (a view strengthened by the fact that no one is seen smoking is the whole movie) Reitman ensures smokers and non-smokers alike will enjoy this brilliant comedy. Much of the credit goes to his leading man as well, since Eckhart manages to turn his trademark amoral guy into a sympathetic character. This aspect is a little exaggerated in the third act, due to some unnecessary father-and-son sentimentality, but by the time the closing credits start rolling he has regained his mojo, ensuring this clever satire won't be forgotten very easily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Satire about a tobacco lobbyist (Aaron Eckhart). I can't quite put my finger on why, but I really didn't think it worked. Admittedly, the tobacco industry is an easy target. It would be too easy to villainize Nick Naylor, so it feels kind of like they were trying not to villainize him completely. Which then feels like they were being too soft on him. I mean, isn't he a villain? It always felt like director/screenwriter Reitman was pulling his punches. The film is moderately entertaining. I actually wish it were a tad funnier, but there are a few really funny moments. Nick's visit to Hollywood is the best part of the film. Rob Lowe as a Hollywood agent and Adam Brody as his assistant give the movie's most memorable performances, and also deliver all the best lines. I also liked Maria Bello and David Koechner as Nick's friends, lobbyists for alcohol and firearms respectively. William H. Macy is also good as an anti-smoking senator, but it makes me question Reitman's intentions that the satirical barbs at him stick much better than the ones against the tobacco industry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a smoker and thinker Ill comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my fist post on this fine site. Excuse my spelling First off I just rented this move and have not had a chance to view but after reading all the threads I will chime in.As a smoker and HUGE Bill Hicks fan I've found many of the threads here interesting. BTW while Bill has been the best preacher I've heard, he did not change my already established thoughts, just re-enforced them by showing me I'm not alone. Here in Sheb WI thats nice :-) First off, in this day we all know what were getting into as smokers, that being health and public opinion. Its funny how many NON forget the GIANT tax revenue generated by smokers and drinkers. That aside the world is full of choices. The gov is MORE than happy to give us alcohol and cigs to kill ourselves and others with, while bashing any and everything it has no direct control over. HA fine! Its the united states of hypocrites. But I for one as a smoker and user of other things including various opiates feel its up to those to decide what VICE they care to cling to. The off topic fat cracks are funny (in their own sick way) we ALL have our own vice to worry about (be it money, drugs, family, morals so on). While having only seen the trailer for this film I think it makes a good and necessary point on smoking. Even as a smoker I'm fine with the public trying to do away with smoking in places. I think CA has a good thing with trying to do away with it in public and even more so in the home. No one should be subject to unchosen exposure to the crap. Its sad to think how many parents put their children through it. I came from a non smoking/drugs/alcohol home yet I, like many other teens in high school and more so college, started as a freshman with little idea what I was getting into. I have no problem with people trying to remove just a little bit of corp and gov BS control from our lives. At some point we must realize the neg variables that impose themselves upon us, and as the fat and current topic has shown us, the US ignorance factor is HUGE to say the least. I have quit cigs but got hung up with a girl that prompted my re-initiation into the smoking world (she gone and so will my cigs in due time again). However its wrong on so many levels to ostracize anyone for chemical dependency. My feeling is in time, this drug abuse (that includes legal and non) epidemic that is only getting worse with time, will be looked at in the same shame in which we treated minorities 50 yrs ago. As Bill said "these people are not criminals, there SICK PEOPLE". We as a nation need to put more money, time, effort, awareness, and most of all "treatment" in this direction. In order to remove the unsightly element of smoking and any substance (this includes BAD FOOD) from the public, people need to hear the TRUTH of all this, and then digest it (no pun intended). And if anyone out there thinks the GOV with do this, than their more delusional than Bush.I too like Hicks am an optimist. I do see and long and VERY brutal road ahead of us. But I like to cling to the idea we will prevail. However it will take the effort of the masses to open the eyes to the larger mass. Once people stop viewing and treating those who do not have a cookie cutter fit to their own beliefs as criminals and degenerates we can start the process of evolving beyond these VICES.I'm sure it will take many more needless deaths and political agendas before it sinks in. But again, I cant wait to see this world 50 years from now (I'm only 26 so there's a chance). And then get to hear "so they put addicts in jail?" For the time being, lets all have a full hearty gut laugh at the medias portrayal of the unfavorable of the earth.BTW I know I have an odd perspective as a user of things. However I feel I'm better suited to speak of them for this. I look at the execution of Tookie as a GREAT loss. Heres a guy who was ready to speak against violence and gangs to the youths of the US and we kill him. Of course the white guy from Harvard is a better rep to speaks to all the high schoolers in LA. WOW some day......."I ain't never met a good lookin dame that needed to be told she was"</fullReview>

Finistirre (William H Macey) is trying to get through congress that all cigarette packets have the world poison printed on them to be accompanied by a giant skull and crossbones.This is a very good satire that gives pokes fun at both sides equally, but it seems to give the anti-tobacco groups a rougher ride by prorating them as some what bumbling and inept. The main point that the film is making is that every person has a choice wheatear or not they make the decsion to buy a pack of Marlborough and light up, which makes it a refreshing, that portrays the reality of smoking.This is a very good movie with some extremely funny one liners in this movie, one of my favorites scenes is comes when Naylor is on a news programme and receives a death threat form anonymous caller when he hangs up the phone the presenter, whose name escapes me, says "Now we'll take a break to fire the call screener".This movie is a very entertaining 90 or so minutes, and makes for an enjoyable watch but its unlikely to make you want to see it more than a couple of times. Its also nice to see a movie that knows it will only last 90 or so minutes and doesn't try and tack an unnecessary extra half hour, something which is too often done in movies.</fullReview>

Even Nick's adolescent kid is corrupt.I had a hard time taking the moving seriously, even as a satire. I chuckled a few times, pondered once or twice and patiently ate through my entire bowl of popcorn.The movie was drab. 92 minutes of over-the-top, clichéd, not-too-funny satire makes one restless, even, I imagine, if you're an anti-smoking, anti-business, anti-American, anti-Big Everything zealot.Plot?

		<fullReview>Anyone going to see this movie and expecting a biting satire on Big Tobacco will be sorely disappointed. Though many of the set piece scenes had good potential to expose the hypocrisy's of the cigarette PR industry, most fell flatter then a damp packet of Marlboros. Instead we where treated to the generic and predictable tale of the corporate Joe who eventually learns his valuable life lesson from an adoring, faultless son. Aaron Eckhart (from In The Company of Men) plays Nick Naylor, a VP of public relations in a tobacco lobby group. He works his trade by pulling the wool over the eyes of a gullible and susceptible public, using various devices to keep selling cigarettes to all. He is good at his job and he knows it. Pity that the first time writer/director, Christopher Buckley, tries to achieve the same effect on us, the paying public. Logical inaccuracy's are skimmed over, characters introduced and then forgotten about, standard montage jump-cuts used to indicate travel, etc. The ever brilliant William H Macy stands out from the mire as usual, as the frustrated and plausible senator trying to limit the reach of cigarettes to the teenage kids.The conclusion is remarkable in its forced unreality. Where in the real world can a media expert screw up so spectacularly and come out a hero after a few weak one-liners? How many in the audience will leave cheering on the frustrated cigarette industry against those pesky senate legislators, even if unintended? Sorry, but I must have had smoke in my eyes watching this farce. As with the tag-line, Christopher Buckley doesn't do compelling satire, he filters it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That this film is garnering such high votes from users is indicative of how easily manipulated most people are. This movie dresses in the livery of a sophisticated satire but falls short in many ways. There is one bit of dialogue, for example, which is representative of the inane laziness/stupidity of the writers: "Do you know who he is" "Yeah, he's the original Marlboro Man, he lives on a ranch, he's dying, not our biggest fan" -- why didn't the movie just use these lines: "Will you explain to the audience who he is so they are not lost in the next scene when you go to his ranch looking house?" "Sure, he's the original Marlboro Man, he lives on a ranch, he's dying, not our biggest fan" -- also it lacks the focus to be a good satire, floundering between irony and artificial attempts at sincerity; a truly good satire would have ended with Big Tobacco winning, with Big Tobacco as the protagonist and the victor, a happy ending with them winning. To top it off, the Katie Holmes character is flat, even for a comedy, and pretty much completely worthless considering the love making scenes she is in reveal nothing.</fullReview>

I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of political satire, as it is a great example of exactly that. It is by no means preachy, in fact it is exactly the opposite. In addition it's also a tale of family, and how a father copes with living apart from his son and divorced wife. Nick, struggles with trying to be a role model for his son, and balancing his life as a spin artist. In addition, don't discount the early role of Katie Holmes, as the payoff will come at the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The debut film from Jason Reitman, son of Ghostbusters, Twins and Evolution director Ivan, is a very good satire comedy focusing on one of the most powerful, and controversial businesses in the world. The lead character of this film is anti-hero chief spokesperson, lobbyist and Vice-President of the Academy of Tobacco Studies, Nick Naylor (Golden Globe nominated Aaron Eckhart), and he is very talented in speaking to defend the cigarette industry in difficult situations. His best friends are also working in controversial businesses, Polly Bailey (Maria Bello) for the alcohol business, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner) for the gun business, and they frequently meet each other in a bar calling themselves the Mod Squad, or Merchants of Death, disputing which industry has killed more people. Nick's greatest enemy is the man who defends the use of skull and crossbones on cigarette packs, Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy). Obviously it is when Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes) that his life is starting to go wrong for him when she betrays his sexual trust. Also starring Cameron Bright as Joey Naylor (Nick's son), The O.C.'s Adam Brody as Jack, Sam Elliott as Lorne Lutch, Rob Lowe as Jeff Megall, Spider-Man's J.K. Simmons as BR, Robert Duvall as Captain and Kim Dickens as Jill Naylor. The story is not only funny, but quite poignant to see how affective the tobacco industry really is, with some very good performances, obviously best is Eckhart, a very good satire. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thank You for Smoking, although clever and funny, was about as poorly conceived as an apologia for the KKK. (Not that it hasn't been done!) Hollywood makes movies good, not good movies. And this film is a prime example of that maxim: good set-up, good actors, good directing, good camera work...bad movie.Now, before you get all hot and bothered about the fact that I didn't like a movie that you thought was funny and cute, stop and think for a minute. What makes a movie good? Is it the special effects? The visuals? The cute female (male) lead? The fact that you laughed? Well, no, actually. (Although all those things help.) What makes a movie good is the IDEA behind it. And this movie was based on a very bad one.If you watch the special features, you'll hear a lot of people say that this movie is about "spin." That's pure spin. The movie (if you pay close attention to what the director says) is about "political correctness." In this case, since you are rooting for the "bad guy" (an amoral liar and all round despicable person), and boo-ing the "good guy" (the be-sandaled Senator from Vermont), the "correctness" part can be argued. Is it merely politically correct to try and curtail smoking? Is it on a par with saying "physically challenged" or "differently abled" rather than disabled or crippled? No, it is not. It is a hard, proved fact that cigarettes do indeed kill, that the tobacco lobby doesn't give a rodent's derriere about that, and that any laws passed through the efforts of lobbyists (like the protagonist of this film) will cause you direct and personal harm.The other reason this film is bad is that it simply didn't work as a film. You can't make a feel-good movie about a man who is immoral. The teary-eyed Child who loves and supports Dad doesn't make you feel all warm and fuzzy. Instead you feel like slapping him, as much for the sentiment as for the stilted, all too adult-sounding, and blatantly expository lines he is forced to deliver. There is no godly reason for us to feel good about the son, or about the ex-spouse for that matter, who somehow, inexplicably decides to support her ex-hubby in the end. No, a plot like that only works if the main character comes through with a change of heart. And this one didn't.Two thumbs down on this one. If you want to see a GOOD movie about spin, watch "Wag the Dog."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Felt Like I Should Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie. Liked it. But the entire time I was watching it, I had the nagging feeling like the material was better than the movie. I never read the book and I'm not some insider who read the script before the movie came out.I just basically kept thinking while I watched this movie, "That's a funny idea. This should be a funny scene. Why isn't it funnier?" I saw it with my wife and our friends, and my wife completely agreed with me. Then we found out that this movie was directed by Ivan Reitman's son, and, well, I hate to be a player bater but I think we got our answer.I'm sure this Jason Reitman is a great guy, but let's be honest. He did not work his way to the top. He was not someone with brilliant talent who had to fight from obscurity to get a career off the ground. He's the son of one of Hollywood's more bankable directors, and that's why a movie that felt like it should have been great turned out to be just all right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as good as I hoped it would be but still watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS: I can honestly say I was a bit disappointed by this movie though I appreciated the depth of the subject matter. Perhaps I was expecting to much. I did kind of expect a masterpiece Because of all the hype and incredible reviews. But Thank You For Smoking to me was just OK. Not bad but not great either. Aeron Eckert was incredible though.There were a few things I didn't care for. The movie starts really slow and doesn't pick up steam for a long time. It's also kind of narrated by Nick, the Eckert character and though sometimes I appreciate narration in a movie, here I found it distracting. I didn't see where it added all that much to the movie.There were also a lot of characters that were interesting but who were not in it much. Maria Bello was good but was very underused and incidentally I am not all that much of a Katie Holmes fan but she was excellent in this as the reporter, the best I've ever seen her and added a lot but her part was small too. There were certain scenes that seemed to talky and to long and other scenes that weren't long enough. There were a lot of characters who had the potential to be really interesting but were not given enough time on screen. The Movie's somewhat of a downer too and it seems like the movie as a whole should be a lot more interesting then it is. Overall I was let down at the end.I guess I'd moderately recommend it anyway because of the acting, the plot and the unusual aspect to the picture as a whole. I struggled with a rating for the movie as 7 is kind of a high rating for a movie I didn't really like all that much but that had it's moments. I guess it's worth seeing but it's nowhere near as amazing as many critics made it out to be. I'd say a 7 Out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Least It Was Filmed in Washington - otherwise no resemblance at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a compelling examination of how Washington works from a tobacco lobbyist's perspective, rent The Insider.This is a stupid movie.Aaron Eckhart portrays Nick Naylor, a lobbyist sometimes wrestling somewhat with the morality of what he does for a living, but more often having adventures like paying off the Marlboro Man, having a risky sexual relationship with a journalist every bit as ambitious as he is, and wooing Hollywood to feature smoking in as favorable a light as possible. Eckhart's performance is not God-awful, but somehow it was delivered as if from on high. The sudden stops in filming with the freeze-frames and then the voice-overs?a hackneyed technique that doesn't seem to work too well in a film depicting Washington.The film is overproduced and not nearly clever enough. Wrong assumptions about Washington and spin, wrong facts and shaky science in a film about lobbying for tobacco are fatal.You know the film is not really authentic when it does not even show one person smoking.The title is the tip off that the film suffers from an identity crisis.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Thank You for Smoking" is yet another talking-head, faux-documentary centered around a main character of some dubious import. This cinematic gimmick was popularized with "GoodFellas," and has gradually gone downhill to include the self-important "Blow" and "Lord of War." "Thank You..." joins the ranks of these latter efforts, and turns out to be little more than an excuse for Ivan Reiman's son to play with an unusually excellent--though in some cases underutilized--cast. Aaron Eckhart, doing a kindler, gentler reprise of his "In the Company of Men" bastard, is excellent as the mouthpiece for Big Tobacco, running errands like bribing the dying Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott) and meeting with a Hollywood producer (Rob Lowe, who steals the show). While some of the acerbic humor hits home, "Thank You" relies on another shopworn gimmick--the young, impressionable son who teaches dad a lesson--that almost made me hack up a lung. I would have much rather spent my time with William H. Macy's raging senator, or the enjoyably amoral characters played by Maria Bello and David Koechner (representing alcohol and firearms, respectively), whose performances are given such short shrift that you wonder if the fortunate Jason Reitman is just showboating with his great cast while transforming a potentially explosive topic into breezy (and ultimately forgettable) 'entertainment.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Farcical and satirical are two worlds apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm just out of the theater and I think 'Thank you for smoking' misses all his marks. The reason I can find is simple: freshman director Jason Reitman confused satirical for farcical. Building and fine-tuning a satire takes a lot more than launching an over-the-top character in an over-the-top world hoping the jokes will be so good that people will think "how clever". If a joke works people laugh and are content with it, if it misfires people are just bored: this is the law of entertainment.In this movie some jokes are funny and the rest are simply not silly enough to emerge from the ongoing farce. But the worst is that the only humane people, the only people not out of a cartoon are just plain boring: Nick's ex-wife and his son are so bland compared with such a colorful character they look dumb. Thus Nick has no valuable point of comparison with reality. Is he a tortured man? Not even close, he's just a high-flying professional cynic who could well end up a moral guy if that's better for him. He simply doesn't live in our world, thus we cannot empathize with him or even hate him since he's just a living farce after all and he spends lots of energy to make us laugh; a brilliant cynical guy mocking the lame hypocritical jerks.So Nick Naylor is colorful but that doesn't make for an interesting character: he's got nothing to prove, nothing to change. He's always on... so you can't tell if he really cares for his family or his friends more than cynical fatality urges him to: he's there, they happen to be the closest human beings, so be it.All along the movie nothing builds up around Nick's personality, his relations to people or simply his desire to tell what's inside of him, what he is really made of, but the key scene where you can't deny the whole edifice doesn't stand up is when Jason Reitman wants to put the final touch. Nick Naylor is just out of the Senate commission and there you can hear the thunder as the director confuses all the energy he put in the project with tune acuteness.All energy and no emotions is a classic fumble with young directors. Almodovar was all energy in his first movies, all energy but with a clear motive: these movies were about exuberant life. Kind of touching in its exuberant naivety. Thank you for smoking aims to be clever before anything else so there's no excuse: the movie was not made on the cheap with an amateur cast and crew, the script was based on a book and was greenlit by some guys who thought all-around Big Tobacco bashing was enough to make a cool picture. Totally avoidable approach, rapidly forgettable flick: a very sad outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slow start...but it gets going</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't really sure what to think of this movie during the first act...it was slow at the beginning and it was difficult to root for Aaron Eckharts character. But when his son came into the story (expertly played by Cameron Bright) the film took off. The ensemble cast is very strong, headed by a great performance by Rob Lowe (not to mention Brody's hilarious take on Hollywood assistants). The pacing was good and no scenes dragged too long...so if you don't like what you're watching (I wasn't a fan of the "sit downs" with Maria Bello and the guy from Anchorman) wait a couple of seconds. It was a good first feature by Reitman and I look forward to seeing what he does next...hopefully a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near-brilliant satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere Ivan Reitman smiles. Reitman the elder, of Ghostbusters fame, has certainly had his share of success. And now his son Jason comes flying out of the gate with a terrific first full-length directorial effort in Thank You for Smoking. If you thought satire was dead have we ever got the movie for you.Featuring a simply brilliant lead performance from Aaron Eckhart as Big Tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor, Thank You for Smoking is laugh-out-loud funny. But what is truly refreshing in this Will Ferrell/Adam Sandler world we live in is that this is a truly smart comedy. The film is brimming with sharp wit, filled with well-developed characters. So nice to see a film which doesn't just throw some actors up on the screen and have them say and do incredibly stupid things in the hope it will get a laugh. Thank You for Smoking is much more subtle. It doesn't try so hard to get the laughs...and gets them anyway.While Eckhart's Nick Naylor is the central figure we follow throughout there are several other winning performances. William H. Macy is reliably brilliant as the rather odd Senator Ortolan Finistirre, enemy of Big Tobacco. Maria Bello and David Koechner play alcohol and firearms lobbyists respectively and their exchanges with Nick Naylor as they compare how many people their respective products are killing are priceless. Casting Rob Lowe in a cameo as a Hollywood super-agent was a stroke of genius as he creates a truly memorable character. Robert Duvall, Sam Elliott, J.K. Simmons...the list of great actors giving wonderful performances goes on and on. Perhaps the only casting misstep is Katie Holmes who strains credulity as a serious investigative reporter. But everything and everyone surrounding her is so good you'll forgive the fact she sticks out like a bit of a sore thumb.Funny throughout this film also can be serious, even tender, when it has to be. Meeting a former Marlboro Man now dying a rather ironic death reminds us of the very real dangers of the product the "hero" of our film spends the whole movie defending. Scenes between Naylor and his son give the film some real heart and show another side to the man whose life's work raises some serious moral and ethical issues to say the least. There are a few lulls here and there but for the most part the film sustains a terrific comic energy all the way through. And Eckhart's performance is absolutely brilliant and will make him a big-time star if there is any justice in this world. All in all a very satisfying film in every way.</fullReview>

Afterwards we were fortunate enough to have our questions about the film answered by Jason Reitman himself! This movie is so much more than what it would appear on the surface. The significance of small details cannot be overlooked. The multiple layers within the plot will appeal to all viewers. The cast is superb and it is clear from this work, Reitman's first major movie, that he will continue to fascinate his audiences with unique approaches to untouchable subjects. He does this with humor, irony, and a depth that surpasses his years. Kudos! Bravo! Best of luck to all involved in this work!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Big Libertarian Campaign Ad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thank You For Smoking tells the story of a lobbyist who's job is to support the tobacco companies in the face of today's PC driven society who want to protect everyone (especially children) from all of the "evils" of the world.There are some insightful messages about the freedom of choices and responsibilities of decision making conveyed in this film, along with a few "hahaha" one-liners. The problem is that there is not enough comedy to sustain interest even for only 90 minutes.This is more of a "Libertarian" newsreel documentary about freedom, choice, and responsibility, than actual storyline. Notice that I have intentionally repeated these words, because in this film, the writers keep hammering the same message: "It's my body, it's my life, let me do what I want but be responsible in my decision making." I was looking for something fresher, or funnier, and got stuck with a Public Service Announcement political ad. The overall effect was below average. The only redeeming value was the performance of the lobbyist's young son. Furthermore, a stupid sex-scene, here or there is often tacked on out of the blue. Probably because while there is enough material for a 60-minute documentary, to make a public-service announcement, into a movie, just doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm glad I saw it, but I don't recommend it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm kicking myself for not appreciating my high school and college lit courses until it was too late. Because it seems like every time I go to the movies I remember back to one of the classics in literature that I callously never read. It was Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal I thought back on after finishing THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, because I now realize that modern satire is joke.Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhardt, In The Company of Men) is as smooth as the cigarettes he's promoting. As the main lobbyist for big tobacco, it's his job to look America in the eye and say "Want to smoke." The film follows him as he convinces group after group that Big Tobacco is the victim and that those who are fighting against him are the villains. There are bumps along the way, including a senator from Vermont (William H. Macy), a nosy journalist (Katie Holmes), and a few attempts on his life. But with some good old American B.S. he may just make it.THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is an almost biting satire, it presents all the characters a great satire needs, and it's full of button pushing ideas that should drag the audience right along with it. But squanders them by playing too safe, by not taking sides, and by coping out at the last moment. Great satire should end with half the characters dead lying in a physical, psychological, or farcical bloodbath. Like in Swift's A Modest Proposal, where he mentions that his countrymen would do well to resort to cannibalism. The hero of the story should be standing next to God, or burning in hell for his misdeeds. THANK YOU FOR SMOKING just winks at you, provides a couple of laughs, and that's all.The major problem is that the screenplay, by Jason Reitman (who also directs), falls in love with the main character to a degree that allows him the opportunity to get away with everything. That's would be fine, but the villains in the film are not drawn as well and so his victory's seem paltry. His Villains are so stereotypical and the actors bring nothing to them that is very profound. Satire without some blood and guts on the floor is pointless.As for the performances they just sit there. No one is big enough. That actors wander in and out of each scene, and the only one we really get to know is Nick. But Nick is not that vulnerable, even when the script tries to paint him that way. Aaron Eckhardt is too confident. I didn't believe his small moment of insecurity once. Because the script doesn't let him fail for long.THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is not a bad movie. It's pretty funny and It's quite timely. But as a satire it's not focused enough, and it doesn't pull enough punches. I'm glad I saw it, but I don't recommend it.</fullReview>

This movie is just another Hollywood attempt to make regular Joe feel bad about the way he lives. Anyone who rated this movie a six or higher should not be allowed to vote on this website anymore. If this is what people think satire is, then that explains the junk movies Hollywood has been turning out for the last five years. Movies like this are the reason that tickets aren't being sold.

		<fullReview>Here are the parts that bothered me most about "Thankyou for smoking": The father-and-on stuff suffers from the usual delusion that a child can convincingly adore his father in one scene and innocently soak up his bad attitudes, then manipulate his mother with sophisticated-sounding psychoanalysis in the next scene, then give his father life lessons worthy of Plato in a third scene. Any character who can do all that is likely to be nothing but a cipher, especially if he's supposed to be twelve years old. I know that impossible wisdom and sophistication is a common characteristic of celluloid children, but it really made this film hard to take to.Then there's the scene with the gun-waving ex-Marlborough man, where the hero gets over his fear so quickly and completely that the next shot starts with him with his back to his embittered, gun-totin' host, leisurely checking out the contents of his mantelpiece. That could have been a great scene, but all the tension, and believability, vanished in the first couple of seconds with one bit of bad direction.The idea that a professional and very talented bullshit artist could be so easily brought down by a reporter who looks about 19 years old (I know she's older, but she doesn't look it) was ludicrous. What newspaper would ever send anyone so young to deal with a notorious spunkiest alone? What spunkiest would ever let sex get him so carried away that he'd spill his guts so completely? Especially a big blond spunkiest who'd have no trouble getting girls.By the way, why did the hero's mate in the MOD squad specifically say the reporter was Irish, with blue eyes, when she has hazel eyes and a strong American accent? Can't Americans hear accents?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great idea, and what a great chance to play interesting philosophical points against themselves and others ... but there's so much out of kilter here that sloppiness prevents the very point that would seem to account for such high ratings. Winston-Salem? I've lived in NC all of my life. No to everything. Wrong license tag. Wrong drink - julep? Go to Kentucky. I love Duval but the accent was laughable. The California types were too strongly stereotypical. The David Spade type character would be great on SNL but spoiled the illusion here. There are some very funny places, though. The MoD Squad idea was done to death. This movie should be remade with a different script incorporating the real lives of tobacco farmers and real Marlboro men who don't storm out of a house wielding guns and believable tobacco executives. The points would be stronger, the depth of the drama and the comedy would be stronger, and the issues would be more believable. The best comedy is made from real live and not a superficial gloss of popular stereotypes. I hope for a remake.</fullReview>

If it does, it's the ultimate effect of self-indulgence.At first, I thought their dialogues were very witty and could not help laughing even though I'm not an American and I'm sure I missed several funny points where it requires American culture background. But as the story unfolded, my lips got stiffer and stiffer...Soon I realized this American comedy was a narcissistic one. It did poke fun at today's upper-class society fulled of so-called elite, but it was more like showing off to me as it did nothing more than exaggerated all the seamy sides in our society and threw them at me.Incidentally, Gus Van Sant's "Elephant" appeared in my mind during watching since these two are slightly common in that they both present us directly with the dark sides of the planet, but the former one triumphs in that it described one story from different perspectives and made us think "it's really bad" while this one seems to be a hilarious show whatever the makers want us to think of.I was rather offended instead of interested as China, Russia, Arab countries were involved in this big joke, and even more irritated by the scene in which***(spoiler) the Mod Squad argued on whose business kills more people in a year.*** As for our talented Nick Taylor, his career success lied not only in his work but also in that people nowadays in this media-controlling world were too happy to be led by others and too stupid to think otherwise.It's horrible and dangerous...I wonder what the original novel is like. I bet it was much more careful than this film --- smoking, death, and other political issues are not supposed to be laughed at at will.Forgot one thing: Aaron Eckhart's smile begins to freak me out...</fullReview>

The repeating trio at the lunch table, tobacco, alcohol, firearms, wasn't funny the first time, and wasn't funny the other times it was part of the movie, either. Basically the story didn't hold up for all the time that was allotted to it, so they had to try and make the young son a focus of the film, with the idea that he could learn from his dad how to be the kind of orator that St. Augustine was a couple of thousand years ago.

		<shortDescription>Do NOT see. Read book instead. Totally perverted the message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Major spoilers ahead:I'd read and quite enjoyed the book. The commercials looked good, the casting was great. It seemed they'd captured the feeling of the book. I was really looking forward to seeing.Of the people I viewed the film with, both the people who had read the book and the people who hadn't hated this film!I was fine with most of the deviations from the book, I know they have to cut stuff and rearrange things. (Some minor things that bothered me: I wish they had kept in the part about BR having kidnapped him. And, I thought it was more effective for him to discover he didn't want any more cigarettes rather than have the doctor order him to stop smoking.)However, the complete about-face of the ending RUINED the entire film.I felt the point of the book was to show him reconsidering why he does this for a living and turn his talent for spin "to good". However, the movie has him continue on in successfully spinning lies/propaganda for evil. Why on earth would you make this film and not show the growth of the character that the book does? I thought this was the very point of adding the kid subplot and the only reason I tolerated it. It effectively showed the kid becoming manipulative like him and I thought when he turned to his son in the court and thought about what he was doing to him and teaching him, he would have an epiphany and change.What was the point of changing it? Was this considered a more "realistic" ending. Well, I'd rather have him redeemed and likable - as in the original story.Especially given our current climate of constant lies and spin from corporations, the government and the media, it would have been nice to see that manipulation examined and shown to be wrong, not glorified with a triumphant end for the spin-meisters.The ending of the book was not to make this an issue about "free choice" or a message about "parenting" (Was this SUPPOSED to be ironic that he talks about responsible parenting while clearly turning his kid into a manipulative clone of himself?) The point I got was to think about what you are doing and the impact you have on others around you.I have not seen a worse movie adaptation in a long time! I am very angry at the jerks that decided to pervert the entire point of the book!AVOID THE FILM. Read the book. It's twisted but funny. The satire is there, but also a message.5/10 because I loved the acting (except Katie), the satire and for the rest of the film up to the false ending. The ending deserves a 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fundamentally Unfunny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With such a wide and talented cast aside from Holmes, one would expect something decent. This movie is far from decent. It isn't abominably bad, but it fails to do what it aims, make people laugh and possibly comment on America's mores. It is a fundamentally unfunny film. I laughed a few times, but these moments were few and far between. In some ways it is worse than movies that are truly awful, for they're funnier in the way they're lousy. This one was just fruitless.Berardinelli said it best when he said "Thank You for Smoking hovers around mediocrity and its lasting impression is like a puff of smoke that is dissipated by a strong gust of wind."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best parts of Thank You for Smoking concern the art of making money from selling nothing but an actual realistic understanding of that world to people who got hoodwinked by indoctrination into a vague idealism they can't even reason through. These scenes are so good that it's a shame the movie is structurally bland and that the good scenes are buried in average ones. It should be funnier and more over the top. it shouldn't be the typical motivational movie. It also feels cheap and rushed. Many scenes look like they should have been reshot.TYFS has the typical problems as all "crisis point" movies, in which a protagonist must choose between morally good and bad options. Neither option holds much promise; he can take a preachy road to redemption. (like say... the road to perdition) or he can remain scummy, in which case the movie is termed a character study; there isn't much tension (or satisfaction) in figuring out where Nick is heading here; it's a comedy. The dilemma faced by those scripts is that they throw away the interesting unethical world for the workaday one (Goodfellas) we all already know isn't interesting. Some of these movies (sin city, LA Confidential, Fight Club) seek resolution in a crescendo of violence which turns out to be equally unsatisfying, because it pushes anything smart from the first half, off the screen. This movie makes a bet that it really doesn't matter which choice Nick makes, and they're probably right. As long as the movie is beautifully written... but it's not. So Nick's choice (the structure) has to be compelling. Nick should have come up with a brilliant way to play everyone as saps. I don't need Nick to become a tight-assed bourgeois eunuch but this fails to really exalt in Nick's final choice.Ironically the first half of this movie isn't very good. The "Cancer Boy" gag which attempts to be one of the most cynical jokes in the movie is lifted without shame from the dud Kids in the Hall Movie "Brain candy." The bitter laughs it seeks can only come from people who haven't seen these ideas handled better in Network, Fight Club, etc. Only once Nick gets an ass-whupping does the movie come to life. Sadly the villain gets only one appearance and (w/o explanation) fails to show up after the middle of the film. It's not good when the energy is so middling that Rob Lowe ends up stealing his scenes.This movie is all you need to know about why the Democrats will lose the fall elections. The Dems are such limp flakes that they think the sincere embodiment of a moral position will get them votes. The Bush presidency proves this to be idiocy; You say what you need to, to mobilize a majority to vote for you, and once you're in power you do whatever the hell you want and tell the same stupid voters that black is actually white; the legislation you just passed to screw them, fill your bank account and pay your friends, is really about saving them. American voters are so hopelessly stupid, they'll sign on with just a little repetition. If you like you can allow a city, a wing of the Pentagon and a pair of buildings in Manhattan to be wiped off the face of the earth and still have 38 percent of the people behind you. The Republicans are evil, but they couldn't do it without the pathetic Dems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the few times where an excellent film is an American film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are old enough; you should to remember when American movies were brave a use auto critic as a way to educate and change society.Of course, that is something you do not see very often lately. You can probably find a few independent projects with barely known actors doing some denounce; but not seen by many people; and sometimes just because they did not deserve public either. Or you can find some Michel Moore (or similar) political statements, that target a current situation but never go really deep in the cause of American's society illness.Well, here it is. A movie, a comedy but really an statement. A deep (and cruel) analysis of the cancer affecting American people is here and should be seen by everybody.No, this is not a movie against Tobacco industry as the title suggest; is about the manipulation of the people by corrupts industries, politics and media. The hypocrisy that is killing our minds and bodies."Thank you for Smoking" is about a spin doctor for the Tobacco industry; a guy that can use a parent's talk in his son classroom to publish cigarettes among kids. If you think he is the Demon itself you are quite wrong. As the history progress he is far from being the worst guy.The movie attacks everybody; politicians looking for media (and political) attention through stupid and unnecessary crusades, prostitution of the media and the corruption of the corporate environment.Jason Reitman (the director) does not go for the easy target. If you want to blame American's decadence, is not the fault of impersonal industries, but the ambition and corruption of the people that control information, law or money. People like you and me, but with more power and using for their own profit.In brief; see this movie. Pay very good attention to the impressive and intelligent dialogs. Open your mind enough to laugh about the things you are seeing every day and after that; try to find a way to change all this. I am sure, this movie is a good first step to make things better for everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And this was SUPPOSED to be funny?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was THE LEAST funny film I have ever seen. It had no love or compassion, it had no morals or light at the end of the tunnel. The sad part is the man passed his immorality on to his OWN SON! He basically told him not care about other people as long as your being successful. I'm sure that the atheists went ko Koo about it, but the truth was it depressed me. I don't know why everyone likes it so much. It was so boring I almost had to walk out. One scene was majorly inappropriate and very gross. It practically said it's o.k. to smoke kids so come on down! And thats NOT o.k. So if you were considering watching this insanity may I suggest changing your plans?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sledgehammer satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still amazed for the accolades this piece of obviousness receives from moviegoers and critics. Completely lacking in any subtlety or wit, and what's worse wasting a decent cast, Thank You for Smoking should be viewed only if decent satirical films like Smile and Election have already been rented. Particularly painful to view are the scenes where the lead character joins another couple of lobbyists (Maria Bello and David Koechner) at a bar to drunkenly crack witty asides at each other's business. For some reason the audience I saw the film with were laughing quite loudly at their banter while all I could do was groan. Midway through the movie, knowing very well where it was going and not having laughed once I almost got up and left the theater.Unfortunately like I said...almost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is an awful adaptation of the book. They cut out way to much of the plot, completely change the ending of the moving and add a character that adds nothing to the movie. Skip this movie and just go read the book. How can a movie cut out one of the main characters and cut out the whole plot from the book? They should of went with the role of him going to jail and changing. The son had no business being in the movie. This was just horrible, like I said, skip this movie and go read the book. This is an awful cliff notes version of the book. One plus for this movie was the acting was good, but what goods the acting when the story is gutted?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank You for Smoking: Don't Start With this Picture *1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only good thing about this glum film is that there is no smoking done by the characters in it. That is an automatic plus. Otherwise, this picture is ridiculous as Aaron Eckhart looks like a dumb Robert Redford type caught up as a tobacco lobbyist. You want him to break out of this part but he really never does. He is as glib as they come.In addition, his son looks as though he is totally annoyed with the entire situation from beginning to end.This film would have worked far better as a serious documentary in the style of Michael Moore's "Sicko."Mr. Eckhart won a Golden Globe nomination as best actor in a comedy or musical. For the life of me, nothing was funny here. The tragedy being that the tobacco industry has hooked countless numbers of people on a product that they will eventually succumb to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't see what people liked about this movie. All I saw was a mega-sleazy man turning his son into yet another one - seemingly with the mother's cooperation? I don't get it. He ends up defending other similar issues and makes more new "friends" in the end. The twist of having the token all-knowing-brat following him around and being oh-so-proud-of-Daddy was just repulsive.If this was supposed to be about freedom of choice or freedom of speech, it missed the mark. They should come out with a sequil featuring some morality-free jackass arguing for NAMBLA or Nazis in America or something along those lines. That would be "great"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie fails to entertain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that could have been good but fails in all areas. The actors all of them professional with excellent resumes go thru the motions with no real interest in the production The story of a tobacco industry lobbyist could have been good satire but instead turns into a vulgar film with no need to entertain but to shock. The director of this movie as capable of so much more, the storyline could have worked but the movie which runs about 92 extra long minutes fails to entertain but does offend the senses. Rarly have I been so disappointed in a movie. The film is based on a novel by Christopher Buckley, after viewing the movie I suggest that you read the book as it has to be a lot better than this very hastily thrown together film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not suitable for Adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen movies that brought tears to my eyes by being so blatantly dull. Never have I walked out of a movie, though. But this time I couldn't sit still at all. I wanted to run away and scream in agony. I couldn't stand any more of these dreadful performances, these mind-numbing dialogs and the simple minded structure of this failure that they dare call a movie. How could anyone EVER give this movie a good rating? For Christ's sake, people! Aaron Eckhart seems like a snotty brat in an adult suit. Apparently, the failure lies with Jason Reitmans. It appears as though he chose only the worst takes to end up in the movie. The all-over impression I got was that they tried hard to make a lukewarm film about the tobacco industry for an audience of breast-fed kids. You could force a man to drink alcohol to a point at which he's merely able to breathe by himself, shoot his brains out and he would STILL grasp that endlessly blunt plot with an ease! They smash this flat story right in our face - nothing to think about! It's all there, just that it is of a quality similar to a bad joke. And then it's over and you feel sick, like you know you've been eating too much of that Junk Food again.I wanted to spit right into Jason Reitmans face when I went out of the cinema. He should have flushed this mistake down the toilet instead of releasing it! Honestly, I can't think of a movie worse to this one. That's because all those "Worst Movie Ever" candidates were so bad, they reached a point at which they were good because of their missing quality - in the end, they were amusing! But this film reaches the peak of bad taste and has the brass to sustain that level TO - THE - END.I'd buy the DVD ... only to smash it into smithereens for my personal satisfaction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just a huge cigarette commercial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly tiresome ordeal. This is a story about people we could care less about than zero, and the director writer team plows through this with no justification for making anyone watch this tripe. There is nothing learned. This is pure and simple just a bash in your face long cigarette ad. It makes smokers look like heroes, and spends every second trying to put down non smokers. That's all the film does. It could've made some points, but failed to do so, and the characters are total bores. The cigarette pushing isn't even subtle. We are given a caricature of anti smoking groups who act more like the smokers in real life. This is simply a poor film made to make cigarette smokers even more self righteous than they are. Want to give smokers equal rights? Than either do away with smoke breaks or allow "non smoke" breaks at work. Allow something besides cigarettes to be given to people who are incarcerated or working for you. Lighting up cigarettes is the only time a psycho can get away with setting fire to something in front of you that is intended solely to emit poisonous fumes. I don't know of any other time that is legal. Pathetic movie meant only for the most self righteous smokers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank You for Smoking (2005) BOMB</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a disappointment. As someone who has never smoked a cigarette in his life and who LOVES poking fun at the tobacco industry and all its addicted consumers who lack at least some degree of self-respect and self-control, I expected much more humor in this dull-as-dishwater nothing of a movie. It's about a tobacco promoter who'll stoop to any lows to put a spin on the dangers of cigarettes to sell his product, but it's not in the least bit funny or clever. Just excruciatingly dull. I can't believe Robert Duvall got mixed up with this thing, but he and Sam Elliott (the latter playing the former Marlboro Man now infected with cancer) were the best things in it. It still wasn't enough to make it worth investing 90 some odd minutes though. I did have one short-lived laugh, however... the main title song about needing to smoke and being unable to stop was hilarious and a real hoot. So to all you chronic puffers out there who just refuse to wise up and save your own lives, I hereby sing: "Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigareeettttttte!".

		<shortDescription>What's wrong with this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This year (2008), about 565,650 Americans are expected to die of cancer, more than 1,500 people a day. Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the US, exceeded only by heart disease. In the US, cancer accounts for 1 of every 4 deaths. 1 in 3 people will develop cancer during their lives. -American Cancer SocietyThis film is a piece of crap. It's simple: the subject matter is not available for comedy. Americans would like to think that everything is open to a big joke, but it's not. The statistics prove this. There are just some subjects that are off limits. This is one of them. Movies like this will keep being made for the simple reason that 1) Hollywood is a greedy, capitalist juggernaut by its nature. 2.) lack of good judgment from very good actors to participate in projects like this thus ennobling them with high production values, and 3) did I mention the cyclopean monolith who lumbers blindly ahead without discernment on its wayward bacchanal to resounding applause without decency, laughing, growling, celebrating the energy of sex and money at the expense of everyone else? Interesting that many of the one star reviews start off with "Didn't make me laugh...." Cancer?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I definitely enjoyed this movie - however the opening titles already put me in a worry. I enjoyed it almost to the end when it downed on me that it was a nasty setup in which they didn't even give a chance to anti-smoking thoughts ..I have to add two things I really love Jim Jarmusch's Coffe and Cigarettes - even the new one .. also I used to be a smoker - for over 10 years - and I'm not gonna light 1 cigarette again .. no, never .. I used to enjoy it - but i found out that it's a severe drug - totally addictive .. and it's very hard to quit .. so that's for my aspect ..I am a journalist and as such creature I think it's very important to take sides in smoking's matter .. I mean you should never send out any message that tells young (or older) people that cigarette smoking is good for them .. It's Tobacco companies' interest that young people think it's cool to be smoking .. to be a smoker .. We smokers and ex smokers are supposed to have a different interest however .. We should always take a chance to mention - like for the record - that cigarette smoking is very bad for you .. for anyone .. for humans in general .. Yes, it is enjoyable - the first draft every day .. but it takes a really huge price .. health in general .. Anyways i'm saying that we are responsible for those who are exposed to the idea that maybe they should start smoking too .. For them we definitely have to send the message like "please don't do that!" ..My problem with this movie is that it's a one-sided propaganda .. wrapped up as a comedy .. remember .. Nick Taylor never once says that smoking is actually bad .. he "testifies" as if his son wants to smoke he'll buy him his first pack .. Okay we all know that it's for marketing .. it's supposed to stir emotions like Michael Mooore's flicks - to sell at the box office .. But in this movie they go further .. they systematically take side for smoking in opposition to not-smoking .. and this hurts ..I mean can you imagine how much it'd cost for tobacco companies to air this message ? The can't even buy this .. they are out from TV and cinemas too .. also Forma 1 is getting regulated .. so can you imagine how much advertising value this movie has for tobacco companies ..? I think I can .. it is HUGE ..! And this movie does't even pretend to give a chance for kids who are potential clients for tobacco industry .. Nick Tylor testifies like positive .. alright .. but he'd still have a chance to give some explanation to his son in the next scene .. but he does't say a word .. he has no comment on that .. He does't add that he hopes that his son would't smoke .. or that his son should know that smoking is very-very addictive .. and cancer is not all that it gives you .. He misses to tell him something like "son, you don't need this thing .." ..So in the end this whole movie is a BIG argument - that amuses people .. and tells them that smoking is dangerous - just like anything else .. like cellphones .. and that's it ..in my point of view if I smoke or You smoke - that's a thing .. but if I send a message to clean people that smoking is cool - that's a very nasty thing .. Of course it wouldn't be so - if cigarette smoking wasn't that addictive .. but it is very-very addictive .. so I think however funny the whole flick is .. the conclusion makes it very offensive ..</fullReview>
