		<shortDescription>Beautiful, hilarious, poignant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is one director who marches to the beat of his own drummer - films in Nebraska, uses black and white, and casts some parts locally to get the correct flavor. He doesn't miss a note.Nebraska is the story of a family of usual dysfunctionals living where else but Nebraska - a quiet, distant father with a little dementia, Woody (Bruce Dern), his two sons, David and Ross (Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk), and their perpetually complaining mother Kate (June Squibb). David sells home electronics and just broke up with his girlfriend; Ross works for a news station and recently replaced the "talent" up front.The current major problem is that Woody has received something akin to a Publisher's Clearing House certificate telling him he's won a million dollars. All he has to do is buy these magazines and check if the numbers are his. All Woody sees is that he won a million dollars. No one will take him to Lincoln to claim his prize so he starts walking - more than once - until David says he will take him.On the way, they stop by his parents' home town and drop in on Woody's brother and his family - a scary bunch. Kate takes a bus in and shows David around the cemetery in a scene you'll never forget, trust me. Woody runs into his old partner, Ed (Stacy Keach), and as word spreads that Woody is going to be a millionaire, everybody wants a piece of him, including Ed, who says Woody owes him quite a bit.This is really a character-driven film, with some of the most vibrant, fleshed-out characters ever on screen and some of the starkest landscapes, filmed in black and white, and giving the viewer the feeling of what it's like to live among miles and miles of farmland interspersed with small towns.Bruce Dern gives an Oscar-worthy performance as a lifelong alcoholic who has escaped inside himself, a man out of touch and seemingly untouched by any events around him. As the outspoken Kate, June Squibb is absolutely hilarious - always yelling at Woody, threatening to put him in a home, complaining about him, but just don't let anybody take advantage of him, or you'll have to deal with her.The sons mirror their parents, with David quiet and thoughtful but trying to bond with his father, and Ross, more confident and less sympathetic.In learning about his father's background, in talking with his old girlfriend (Angela McEwan) David begins to see the man that his father once was and what shaped him. And he finds out that love is sometimes an unspoken thing, but it's there all the same.A wonderful film, powerful in its simplicity. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very difficult and worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nebraska" offers viewers an unstinting view of some very unpleasant things: extreme decrepitude, boundless stupidity, greed and ignorance. There is also very deep, and very painful, love on display in this portrait of an embittered working class eking out a meaningless existence in a dysfunctional and remote place. "Nebraska" oscillates between cynicism and schmaltz, pulling off a wondrous kind of emotional alchemy that few films aspire to, let alone attain.All of the acting is first rate, though the characterizations are rather broadly drawn. Will Forte plays a dutiful, sensitive, repressed son with seemingly unlimited patience for the eccentricities of those around him. He's the perfect foil for Bruce Dern's semi-catatonic, alcoholic ramblings (both verbal and spatial). June Squibb serves up hilarious venom to spice up the mix.There were scenes in the movie that so perfectly captured the narrow, soulless, deadening ethos so prevalent in small-town America that I could hardly stand to watch them. It was almost as if the tire stores, bars, gas stations and motels of every desolate corner of America were rolled up into one set of visuals here, captured in stunning black and white cinematography.I highly recommend "Nebraska."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Dern Oscar worthy performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bruce Dern gives the performance of his life. He is wonderful. He maintains the quality of tuning in and out of reality throughout the film. Typical of someone with dementia, you are never really sure if he's there or not. There is a moment in the film when he drives and you can just see him glow and come alive.This is not a film for everyone because it moves slow, but true movie buffs will love it. Filmed in black and white and bleak (if that were a color) it's a son that takes his father on a road tripIt's quietly poignant, with a lot of very funny moments in it. When the mother is in the scene, she steals every one.The cousins are a riot and the family members are a cast of characters. This is the sort of film that you leave but doesn't leave you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow and low-key but describes its characters with wit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie at the Helsinki International Film Festival. It tells a story about an old man who is certain that he has won a million dollars and wants to get to Nebraska to collect it. His family is sure that it is a hoax but his son chooses to drive him there so that the thing wouldn't bother his dad anymore. Everything about the movie is very low key and the pacing is quite slow. This comes from the choice of shooting it in black and white, style of acting, and the locations and events depicted in the film. For long periods, I found it a little hard to get immersed into the events on the screen and empathize with the characters. I kept thinking that the movie repeats what I did not like about Alexander Payne's earlier work About Schmidt. But then somehow the movie started to grow on me. I still feel there is almost weird resemblance to the road trip and family reunion Jack Nicholson's character goes through in About Schmidt but Nebraska has merits of its own. For one, the characters are quite well written. Even the supporting roles provide witty observations of different ways we might react to other person's fortune. Also, the acting is very good throughout the film. The main characters' lives have become unsatisfying and they are trying to deal with it in different ways. Even though it is a little frustrating to watch people who struggle to find anything meaningful to do or say, the script and the actors are able to draw a very accurate picture of everyday life as it sometimes can be. Here and there, they are able to provide a few laughs and even some satisfaction when the characters are developing, albeit slowly.Overall, I'd end up recommending the film if you have enjoyed Alexander Payne's previous work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keep on the sunny side of the desolate landscape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne is currently one of the best dramatists in cinema right now simply because he makes films about realistic people in realistic situations. Payne seems to see no value in fantasy elements, far-fetched circumstances, or overly-comedic nonsense. His accomplished filmography includes the uproariously funny and poignant Sideways, The Descendants, which I went on to name my favorite film of 2012, the bold satire Election, the humble and depressing About Schmidt, and the daring abortion comedy-drama Citizen Ruth.Now with Nebraska he adds another incredible film to his filmography. Heavy on the drama, smart with its character depictions, but never schmaltzy nor self-satisfying, Nebraska paints a bleak and depressing portrait of Midwestern life centering on a broken family with little to live for. One day, however, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern in a career-making performance) finds something to live for. Senile, an alcoholic in denial, and not one for long conversations, Woody receives a letter in the mail telling him he won a $1,000,000 prize and should come to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect it. His son, the quietly-sad David (Will Forte), informs him that the letter is a shameless piece of scam mail that requires the subscription to multiple magazines to even qualify for a raffle to potentially win the jackpot.Woody doesn't care. He believes that people or an organization wouldn't say something that wasn't one-hundred percent true. Residing in Billings, Montana, Woody abandons his long-suffering, brutally honest wife (June Squibb) numerous times by aimlessly walking (sometimes trudging) down interstate highways and side-streets to venture out to Lincoln to collect his supposed earnings. At first, David can't fathom his father's logic. He has informed him several times this is a hopeless scam, that he is in no condition to travel long distances (he can't drive), and he doesn't even need $1 million to begin with. Woody, stubborn as a mule (or is he?), offers very little reasoning for his actions. He simply does what he wants. But when people in Woody's hometown get wind of this, along with distant family members that maybe should've remained distant, Woody now owes everyone money and a favor.Director Alexander Payne and writer Bob Nelson work wonderfully with Nebraska, especially Nelson, who is sure to paint the characters as realistic as they are relatable to the audiences. Consider Woody's rather large family, made up of codgers who speak in disjointed sentences and delightfully funny souls who like to complain every chance they get. One of these people in particular is Woody's wife Kate, portrayed by a fearless June Squibb where almost everything she says is a laugh riot. A key scene comes when Woody, Kate, and David are visiting the gravesites of Woody's family members and for every person buried six feet under, Kate has a smarmy remark for them.It's all the more surprising to note that Will Forte, usually known for playing characters in goofball comedies, does tremendous work in a serious, darkly funny, but also depressing drama film. Forte embodies an everyman quality that will make him familiar to some, and the way he tries to live in the boundaries of reality while giving his father something to live for is easily relatable to someone who wants the best for their own parents. However, the performance of the two hours is easily given by Bruce Dern, who has the rare ability to play detached and clueless with a true sense of believability. I can only think of Paul Dano's requirements for his character in Prisoners, released about two months back, where Dano had to always bear a facial expression that rendered him dazed and almost entirely out of touch with reality. Dern uses the effect to true emotional heights in Nebraska, with the uncanny ability to sit with a blank stare on his face and look as if he's about to burst into tears.That precise quality of Nebraska is why I was so drawn in (along with the excellent black and white photography); its lack of milking its story for emotions. It has the very ingredients to make a person cry from the senile father who never really was one to his children, the broken family, and the unremarkable rural life that seemingly offers no hope outside of a desolate landscape. However, just like Woody, the film looks on the brighter side of life, optimistic about the peculiar instances and finding solace in a practical adventure. It doesn't have time to waste on sappy musical cues and actors phoning in emotion; it's much too concerned for articulating the characters and the adventure at hand.It's also wonderful to see Will Forte in a pleasantly different role, alongside his frequent collaborator and friend Bob Odenkirk as siblings in Nebraska. The last time Forte and Odenkirk teamed up, if I recall correctly, The Brothers Solomon happened and such a film doesn't even deserve a mention in this review.Starring: Bruce Dern, Will Forte, June Squibb, Bob Odenkirk, and Stacy Keach. Directed by: Alexander Payne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious movie where SNL comedian Will Forte plays the straight man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nebraska" stars Bruce Dern playing Woody Grant, a 77-year-old man living in Billings, Montana who believes he's won a million dollars from a publisher's sweepstakes just because he received a craftily worded sales letter from the company. When the movie opens, we see Dern on foot, hoofing his way on the outskirts of Billings and on his way to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim his prize. It quickly becomes clear that the years have not been kind to Dern's character Woody. Alcohol, age, the bleak northern US Midwest, and the long line of life's events have left Woody a bit addled, which is why a sales letter can make him believe he's a millionaire. Turns out, he was always like that.Woody's son David, played by Saturday Night Live alum Will Forte, also lives in Billings. He sells home theaters and other consumer electronics in the local appliance store, drives a dented Suburu wagon, and has the usual dysfunctional relationship with his increasingly disconnected father. After Woody makes several attempts on his own to escape Billings and make it to Lincoln, David agrees to take Woody to Lincoln in his Suburu. Events along the way take both Woody and David to Woody's tiny fictional hometown in northeast Nebraska where Woody's past awaits.And there you have the setup for another of director Alexander Payne's wonderful road-trip comedies, cast from precisely the same mold as "About Schmidt" and "Sideways." This movie takes us through Woody's long past so that the present can seen with sharper focus. If you like those movies, you will love "Nebraska" too.There's one more thing you will also love and that is June Squibb's portrayal of Woody's wife Kate. Squibb plays Kate as a force of nature with a mouth that's funny, insightful, profane, and tender all at the same time. Dern's already won one film award for his Woody and many of us believe Squibb will do the same with her Kate Grant. Squibb also played the wife who suddenly dropped dead in "About Schmidt." We didn't get to see much of her in that movie but she gets plenty of opportunity to steal a bunch of scenes in "Nebraska." This is a very funny movie with some poignant statements to make about aging, familial relationships, and the past's influence on the present. In that way, "Nebraska" is just like director Payne's other road-trip movies. But "Nebraska" is its own story with an entirely different take on these topics.For some of us, it's a lot of fun to see great movies before they open. We got the opportunity to see "Nebraska" a few days before it opened in a national expansion of the New York Film Critics Series, which started in 1995. Last-minute tickets for this event were provided by Paramount through the tireless efforts of Tim Sika, founder and head of the San Jose Camera Cinema Club. Thanks Tim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Payne's best film ever...June Squibb steals the show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NEW YORK FILM FESTIVAL: There is a magical and profound power that is exuded from Alexander Payne's film "Nebraska." I loved just about every second of it. Written by Bob Nelson, the black-and-white dramedy takes us through the beautiful and rural Midwest showcasing opulent and lavish cinematography by Phedon Papamichael. And let's not forget the trio of stunning performances from Oscar-nominee Bruce Dern, Will Forte, and June Squibb. The film tells the story of an aging and ailing Woody (Dern) and his son David (Forte) as they venture off from Montana to Nebraska to collect a million dollar prize that Woody believes he has won.I've long thought that Alexander Payne was one of the more overrated writer/directors working today. Winning two Oscars for screenplay, only one of them was warranted. I merely enjoyed his film "Election" over ten years ago, couldn't find the emotional connection in "About Schmidt" and found myself perplexed by the love that poured in for "The Descendants." His Oscar-winning film "Sideways" was the only film that lived up to the promise and still retains its magic on repeated viewings. The Paramount Vantage film presents an impeccable example of Payne's directorial skills and style when they're utilized with the right material. "Nebraska" is Alexander Payne's best film, bar none. He creates an intimate setting, even when driving cross-country or walking around an abandoned home, Payne keeps the story close and the responses authentic.Bruce Dern is perfectly used and exquisitely raw presenting the actor's best outing of his career. As the co-anchor of the story, Dern is finally given a chance to show what Hollywood has been missing out on for over fifty years. Touchingly reserved through most of the narrative, Dern allows Woody to open up to the audience for the briefest of moments that works beautifully. It's an Oscar-worthy performance.Will Forte surprisingly underplays and buries his normal comedic ticks and beats that made him so successful on "Saturday Night Live." His David searches and finds many of the mysteries that embody the enigma of his alcoholic father, giving Forte an ability to connect fully with the audience. He is equally as affecting as Bruce Dern and this will hopefully lead him into more complex and audacious roles like this in the future.The wonderful and delightful June Squibb steals the show. Getting the film's biggest laughs and in many ways, offering herself up as the emotional pillar in many aspects of the narrative, Squibb is someone that could walk her way to an Oscar. Nelson's writing, especially in the creation of Kate, Woody's wife, is freshly executed. Say hello to one of your Supporting Actress nominees.Other supporting players giving their all is Stacy Keach playing a sleazy old friend of Woody's and Bob Odenkirk as David's brother Ross, who bounces well off comedian Forte in some of the film's best scenes.One aspect that I fell in love with was the score of Mark Orton is musical accompaniment lands precisely with every bar and in every scene. Editor Kevin Tent, who has worked on all of Payne's previous films, finally has found his groove and maintains a steady pace to tell our story. I have to admit that when I first heard that the film was going to be shot in black and white, I'm immediately thought it was going to used as a gimmick. Nearly five minutes into the movie, you can see exactly why he chose to use it. Papamichael captures the natural elements of light in several scenes, some involving a simple living room, others when we're in the car with the family. "Nebraska" is one of the year's best pictures. Something that will surely appeal to a certain demographic of the Academy. It runs as a light and comedic companion piece to Michael Haneke's "Amour." It's a film that will surely be in contention for several Academy Awards including Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite comedy is sideways (among others) and I love Mr Paynes films (like Election. As an advanced senior I was totally with Bruce Dern, the crankiness, the lack of balance, the drinking the boredom. the many naps. WIll Forte is absolutely superb as a kind loving son, in every way. His patience his help on the many scrapes his dad gets into and his true love. He is a cinch for an Oscar nomination. So are Dern and the actor who plays his wife. Although the film is outright funny, the sensitivity which Payne shows in handling the actors and the bleakness of Nebraska. The people of the small towns are portrayed is as close to real people as you can get. The black and white added to the story, especially the portrayal of the cities and small farms. I think this film will be loved by seniors. Younger people, after they have see Hunger Games could learn a lot from the lives of their grand-parents. A magnificent film, go see it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartfelt slice of Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne "Sideways" (2004) and "About Schmidt" (2002) deftly handles the road-movie plot structure once again with dark humor and satirical depictions of contemporary American society, yielding fantastic results yet again, as a heartfelt journey to examine his frail and flawed characters. Payne himself is a Nebraska native who felt strongly that the movie be filmed black and white to capture the mood of the old American heartland, and in order for the film to receive funding from Paramount, he had to settle for a smaller budget. As a result, Payne films and casts the movie in local communities with actual residents which provides a realistic texture to the family bonding tale. "Nebraska" is a humorous and heart-rendering story of family, but it also sheds a light onto the people of America's heartland, and our countries economic, moral, and cultural decline."Nebraska" starts as a road movie, with a father and son traveling from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska. David (Will Forte) has decided to indulge his father Woody (Bruce Dern), who is struggling with dementia and thinks that he can pick up his $1 million in winnings from a magazine distributor in Lincoln. En route, they stop for the weekend in Hawthorne, Dern's hometown, where they're joined by his wife (June Squibb), and his other son (Bob Odenkirk) amidst your stereotypical Midwestern relatives and friends, all of whom are extremely interested to learn that there's now a millionaire before them.The central relationship between Dern's stubbornly gullible dad and Forte's passively irritated son gradually deepens as the movie makes its way through middle America. What makes the film such a delight to watch are the individuality of its characters. Each one is fun to watch in their own right; the father's relentless determination, the mother's humorous outbursts, and the son's sympathy and desire to bond with his father. "Nebraska" reaches an emotional conclusion that echoes of "About Schmidt" and "The Descendants" (2011) with an underlying sense of lives largely squandered, but handled with grace and finesse that feels innately genuine. "Nebraska" is another finely tuned, superior slice of cinema crafted by Alexander Payne who achieves a more mature, sentimental tone than previous films. The all-around marvelous performances from the cast and supporting non-professional actors add an unmistakable authenticity to this slice of Americana.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska- The Latest Whimsical Tale from Alexander Payne is a Subtle and Poetic Reflection on the Loss of Time and the Affirmation of Hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time is a peculiar yet universally felt concept whose effects can be seen in its numerous consequences either through the obvious traits of aging or the far more subtle and subjectively felt intangibles such as regret. In the heart of the Midwest there are depressingly poetic examples of this thoroughly felt concept of time how the vast stretches of what appears to be infinite plains of nothing are filled with monuments of ruin either in the ghost town cities or the deserted farmland all of which are consequences of economic hardship and familial anchors. This is the melancholic setting of Alexander Payne's new film Nebraska, a sad yet endearing road trip film that becomes a sort of modern Don Quixote influenced story where a regret filled, dementia gaining father resembling the infamous dreamer Quixote resiliently chases the remnants of a thin dream accompanied by his affably neutered son serving as the loyal Sancho Panza. Nebraska clearly resembles previous films that have captured the distinct American spirit and eccentric characters of the parched Midwest, including Peter Bogdonovich's The Last Picture Show and David Lynch's oddly accessible The Straight Story, but remains uniquely an Alexander Payne film containing his penchant for mixing whimsically dry humor with poignant humanity. At the center of Payne's film is an astonishingly subtle performance from experienced acting veteran Bruce Dern whose stern blankness and aging dementia makes for an intriguing parallel to the derelict environments throughout the Midwest setting which is captured brilliantly through cinematographer Phedon Papamichael's poetic black &amp; white imagery. This whimsical yet mournful ode to Midwestern life, values, and legacy is aided through the lost art of subtle acting and the usually non-existent talent for subtle direction allowing the intended humor to land directly and the emotional heart to enter gracefully. While Nebraska might be an engaging, humorous, and sweet amalgamation of Payne's previous works where the road trip element of Sideways meets the intimate family dynamic of The Descendants it's definitely a transition film for the quirky storyteller as it embraces a far more poetic and humanist side to the director's incredibly heartfelt style of filmmaking. It's difficult to say where exactly Nebraska will fall in Payne's established film canon but as it stands on its own it's a deeply lyrical reflection on the loss of time and a credible affirmation on the long enduring existence of hope.More on this review: http://wp.me/py8op-Ck; Other reviews: generationfilm.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tedious Cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the film has generally received anywhere from positive to rave reviews, I am decidedly in the opposite camp. It would appear that Payne was attempting to create some sort of dark comedy, but in my opinion the result turned out to be simply a tedious cartoon. All of the characters with perhaps the exception of the son Dave played by Will Forte, seemed very two dimensional with little, if any, depth unfolded or transformation effected by the conclusion of the film. The character of Woody Grant never moved beyond a sad and pathetic 75 year old man with a brain addled by a long history of alcoholism and cursed with the onset of Alzheimer's. Payne painted this in broad brush strokes with the character mostly gazing off into space, saying "Huh" when spoken to, and daydreaming with his mouth open. His wife Kate was something out of an Al Capp comic strip, a sort of overdrawn termagant wife played by June Squibb who usually yelled her lines to the camera, sort of like Olive Oyl as the ultimate bitch. The minor roles of the aging townspeople in the fictional town of Hawthorne, NE where Woody and his family visit en route from Billings, MT to Lincoln, NE in his quest to collect a $Million in a scam magazine sweepstakes, were equally as shallow and simply included, in what seemed to be a cynical stereotypical portrait of a small town in Nebraska, a collection of quasi Grant Wood American Gothic zombies, who do nothing but drink at the local pub and watch football on television. Local Nebraskans will tell you that older people in these communities are far more in touch with the world, and not living any kind of isolated life that may have existed 60 years or so ago or the bleak kind of picture of the past which Payne seemed to be trying to paint.I might subtitle the film as Nebraska: A Road Trip in Circles. From what I could gather, the storyline was supposedly intended to trace the process of family bonding (primarily that of son Dave and father Woody) through a bittersweet road trip revisiting family and friends along the way. Usually road trip movies offer some degree of character transformation by the conclusion. Here there seemed little if any change. Woody was still living his life in a hazy daze though now possessing a new truck and generator purchased for him by his son when they arrived in Lincoln and discovered there was no prize money. While his wife Kate exhibited one fleeting moment of tenderness toward Woody near the end of the film in a perfunctory kiss on the cheek, there was nothing to suggest that there would be any difference in their ensuing lives together. Perhaps the son Dave may have felt a bit closer to his father after the trip, but heading back to Billings, there seemed little sense of that. Again, I have no idea of what exactly Payne was attempting to accomplish with this film. It was anything but comedic or tragic or any kind of subtle ambiguous satiric mixture of the two. There was, however, some wonderful shots of rural landscapes, but unfortunately, the fine cinematography didn't prove quite enough to redeem the film overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't drink the Kool-Aid- horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hesitant to see this film, as it looked like yet another road pic where father and son or whoever bond on the road. But critics and friends love the movie. So we tried it out, and I wish the road was the only problem with the movie. I am a Payne fan, but I can't see why he would make this movie besides it being named after his home state. If Oklahoma wasn't already taken, this movie could have been called that. Or Montana. Or Wyoming. There is nothing distinct about the characters or setting in this movie to warrant its being made beyond a personal connection for Payne. Too bad for Payne the script is so contrived that it doesn't come across as personal but caricature.I gave this movie a chance for 20 minutes, as I was surrounded by Christmas vacation movie rubes who seemed to be laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. But when June Squibb's character flashes a gravestone in an obvious and painful attempt at humor, I turned on this film. At that point my suspicion that these were caricatures and not real life characters was confirmed. They were just doing wacky sitcom things because they're cute, quaint simple-minded townsfolk. Check out the screenwriter's credits- it's his first feature film, with only one TV show I've never heard of, and writing for MAGIC JOHNSON'S TALK SHOW! for previous credits. That's it! And it really feels like a first-time script, with it not being concerned with genuine, natural feeling plot of character development, sticking to a trite formula that makes the viewer FEEL like they're watching a movie, which is not a good thing.The story ends well, but the last 10 minutes' payoff was not worth the excruciatingly slow and painful dialogue and "plot" that precedes it. The movie's worst feature is that it relies on a bunch of false conflicts where a simple explanation from Will Forte's character could have resolved everything, a la a Three's Company episode. In fact, such an explanation could have made Bruce Dern's plight more sympathetic, and given the townsfolk a chance to show some humanity rather than their two-dimensional idiosyncrasies and quirks.The script's problems are compounded by Payne's directorial choices. Can someone explain to me why this is in black and white? Besides a director's insecurity, and wanting the film to seem more important than it is? The already slow script turns to molasses when Payne decides to gather 10 male townsfolk in a living room to watch TV. Payne thinks he's being insightful and/or clever by showing them looking at the TV, aka his camera. The "simple" townsfolk just stare at the camera, watching you watch the film. One caricature asks a question. He receives a one word response. A long pause as everyone continues to stare at the camera/T. Another question asked, a remark made, with a slowly delivered one word response. Absolute. Torture. The pace of this movie made the mostly excellent 3 hour Wolf of Wall Street fly by in comparison.I can't fault the acting here, but even Bruce Dern's role didn't have much depth or dimension. I already mentioned June Squibb's part, and I have to fault the script that I found her to be obnoxious. Will Forte does his job, but that's about all. The only memorable performance for me was Peg Nagy as Angela, a former love interest of Dern's. Hers was the only part that felt like it could have been a real person. She played the part with a subtlety and poignance that the rest of the film lacked.Nebraska is the first Payne film that I didn't like. Hope it's the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots to like, but ultimately lacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**I'll try to be discreet, but there will probably be some indirect spoilers ahead **First, let me agree with virtually everyone else that the performances by Dern, Forte, Squibb and the rest of the cast were top-notch. The cinematography was beautiful, the choice to film in black-and-white was appropriate and effective. The script, the score, and the supporting cast - from Odenkirk and Keech down to the woman in the contest office - all right on the money. So why only 6 (leaning toward 5)stars?Yes, there is much to like here: some tender moments, some laugh-out- loud funny bits (Kate's running commentary in the cemetery and her final goodbye to an old suitor is hilarious), an absolutely beautiful set piece at the old homestead, even a small comic caper vignette. And the final 10-12 minute sequence is almost (but not quite) good enough to redeem the rest of my quibbles. First, with a running time of almost 2 full hours, combined with the generously long average shot length and slow, fluid camera movements, the film seemed much too long. I think it would have benefited from a little more aggressive editing. By the end, I found myself feeling akin to Woody's character through much of the movie - walking and driving and walking some more, but not actually getting anywhere. When we/he finally *do* get to our destination, the payoff hardly seems worth the effort. None of the characters had really changed much, the few things we learned about their back stories never paid off (I'm thinking specifically about what Peg reveals to David about his father's military career), there was no larger no social commentary (at least none that I could find), and by the end, I couldn't complete the sentence: "this movie tried to say _________ about __________".I'm sure I'll be in the minority, but for me, with as much as there was to admire about the film, it was ultimately a case of the whole being less than the sum of its parts. All in all, not much more than a pleasant diversion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our Hope Wanes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a while there I thought Alexander Payne was the best director in the world. He hit the bullseye with About Schmidt and Sideways telling compelling, entertaining stories about 'real' people. He was so anti-Hollywood, showing the side of life no one 'wants to see', but never allowing concept or style to overwhelm or replace the story. The story had been the backbone of the film, and those stories were great. There is a lot of quirk and heart and good intent with The Descendants and Nebraska, but they are not engaging stories. They may be stories, but Mr. Payne's flair has caught up with himself, it seems. His last two films have relied on what have become tricks, using set decoration minutia, witty, surprising dialogue, casting real-looking people (or non-actors in many cases), uncharacteristic and shocking sexual overtures made by unlikely candidates. Those things worked in About Schmidt and Sideways (and Election) because the good stories those movies told were only highlighted by those details and comic turns, not supported by them. In The Descendants it seemed Mr. Payne had gone soft and cast Clooney in a typical-Clooney role (just a great guy, what a great guy he is!), unlike Nicholson in About Schmidt in a role we had never imagined he would play (and play so well). The Hawaii land plot a diverting and unnecessary distraction and contrivance, the heart-tugging classic father/daughter relationship, the glamour of the locale, the ultimate graciousness and forgiveness, all basically a reversal of Payne's style. Like he went Hollywood. He was critically lauded and nominated for awards as his other films had been. But it stopped mattering, because now it was just mediocre, by the standards Payne had set for himself. He probably knew that and made Nebraska as his rebuttal to himself. The film almost punishes us by its lack of dimensionality. We know where this is going and it is not surprising. Painfully slow without demonstrating its need for such, not even making literal sense at times, the movie never gains any steam, there is no rising action, it is a big flat line across the screen. It resorts to the aforementioned tricks to distract us from realizing that, while this may be called a story, it is not a compelling one, and one that does not take risks. It uses tricks. Example of a trick: The younger son's girlfriend is intentionally unattractive and overweight. We're supposed to think this lends some credibility to the realism of the film. 'Oh, isn't that interesting! We're not seeing a Hollywood starlet in the girlfriend role! She's ugly and overweight! How interesting!' This is just set decoration. Such tricks worked in his previous films, but not here, because it is a mask. What does this trick accomplish? Establishing the son's character as.. Sympathetic, pathetic, realistic, weak..?? Who knows. Who cares. Without creating a great story, these choices are merely interesting, but no longer important. Why isn't the story great? The writing and the plot. They must continue shooting itself in the foot, because the protagonist is never-endingly taciturn, and while we can sense there is more going on inside him, the movie intentionally makes us guess at why he will not let go of a ridiculous claim to the million dollars. Is it because he's senile? Is it because he's poorly educated and isn't intelligent enough to render common sense to the matter? Why doesn't he get it? He's out of it? We don't know. We don't ever know. The movie doesn't want us to know. If we knew, we would know that there is no reason, because it's all contrived, it's a device. I am only so critical because I was such a big fan of his other films. I realize that is possibly unfair. But this is the Internet, we can write whatever we want. Who cares. But I really care, so maybe you're like me out there, who was so touched and inspired by Mr. Payne's previous work. I was so desperately looking forward to The Descendants, like I needed it, I needed to be affected, I needed to see a great story in the movie theater. Perhaps it's unreasonable to expect greatness. But in this day and age, it is so rare, we have only a special few that are capable, Mr. Payne being one. So despite my complaints, I hope Mr. Payne has a great story to tell again some day. In the meantime, we have got to pick up the slack, myself included.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did the black and white make things any less quirky?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to fall in love with this quaint looking film. I really did! The plot seemed intriguing, the trailers seemed funny and as I began to watch, the initial fifteen minutes displayed a great amount of promise. But as the plot takes flight, director Alexander Payne allows "Nebraska" to become more and more awkward and meandrous; even dedicating an entire act to his characters meandering around a quirky Podunk town. And while there are some bright spots in this father/son road trip movie that range from touching to smirk-inducing, there isn't enough here to allow "Nebraska" to come off as anything more than a minor disappointment.Synopsis: A half-senile old man looking for something to live for, attempts to convince his son and others that he has won a million dollars in a sweepstakes and must travel to Nebraska to claim it. Realizing that this is an obvious scam, but also realizing that a journey to Nebraska may be his father's last hurrah and may mend their estranged relationship, his son decides to drive him.Bruce Dern, who plays the father, and may inexplicably garner an Oscar nomination for this role, is fine here. And the same goes for Will Forte, who plays the son. And while I will say that Nebraska's outline promised a touching tale of a father and son relationship and every sequence where Forte and Dern interact does set the stage for something genuine, every one of the supporting characters seems unrealistic and one dimensional. And in the second act, when Forte and Dern are immersed in a town full of these colorful characters, all of the heart goes right out the window. As I have already alluded to, it is the quirky script that reduces these fine actors to performances which are, at best, eccentrically odd, and at worst, eccentrically obnoxious. For example: Bob Odenkirk (from "Breaking Bad" fame) plays the brother, a character who embodies the smallest amount of quirk, but could be seen as acceptably eccentric. And then there is June Squibb, who plays the incredibly obnoxious mother. A character so forcibly over-the-top vulgar, it is as if Payne is tapping us all on the shoulder, notifying everyone in the theater of how he has now cranked the quirk up to eleven. Some may find quirkiness for quirkiness sake, comical. I find it intolerable.Side Note: It's my guess that "Nebraska" was filmed in black and white to set a certain mood or pay homage to a Capraesque quality Payne thinks he carries. But in the end, this effect really adds nothing to the picture.Final Thought: Through no fault of my own I have a love/ hate relationship with Alexander Payne. On one hand, he still is the director who brought me "Election" and "Sideways". On the other hand, two years ago we were subjected to the overrated piece of Oscar bait that was "The Descendants". In regards to "Nebraska", here is what is all comes down to: The first act was intriguing, the final act was symbolically well constructed, but the journey itself was dull.

		<fullReview>In Billings, Montana, the old mechanic Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) has dementia and believes that he has won a million-dollar prize, but it is actually the marketing advertisement of a magazine. Woody does not drive anymore and he tries to walk to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect the prize. His wife Kate (June Squibb) and his older son Ross (Bob Odenkirk) want to send him to a nursing home, but his estranged younger son David (Will Forte) decides to satisfy his fantasy and travels with him to Lincoln to claim his prize. During their journey, they stop in Hawthorne to visit their dysfunctional family and friends and David learns the past and dreams of his father. In the end, David makes his father's dreams come true."Nebraska" is a sensitive story of a father and son journey where the son understands his old father in an environment of greedy and ignorance of family and friends. The story is simple, the characters are believable and Bruce Dern deserves his nomination to the Oscar. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Nebraska"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life in black and white</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, one learns about a film's key characteristic in its first frame: a dreary highway somewhere in the American wilderness, somewhere in the outskirts of a rather non-descript town. An old man walks on it, fragile, yet doggedly ploughing on. Yes, Nebraska, the new film by Alexander Payne (Sideways, The Descendants) is a road movie. And yes, as is often the case with Payne, it is a family story. a father and son who never had much to say to each other, the younger (Will Forte) an average man with an average job and a girlfriend who just walked out on him, the elder a life-long drinker, hard, bitter, unapproachable. Of course, they will find some closeness on their journey which is a strange journey indeed: the father has received a letter proclaiming he won a million dollars, Everyone else recognizes it for what it is: a trick to sell magazine description but the father, somewhere between stubbornness and beginning dementia, refuses to accept it. Try as they may but again and again, Woody walks out to go the 750 miles to Nebraska to pick up his prize. In the end, son David relents and drives him. They stop by in his father's home town where an impromptu family reunion is staged, the assumed riches generate various desires and old conflicts alight again among the town's people before they continue on their journey, which unexpectedly ends in a little, humorous triumph.The film turns out to be a bit of a mixed bag. It is strongest when it focuses on the family and on Woody. Bruce Dern is the real story ? and the most accomplished story teller ? of Nebraska. Payne gives him plenty of close-ups, and the 77-year-old pays back with interest. The black and white which Payne has chosen for his film helps to give Dern's face an out of time quality, like someone from old days long gone by, an wanderer from a world we hardly remember. How he moves from the expressionless appearance of a man who has plainly lost it, to subtle glimpses of some sort of life left in him, how his eyes convey unexpressed love, lingering regret, unsatisfied longing while the rest of his face remains immobile and seemingly dead is as breathtaking as it is done with the finest of brushes. These people, living isn't the desolate wastelands of Montana or Nebraska do not talk much, they are hardened by time of life, but there is still a residue of love ? for each other, for life. There is hardly any discernible change in the (non-)relationship of Woody and David by the film's end, yet they have come many, many miles, are closer than they have ever been. and suddenly this highly dysfunctional group ? the stubborn stone-like Woody, the melancholic David, the bitter and constantly complaining mother June Squibb) and the successful older brother (Bob Odenkirk), who is as vain as he is pragmatic, merge into a family unit that in the end, is all they have and they know it.The dry, matter-of fact observational style Payne is such a master of, highlighted by those long, quiet, slow frames, with the camera repeatedly moving into the distance only to come unbearable close the next moment, is here intensified by the pale, relentless black and white, depicting a world more dead that alive, a world of aging populations and deserted houses, harvested farms and empty roads, run- down taverns and people who have nothing left to say. Payne's look is one of clinical precision, he doesn't spare us any of its ugliness and yet he finds love where it could not e expected. What has been gained on this trip is fragile, it might not even have much substance but we must believe in it because it is all that there is.Nebraska could have been a memorable, touching, even cautiously funny film if it did not have that other level: it also tries to be a satire of greed, of narrow-mindedness, of all the vices even well-meaning people can fall victim to. The problem is that Payne turns most of his minor characters into one-dimensional caricatures, ridiculous idiots, flat characters with no redeeming features. Stacy Keach, for example, stars as Ed, former collaborator and friend of Woody's and is made to depict him as a rather ridiculous villain that is oddly out of place here. The portrayal of the extended family as slow, silent dunces is rather simplistic, too, and contrasts strangely with the subtle depiction of the protagonists. All in all, the Nebraskan town they are stuck in for two days is full of clichd country folk with only one positive standout who in her ever-smiling goodness is even more unbearable than those lusting after a share of the assumed riches. The effect is that the black and white takes over the story and characterization for much too long, creating an odd coldness that keeps distancing us from what we see. Nebraska is two films in one which do not fit together with one of which even being a rather bad one. At the end, one wishes Alexander Payne had trusted his main characters ? and his actors ? a little more. They could have carried the film and there is some reason to believe they should have.http://stagescreen.wordpress.com/2014/01/21/life-in-black-and-white/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the road again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been nine long years since Alexander Payne's top twenty worthy masterpiece Sideways and I can't shake off the feeling he has another one in him. He's an odd director with his contradictions, safe yet often unsafe, mature yet often silly, exciting yet mellow. I hoped The Descendants would be that film but my expectations were set far too high. While it's grown on me a little since I saw in the theater as I've accepted it's more of an observant drama than a sharp comedy, it's a relatively weak followup to Sideways. Unfortunately I've found that his older films are not good at all, Election disappointed me a lot and I thought About Schmidt was utterly pointless and charmless. I guess that's the main issue with his films, they feel too on- the-surface while it's surface is too low-key to be enough. Sideways manages to connect, but the others feel like their stories are in a bubble, isolated from us.However, Nebraska has more than enough depth to go around. It may be low-key with its conflict and narrative drive, but its study on the American dream is fascinating. What draws middle-America to riches for nothing? It's become a part of our human condition to strive for that dream. I love films like these where its catalyst is farcical but its approach is mature and thoughtful. It makes you think about time, relationships and generations as our protagonist, played by Will Forte, investigates his father's past, taking that typical amateur detective mold of Payne's films. It's strange that I've recently been in the presence of my namesake's grave as Forte does too. The film regularly conjures deeply personal and specific feelings like that, but not without a great sense of humour, often coming from a silly place. However, it's just chuckles and sighs as the screenplay pulls its punches and holds back for a slighter effect. In a way it's admirable, feeling more honest, in another it's one step short of deep satisfaction. But it's certainly quite satisfying at the very least.In Payne's films, they're usually about family but only follow part of the family. Nebraska is unusual as eventually the whole unit is together on Woody Grant's journey. The fantastic cast makes this chemistry work and there's an endearing nostalgic quality to see them together on screen. While Forte's character is a bit too passive for him to really shine, despite this being off-type for him, Bruce Dern definitely deserves his acclaim. His bitterness may come out with a snarling bite but he's utterly human and fragile. June Squibb is a welcome presence as she pumps energy into the film's second half, however it's the incredible cinematography steals the show, even beating this year's Gravity for me. The blocking is precise but organic and the shots of the clouds of Nebraska make my stomach sink with their profound beauty. Nebraska may be more intellectually stimulating than emotionally, but perhaps it'll get better on rewatch. Alexander Payne seems like fine wine anyway as his films get better and better.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An invitation to depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing Nebraska, I was left wondering if everybody depicted in the movie was on depression medication. This is a slow moving, tedious movie that purports to be a slice of life on the Nebraska plains. Adding to the dreary atmosphere is the fact that it is shot in black and white. Of course, it is well acted by Bruce Dern as an aged and senile Woody Grant. Also kudos go to Will Forte as his son David Grant and especially to June Squibb as Woody Grant's feisty wife. Still, the film is largely a wasted effort by director Alexander Payne and also a distortion what life is really like in small town Nebraska. It depicts these Nebraskans as mostly taciturn depressives who spend most of their time in seedy bars sipping Bud Light or in dreary living rooms watching endless football on television. Nobody seems to work on a farm although this is essentially prosperous farm country. Woody's relatives and old friends are only roused to action upon learning that Woody might be winning a million bucks. Then they all start hitting him up for a loan or demand that he settle some long ago imagined debt. Nevertheless, if you enjoy endless driving shots along the Interstates and gravel-covered secondary roads of Nebraska, then this movie might be for you. Of course, the motivating force in what is essentially a road movie is transporting Woody Grant to Lincoln Nebraska from Billings Montana so that he can collect his one million dollar prize that he thinks he has won in a sweepstakes contest. Needless to say, the ending is a letdown. Woody has won nothing but his dutiful son David buys him a used pickup truck as a consolation prize. The last scene in the movie has Woody driving his truck triumphantly down the main street of his old hometown.</fullReview>

If you have enjoyed his movies in the past, the you will be in nirvana watching "Nebraska". This film also reminded me of "The Straight Story" - another terrific film. "Nebraska" is a forth film from 2014th contenders for best movie Oscar that i saw, and to be honest, i enjoyed it more that "Captain Phillips" or "Dalas Buyers Club" - two very solid film. The forth is "Gravity", but that one is in another level of movie making, hope you know what i mean.Overall, "Nebraska" i a great, slow, quite road movie that will definitely move you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alexander Payne's finest film for grown-ups yet - bittersweet, uplifting and heartbreaking all at once.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a film industry dominated by crowd-pleasing blockbusters and gross-out comedies, Alexander Payne's gentle, thoughtful movies have always set themselves apart. More chatty than explosive, less hilarious than contemplative, Payne's films - from About Schmidt through to Sideways and The Descendants - have been the welcome antidote to Hollywood's worst excesses. Nebraska, an uplifting, heartbreaking treatise on love and family, is perhaps his finest yet: a sweet, tart, perfectly-measured balance between the comedy and tragedy of life and old age.Convinced that he's won a million dollars in a dubious mail-order sweepstakes, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) resolves to travel from Montana to Nebraska to claim his prize. The only trouble is that he's bordering on the infirm: his wits are fast disappearing into old age and alcoholism, and no one - least of all his mouthy wife Kate (June Squibb: stealing scenes with glee and aplomb) and eldest son Ross (Bob Odenkirk) - are willing to indulge his latest whim. Only David (Will Forte), his second son, decides to humour the irascible old codger. Together, Woody and David embark on a road trip that will take them through Woody's old hometown - and a step or two closer to understanding each other.This journey of discovery is, of course, both literal and metaphorical. When stopping off in Woody's old stomping grounds, David meets Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach), his dad's former business partner - a mix of charming and shady, an old-school predator always on the hunt for a quick buck. He also finds an extended family and townsfolk either bitterly jealous of or genuinely happy for Woody's purported new fortune.But David also learns more about his dad. As the film unfolds, it becomes evident that the son lost sight of the father a long time ago, after Woody wrapped himself in a taciturn, booze-fuelled haze that carries him through most of the film. In the place that made and - in some ways - broke his father, David peels away the layers of age and dust that obscure the man who once was.The greatest joy of Nebraska is its deft, wonderful way of exploring and deepening its characters. Payne, working off a spare, unsentimental script by Bob Nelson, allows the Grant family to live and breathe, their insecurities and fears slipping through the cracks of humdrum, everyday life. Even Kate and Ross, who turn up for the unscheduled family reunion, have a depth that goes beyond their supporting roles. As Kate fusses around Woody, casually insulting him in an almost shocking fashion, it's easy to see the years of love, frustration and life they share.Dern has been rightfully lauded for his turn as Woody: he drifts through the film, trailing a shock of unruly white hair and a puzzling determination to get to Nebraska come hell or high water. But what impresses is Dern's ability to cut a figure both noble and utterly ordinary: an old man, lost in time and within himself, determined to make one final stand. Forte, too, is marvellous - he sheds all signs of his better-known comedic persona as the sweet, caring David, who decides to take what he knows is a futile trip just to spend some time with his dad. It's a shame that awards season has passed him by; Forte is the tremulous heart of Nebraska, just as Dern is its spunky soul.Shot in stunning, velvety black-and-white, Nebraska might seem like a throwback to simpler times. In a way, it is. This is an age-old story of family, love and connection: of missing the man beneath the memories, of not always understanding the people you've lived with all your life. But the film also has a darker, more modern heart, buried beneath the script's sad, bittersweet shades of grey. Woody is drawn by promises of wealth that are plainly false, a comment - one might think - on the faltering American economy of the past few years. It's a fine balancing act that Payne pulls off wonderfully well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In-Depth Father and Son Story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is one of the greatest filmmakers working today and he directed some of my favorite movies in Sideways and The Descendants. Now we can add his latest film, Nebraska to that list. I adored this film, especially given the fact how small-scale it is compared to his other films. At its heart, this is a story about a father and son and it is never too late to bond with each other, even if there are differences. It's a simple story, but is elegantly told. I loved the use of black and white cinematography which enhanced the film by making it feel more realistic and a visional portrait of rural America. The film was shot on location, so that gave the film a natural beauty few films cease to have.Alexander Payne's film is about an elderly, alcoholic man by the name of Woody Grant. He is quite gullible and that shows when he claims he has won a million dollars, despite being an obvious scam. Despite that fact, his son David decides to drive him from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska. Along the way, they stop in a town named Hawthorne, Nebraska where Woody grew up and there are some unforgettable encounters.The acting is just incredible. Bruce Dern delivers the performance of his life at age 77 and his ignorance of the world around him really hits home at this tough realism. Will Forte is normally a funnyman, but he delivers a satisfying dramatic performance as David. Let's not forget to mention the foul-mouthed performance of June Squibb, who played Kate or Woody's wife. Her physique may be small, but some of her lines are just wow. Finally, Bob Odenkirk better known as Saul from Breaking Bad plays a good performance as David's little brother, Ross.Overall, Nebraska is a poignant film about the bonding of father and son and shows this can happen at any age. It's about two men who are trying to understand each other. This is a small film, but it grabs the heart of those who watched this film. I got emotional during some of these scenes, thanks to the clever screenplay that Payne did not write for once. However, Payne's subtle comedy is always present so like his other films, we still get a chance to laugh. This is one of those instant classics you can keep on watching over and over again. I rate this film 9.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, charming, quirkily funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sweet, charming, quirkily funny movie.From director Alexander Payne who gave us such gems as Sideways, About Schmidt, The Descendants and Election, this is a road movie with a difference. Explores many themes: heritage, home, family, memories, fulfillment and greed.So many scenes that spark off memories of one's own life, or at least things that one can relate to.Can be frustrating at times. There are points where you want to reach and slap a character or two, and periods where it does seem to drift. These periods are brief, fortunately, and tend to serve a purpose, ultimately.The only negative aspect is the cinematography. Payne chose to film this in black &amp; white. While I generally don't have a problem with B&amp;W films - the lack of colour can help create a mood - here the B&amp;W is unnecessary. Moreover, it is wasteful. We have the big skies and beautiful, endless Nebraskan vistas, just bursting to be seen in colour...and we see them in black &amp; white. Plus the movie is ultimately an upbeat one, so the B&amp;W isn't required.Good performances all round. Bruce Dern and June Squibb are great as the mother and father, while Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk give solid performances as the sons. There's a good balance between the father's ditziness, the mother's nagging, the older brother's focus and the younger brother's rolling eyes-yet-caring-ness.A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeously filmed and expertly performed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 2011's slow-moving but well-acted The Descendants, writer/director Alexander Payne (here only on directorial duties) returns to the road-movie formula that served him so well in his greatest film, 2004's Sideways. When we first meet Nebraska's grizzled and hunched hero, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), he is plodding along a snow-laden road, wandering without any sense of direction. He is picked up by the police and taken back to his iron-fisted wife Kate (June Squibb), who longs to put this 80-plus year old man, teetering dangerously on the cusp of dementia, in a home.His son, David (Will Forte), is a passive young man who is unhappy in his salesman job and has recently separated from his girlfriend. He learns from his mother that his father was on his way to Lincoln, Nebraska (Woody lives in Montana) to pick up a million dollars he believes he has won in a junk mail sales scam. Where most people would throw it away without thinking twice, this grey-haired old coot believes that they can't say it if it isn't true. In his stubbornness, Woody convinces David to drive him to Lincoln, and David, having lived most of his life in the shadow of his small-town news anchor brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk), sees a chance to spend some time with the father he doesn't really know.Like most Payne efforts, Nebraska is low on plot but high on humanity. After a long career playing eccentrics and loons, Dern gives a highly understated performance, which is without a doubt the best work he has ever done. More than just a poor old man to feel sorry for, Dern brings a history to the eyes of his character, a man who has seen his life come and go without really realising it. In one extremely touching scene, David questions his father about why he and his mother got married. Woody says "I figured, what the hell," and when David asks him if he was ever sorry he married her, he replies "all the time." It's a desperately sad and honest portrayal of a man helpless in his regret.Yet, like most of Payne's films, Nebraska is also very funny. As Woody becomes a local celebrity in Lincoln, his home town, when knowledge of his 'wealth' spreads, Woody finds old friends (such as Stacy Keach's Ed) and half-forgotten family coming out of the woodwork looking for a handout or what they believe is owed to them. This is when Kate turns up, a small but feisty woman, prone to telling her sons about how she was the subject of many a groping hand in her youth, much to David and Ross's disgust. Squibb is magnificent, and injects energy into the film when it starts to need it. Nebraska is Payne's most mature film to date, gorgeously filmed, expertly performed, and surely now one of the definitive films about reaching the end of your path.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Determination! Woody Grant is determined to claim his 1 Million Dollar prize. Determination drives the elderly Woody to attempt to walk to Nebraska to claim it where he will buy a new truck even though he hasn't driven for over ten years. His son, Will Forte as David Grant, is in a dead end job and recently lost his girlfriend so he offers to drive his father to claim the winnings that don't exist. He admires the determination of his father!Bruce Dern (known for Django Unchained and The Burbs) as Woody Grant in Nebraska is awe-inspiring. Directed by Alexander Payne in 2013, Nebraska, also staring Will Forte as David Grant, was nominated for six Oscars and other numerous awards. Father and son spend a week together where truths and memories are rediscovered. Nebraska was given an R rating, after an appeal to have it PG-13.June Squibb (Kate Grant) brings comedy to the film as the uncouth, Catholic wife of Woody. The trip gets delayed which puts Woody and David in Hawthorne where Woody and Kate grew up. Everyone believes Woody when he tells them he is going to claim his winnings. It just so happens, now that everyone believes Woody has money, he seems to owe everyone money from years ago and they want to make it right. Along the path of undoing the belief that Woody has won a million dollars, David discovers much about his father's childhood. David gets to visit the newspaper in Hawthorn where he is told of his father's heroism of the war. They also visit the farm where Woody grew up. Kate is openly truthful at the cemetery where she airs all the dirty laundry of the individuals while standing over their headstone.Nebraska, a black and white film, could have easily been filmed in color. However, black and white takes the audience back to the period when visiting the old homestead. The home was dilapidated, but black and white allowed an appreciation for what it once was through imagination. We watch Woody through David's eyes and David through Woody's eyes during most of the film. This camera angle shows us the appreciation Woody has for what David is doing for him and most of all, the admiration David has for his father. This view also gives the audience a more realistic view.Adults with elderly parents or grandparent are sure to relate to this highly recommended film. The reality of dealing with the trials and tribulations of our seniors is depicted vividly in Nebraska. While it may be difficult of handle these situations, we can see the happiness, disappointment, frustration, and appreciation in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nostalgic Masterpiece for A Older Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was not made for our generation. I personally think that this film is dedicated to the lives that our grandparent's lived. This is shown most predominately through the character of Woody Grant, who goes back to the town that the grew up in (called Hawthorne) on the way to collect his "million dollars." The character of David Grant (Played by Will Forte) is Woody's son and acts as a representation of the audience, learning about his dad's past as he runs into the other senior citizens of Hawthorne who tell him stories about his dad. Surprisingly, it seems like David doesn't know much about his dad, as everything that is told to him is stuff that the didn't know before. This shouldn't come as much as a surprise to him though, because his dad is a man of few words, just like how my grandpa is. Probably the most heartfelt moments in the film is when Woody visits the house that he grew up in, and when he looks at his old barn, Bruce Dern does a fantastic job of showing that the character is having a heavy dose of nostalgia and is thinking about all of the memories that he has in that place.Nebraska is a film that everyone should show to their parents or grandparents because it will make them think of all the memories that they have had in their past and will give them a reason to think about their lives as a whole.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essentially a road trip film and a character study, Nebraska is simply brilliant however you look at it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska follows Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) and his son David Grant (Will Forte) as they make the journey from Montana to Nebraska so that Woody can claim a $1,000,000 prize that he's won on a sweep stake.I think one thing that really stands out with this film is how well written it is; if we take Woody for example, at the start we see this confused, indifferent and somewhat uncaring individual. However, as the narrative unfolds we begin to understand why he behaves in the way that he does. We learn that he's an alcoholic and that he's been no great shakes as a dad, but when you learn what he's been through and what he's had to put up with you can start to feel for him as a person. Alcohol was clearly a coping mechanism for Woody - his time at war in Korea obviously affected him throughout his life, his wife Kate (June Squibb) has clearly bullied him and controlled him throughout their marriage. In fact, there is one foul mouthed out burst from Kate which clearly shows how cruel she could be at times. Likewise his so called friend and former business partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach) also convinced him to stay with the woman that he's married to rather than go off with someone he loves because at the time divorce was a 'sin'. However, Pegram then says that he could understand why Woody would want to divorce Kate because she was a bitch. This scene again highlighted how easily Woody could be manipulated and controlled and showed that he believed anything that anyone says (which is actually a central theme for the entire plot). It's also really touching that David would accompany Woody to Nebraska even though he knew that it was all a scam from the start - he knew it gave Woody something to live for and something to focus his attention on.Anyone who's worried that Nebraska is all heavy drama has no need to worry because there are plenty of light hearted, funny scenes most of which involve Woody and David. I remember one scene where Woody and David are driving along and Woody keeps saying "I can drive better than that moron" to about 3 different drivers that pass them on the freeway. I also feel that I should take my hat off to Bruce Dern who put in an absolutely amazing performance as Woody Grant - his acting was brilliant and his character was written in such a way that he's never really 100% likable, but then again you won't find you hate his character either. Likewise with his wife Kate, although she is quite objectionable and it's highly likely that she has contributed to him being the way that he is she also shows at times that there is love there and she does stand up for him on a couple of occasions. I honestly was so impressed by the screenplay for this film.Along with all this greatness is an ending that was warm but was also very clever. Woody driving through his old town with his truck and his compressor and all the towns folk assuming that he did win $1,000,000 - remember he told everyone that's all that he wanted so they'd have no reason to think that he wasn't a millionaire. A very funny and clever ending to a roundly brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice, warm slice of Americana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is my introduction to Alexander Payne and I am very impressed. With a simple story and homegrown, naturalistic performances from his actors, he created a movie that resonated with me in a strong way. NEBRASKA is about an old man, played by Bruce Dern, who gets one of those Publisher's Clearinghouse-type of letters in the mail and thinks he's won a million dollars. All he has to do is take the letter with him to Lincoln, Nebraska. Eventually his son, played by Will Forte, decides to take him there in order to placate him. Along the way, he learns a lot about his family and grows closer with his father. Thematically, there's actually quite a bit going on beneath the surface. On one hand, you have subtle commentary on the illusory nature of the "American dream" but the film says more about finding a sense of purpose, self-worth and hope. And all of it is shown through the lens of small-town America. It wasn't anything profound, but it didn't need to be. It was simple, straightforward and did it in a very homey way. Speaking of "homey." I thought the character work here was as strong as anything I've seen in years. It's like the actors weren't even acting. They just seemed that real to me, like these were people I could have known when I was growing up. They had such an authentic manner of speaking, and a lot of what they said was endearing and comical, in equal measure. Though the entire cast gives great performances, the standouts were Bruce Dern (who got a well-deserved win at Cannes last year), Will Forte and (to my surprise, although I didn't have any expectations going in) June Squibb as Woody's long-suffering wife. She was a very no-nonsense woman who was given some brilliantly acerbic dialogue. Will Forte also gave a performance I'd never have expected from him, given the comic persona he honed on Saturday Night Live. And Bruce Dern, as usual, gave an outstanding performance as a man who finds something to live for, even if it's just in his mind. It's like this movie was the real-life crowning achievement that his character hopes for in the film. As far as other aspects go, the movie was shot in black-and-white, an appropriate choice in my opinion. It, along with the conservative camera-work, gave the movie a stripped-down feel which helped to bring out the story and dialogue more, as opposed to the imagery (which still looked fantastic). This movie was also all shot on location, and there was great work there as well. I also loved the score, which had a down-home feel to it with the minimalist strings and guitar (banjo?). Had I seen this last year, I'm positive this would have been my pick for the best one. Still, it's great that I've finally seen it and I look forward to digging further into Alexander Payne's back catalog. Highly recommended to any self-respecting cinephile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For those of us not from the Midwest, there is something strange about the place. Its people are taciturn but full of character; its landscape is wide, foreboding and sends the viewer into silence. "Nebraska" sits somewhere between "The Last Picture Show"; monochrome and a sad town full of back stories; and "Fargo", black humor, caricatures and illusions.Nebraska has many wonderful moments and all of them come along without fanfare, building one on another; little piles of sand mounting to bring the whole piece in one. The structure of this movie is as near to ideal as it gets. It adds and adds layers and events and meaning to the relationships within a family and between a son and his rather hapless father.The actors make this work so well. The comedy, the idiotic humor, the awkward silences and bitter stories out of the past are alive with humanity. The whole cast is superb. Dern's performance is almost like an old man from a Beckett play; white-haired and selfish, bitter and sad.The photography and design really add texture. The geometry of the towns and house on the landscape; the broad emptiness of the country create a sense of place. Alexander Payne has made a film to watch again.</fullReview>

It's about hope and having a meaning to live. Imagine yourself there, in the place of the protagonist. Old, alone and feeling emptiness on your life. You'll use all the means possible to get out of the stagnation, like in fact,everybody would do, and that happens frequently with people of that age. You see, a fake 1 million award to buy a truck is everything that moves the old protagonist. It looks unrealistic? Absolutely yes. But there is where the beauty of Nebraska lies. Is a metaphor, a metaphor that is present everyday, with persons of all ages. Searching a meaning for life. And I say: there isn't more intelligent, touching or beautiful existentialist works than Nebraska. What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is a masterpiece. An unique masterpiece. Is not a dry drama either. There is a lot of comedic moments on it, which can turn the experience even more refreshing. I rather consider it a dramedy than a drama, personally. The cinematography is beautiful, the black and white choice was excellent given the tone of the film. Anyway, you can't go wrong: watch it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska is a magnificent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The black-and-white cinematography and the minimalistic screenplay might suggest Nebraska is an art-house film. But there's nothing to worry about, because screenwriter Bob Nelson and director Alexander Payne bring an abundant level of emotion to every scene, making the film to transcend the family melodrama niche which is so common in independent cinema. The great Bruce Dern received deserved acclamation for his extraordinary performance in Nebraska, and the rest of the cast also brought an excellent work, highlighting Will Forte, who shows a considerable dramatic talent he had rarely shown during his years on Saturday Night Live. Nebraska isn't a movie for every taste, and I understand why some people could consider it slow and boring, but I found it to be an extraordinary film, with an unexpected deepness behind its ordinary characters, prosaic situations and mundane settings. I'm not an unconditional fan of Payne's, but I definitely think Nebraska is his best movie so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Hilarious &amp; Heartwarming Portrait of A Father-Son Relationship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written by Bob Nelson &amp; directed by Alexander Payne (Sideways &amp; The Descendants), Nebraska is the story of an aging, alcoholic father named Woody who takes a road-trip from Montana to Nebraska with his son, David, to collect a million dollar prize he thinks he won. Painting an amusing portrait of Woody Grant &amp; his extended family, this film presents Alexander Payne at the top of his game and is gorgeously captured in crisp black-n-white visual style &amp; brims with expressionless humor from start to finish.Payne's direction is very impressive &amp; his decision to shoot it in black &amp; white pays off tremendously well here, giving this film an ageless appeal &amp; adding a poetic touch to the entire story. The camera also captures the landscapes in all its grandeur while editing brings the pace down to move the story as slow as the daily lives of old people. The film may give an appearance of a snooze fest but the terrific use of humor keeps the plot &amp; characters flowing for us all the time. The music has a country feel &amp; some tracks are just heartwarming.Coming to the acting department, Bruce Dern delivers a swashbuckling performance as Woody Grant; a slightly demented father who is hellbent on going to Nebraska &amp; as the story progresses we get to see a tragic side of this old man too. Will Forte is in as David Grant; Woody's son who takes his father to Nebraska to shut him up for once &amp; slowly learns more interesting facts about his father while they're in Woody's hometown for a while. June Squibb plays Woody's wife &amp; steals every scene that she is in. The rest of the cast also chipped in with fine contributions &amp; puts up a family full of eccentric characters.On an overall scale, Nebraska is an immensely poignant yet hilarious adventure that's wonderfully directed, starkly written, brilliantly performed, beautifully photographed, carefully edited &amp; pleasantly scored. The best thing about this film is definitely its performances spearheaded by Bruce Dern &amp; greatly supported by Forte &amp; Squibb and hilariously explores the relationship between an estranged father &amp; confused son whose once stale relationship finds a new life on a pointless road-trip to Nebraska. One of the finest comedies of the year, Alexander Payne's latest is thoroughly recommended.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Master of Quirk Cinema Payne, still unable to jettison condescending standpoint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a lover of 'quirk', then you will enjoy 'Nebraska', the latest from the master of quirk himself, director Alexander Payne. Understand that there is a formula to quirky movies. The protagonists are always quirky themselves, with some glaring faults, but in the end quite sympathetic and lovable. That applies to Nebraska's main character, Woody Grant (solidly played by the veteran actor, Bruce Dern). Woody has numerous faults, principally that he's a curmudgeon and an alcoholic. Woody may be suffering from a touch of early onset dementia when a police officer finds him walking on the side of a highway, mumbling how he's determined to trek all the way to Nebraska on foot, in order to claim a $1 million Publisher's Clearing House sweepstakes notice he received in the mail. Woody's son David (played by comedian Will Forte, in a straight guy role), wants to prevent additional ill-fated wanderings, so he agrees to drive his father from their home in Billings, Montana, all the way to sweepstakes headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska. For me, Woody seems simply an irascible and stubborn curmudgeon, rather than an Alzheimer's victim, so I had trouble believing that he would actually believe that he was a sweepstakes winner.Once you accept the unlikely premise, it's not hard to believe what happens next. Basically Woody and David get waylaid after Woody goes on a bender, trips and falls (resulting in a gash on his head that requires stitches at the hospital) and then loses his dentures, forcing the hapless pair to back track to a railway yard where, after a short search, recover the old man's false teeth. With the day shot, David convinces Woody to go to his father's old haunting grounds in the town of 'Hawthorne', where they visit Woody's brother.At this point, the second half of the definition of the 'quirky movie' can be explained. The 'antagonists' who comprise these 'quirkfests' are not only 'quirky', but nasty too. Sometimes these characters are outright caricatures (such as the 'twins' who end up assaulting David, to get their hands on Woody's sweepstakes notice); or perhaps they're more nuanced like Ed (played by the other veteran in this picture, Stacy Keach). No matter how fine Payne manages to draw his antagonists, he can't escape accusations that he looks down on them.Payne's air of condescension has not gone unnoticed by a gaggle of professional film critics. Here are a few examples: A.A. Dowd (The A.V. Club): "It's when Nebraska veers off the road, and into the one-horse town David grew up in, that condescending comedy begins to take precedence."; Jessica Kiang (The Playlist): "?the rounding out of Woody's character and back-story happens largely at the expense of the local citizens, relatives and townspeople -- in trying to make us understand Woody, Payne kind of makes us despise almost everyone else, notably the film's "villain" Ed (the terrific Stacy Keach). There is a troubling air of condescension in the portrayal of a lot of these folks as either venal and grasping, or just plain stupid. ''; Lou Lumenick (NY Post): Bob Nelson's original script, a sort of unlikely cross between "The Last Picture Show'' and "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek,'' offers a biting satire of Midwestern life that Payne sometimes allows to border on condescension.''Payne depicts Woody's old friends and relatives in the old town all managing to take the low road, whether it involves hypnotically staring at a Sunday football game on TV en masse, some cheesy karaoke warbling and being stupid enough not to ask a few questions that would confirm that Woody did not win the $1 million. Things get even more ugly when the old friends start trying to hit Woody up for a piece of the sweepstakes winnings, claiming he borrowed money from them in the past. Fortunately for Woody, his equally curmudgeonly and foul-mouthed wife, Kate, intervenes, preventing the townspeople from inflicting further physical damage on her husband and sons.If there's anything redeeming about 'Nebraska', it's in the depiction of the bonding between father and son. David's gracious gift to Woody (in the form of a pickup truck trade-in), allows Woody to get in one last dig, at his unpleasant former friends. 'Nebraska' also benefits greatly from some gorgeous black and white cinematography which highlight the bleak but haunting Midwest landscapes. The acting here is quite good as the cast seem like they're straight out of the artist Grant Wood's masterpiece, 'American Gothic'. What's missing here is Payne's ability to sympathize with the crowd he's determined to criticize. For him, everything is 'black and white'; I say better to draw both your good guys and bad guys, in more nuanced 'shades of gray'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a piece of cinematographic art that oozes strong realism and deep humanity. It's darkly funny but also dramatically tough, and sometimes depressing in the way it depicts with no discounts the bleakness of a Midwestern family, where no trace of enthusiasm towards life and no hope are to be found. The characters are thoroughly depicted and superbly interpreted: the stubborn, alcoholic old man, the always complaining and brutal wife, the mild and caring son, and a whole world of miserable people around them. But despite the presence of different characters which help portray a specific tone and mood, the movie is more a father-son story than anything else, and the relationship between them is what touches most, but without a single hint of sentimentalism. The finale is really poignant with the idea that however insignificant one's life may seem, there is always some possible sense to be found and a bright side may arise from an aimless misadventure along the roads of a desolate land.</fullReview>

Filmmaker Alexander Payne continues his streak of making films about people struggling with terms of self-worth and supposedly impossible dreams with his latest about a Montana codger (Dern, low-key perfection) whose dogged determined trek to the titular state to claim his wins in a seemingly bogus million dollar jackpot that his beleaguered son (Forte, equally winning) agrees to help him make the odyssey. Along the way of pitfalls including a nasty wife (Squibb, whose constipated pug-like countenance is the perfect foil), duplicitous family and so-called-friends (an oily Keach) only empowers the frail old coot in his desire to gain what is his. While this is not Payne's best work it is ambitious with its bleak yet beautiful black and white cinematography by gifted Phedon Papamichael and a stream-lined script by Bob Nelson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another comfortably executed dramedy from Payne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne's follow-up to The Descendants is an amiable, bittersweet family comedy that turns its overwhelming slightness into an advantage. While it may not have attention-grabbing stars or subject matter, Payne's latest is another comfortably executed dramedy, even though it's hardly essential viewing for anyone but Payne's biggest fans.The opening shots of Nebraska show Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) hobbling along on foot in his hometown of Billings, Montana to the state of Nebraska. He's on his way to claim a (bogus) reward of $1 million, much to the frustration of his sons David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk), and his wife Kate (June Squibb). Rather than dwell on the reasons for Woody's determination, Bob Nelson's script has David give in to the idea of propping up Woody's fantasy for a few days. This gives the film an early chance to jump to the bulk of its limited story, set among Woody's relatives in his hometown in Nebraska.And, try as David (and eventually Ross and Kate) may, no one else in the family wants to give up the idea that Woody has suddenly become a millionaire. Like a group of cuddly, wrinkly parasites, the Grant family starts cozying up to Woody in hopes that they can get some of the winnings. Folks outside of the family, like Woody's old business partner Ed (Stacy Keach), are less pleasant about it. David remains uneasy during the entire journey, while Woody nods along, too worn down and generous to say 'no' to anyone.Even though it's tempting to nag and ask why David never cuts the journey short, Payne and Nelson make the open-ended journey a pleasant one. Though the film was hit with claims of patronizing its mid-Western characters, there are enough little details that give the ensemble enough plausible humanity. Some, like a pair of David's creepy cousins, are broader than others, but Payne's simple direction keeps things from sliding into cheap mockery. The films's vision of its setting is best encapsulated in a lengthy shot of the men in the family sitting, stone faced, as they watch TV and make conversation that would barely pass as small talk.When Nebraska arrives at scenes like this, it can be enormously entertaining. Despite the tinge of melancholy inherent in the premise, there are any number of laugh out loud scenes, many of which come from Squibb as the feisty, unfiltered Kate. With so much glum small talk and sinister sucking up, Kate's interjections enliven the film and provide Nebraska with its high points.What keeps Nebraska from being a more memorable addition to Payne's resume is the work from the film's pair of leads. Forte, known for his outrageous Saturday Night Live characters, is effectively understated. There are hints in the performance that he's capable of mining even richer characterization if given stronger material. Dern, meanwhile, is reduced to being distant and occasionally crotchety. In a year with any number of powerful, dynamic male performances, it's puzzling that Dern has gathered such acclaim, even picking up the Best Actor prize at Cannes earlier this year.Once the film arrives at its conclusion, and all of the emotional secrets are dragged out into the sunlight, you can already feel it evaporating. Woody's determination is so single-minded and lacking in interesting angles or details that he becomes a mere sounding board, rarely able to throw anything back. The role is passive to a fault. Just as Woody sits around while others talk, bicker, and scheme, Dern mostly sits and nods while others act. With such a paper-thin core, it's no wonder that Nebraska doesn't linger on the mind once the credits roll. Whether this or not this ends up being a transitional film for Payne, it's also an unquestionably unmemorable, albeit enjoyable, outing. Jordan Baker, FMR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human Echoes Rundown: Nebraska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ou could be forgiven for thinking of Nebraska as an art film. Shot in black and white, nominated for an Academy Award, and seen by next to no one, it certainly seems to check all the boxes of the sort of insufferable self-important Oscar-bait movie the average movie-goer has come to disdain. But Nebraska is far more earthy and relatable than it first appears.NEBRASKAThe story follows Woody Grant, an ordinary man at the end of an ordinary life, who has convinced himself that the sweepstakes letter he received in the mail is actually worth a million dollars, and who is hell-bent on collecting the sum in Lincoln, Nebraska.His son David tries to dissuade him at first, but Grant is determined to collect his winnings, and so, hoping for nothing more than a little more time with his father, David agrees to take him on the 800 mile pilgrimage to the office of the sweepstakes company. The two stop off along the way in Woody's old stomping grounds in Rapid City South Dakota, and it is there that the bulk of the plot takes place.We see Woody encounter old friends, and family, and as the story unfolds we come to understand that there is more to him than his silent demenor indicates.Nebraska is a movie about what it means to get old. The black and white cinematography is not so much about artistic flourish as it is a demonstration of a life that has been drained of color. More than half of the characters appearing on screen are over sixty, and they're all tired and ugly and bored with life.But when folks around the town get wind of Woody's supposed winnings, things begin to change. Excitement begins to bleed back into their lives again, and the story which at first seemed doomed to be a plodding character piece picks up speed. Woody becomes something of a local celebrity, a fact that is hilariously frustrating to David who tries over and over to convince his father's friends and family that the winnings aren't real with increasingly poor results. Old friends and enemies come out of the woodwork sniffing for Woody's faux fortune, and greed and jealousy rear their heads in unexpected frequently humorous ways.Woody's wife, June, adds even more life to the picture when she shows up in Rapid City. Her relationship with Woody is frequently combative, but her brash attitude and candid words make her one of the most fascinating characters in the film. Her candor about her past sexual conquests shocks her sons, but her uninhibited voice balances out Woody's stony reticence perfectly. Her frequent nagging of her husband seems harsh at first, but as the film progresses we come to see that their relationship is deeper than and stronger than it first appears.Nebraska takes a look back at life's journey from the end of the road. Woody is not a remarkable human being, except in the way that we are all remarkable. His life has no great significance, but for better or worse it is his life, years piled upon years all leading to a grey twilight. But in that twilight he manages to find a stubborn spark of hope, and that spark lights a fire that burns in strange and beautiful ways in his life and the lives of the people that love him.For more reviews like this check out HumanEchoes.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Nebraska", a story about an old man who thinks he has won a million bucks, will leave you feeling like you did.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have won $1,000,000? if you have and return the winning numbers. Bruce Dern's character, Woody Grant, focuses on the first part of that sentence when he receives a sweepstakes letter in the mail, but doesn't understand (or doesn't want to understand) the second part. He's determined to personally claim "his million dollars" by taking the letter from his home in Montana to the offices of the marketing company who sent him the letter in "Nebraska" (R, 1:55).Woody is a gruff old man who doesn't have much going on in his life and is willing to walk the 900 miles to Lincoln, Nebraska if he has to (and tries to do so). His long-suffering sons, David and Ross, played, respectively, by Will Forte and Bob Odenkirk, and Woody's pistol of a wife, Kate (Jane Squibb) are all unable to talk him out of it. David finally agrees to drive his dad to Lincoln. The trip takes them through Woody's hometown where we meet a number of his family members and old friends. Woody begins talking about the fortune he says he has won and word spreads quickly. Everyone enthusiastically congratulates Woody and he becomes the talk of the small town. He enjoys his new found local celebrity, until some of his family and friends start sticking their hands out, deciding that Woody owes them money from back in the day.In the end, it doesn't matter whether Woody gets the money or not. This film is much more about the journey than the destination. In content and tone, "Nebraska" has elements of 1986's "Nothing in Common", 1998's "Waking Ned Devine" and 1999's "The Straight Story", while, at times, feeling like a Coen Brothers movie. "Nebraska" is charming, funny and heart-warming. The film appears in black and white, which serves to enhance its simple, rustic feel. Besides, the movie's characters were colorful enough for me. Most of the actors are good fits for their roles, but Forte is miscast. His acting skills served the broad comedy of Saturday Night Live well, but aren't well-suited to the subtle comedy (and the serious moments) of this film. I found his presence distracting. Odenkirk was very good, and I'll let the Oscar nominations for Dern and Squibb (plus director Alexander Payne, screenwriter Bob Nelson and the film, as a whole) speak for themselves. "Nebraska" will leave YOU feeling like a million bucks. "A-"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, maybe I am a bit late reviewing this movie, but I had to.This movie got my attention long time ago, but I just couldn't see it when it got released in 2013.It was a great story about a broken relationship of a son and his father. Dialogs are pretty much everything in the movie. Catches your attention in every moment till' the end of it.Acting was just fabulous. Characters are so well played that I even felt identified with them.There's one thing that catched my attention too, it was that this movie shows how interested the people is, and it's sad to say it, but unfortunately we are that way and always gonna be. Coming back to the movie, it is even funny at some times. So if you've not seen it yet (witch is probably wrong) or you are thinking of watching it and for some reason you are here and see my review, I strongly recommend this movie to you.9/10</fullReview>

I will turn into the cast now to give him his right .. the actors were great ,especially the great one , Bruce Dern .. this man is incredible .. he could get deep into the character which I say that this character is too difficult .. But this man he made it .. and the screenplay I couldn't say any thing about it .. It was professionally made .. and at the last I'll take about the director the man that was able to make you live in the old's world and show you their suffering and show you even they are very old but they still have a message even if it is wining the lottery</fullReview>

		<fullReview>NebraskaProducer, director, and writer Alexander Payne wears many hats when he is in charge of a project. He selected director as his primary hat for his motion picture Nebraska. The story takes place in that Midwestern state as we learn of the Grant family. Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) has realized that he is now an old man. Cranky, aloof, and in the beginning states of dementia, Woody gets a new spark in life when he discovers that he has won a lottery. All he has to do is go to another town and claim his winnings.His wife Kate (June Squibb) does not love Woody. She is short on patience and even shorter on compassion. Woody seeks the help of his son David (Will Forte) to help him claim his prize. The movie is shot in black and white and has a dusty feel to it from beginning to end. The extras are country people from Nebraska and they add a feeling of authenticity to the rusting, set in the past, dying ambiance of the area.Nebraska is a story of fathers and sons, a story of forgiveness and grace, and the love of a son for his dad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Dern captured me during the whole movie. His acting as demented old man was so brilliant. He didn't even talk that much the whole movie, but I can't help but wonder what's going on within the old man's head. I found my self to feel empathy with the son who drove his father all the way from Billings to Nebraska. All for the million dollars he knew was a scam. On the way to Nebraska, the father and son stopped in the city where the father grew up and the story started to stir from there. The characters slowly revealed them self and it was interesting for me. It's a rather slow-paced movie with a predictable ending, but I found my self enjoyed this more than i thought i would. This isn't a movie for everybody, but if you want to watch a movie where you more care about what's going on throughout the movie or the characters than what's going to happen in the end, then you should try it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Picture of a Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska is a movie with a small scope that can easily slip past your attention. Through quiet retrospection, it opens a window to the life of Woody Grant, a stubborn and serious man who is struggling to adjust to the final, sedentary stage of life brought on by age in mind and body. Woody, played by Bruce Dern, is deemed a millionaire by a piece of junk advertisement in the mail, and embarks on a trip from his hometown in Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim his prize. Woody's son David (Will Forte) is compelled to join his father in his journey, to both watch after the old man's increasingly errant behavior and spend some time with him in what could be one of their last ventures beyond the town's borders.Bruce Dern is the unquestioned star of Nebraska in his understated portrayal of a man from a bygone era. Despite Woody's reluctance for dialogue and expression, it is hard not to come to love the old man and his drive to keep moving to the point of running himself into the ground. The film's director, Alexander Payne, does an excellent job in bringing out every piece of background we can get on a man who would never tell you anything himself. Nebraska has a melancholy to it, enumerating the passage faced at the end of life, where we come to terms with our own limitations. Woody isn't at his most glorious age, but he is here nonetheless, and he is still capable of making a mark. The film feels like gentle assertion about the impact a man can have on his world, regardless of its size. The instrumental soundtrack of Nebraska plays a critical role in reflecting the combination of vigor and quietude, passive reflection and the melancholic passage of time. Nebraska makes no dramatic statements; it only asks the viewer to briefly attend to a snapshot of a quiet life in a rural town. Afterwards, it will gently pass into a memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminds you of what movies can be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one presents fully-realized, intelligent family drama like Alexander Payne and in an era fully dominated by superhero sequels he should be put on the Federal Endangered Species list and carefully preserved. The simple tale of a man at the end of his life trying for a little dignity benefits from acting played with perfect pitch across the characters. All credit to the casting of Will Forte as an Everyman trying to manage his unruly aging parents and setting up scenes for other actors to shine in. Bruce Dern, Brian Hennehy and Bob Odenkirk all put in on-the-mark performances lending an also photo-realistic portrayal of small town life among people with small dreams and long-held grudges. The bleak black-and-white cinematography makes the small town of Hawthorne, Nebraska and the larger town of Billings, Montana characters in themselves interacting with the human characters no differently than if they could have a speaking part. The simple plot unfolds seamlessly with characters making the choices they would actual make if they were not just fictional. The simple beauty of the ending makes for a bittersweet denouement worthy of a Springsteen song. In short, while it may lack sound and fury, the sheer artistry of Payne makes this a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The slow pace and single-minded plot slowly reveals a cast you're terrified you'll someday be able to sympathize with, and sets the mood perfectly for when things really begin to happen an hour in. Payne has crafted characters with nothing to hide, and lets the viewer decide what they think of them while looking at both the good and the bad. This isn't a highlight reel, it's a behind the scenes look into the lives of the American middle class. For those of you like my girlfriend who find it difficult to make it to the extended climax I beg you, if the name "Ed Pegram" doesn't elicit an immediate surge of hatred then you haven't made it far enough to know what you're missing out on.

		<shortDescription>A top film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a prime example of how a movie can surprise you, in a very good way.The plot is simple: A grouchy old man believes that he has won a million dollar lottery and must travel from Montana to Nebraska (in winter) to collect it. His estranged son finally agrees to drive him there despite the disappointment he knows waiting at the end of the trip.If that is not the epitome for the makings of a dull movie, then consider that it is shot in black &amp; white, only adding to the gloominess of the story. Look at the poster for the film - does this inspire confidence that this will be a great movie?So here is the surprise, the movie is excellent - emotionally moving without being maudlin. The witty dialog, the realism, the diverse characters, and the touching story, as well as the superb acting by the entire cast, including Oscar-nominees Bruce Dern and June Squibb for their roles here and Will Forte playing a non-comedic role, push this film beyond anyone's expectations. While the story is a little slow to develop, that time gives us a chance to let the characters shine in their own right. Director Alexander Payne adds to his string of excellent films (Election, Sideways, The Descendants).For my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why It's an Important Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will not find a lot of girls in this particular film. In fact, I don't remember I saw any of them at all. Moreover, it's in black and white, which might not satisfy some of Alexander Payne fans, he is the director by the way! However, it is a blast! The movie got high rate on IMDb, 7.8 so far. Also, the movie achieved 6 important Oscar nominations, with no wins unfortunately. But this is not the point I want to make about importance.First, let me tell you the story in brief. It is about an old father decided to walk from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska thinking that he won a million dollar and he wants to go and collect the prize. His son knows that he does not win any money but because the father's high insistence of going there for the prize, even by walking! the son decides to take a week off from his job and have a road trip with his father to Lincoln. On their way they stop in a small town located in central Nebraska, where the father grew up, to settle in his cousin house for a few days. When the people of the town knew about the prize, some of them thought of taking advantage of the poor old man by accusing him with some kind of debts in order to get the money from him!The message that I was thinking of that this movie has is the family relationship. That is what I like in some of Payne's movies. He gives a lot of value for the idea of family in my opinion by showing how the son wants to help his father to achieve his goal, even though the son knows that the goal is not really exist. It is an important message for everyone thought of neglecting this valuable aspect or not giving much time for it. That is why Nebraska is an important movie. Thank you so much Alexander Payne.It is also so funny by the way!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie about what it's like to watch your parents grow old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I was kind of hesitant towards watching this movie since it was in black and white and I wasn't really in the mood at the time for anything arts-y or high brow (which is what most modern black and white movies are like), but was pleasantly surprised by a movie that while still quite sophisticated and mature, is very accessible. This movie is not hilarious (it's not supposed to be) and most of the scenes evoke audible chuckles at best, but the comedic timing of the cast (especially Bruce Dern and Will Forte) made for a very amusing movie that never really felt boring or too sentimental. Bruce Dern's performance is by far the best part of the movie. He is the classic "confused old person" and will definitely remind people of their parents or grandparents when they're watching the movie. For a comedic film, the tone is actually quite subdued and even depressing at times which is why I think the movie's success would not have been as great if the movie wasn't in black and white as it really adds to this idea of approaching death while reflecting on what's passed. The movie had no real faults and feels very satisfying by the end. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone with eyes as it is a nice little film that is definitely one of the best comedies in recent memory. Also, the score is really quite good and feels like Nebraska."I never knew the son of a bitch even wanted to be a millionaire! He should have thought about that years ago and worked for it!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Napoleon Dynamite" For the Older Viewers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm trying to think of what was wrong about "Nebraska," and I could find very little to pan. After seeing this quiet and effective movie, memories of "Napoleon Dynamite" came into my head, not because "Nebraska" had any storyline at all like it, but that this film was filled with characters that fit in with the lifestyle and landscape. I figured "Nebraska" might be filled with heavy emotional themes but it was the opposite. Rather than a yarn of an elderly man facing death, the film places the audience into the front seat of Woody's family and allows us - like Woody's son - to journey through the miles to learn just who they are, discovering why Woody became salty. It's as if the miles of distance between Montana and Woody's ultimate destination of Nebraska helped roll back the years while peeling open his history as Woody revisited his family along the way. As the journey ended, I wound up realizing how different I felt about everyone, which made for a really profound journey of thoughts about family and friends. "Napoleon Dynamite" had that country-simple charm of young characters with really unique quirks, and "Nebraska" also exploits that similar charm in which the people involved are middle-aged and elderly. Add to this film, some great B&amp;W cinematography (the DP made a statement from the very first scene, how well the film would be crafted), fine writing filled with wit while avoiding sentimentality, and effective musical scoring, and you have a movie that I predict can be watched decades later. One could never tell that Bruce Dern in real life runs marathons, because he embraced the character of an alcoholic whose body has deteriorated more swiftly than people his age in the movie. Bob Odenkirk (Ross), June Squibb (Kate), Will Forte (David) and Stacy Keach (Ed Pegram) highlighted a terrific cast - it seems that cast and crew truly believed in this project and they put their best efforts into a charming film that I urge movie buffs to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about Payne's subtle observations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The name Alexander Payne is synonymous with the road movie, mainly thanks to the flawless Sideways, and to a lesser degree About Scmidt. His film, Nebraska, is his third foray into the genre and like both those films it encompasses a lot more themes and touches on a lot more emotions than your average 'road' film. Primarily there's the Father-Son relationship, then family in general. Dig a little deeper and we find a fascinating and subtle commentary on the undercurrent of economic struggles sweeping across small-town America and yet, at its center, Nebraska is a sweet, hopeful, heart-warming film.The story follows thirty-something year old David, working in a local electrics store, going through some sort of break up; and his Father Woody, a doddery alcoholic who begins to lose his grip on reality when he swallows a scam telling him he's won a million dollars. The scam tells him to go to Lincoln, Nebraska, and so he does.At first David tries to get it through to his father that he is being conned, however these attempts are utterly futile. Subsequently, recognizing his Father's desire not for the million dollars, but for something to live for, some sort of hope or fulfillment, David decides to drive him to Nebraska.From here on, Payne slowly and expertly uncovers the layers of the difficult relationship between the two men. Through marvellous and sparse dialogue scenes filled with both humour and pain the audience begins to understand the relationship from both sides.Bruce Dern's performance is one of those performances where his consistent walk and broken, bumbling, drunken voice seem totally unique and yet utterly believable. Throughout the film he carries on his back Woody's life time of pain and unhappiness. A key scene being where David quizzes his Father over his love for his wife, David's Mother, Woody's disinterest and almost lack of understanding of the inquisition demonstrates his characters life of disappointment and martial disillusionment.Dern's performance is a treat, but he is backed up by solid supporting cast. Will Forte as his son David gets a difficult role just right. His performance is understated, as it needed to be, and it complements Dern's perfectly. His glimpses of pain over his Father's condition and their broken relationship are wrapped up in a soft-spoken, polite demeanor. It allows for a much more fascinating study than if two alpha males had been scripted in the lead roles.June Squibb also gives a solid performance as Woody's nagging Wife and David's nagging Mother. As does Stacy Keach, Woody's ex-business partner, and the villain of the piece who comes looking for his dues when he hears Woody's news.The script is tight and concise. I spent the first half of the film trying to determine the reasons for the black and white photography yet what slowly dawned on me, as Payne revealed more about the world these characters inhabit, is that their world is a very black and white place, in more ways than one.It's a delightful film, an expert character study and a subtle observation of the difficulties of family relationships. Furthermore it is an analysis of the dread of small town life. Obviously in this case it is referencing small town America, presently. But in truth it could apply to any geographical location that finds itself stuck in a root.Nebraska calls to mind Peter Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show. There's the black and white photography, used to highlight the total and utter blandness of life, the small town and the meandering characters in search of something or nothing. Nebraska however has more character depth and is an all round more rewarding film than Bogdanovich's, which is in itself a classic of sorts.The audience comes away from Nebraska feeling an enormous sense of satisfaction with this sweet analysis of family, and specifically Father/Son, relationships.A friend recently told me that although he felt Nebraska is good, he thought that we've seen this same stuff from Payne before. I disagree, although not as magnificent or hilarious a film as Sideways, Nebraska goes deeper into the pain of its characters and analyzes much more so the pain of the world around them. It's all about Payne's subtle observations.</fullReview>

Characters are so lovely, two charming elderly people, also funny especially Kate Grant . On the one hand Bruce Dern with a performance to remember. He was amazing in this movie, a character that fits him. On the other hand June Squibb, a lovely and funny grandma that everyone would like to have. These two characters makes movie even more loved.I highly recommend Nebraska. It's a movie that everyone should watch and see how you should treat you parents even that sometimes they are pointless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I can't tell you how many old Western movie and TV episodes I've seen Bruce Dern in; he's usually cast as some outlaw or sleazy looking villain like the character he portrayed in Eastwood's "Hang 'Em High". All those roles led up to seeing him here as the brain-addled old man who insists on collecting a million dollar prize in one of those magazine subscription promotions. I'm trying to think who else might have done a good job with the character of Woody Grant. Dennis Hopper comes to mind but he's passed on, and Jack Nicholson would have given it a pretty good go. But Dern pulls it off admirably and this is probably the best work I've ever seen him perform.Now June Squibb - I can't say I recognized her right off the bat but I did see her in "About Schmidt" but that seems like ages ago. Talk about your politically incorrect or any other context you might come up with. Come to think of it, she kind of reminds me of my own Mom who's now eighty six. There must be something about growing old that allows one to shed inhibitions and tell the world to just go f--- themselves. That cemetery scene was a hoot and a half, and you can usually get me to crack up with a single hoot. Kate Grant, you go girl.The thing is, if you haven't grown up in a small town, this picture might seem to be offering a caricature of what life might be like outside the sophisticated 'big city'. But from personal experience, I can relate to characters like Ed Pegram and idiot brothers like Bart and Cole because I've been there. Maybe not to the same extreme, but you get the idea with the way director Payne presents his characters. In a way, these goof-balls are a lot more real than you'll find in the latest action adventure shoot 'em up. So even if the pace of the movie is a lot slower than many viewers would expect, I tend to savor the build up to those defining moments when Woody selects his Prize Winner hat or when son David (Will Forte) is startled to learn that his old man was a Korean War veteran who almost left his mother for an Indian squaw. Now that would have been some main event - old Kate against the Indian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Alexander Payne (Election, About Schmidt, Sideways, The Descendants), this was the highly rated and nominated independent film of the year, and I was super keen to see it. Basically in Billings, Montana elderly Woody Grant (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bruce Dern) is approaching dementia and he is becoming delusional, this is due to a lifetime of heavy drinking, he is married to Kate (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated June Squibb) and has two adult sons, David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk). Woody's latest belief is that he has $1,000,000 in a Mega Sweepstakes Marketing prize draw, David looks at the letter and realises that this is a mail scam to make a person purchase magazine subscriptions, Woody insists he wants to collect his "winnings" himself at the company headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska, he does not trust the U.S. postal service to mail the certificate. His younger son, electronics salesman David has just broken up with his girlfriend and needs a distraction, he agrees to drive him to Nebraska, just to humour him, but also on the way Woody wants to stop in Hawthorne, Nebraska, where he grew up, for a family reunion with news anchor son Ross and harsh speaking Catholic wife Kate and to settle some scores. David does not want Woody to tell anyone in Hawthorne about the "$1 million", but the news does soon spread and colours the father and son's interactions with their relatives, old friends and colleagues, including with Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach), Woody's overbearing old business partner. The time David and his father spend together is also illuminating, he learns why Woody is the way he has always been, the relationship between him and his mother, also concerning himself and brother Ross, and he finds out the true reason Woody wants a $1,000,000, he wants is to buy a new pickup truck, which he has never had, he wants to buy an air compressor, to replace one stolen from him decades ago, and he wants to leave a legacy for his sons. They finally arrive at the marketing agency to collect the money, of course Woody did not win, he takes a consolation gift, a hat saying "Prize Winner", but as a goodwill gesture David sells his car to buy Woody a new pickup truck, along with a new air compressor, driving back David lets Woody drive the truck for all to see, some smiling and some looking perplexed, Woody says goodbye to Hawthorne, and David and he swap seats to drive home. Also starring Mary Louise Wilson as Aunt Martha, Rance Howard as Uncle Ray and Home Alone's Devin Ratray as Cole. Dern is fantastic playing both the mad old man and the sympathetic booze- addled father, and Quibb is hilarious in her moments as she says before she thinks many outlandish things, filmed in black and white with beautiful imagery of Midwest America, this is both a funny road trip stopping once in a while for laughable conversations and conversations, and it is a revealing bonding between father and son, it is witty, lovely and poignant, a great road movie. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Cinematography and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical and Best Screenplay. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was never too dramatic and never too comedic, it was just right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At its core, Nebraska is a touching and amusing film about a delusional alcoholic, played very well by Bruce Dern, whom believes has won a million dollars. This belief he holds throughout the film is what holds together its sentimental tone. However, just as Nebraska is shot in black and white, it also carries a comedic undertone to it that accompanies its more gloomier mood, which can arguably be credited to June Squibb's performance as Dern's judgemental yet hilarious wife. A performance that surprised me was Will Forte and his ability to draw out sympathy for Dern's character. Not to be overshadowed by the acting department, Alexander Payne does a magnificent job directing Nebraska. He has a keen eye for creating the mood of the scene with the use of the music. However, when watching Nebraska, one can't help to notice the set design. It does its job in drawing the audience into the film's time and place, which really helps us connect with the characters, not that we weren't already capable of that thanks to Bruce Dern's Oscar worthy performance. I felt that the same music track was playing in the movie too many times, that it began to make my ears numb to it. Apart from being a bit too predictable and having a particularly slow middle, this movie does succeed in what it's trying to accomplish. Overall, Nebraska was a movie that was never too dramatic and never too comedic, it was just right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fancy one million dollars?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good film on every aspect and every detail: the story, the plot, the acting, the scenes, the landscape, the real sceneries of interiors and exteriors and the image framings. An old ailing man, addicted to booze convinces himself that he has won one million dollars in some lottery and he must collect it in Lincoln, Nebraska, about two thousand miles away (he lives in Montana). He doesn't listen to his sons and wife that keep telling him he hasn't won anything because this is only a trick to lead him to buy some stuff like magazines. But he is so stubborn about getting on his way even alone that his youngest son agrees to take him there. On their way they stop at the small town in Nebraska where they have lived many years before and they still have relatives and old friends. These become convinced that the old man had effectively won such a fortune and from then on we watch a few incidents of greed natural to human nature which are very well acted and depicted in the movie. But in parallel we also see the strong affective relationship between father and son, restrained on the former and much more patent in the latter. All this is shown with great realism and psychological veracity in what concerns good and bad sentiments. One last word to stress the excellent performance of Bruce Dern as the old man in a very difficult role indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soulful &amp; Perfect Non-Pretentious Family Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is one of my favorite directors. I believe that human emotions is captured the best way in his movies amongst the current crop of directors. "Nebraska" is a family drama genre movie dealing with the relationship between an extremely old and mentally fragile father and his not-so-young son and how their relationship change after the father is sure that he has won a lottery of a million dollars and is willing to visit to a far away place to retrieve the prize money.Cast wise, Alexander Payne and his casting team has been a genius considering his previous movies. Bruce Dern (Father), Will Forte (Son) and June Aquibb (Mother) are the soul of the movie. The performance of Bruce Dern is an act of perfection and no word is sufficient enough to appreciate it. Will Forte plays the role of the son so well that it surprises me that he is mostly a stand up comedian by profession. June Aquibb provided comic relief in such a wonderful manner that you can't escape smiling. Rest supporting cast is so wonderful, each performing their role with unique mix of seriousness and comic.I wouldn't say any negative about this movie, even if it may be gazing at my face throughout the movie cause I love Alexander Payne's movies. Each and every aspect of movie making, let it be storyline, black &amp; white shooting, cinematography, casting, performance, music is simply done superbly.Overall Rating: 09/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Beautiful, Touching, Sentimental Road Trip Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been to Nebraska. I've had long road trips, but they never looked anything like this. This film made a long drive a beautiful, sentimental journey filled with meaning and depth and hope. The scenery was awe- inspiring, but it was the story of this very determined old man that made this film a masterpiece. Bruce Dern played elderly coot to the hilt. He was determined, hard-headed and cantankerous. But he was also so hopeful that it was kind of painful to watch. He was both funny and a little bit sad. The whole story was done so well. The characters were in full blooming color, despite this black and white film. This family had depth. And the supporting characters were hilarious in that greedy, hand-in- your-pocket kind of way. I really enjoyed the movie from start to finish. Well done. And on my next road trip, I'll pay a little closer attention to the landscape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The new movie by director Alexander Payne has Bruce Dern and June Squibb giving the most hilarious performances throughout the entire film. The movie tells the story about an alcoholic father named Woody T. Grant (played by Bruce Dern) and his son David (played by Will Forte) end up traveling to Lincoln Nebraska to claim a $ 1,000,000.00 prize (but it turns out to be a false errand. This is another film that works as a comedy more than a drama because I didn't find the movie to be dramatic i found it to be very comedic. But to be honest there was one performance that I found to be really annoying and that was by June Squibb because every line she had to me they were just very unnecessary which had her son annoyed. But to be honest Payne has crafted a near masterpiece that was shot in black and white.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film had hardly started and I could already feel the tugging at my heartstrings, Bruce Dern had me at hello and his amazing supporting cast thereafter, including but not limited to; Will Forte, June Squibb &amp; Stacy Keach. It has been suggested that this modern day marvel of a film only appeals to people who can relate to it but I beg to differ. I did not grow up in rural America nor rural anywhere for that matter. Listen, the film had heart and filming it in black and white only added to its existing allure. It had all the right elements; great script, great backdrop, great cast, compelling story lines, great performances, great pop-up characters, the right amount of up and down moments, excellent camera work, symbolism occurring naturally without it having to be spoon-fed to its audience; all of this plus America's great countryside and winding roads ever beauteous and majestic serving perfectly as backdrop and silent character. Keach (an actor known for his amazing voice and voice-over talent) even sings at some point before solidifying himself as the movie's main villain. You know what? This film was perfect. It's the kind of must-see cinematographic brilliance that you'd willingly forgive its faltering and flaws if any.</fullReview>

Will Forte is his son David, who knows it's not true but decides to humor him and drive him from their home in Billings, Montana, to Lincoln, Nebraska. Along with June Squibb as Dern's wife and Bob Odenkirk as David's brother, they stop at Woody and his wife's hometown of Hawthorne to visit old friends. I'll just now say this was quite a moving drama with some humorous moments concerning exploring the family past and how that affected their present selves.

		<shortDescription>A work of art on many levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in glorious black-and-white, Alexander Payne's "Nebraska" captures the stark beauty of the American Midwest better than almost any movie I can remember. Set against the bleak backdrop of a high plains winter, it's a "road picture" in which the characters travel through a seemingly unending expanse of lonely highways, leafless trees, peeling clapboard buildings and dusty, windswept streets in towns that haven't changed all that much since the 1950s. Like a land frozen in time, it's a place where the tales are tall, the fields are parched, and the accents are as flat as the limitless terrain. Filtered through a dreamy half-light, the imagery turns spareness and homogeneity into art. The travelers in this case are the Grant family, formerly of Nebraska, now residents of Billings, Montana. Woody is the patriarch of the group who's convinced that he's won a million dollars in what everyone else recognizes as nothing more than a marketing scam designed to rope in newspaper and magazine subscriptions. Woody, however, is dead-set on traveling to Lincoln to pick up his prize. As a means of both humoring him and getting him to shut up about it, his younger son, David, agrees to drive Woody to the state capital, stopping off to visit some of the relatives and old friends who still live in the town where the old man grew up, married and started a family. Eventually, David's mom and older brother join them for the impromptu reunion that results from the visit.With an Oscar-nominated screenplay by Bob Nelson, "Nebraska" is extremely perceptive about the complex dynamics that make up parent/child relationships, especially when the parent is a cantankerous alcoholic who may just be slipping into early-stage dementia and the child a mild-mannered, dutiful adult who seems to be using his own parents' less-than-ideal marriage as an excuse to avoid taking the matrimonial plunge himself. Yet, for all the seeming dysfunction, in the end, "Nebraska" emerges as a moving tribute to the enduring bonds of family. For while David may have issues of his own with Woody - mainly resentment for his years of parental disinterest brought on by his alcoholism - he'll be damned if he's going to let anyone else make a mockery of him. What's amazing is how much we see of ourselves reflected in these characters. Woody represents the elderly holding onto their last remaining shreds of dignity while bit by bit the ravages of time and aging take their toll. And even though David has entered that stage where the son must now become parent to the father, he's determined to do so without robbing his old man of the dignity that each of us is entitled to when we come to the end of our road. Fortune or no fortune, this turns out to be a healing trip for both David and his dad, and who can put a price on that?The humor is as dry and unaffected as the setting, as the Grants voice their many concerns about the situation they find themselves in and each other. Plus, they have to contend with an assortment of ne'er-do-well relatives who sit around all day watching "Golden Girls" reruns and plotting how to get their hands on some of Woody's "fortune." Then there's David's mother, Kate, a sharp-tongued, long-suffering woman who's put up with Woody's petulant personality for just about as long as she can at this point. She's clearly at the end of her rope with Woody, yet as with David, we sense that there is something holding the couple together, something we have trouble seeing yet are somehow made to feel. And that is as it should be with family.If the visuals were not so stunning, one might almost be tempted to label "Nebraska" an "actors' picture," for rarely do we see performances of this caliber in a single film. As Woody, Bruce Dern injects an amazing pathos into his portrait of a man who may be slowly losing his grip on his memory, his vigor and his independence but who is determined to go down fighting, not allowing any outside naysayers and skeptics to rob him of his one final dream, quixotic though it may be. And who could have imagined that Will Forte, hitherto known for his cranked-up comic turns on "Saturday Night Live" and "30 Rock," was concealing such a gift for understated emotion and low-keyed humor? Forte provides the reasoned and reasonable center of gravity that such a tale needs to avoid spinning off into undisciplined absurdity or indulging in a too-knowing condescension. It's a true breakthrough performance. And the marvelous June Squibb steals every scene she's in as Woody's lifelong bete noire, matching her husband dig for dig and barb for barb every step of the way. Each of these actors makes us care deeply for their characters inspiring us to laugh with rather than at them. There are also fine performances by Stacy Keach and Bob Odenkirk, among others.And, saving the best for last, we must now genuflect before the brilliant Phedon Papamichael for his incomparable cinematography which sees to it that the image is every bit as important as every other element in the movie. So beautiful it almost hurts, "Nebraska" may be the most perfect blend of form and content we've come across in quite some time.</fullReview>

Woody, living in Billings, Montana, believes he has won a million dollars from a magazine sweepstakes; and sets out on foot, walking to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim his winnings. Every time his wife(June Squibb)finds him missing, adult son David(Will Forte)gets the call to go find him...yep, walking to Nebraska. Finally David calls in sick from selling stereos and reluctantly takes a road trip, so his dad can claim his fortune. Along the way they stop and visit friends and relatives whom think Woody should share his new wealth...after all for some reason, everyone seems to remember that the old alcoholic owes them money.NEBRASKA is filmed in outstanding black &amp; white, with beautiful scenery in the eye of the beholder. The dialogue is wry and humorous without cracking a smile. At times on the road, I expect to hear Bruce Springsteen or John Mellencamp to bust out in song...no such luck. Dern is absolutely great in this role. My favorite scene is where Squibb raises her skirt over a grave marker...showing what was missed out on. Supporting cast includes: Stacy Keach, Bob Odenkirk, Mary Louise Wilson and Rance Howard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska's Uplifting Roadtrip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed in black and white, Nebraska brings us on a stark journey that a son takes into his father's past. Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is an elderly man with the beginnings of dementia who receives a Sweepstakes Letter that he believes entitles him to a million dollars if he can get it to Lincoln Nebraska in time. He is so insistent that he has won, despite the pleas of others that it is a scam, that his son David (Will Forte) decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln so that he will know once and for all that it is not in fact a winning ticket.During the trip we meet many of Woody's family and old friends, and David hears many stories of his father's past. Much of his father's behaviour is explained, and David learns of many events that shaped his father's behaviour and character. This journey into the past is supported by certain devices like the non presence of technological devices like cell phones and computers in the film. This film concentrates on showing us the importance of simple things like the love between family members in an age where digital technology is increasingly detaching us from true emotional bonds and experiences. By spending time together with his mother and father, David is able to see that what their marriage is not as dysfunctional as it seems. His mother and father really do love each other. And later on David learns the real reason his father is intent on claiming the million dollar prize.This is the sort of film that challenges you to ask why you live, and what is really important in your life. Often times these are the hardest things for us to openly express in words.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: I really enjoyed this road movie about a man who thinks that he's won a million dollars. His son ends up taking him to Lincoln to claim his prize but there are many obstacles on the way. This is a well written drama with a great cast, who all put in great performances. It does take some time to get going and it's a bit slow in some parts, but the individual characters really do bring different flavours to the piece. Bruce Dern played his role extremely well, but it was his wife that stole the show for me. The black and white tone to the whole film, really does work and I liked the ending which brought the movie together nicely. You do have to be in the right mood for the film because it's not really that exciting but it's a well made film. Watchable!Round-Up: Bruce Dern, who has starred in many movies through the years, has finally been noticed as a leading actor after playing loads of cameos. At 77, he was nominated for an academy award for this movie which shows that it never too late, although he did loose out to Matthew McConaughey. Anyway, the relationship that builds between his character and his son was touching and realistic in many ways. Will Forte, who played the lead in that ridiculous movie McGruber, was much better in this movie even though he is known for his comedic roles. Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $18millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there road movies about a father and son travelling across America to claim a $1million dollar prize. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nebraska is a fiction comedy-drama film directed by Alexander Payne. It follows an aging, slightly-demented father and his empathetic son on their road trip to claim the "Million Dollar Prize" that the father believes he has won. On the way, the son learns more about his father, along with his family and past.I believe that the actors were one of the biggest strength of Nebraska. The actors are all well cast and perfect for their roles. Bruce Dern and June Squibb turned in particularly great performances as an aging couple. Dern, who plays main character Woody Grant, is wonderful in his portrayal of a lonely man who is losing his memory. Squibb, who plays Woody's exasperated wife, is hilarious in her scoldings of her husband and because of her bluntness. Saturday Night Live actor Will Forte plays Woody's patient son David.The second strength of Nebraska is that the movie is rather simple and pleasant. It's straightforward storytelling and well-scripted storyline make the movie enjoyable to watch. The humorous scenes, which are always linked to old age and memory loss, appear suddenly and you can't resist laughing. For example, when Woody loses his dentures, he and David begin looking for them in the railroad tracks. David eventually finds them, but jokingly tells his father, "Oh wait, these aren't yours," which Woody believes. When he begins to continue looking for his teeth, David says "Dad, I was just kidding," to which Woody replies confidently, "These ain't mine." After hearing his father insist that he didn't find his teeth, David begins to walk away, but Woody gruffly says, "Of course they're my teeth. Don't be a moron."Visually, the movie is simple as well. The camera movements are kept to a minimum and the entire film is in black and white. Nothing distracting or flashy happens, keeping the movie visually undemanding.The movie explores the themes of old age and familial bonds. I felt like the humor largely revolved around the decrepitude that accompanies old age. The film also focuses on different familial bonds, as there are different degrees of relationships in the movie. For example, there was a patient and caring son, and a son that wanted to put the father in a nursing home. Greed is also a theme, albeit a secondary one. Upon learning that Woody has "won" a million dollars, all of Woody's friends and family try to get some form him.The movie's simplistic style does not make the movie plain, but rather makes it quite crisp and easy to watch. The viewers are kept engaged with blunt and vivid humor. The absence of flashy effects and action is fresh but some viewers may find that it causes the movie to be boring and slow. For serious movie watchers though, this is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The big shrug that is rural Nebraska.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's films have really mellowed over the years. Consider the tone of the near-mad cap farcical "Election" to "The Descendants", and now this one. The next stop would seem to be still photography. Nebraska is the story of an impromptu family reunion of sorts as an elderly man attempts to travel from Montana to my old stomping ground of Lincoln, NE. The old man, played to perfection by Bruce Dern, believes he is holding a winning lottery ticket worth a million dollars, when in fact it is just a misleading promotion for magazine subscriptions. Despite repeated assurances from his wife and son, that there is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, the old codger keeps his slow motion journey moving. After injuring his head in a fall, the man and his family stop for about an hour of screen time in his old home town in a rural area of the state. Here, some old wounds re-open as he has to deal with old family turmoil and fend off both relatives and former acquaintances who feel the old timer owes them a piece of his new-found pie. The film is definitely not going to please everyone, but viewers with patience who can appreciate a nice character study will probably enjoy it to some degree.This film was nominated for best picture, I believe. There were a few other nominations for actors and whatnot, but I think everyone associated with it got shut out. It was a tough year with so many high-energy American films nominated. Dern is outstanding as Woody Grant, a man who has never amounted to much, and simply wants to have something positive to leave his family other than the bad memories most people have of him. In many ways, this film is about unpaid debts, especially ones that would hardly seem to matter after so many years. Honestly, what good would $10,000 from Woody do for Mr. Pegram? His life wouldn't change at all. He'd still be doing sad karaoke performances and taking up space at the local bars of this dying town. Does Woody really need an air compressor at his age? And what does a man who cannot legally drive need with a new truck? Merely a chance to drive it once through his old town is enough of a payoff, it would seem.As stated previously, this is definitely not a film for the casual viewer. My wife actually asked me if there was a "color" option of the DVD. Sweetie, The Hound loves you but you and I will never have the same tastes in film. I can't help but think Payne had "The Last Picture Show" in mind when he decided to shoot in black and white. It is the perfect touch. Some of the shots of this little town reminded me a lot of Archer City, TX. where that one was filmed. One shot in particular of some leaves blowing down the street near the film's conclusion had me half expecting to see a little boy with a broom chasing after them. Nebraska (both the film and the state) deserve their moment in the sun. But are either the state or the film worthy of great acclaim? All this Nebraskan can do is respond with a shrug. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Black and white frames shorn of affectations, landscape and sky that dazzle in monochrome, camera-work that bares spaces within, Nebraska does more than story telling or pressing those raw tendons of guilt, love, withering, yearning, loss and redemption. It leaves one elevated, more forgiving and mindful.The central bond in the movie involving a alcoholic codger of the father embodied by Bruce Dern and younger soft mannered son (Forte) is an homage to kindness. Add to this understated co valence, an ever nagging, acidic yet supremely adorable mom, who has berated her man to senility but would lash any one to ground who even tries to raise a finger at him, and an elder brother, a mamma's boy, who steps in when necessary. Add to this quad, a whole array of TV-fixated emotionally catatonic uncles, chatty old aunts, dunderhead cousins, pokey neighbors, nosey acquaintances and frayed old fragrant loves. Add to this melange, the spell binding wide screenshots, undulating background score that softly cradles one in and out of crumbling houses and winding roads. Add to this tapestry, humor that underlines the movie like paint scrapping off old fences.Nebraska takes you and places you alongside the characters in their drawing rooms, in the back seats of their cars, makes you open their old love letters, dust their photo albums and since it's the season, lets you take a selfie with them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nebraska is a film worth a watch.........simple and straight goes through the development of emotions of love and meanness of the society. There are moment which will make you smile....moments which make you laugh but above all, those moments of laugh makes our heart satisfied....satisfied with what we see, what we dream and what we have had in our life. What is our society, friends, family, our self, our desires, resentment for our failures, memories of past, forgotten wishes, selfishness and the bent tail of a dog that cant get straight...all put together in a cyclic chain in the movie. Alexander Payne has done it again after the descendants how our lives circle around few things unnecessarily but we get something within that...something that we forgot to see or adapt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth, hope and life passing (us) by..and its all good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where do I begin? Is it with the fantastic throwback black-and-white cinematography that seems perfect to capture the timelessness of all the vistas presented across Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana? Or the amazing relationship the son has with his father, and takes him on a cross-state drive to fulfill his childish/whimsical fancy? Or is it with the performances I need to focus on that each actor/tress breathes oh-so-carefully into his/her characters? Let me start by making a few points on Alexander Payne. With Sideways, The descendants (a little but of 'About Schmidt') and now this, he seems to have made the genre of relationship-building whimsical road movie completely his, and there's simply no competition that's close by. However, he's also dangerously close to completely pigeonholing himself within the same genre, and I'd like to see him try something quite different as well.Bruce Dern - quite simply, this is the role he was born to play. Ably supported by Squibb and Forte, he ensures that we pay attention to his every tic, and he has us all in his pocket for the entire length of this feature. Forte, by just a few inches, falls short of being the leading man, but he's probably one of the best supporting actors by far, and not nominating him for this performance was a travesty. Squibb, as the spunky matriarch, owns every scene she's in, and the lines have been crafted especially for her. She has tough competition this year, but I'd dearly like to see her win.More than anything, this one's a life-affirming, hope-inducing, mostly endearing tale of people bonding, reacting to each other and to life, and ...moving on. It has its tongue firmly in cheek, and leaves one with the thought that we can definitely make it all alright.Special mention needs to be made about both the cinematography and the sparingly-used soundtrack, that simply enhance the movie going experience and takes it to another level. Not to be missed on the big screen, and to be savored again and again, preferably with friends and family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family Strains in NEBRASKA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne has had wild success in writing and directing stories (The Descendents, Sideways) about fragile individuals who are looking for a purpose and meaning amid love and heartbreak. In Nebraska, he takes a gem of a screenplay by Bob Nelson about a fateful road trip and elicits strong performances from a terrific cast.An elderly man, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), is determined to travel cross country from Billings, Montana, to Lincoln, Nebraska, to claim a million dollar prize despite the objections of his wife Kate (June Squibb) and skeptical son, David (Will Forte). He has a habit of wandering off much to the frustration of his family including David's older brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk). An alcoholic with a painful past, Woody takes the long road trip accompanied by David. Along the way, they stop by the town of Hawthorne for an impromptu family reunion where news of Woody's windfall spreads, and with it come greedy family and friends particularly in the person of an old buddy, Ed (Stacy Keach). As Woody and David approach their destination, old memories are revived and a father and son bond.Payne creates a reality that successfully conveys a feeling of family and its dysfunction, which makes the story believable and authentic. While David realizes that he has nothing in common with his extended relatives (and you might not want them in your family either), you sure as heck won't forget them! The film is divided into a series of vignettes, some with amusing payoffs. Woody rarely filters his thoughts as evidenced in his explanation to David about how Woody and Kate started a family. It is a gem. There is an outrageous moment near the end when the brothers David and Ross attempt to right a wrong with hilarious results.The journey is the point of the story. There are similarities in theme and characterizations to The Straight Story. David uses the trip as a way to get closer to his dad. In fact he learns some surprising things about Woody via the local newspaper and a certain female with a shared past.Veteran actor Bruce Dern (Coming Home) makes the most of the role of a lifetime as a father looking for redemption. In the last chapter of his life, Woody does not have many prospects or things to look forward to, but he does have a prize that motivates him and is a sense of pride. It gives his empty life meaning. Grumpy and blunt, he can be confused and oblivious at times, but when he isn't drinking at a local bar, he has moments or clarity and recall that can be jarring.The revelation here is the natural acting abilities of former Saturday Night Live player, Will Forte, who is completely convincing as the dutiful son, David. June Squibb is quite good as the mom who speaks her mind and proves a nice counterpoint to Woody. Her scene at the family cemetery is a riot.The town of Hawthorne is not unlike the Midwest town featured in The Last Picture Show. Gorgeously Photographed in black and white amid a Midwest landscape, the film uses its setting to great effect as the towns and farmland become characters too like the old, derelict family house which serves as a touchstone replete with memories and demons. A grassroots country musical score complements the visuals.In a way this is not only a father's quest  la Don Quixote but a son's search for his family's roots. The film makes a point of Woody's reasons for getting his pot of gold, and it comes down to family legacy. What are the things that matter and what do we leave for future generations? You root for him and want his prize to be genuine, but there are riches to be mined along the way. It's also about setting things straight as exemplified by David's final act. It's ultimately a family's unusual journey but particularly a son's love for his father.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's film strives for adult commercial American cinema which strives for acting style more approximates real life and is relatively free of contrivance and device. He portrays excellence by choosing his hometown Nebraska as the center of the film.Nebraska tells the story of old-aged, alcoholic suffering from dementia who travels with his son on a road trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a million dollar prize.It is always a pleasure to watch Alexander Payne's film ( Sideways, The Descendants )as he has mastered the effective introduction of each character as the movie progress. Nebraska , filmed in black and white color, is like a delicious dish which will taste better the next time you take wimp of spoon in your mouth. The film movement is snail-paced and will be take sometime for you to grab but with dark humor and satirical depictions of contemporary American society, it will be an enjoyable ride. Full marks should be given to the cinematography for capturing the beautiful landmark and historical places. Background score gels well with the mood of the film. Bruce Dern was outstanding as Woody Grant. He fitted the role as it was tailor-made for him. Equal applaud should be given to Will Forte as supporting son who plays the dutiful son.Overall, Nebraska is fine piece of cinema which will appreciate by true movie buffs.Excellent 4.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne has had a successful career making comedy-dramas and working excellent screenplay by Bob Nelson his black-and-white film Nebraska is both funny and heartfelt. Nebraska follows Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), a senile old man who believes that he has won $1 million when he receives a letter from a marketing company. Despite his younger son David (Will Forte) knowing it is scam agrees to take his father from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska, visiting Woody's old home town and send time with his family.Nebraska is brilliantly acted film, particularly from Dern who is deserving of his Oscar nomination, being believable as a man who is no longer quite with it and becomes more sympathetic during the course of the film. Nelson crafts a wonderful screenplay that is full of wit, clever lines and well-written, compelling characters. Nebraska is very much a story about family and a father-son relationship, with the son learning about his family's past. Nebraska felt very believable in its story and characters as one old man wants something to hope for and give him some control in his life and a family reconnecting again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes the simplest stories are the best? There's nothing flashy or mind-blowing about "Nebraska" but it sure was an amazing movie. The story is simple but the emotion it delivers feels very real and authentic. The characters are interesting and all played by terrific actors who really married the pairing of drama and comedy well. Bruce Dern, in particular is amazing and he's followed closely by Will Forte in the amazing acting department. More importantly, however, they really made their characters feel authentic and they reminded me a lot of my family or families I have met in my years traveling this world like lost samurai.The aspect of the family unit and how they interact with extending branches of their family tree is what really kept me glued to the story (of course, the great performances and amusing moments helped too). The whole time I watched the film, I kept thinking how they reminded me of my family and this authentic and real feeling the film deliver made the emotional content of the story deliver that much better.There was just something beautiful about this simple film (even though it was in black and white)?and yes, I just called a movie that is very bittersweet and kinda depressing for most of its tale "beautiful."

		<fullReview>I can understand that many people might say that this movie is too slow. It does take some patience to get into it. I liked how both June Squibb and Bruce Dern were portrayed as real senior citizens. The subtle things like them gingerly walking up the stairs with the help of their boys was a sweet touch. I also liked how it slowly revealed more about Woody throughout the story. The black and white shooting along with the music also helped show what I think the central states would feel like. Make no mistake however that Dern and Squib both offer some great laughs, with Squib especially delivering her lines with some fire. The air compressor scene stands out. The movie felt very organic and had a sweet ending. Overall solid acting by everyone involved, while standout performances the senior couple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Payne knows his Midwestern Americana!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I ain't fiddlin' with no cow titties. I'm a city girl!"Alexander Payne has directed yet another powerful film by creating real characters going through real life situations in a very poignant and hilarious way. Nebraska is one of those films that manages to balance serious subject matters with light touches of comedy by creating characters from Midwestern American society that feel authentic and are easy to relate to. It's a heartwarming film with some very emotional dramatic moments that are taken to another level thanks to some strong performances. Bruce Dern stars in the role of a lifetime and his performance is so natural that he completely owns this movie and never misses a note. It's a difficult performance because due to the subject matter one wrong note could've made the audience feel like it was being manipulated, but it never does and Payne manages to direct his actors in such a way that I never felt he was being condescending. Will Forte also delivers in a strong dramatic role sharing great chemistry with Dern and making this a strong father-son road trip story that stands out above other such films. June Squibb is hilarious as well and she brings some comedic relief during some of the emotional or more dramatic moments. This road trip film is gorgeously captured through black and white cinematography giving the film a more nostalgic tone towards the past. It's a well balanced road film about old age and family, and one of Payne's best films (I'd rate it second, behind Sideways my personal favorite of his). This sad and tender film takes us through a journey that may be slow at times, but Payne makes sure he rewards his audience for sticking with it.Written by Bob Nelson, Nebraska is an original screenplay centering on a Midwestern American family from Billings, Montana. The father, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) who's in his late 70's and approaching dementia, is convinced that he has won a million dollars after receiving a newsletter, but everyone else in his family knows it's just one of those scams for people to purchase magazine subscriptions. His wife Kate (June Squibb) can't convince him otherwise and neither can their two adult sons, Ross (Bob Odenkirk) and David (Will Forte). Since no one will take him to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his million dollars he tries to walk there. Finally David decides to call in sick at the electronic store where he works at and take his father to Lincoln. He believes this is a good opportunity to get closer to his estranged father who has always had alcohol related problems and been a very quiet person. Together they embark on the journey, but along the way they agree to stop by the small town in central Nebraska where his father grew up and meet up with their relatives. The trip becomes an illuminating experience for David who begins to understand some of the things that made his father the way he is, and through this unexpected journey the two grow closer together.This could've been yet another forgettable father and son film, but thanks to Payne's unique style and deadpan humor along with Dern and Forte's powerful performances Nebraska is a beautiful and touching film. The tone of the film balances really well the family dynamics with the longing and yearning for the past mixed with the discomfort and emptiness of the present. Dern portrays this character so well and the final scenes he shares with Forte are touching and tender. It's a genuine story and in my opinion it's an improvement from Payne's previous film, The Descendants, which I enjoyed a little less than this one. Nebraksa is a very revealing film and I loved the way the father son relationship was slowly built without ever being manipulative.</fullReview>

The Black&amp;white color of the movie is another cool thing about the movie which makes you feel more relaxed and out of high colors and also gives you a nice feeling about the movie to stay watching , kind of makes you feel the movie or the locations are special.

		<fullReview>Nebraska is one of 9 films that are nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. Watching this film was a great experience. I'll explain why.The film starts out with Woody Grant walking to Lincoln to get his million dollars he won. He is then taken to the police station where one of his sons David picks him up and tries to convince him its nothing. But no luck. With the same thing happening over and over, he takes Woody to Lincoln to get his "Money". His Wife, Kate comes along later in the film and so does other son Ross.Payne is well known for his road trip movie "Sideways" and at first he didn't want to do this picture, but I'm sure glad he did. This is a wonderful, dramatic and funny movie that deserves the cinematography award at the Oscars.June Squibb, who plays Kate, is excellent in this film. She is hilarious she stays strong throughout the whole film. She needs to win that Supporting Actress nomination. She was that good in this film.The film's original score by Mark Orton is superb. It gives us that little town feeling that fits perfectly throughout the film. If they had a vinyl soundtrack of this film, I would love to have it.Nebraska is surely to win two awards at the Oscars. Supporting Actress and Cinematography. Its a film to be remembered for years to come.95/100 A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fade to Greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great Alexander Payne delivers yet again and the Academy agrees. Nebraska parlays a brilliant script into screen gold! Momentum defeats us all sometimes, but sometimes we defeat it. In the case of Woody Grant, played by the character Bruce Dern, we witness a man in the throes of social dynamics seeking to tear him apart.But Woody never quits, he never dies, he never gives up. Who has this power? God.Through a simple road trip, Payne enlightens the path of the Spirit Walker. Woody envisions Lincoln, Nebraska as his destination and through his knuckleheaded son's distractrions (Mt. Rushmore)he treads carefully. But the sly Woody has a few tricks up his sleeve. He knows how to act. How to trick people. How to move the wind.Woody convinces everyone around him, even his stubborn son, that there's treasure in Lincoln. He knows he's not done. Sure, at one point the pain of life becomes so unbearable he wishes himself dead. But as soon as the pain subsides and he sees a clear path he skips to like a fox.Woody's prowess of survival even stretches to the realm of metamorphoses, for he adapts over time to ignore the kerksniffering of his sometimes nasty wife. He literally loses his hearing.And Will Forte delivers a masterpiece, a true tour de force. In the beginning of the film we believe that he's just a selfish good for nothing dead beat. Picking on his old dad and worried about getting a little nicky.But by the end of the film the viewer teleports him or herself into seeing David Grant as a kind, compassionate, generous son. For an actor to carry this arc through so finitely truly puts him on a level almost as great as the legends that came before him.Phedon Papamichael also deserves an honorable mention. His subtle steering of the camera brings forth a cinematic experience that resonates as both loving and gentle. Without over doing it, he's able to capture moments that bring into full focus Americana.Payne's visual style surpasses all. With inventive camera tricks such as the expanding shot at approximately 1:45:50 and then the inverse contracting shot to represent the son's welcoming of his dad's vision and spirit and the dad's embracing of his son's love Payne puts onto film a transcendental moment that gives three dimensions to what can only be two.Of course, in a scene we know well from classics such as Hamlet Payne fades from son to dad at the end of the film, the cycle of life coming full circle.This film also speaks to a younger generation, the YOLO generation. It poses the question, what if? What if one chances really do exist? Do you jump? Do you take that leap of faith? For in the end, while momentum and pride, humility and virtue and sin all lift this film up isn't it really a film about Faith.According to Google Maps it takes 12 hours to drive from Billings, Montana to Lincoln Nebraska, but isn't it Faith that gets you from any point to the next? Whether you're traveling to a new stage, page, level, time or space at some point you close your eyes and jump. You take that leap of Faith. Like Woody Grant.You ask that girl out. You buy that truck. You take up arms. You bare that child. You milk that cow. You fight, you live, you win.Another standing ovation goes to the supporting cast. They delivered an amazing performance. Without them this film wouldn't have the legs it does. And the entire crew deserves a mention. A film like this needs a labor of love. This one has it in spades.Finally, no Alexander Payne moving picture would be complete without shenanigans. The flashing. Stealing the compressor. The sharp tongue. Classic Payne! He leaves us wanting more, but we all know what happens next. Woody's getting laid in or by that truck like every sheriff should.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Nonsense Performances by Dern and Squibb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing this film before it was officially released in the country I am living in at the moment and must say that I am quite happy to have seen it. It is a masterfully well-done film, by one of the great modern directors Alexander Payne. The film features two incredible performances by Bruce Dern and June Squibb, and several other worthy performances by the rest of the cast. It also features an entertaining and hilarious story, as well as sincere dialogue and one of the greatest characters written in modern cinema (that of Bruce Dern's character).I loved viewing this film for several reasons. I loved seeing the wonderful talent that went into making this film, connecting with the characters in an almost frighteningly intimate way, as well as seeing what in my opinion is the greatest performance of the year for actors in a leading role. Bruce Dern's performance was so honest - it didn't feel scripted or rehearsed, and seemed so refreshingly natural - that it's rather hard to believe that he was acting and not just living.This is certainly a film to appreciate. It isn't boring in the slightest and is marvellously acted, written, directed, and made in all other cinematic aspects. I would recommend viewing this film for all these reasons, but the greatest incentive for viewing this film would be to see Dern's best performance of his career.</fullReview>

I was always kind of creeped out by the Dern family when I was a kid, and this is a part that just seems like it has been made for him, or that time has made him for the story. Will Forte plays Will Forte, which is what he plays best, and the rest of the cast is all very good. There are some very funny moments in this movie that will sneak up on you. I love the room full of old men. I have always liked the idea that as we age we are actually just moving through time slower, so it just looks like we are taking a lot longer to do things, and this movie is a great example of that in motion. I really enjoyed the whole story, you never are quite sure about the prize money, and how it is handled is so very heart warming.

		<shortDescription>The screenplay stabilizes its conceptual possibilities through humorous dialogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's Nebraska is another entry to the thick notebook documenting the memorable films of 2013. The film is captured in black and white cinematography, an acute decision by Payne and his team. Could the bleak view give us an insight to the decayed view of the world elderly people experience? Is the choice to broaden the tactile of small towns? Or is the lack of color to show the anxious, ill-eased experience of returning to your place of origin? All of the above and more. Nebraska an impeccable motion picture initiated by Bob Nelson's screenplay, which stabilizes its conceptual possibilities through humorous dialogue. If you know the name of the attached director, the bar of expectations rises. The artistic side of Payne's direction does not encumber Nebraska. He permits the scene on the page to play out with the actors and only brushes the surface to get stray pieces of the film in order. Nebraska is not a film that aches for a director to manipulate everyone involved to for it to work. Not that Payne deprives himself of visualizing the film with creativity; he carefully chooses moments that will evoke specific reactions from his viewer.Nebraska reeks of old age. It is Payne's mission to facilitate understanding of the inevitable sadness that comes with adding years to our life. The plot is motivated by Dern's character to "do" something. The fear of accomplishing nothing in our lives becomes a robust presence when it is too late. When the opportunity for Dern to leave something for his children arises, he understandably wants to believe in it. The cinematography paints Nebraska as a dried-out photograph, like the nostalgia of a fast-beating pulse of the past. Store signs are worn out shown by letters falling off the titles, likely symbolizing the doddery wits of the elders: there are a few missing components, but enough remains present to assume a meaning.After years of standing aside and allowing the spotlight to illuminate someone else, Bruce Dern has a role that allows him to boast his talent. Dern is damn good in his thorough depiction of aging, guilt, and hope. Internally he feels out of place next to the other characters and the audience, a fitting distance aged people often find themselves trapped in. The portrait on the poster reflects the internal meaning Dern's character: a hollow shadow of an old man filled with regret. The film's greatest attribute is June Squibb who supports Nebraska for every second she is granted by the script. Squibb creates maybe the funniest character of the year, a comical role that originates in bitterness. Will Forte narrates Dern's journey through Nebraska, though the role does not offer a showcase for him, but he adequately stands by his costars.Nebraska is funnier than anyone would guess from the posters, the plot descriptions, or even the trailers. I was laughing out loud numerous times during my viewing, many of which are pushed by momentum from Squibb's comic relief, others by the absurdity of Dern's delusions meeting Fortre's view of reality.Nebraska has a huge misstep in Squibb's five minutes of judgement at a cemetery while she recaps people's lives to her son. The scene itself is thoroughly amusing until the conclusion, then the film plunges six feet under for those five seconds. Hopefully Squibb's humorous build-up is the token people take away from that scene, not the punctuation.I may not be from the Midwest specifically, but I was raised in a small town in Pennsylvania, which allowed me to be overcome with stimulation in the accuracy of the "small-town" mise- en-scene. Company trucks riding along the high-way, the stillness of the air, the interior house designs, even down to minuscule details such as the restaurant bathrooms stay true to the standard of verisimilitude.

		<shortDescription>This Year's Lincoln (NE)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is such a sameness to films these days, with huge budgets controlling everything. That's why a film like this is so precious. Granted, it is slow moving and almost photographic. The plot, as most know, has to do with a man (Woody Grant played by Bruce Dern) in his late years, getting a piece of paper we have all received at some time, telling us we have won a million dollars. We know and most of the characters know that this is a scam, yet he endures and becomes such a liability, that his long suffering son agrees to drive him from Billings, Montana, to Lincoln, Nebraska, to pick up his prize. On the way, they stop at Woody's childhood home. There are two things going on. One is that this place has become even more depressing than it was when he lived there, and, secondly, he blabs about his upcoming fortune, and the townspeople believe him. This leads to a group of fortune hunters making claims on the money he will never have (the worst, a former business partner played by Stacy Keach). Woody's wife is one virago and she is proud of it. She has been through the school of hard knocks, sexual promiscuity, and a series of challenges to her survival. She is mean and profane and almost never lets her guard down. His son is a middle aged "loser" who works in a stereo store. His father has never really had much to do with him. He has no relationships and is seen as weak and winy by his family. There is a great scene where his two cousins (one a convicted rapist and the other a comparable idiot) make fun of him for taking so long to drive there from Billings. This story has a great kicker, however, because while things are at an incredible level of tension from the get go, the relationship of father and son begins to form. It's not that "I love you, Son" thing at all. Much better than that. I really admire this film. People have mentioned the bleakness of "The Last Picture Show." This draws from the stark reality of the breadbasket of America and teaches us a lesson in the process.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truth be told, I would probably never have watched this film if only based on the little I have heard about it. This film is about a very old man on a road trip with his son, probably fixing their relationship along the way. Certainly nothing new about that topic, and sounded like it would be a boring ride. Thankfully it was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars, so I watched it. In return, I got rewarded with a most poetic and heartfelt film. "Nebraska" is about Woody Grant, a senior citizen in Billings, Montana, already teetering in and out of senility. One day, he received one of those junk mail from a magazine company, announcing that he has won a million dollars. Despite admonitions from his family, Woody firmly believes he won, and wanted to go to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his prize. His son David was forced to make this long drive with his dad. As they make a stop in his dad's old hometown and gets reacquainted with their kin, David gets to know his dad more than he ever knew him before.Reading my short synopsis alone does not do the whole film justice of course. This is an experience you need to immerse yourself into. OK, it is true that the "million dollar ticket" misunderstanding could have been explained more easily than what was shown on screen stretched out for almost two hours. But looking beyond that main flaw, the film itself turned out to be a thing of elegantly-told beauty. The crisp black-and-white cinematography and languid pace by Director Alexander Payne worked favorably in its favor.Bruce Dern played Woody in a most touching, low key and realistic manner, certainly a dark horse in the Best Actor race. In contrast, June Squibb though steals her scenes as his toughly frank and cranky wife Kate. Comedian Will Forte plays it straight here as David. We can identify with him as he tries his best to reconnect with his aging dad through this tough time. Stacy Keach plays as he usually plays, an effective sleazy villain.This film are about folk in the heartland of America, but I guess characters like this exist everywhere on earth, and we can relate. We will all get touched by the time the ending comes. So well set-up, that ending! Made the whole film worth watching. I did not feel bored at all despite my initial fears. This film is engaging and involving, fully deserving of its Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor and Supporting Actress, and Best Cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I could pinpoint exactly what it is that makes a cornfield boring one day but then can make it exquisite and beautiful the next. Your mindset I guess.When I came out of the theater after seeing Nebraska, an older couple behind me made a comment to the effect of, "that's how people really are out there idn't it? Not talking to each other..." The tone of his voice observant, maybe a little defeatist, but I also heard appreciation for the source from which came the observation.Nebraska is shot in black and white and features many landscape shots depicting scenes which look very familiar to me in a lot of ways. Growing up surrounded by cornfields in Indiana, I remember drives where the endless rows of yellow, sometimes dead brown, were reminders of the fact that I couldn't go out and see the world just yet. But at other times, like the drive home from South Carolina after having lived away from family and friends for a year, I had rolled down the window to experience through every sense possible the reality of those cornfields marking the fact that I'd come home. I felt a similar kind of nostalgia mixed with confusion as I watched this movie. Some moments were depressing, others very much uplifting. There is a balance kept up by the shooting back and forth of moments that seem drab then pleasant, understated then blatant. The frustrations and sentiments between the family of Bruce Dern's character, Woody Grant, are similarly kept in balance by a back and forth between feeling infuriated at the old man's stupidity and an intense love and pity for the goal he won't realize.The film quickly merges into a larger metaphor for the relentless march of life that can seem to offer us absolutely nothing in return for our effort and creativity; an answer back as silent and empty as the black and white film that captures the graveyard (and, what I assume is a cleverly spotted gravestone with the name "Payne" in large lettering.) Woody's son David (played by Will Forte) believes he is graciously giving his father one last adventure, "a reason to live." But what he doesn't realize yet is that he is serving the same purpose for himself as well. David needs to be accommodating, to help someone out, because he doesn't understand why he seems to be the only one content with his simple, mediocre life. His girlfriend is restless and just wants something to happen, anything to happen. He is constantly trying to reign in his father and calm his mother as she rants about her dope of a husband. It makes sense then that David is the one to see with the most clarity what this ultimately pointless trip would offer his father, and to ultimately contribute to the realization of his father's fantasies.I can't help viewing this film without the thoroughly pondered-on perspective that highlights themes from other books and movies I've read and seen dealing with the human "absurdity" that reaches out toward a life and reality that will not reach back, the human need for "movement" as the answer and to know that "man is an end in himself," (quotes Albert Camus and Ayn Rand.) This film is a beautiful fulfillment, in whatever small measure, of that human hunger, put at rest for a while as Woody finally makes the impression he's always dreamed he would, an impression of the man hiding deep within himself unable to emerge without the help of someone close to him, to confirm that he is loved and his life has meant something to someone. funkyforestfirstcontact.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vast State of Somberness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this year's foreign film, Wadjda, painted a quite dismal picture of Saudi Arabia- essentially appearing as a dystopia in a sense- Nebraska uses the same paintbrush for America (or at least half of USA). It's certainly not a compliment to the state of Nebraska, that's for sure. The story begins in Montana when a decrepit man, by the name of Woody (Bruce Dern), receives a "letter" informing him that he has apparently won $1,000,000! Isn't that great? Yeah, except we've all received similar mail and immediately threw them into the trash as we instantly detected the shadiness and phoniness behind it. The major issue here is that Woody firmly believes that this is no scam, and he's willing to walk all the way to Nebraska to retrieve it. From that point on, his wife and sons struggle to restrain him from the ridiculous idea. Too often, Woody attempts to sneak out of the house and commence his daring and taxing walk to a state far beyond, but he eventually gets caught every single time either by the police or his worried family. Ultimately, the remainder of the story centers around this old man's last wish, only dreaming of what he'll do with such a copious amount of money- except that all he desires to purchase after claiming his prize is a truck. Yep, you've heard it here, folks- a truck! Anyways, the cinematography of the picture obviously stands out as the entire film is shot in black-and-white. Believe me, there's a point to the unusual decision. It successfully brings out the emptiness and bleakness of this rural life; we see wide, vast fields- running on for miles- perfectly capturing the desolation found in these parts of America. We're also accompanied by a low-key and somber tune/soundtrack to complement the visual dreariness. If I would've just left it at that with my description, you readers would likely feel utterly detracted by the sheer depressing tone my words seem to indicate, but don't you worry for a fair share of humor is implemented into the plot in order to keep its audience from persistently weeping. It proves that no matter how dire the situation looks, there's always some comedy to be found in the misery of it all. Furthermore, the talented cast definitely allows for the film to remain as authentic as possible. This saddening tale is so effective partially due to such a talented cast; firstly, an exceptional performance from Bruce Dern as we're dejected by the sight of his clearly appalling physical and mental condition, barely hanging on there as he hobbles along heavily. In addition, Will Forte's equally powerful (and more subtle) performance as Woody's son- immensely concerned about his father's current state and absolute craving for this money- stands out as well. These two are the stars of the film but are also amusingly supported by the likes of June Squibb, Bob Odenkirk, Stacy Keach, and many more. In sum, it's quite the ensemble Nebraska has going for it. Also, as is usual with Alexander Payne's work, one of the greatest strengths of this narrative is its writing- the script is magnificent in its wittiness and authenticity, properly developing these fascinating characters as the story progresses. Initially, we're greeted by some extraordinarily unkind individuals, constantly cursing each other and wishing a safe trip to a nursing home, but as the plot thickens, the personalities far transcend their earlier positions as pure caricatures. Payne's films always effectively tap into the genuineness and tameness of regular reality and its average participants. Like with Payne's other projects, it feels like you're actually watching a real-life event play out as the film effortlessly immerses you in its realism. Moreover, its thematic material is undoubtedly meaningful and remarkable as it exposes how human beings truly behave (when they overhear an incident involving money). Once you're in possession of considerable wealth or nearing a monumental prize of that caliber, the people around you suddenly start transforming into completely different- and frightening- individuals; some become desperate or greedy, others reek of maliciousness and jealousy. As America faces yet another tragic recession, this movie serves as a perfect rendition of our contemporary tribulation. Merely sighting the penurious towns as evinced by their inhabitants discussing how there's seriously nothing to do around these parts besides drink your life away, hence the popularity of bars and beer in the Southern states. Nebraska certainly reveals the hollow nature of a multitude of American lives. With that being said (I'd have to say this is very important for you to know before you leave this review), Nebraska is surely not for everyone. It advances at an incredibly deliberate pace, taking its sweet time with lengthy shots and noticeably uneventful scenes. This is another one of those pieces of cinema that solely focus on human interaction and the interesting conversations within interesting lives. Honestly, I wouldn't blame a viewer if I caught them continually taking a phone out to check the time during the film's running since it does carry along slowly and never seems to pick up. Overall, if you're an enthusiastic fan of Payne's, I'd definitely recommend it. Otherwise, enter at your own caution. If you're an open-minded cinephile who loves the tamer films as well, then you really can't go wrong with Nebraska. That's all I'm going to say, but others, you've already been forewarned by my explanations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looking toward the future and finding yourself in the past.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the year for actors (among them septuagenarians) who have been on the back-burner for years, or been cast as one-dimensional movie "idols", finally getting the opportunity to forego the razzle-dazzle of stardom, and actually "strut their stuff." Bruce Dern who stars in NEBRASKA directed by Alexander Payne is formidable as Woody Grant, a man clearly in the early stages of dementia, consumed with the belief that he has won a million dollars in one of those unscrupulous Sweepstake scams that target "senior citizens." The official looking papers that come in the mail announcing the "award" are designed with such a flourish that unwitting recipients are blinded by the gilt-bordered inscriptions, oblivious to the realities secreted in the fine print, and clutch their "prize" notifications as if it were an antidote to the pain of past aberrations and disappointments.NEBRASKA is an eccentric movie, in that it is both comedic and tragic, filmed entirely in black and white referencing the stark, bleak landscape populated by mostly elderly folk who are living out their last years sitting around watching "the cars pass by". The lack of color suggests the wrenching nostalgia of time gone by, and befits the mood of Bruce Dern's depiction of an elderly man who is dreaming of the future, but in his attempt to reach that dream, steps back into his past.There is a fierce urgency about Woody who refuses to be hindered from leaving his home in Billings Montana (the local police have found him on the road and deposited him back to his family numerous times) in an attempt to reach Lincoln Nebraska to collect his winnings. Woody's whole being is concentrated on reaching that goal - both psychologically and physically - white wisps of electrified hair creating a halo of wild disorder framing his head, and a look in his eyes that is both determined and vacant. He moves slowly with a staggering, faltering gait that belies the strong conviction that he is finally a "winner."We meet Woody's family, frustrated in their ability to control his obsession, aware that he is slowly "disappearing" as evident by the often emptiness of his fixed gaze. His son David, sensitively played by Will Forte, has compassion for his father's situation, eventually accompanying Woody on his quixotic quest with the hope of finally garnering the emotional connection that he had never received. A spirited June Squibb is wonderful as the sturdy, clear-minded, foul-mouthed, and fiery wife Kate, who has had it with her husband, exhausted from watching over him, but the tensile bonds of time, despite the impediments of drinking and womanizing, cannot be expunged. She is the person we all want on our side when the sharks are circling. There are many wonderful characters in NEBRASKA, although at first I feared that they were too stereotypical, but as the movie unfurled getting better and better ? the director's affection for his colorful, laconic characters became apparent. Stacy Keach, plays the perfect rogue as the former business partner of Woody Grant, initially basking in the reflected glow of a friend's jackpot - as do the rest of the community and extended family - excited by being in the presence of the idea of so much money, but shortly we see the emergence of self-interest and avariciousness exposed. NEBRASKA deals mainly with sentiment and rarely gets sentimental, giving the audience both an entertaining and penetrating portrait of a man who is evaporating into his own body, and the persistence in which he pursues what we all know is a barren mission. The will to accomplish this pursuit and how it affects those around him makes this movie a gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dern gets his due.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one actor who has deserved his time in the spotlight, it's Bruce Dern. The 77-year-old character actor has enjoyed a respectable career over the last four decades, albeit as mostly supporting characters in offbeat pictures. But now, the actor who was most notorious for shooting John Wayne in the back is finally getting to shine in a film all on his own: Alexander Payne's Nebraska.Comparisons to David Lynch's eloquently brilliant The Straight Story are apt, as Payne's latest offering deals with very similar subject matter (an elderly man going across a significant chunk of the country for reasons not quite understandable by family and friends). Like The Straight Story was for Lynch, Nebraska marks a departure for Payne, as it is the first film he's done that he didn't have a hand in writing (Bob Nelson is the sole writer). The two films also feature immense performance by their leads, character actors both.Where they differ is that Richard Farnsworth had to carry his film on his stooped shoulders almost entirely by himself, whereas Dern has an interesting array of actors to play off. Dern plays Woody Grant, a cantankerous yet doddering Montana geezer who becomes convinced that he's hit the jackpot ? he has received one of those junk sweepstakes letters in the mail, telling him he's won a million dollars. Not content to sit around and wait for someone else to claim his money, Woody sets out to the head office where the letter was sent . . . in Lincoln, Nebraska.When his adult son David (an uncharacteristically solemn and sturdy Will Forte) catches his old man walking the route on foot, he decides that maybe it's time for a bonding experience with dear old Dad. He's coming off a bad breakup and he's eager for a change in scenery. So they set off . . . and almost immediately, their trip is derailed when Woody hurts himself, causing them to stop to convalesce in Hawthorne, the one-stop Nebraska town where Woody spent his boyhood and where the rest of his family resides. While Woody recuperates, the rest of his family delights over his newfound fortune, not hearing a single word that David tries to tell them about how it's just a scam. Soon, Woody's impending wealth becomes the talk of the town, which of course ends up luring some pretty shady folks hoping to get a piece of the pie, especially his old partner Ed (Stacy Keach, who plays sleazeballs better than anyone).Throughout all of this, Woody pretty much is content to let people walk all over him, and it's no wonder why. Not long after they touch down in Hawthorne, they are joined by Woody's wife, Kate (June Squibb) and elder son Ross (Bob Odenkirk). The second that Kate's squat form takes the screen, we know exactly why Woody walks around with a defeated look on his face all the time. Kate's a no-bullsh_t kind of gal, with a vicious tongue she uses to browbeat her boys, especially her addled husband. It's a glorious turn, and Squibb seems to relish the opportunity to steal scenes whenever she can (a stop in the local cemetery provides a golden scene that ranks as one of the funniest of the year).What is fascinating about the film is how Payne and Nelson depict small-town life. I couldn't help but see Nebraska as sort of a glimpse in the future of King of the Hill, with an adult Bobby and geriatric Hank enjoying a father/son road trip at last. There is also a sort of interesting hypocrisy to every one of the characters, which sort of shatters the idea of down-home values. Even old Woody has his dark side, with his history of drinking and his curt dismissiveness of everything around him.Nebraska is cleanly shot, beautifully rustic. The cinematography is lovely, the black-and-white style reminiscent of The Last Picture Show. But where it truly excels are in its performances. Forte plays a rather excellent straight man here, playing off of his showier co-stars with a great deal of restraint and gravitas. Wouldn't have expected it from him. Squibb gets the juicy lines and the vicious delivery, and she earns the biggest laughs in the film. Stacy Keach, Bob Odenkirk, Rance Howard, even Buzz from Home Alone all get their moments to shine . . . but the film really wouldn't work half as well without Dern. Decades of melancholy are etched on his weathered face, the set of his jaw. He says and does so much by saying and doing so little. Earlier this year, Robert Redford busted his ass to give his finest performance to date in a mostly-silent performance as a marooned ancient mariner. Dern doesn't even break a sweat with his.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Winning the Sweepstakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After my mercifully few recent outings to the movies, I had sworn off Hollywood (please see my review of "Last Vegas," a genuine stinker). Perhaps I do not see movies to empty my mind of truth or reality. Truth, for me, is waaaaayyyyy stranger than fiction.And so I found "Nebraska." First, the quiet, poetic black and white cinematography is as much dialog as the script; the locations are wordless scenes. The timing of fades and pans are orchestrated like a romantic symphony. And like a conductor, the director tells the story almost seamlessly; the few moments where suspension of disbelief falters are few, and recovery is prompt and gentle.Other reviews can handle plot line and specifics. The contrast between families is a bit cartoonish (Nebraska cousins vs. Billings latte-drinkers), but hey, I give a little poetic license to make a point. I think Forte's affectations unnecessary for purposes of audience identification.Nonetheless, my overall reaction: how did Hollywood let this movie get made? It's understated. It whispers, where other movies scream. And it comes together at the end with a joyful, believable resolution like a Brahms' symphony. It reminded me of the conclusion of "Little Miss Sunshine," another anomaly of American filmmaking. And I adore black and white. It was "The Last Picture Show" for the 2010's. And I love casting that isn't beautiful.So...I also said "how did Hollywood let this get made," when I left "Last Vegas." But that I left before the half-way point, wishing it hadn't been made.Just when I was going to give up on American movies, along comes "Nebraska." It was like winning the sweepstakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When life breaks - just get a truck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like most of what goes by the name of Americana, I knew this would be about eulogy and the passing of times - signified in the old coot who wants to go in Nebraska. The opening shot prepares the space, a kind of visual carving in real time - an old man coming from somewhere back on the road and going a little further down.This would be a simple existential thing, about seeing what kind of distance is that, what kind of life walked. Like seeking lifestories from an old man, we want these every now and then as a way of being imparted a certain wisdom about what road lies ahead, what toil, or worth in going the distance. We have a bit of self-reference in the main narrative device - a sweepstakes ticket promising a million bucks, fiction but it creates a real journey of return. We get to find out about a man who was not too good and not too bad, who tried in his way, failed where we might; evenhanded. But when we get to the point when the crestfallen old man says "I just wanted you to have something" and the dutiful son quips back that he just wanted to spend some time together the movie has long squandered its opening shot premise. Something pathetic, when it ends with redemption by way of buying a shiny new truck for your dad, signified in the son crouching down below so his dad can have one last hurrah as if that's where dignity comes from, being seen on some thing that costs money. Eulogy becomes lullaby, drinking syrup to hide the bitter taste of broken life. This is just how far this maker can see, not worth knowing as far as I'm concerned - his failure is total here. It's not that it's bad in being put together, a series of clean, simple verses, some of them endearing. It's a matter of not being able to impart value.This should be in what we've seen of the old town, which is the old man's memory shuffled about by time. There's nothing left behind that he should miss - this is nostalgia and memory, there's never anything there, the old farm of childhood is just a bunch of reeds. Bogdanovich was similarly quaint in Last Picture, his own last hurrah to much the same prairie, but he got this - the old town, the place of nostalgic memory, as an empty space with dust flying around.All of this has nothing to do with this being a borderline senile old man so what kind of meaning is there to find; it's how far you're able to see as the maker of that life. Would you settle for fiction that gives comfort? Neither did Cassavetes in Woman, he cuts, cuts, cuts with shards of life but finds transcendence in this very room, tonight. Leave this in the store, you can't buy wisdom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lose yourself on the Plains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Nebraska' is one of those delightful movies that slowly pulls you into the characters as it unfolds. It could have been a predictable, sweet, sentimental journey of an old man (Dern) who dreams of winning a million on one of those phony magazine subscription scams but fortunately it rises above this as you learn more about past of each character and how they react to each other today. I enjoyed the way the Plains are shown in monochrome, the long stretches of highway and the flat landscape with isolated farmhouses that suddenly just appear.Most of the story takes place in Hawthorne, a nicely chosen location that probably hasn't changed, like the inhabitants, for decades. The clever script gives the ladies much more to say than the men, who mostly give on one word answers, especially Dern's Woody Grant. One of the standout performances is from June Squibb playing Mrs Grant, a feisty, very funny lady who tells it like she sees it. There is also a gem of a vignette from Angela McEwan, her appearance only lasts a few minutes as Peggy Nagy, the local paper newspaper lady but the screen lights up with her performance.Woody Grant has to get to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his non-existent million and when he gets there I wondered how the movie would end, in fact it turns out to be a very credible finish to a wonderful road movie with a difference.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film expecting to see a touching masterpiece of our times but it didn't even remotely stand up to my expectations.Frankly I cannot understand what so many people enjoyed about it ,voting with more than 5. Payne cannot decide whether he is shooting a drama or a CHEAP black comedy and his effort to touch inner cords of viewers using the lost mind of Bruce Dern is insulting at times. The plot is ridiculous,the dialogs cringe-worthy ,the acting of the main cast totally unsuitable and the directing indifferent at best. However it gets 1 point for the fine acting of Bruce Dern even though his lines didn't help him at all ,1 point for the excellent photography of Phedon Papamichael and 1 point for the brave decision to shoot in B&amp;W which I really appreciated. So 3/10 for me!</fullReview>

He was an educated man, thankfully still with all his faculties, someone who had always eschewed winnings, suing, gambling, games of chance. He preached up to the Sunday before he left us. But that last summer he became convinced he was going to win the Readers' Digest contest that came in the mail, even going so far as to write to the company as well as to consult a lawyer - making sure that if he died before the final contest announcement my mother would receive the winnings.That same feeling, the same conviction is portrayed perfectly by Bruce Dern, one of my favourites. As Woody says, "Just wanted to leave you something...." So true, so true.Brilliant casting - Dern, Stacy Keach, Rance Howard, June Squibb, Will Forte et al - the crew, writer Bob Nelson and director Alexander Payne have created a gem - not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Picture a less dramatic "August Osage County" and you pretty much have "Nebraska."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sole reason I looked into this movie was so that I could claim I saw all the movies nominated for best performance by an actor, and actress, in either a lead or supporting role. With that said, there is a reason this was one of the last movies I sought out. Never mind it being black and white, for I loved The Artist despite that, but with only Will Forte being a recognizable name amongst the casts, I didn't see much in a way of appeal. But, even with that said, let's talk about the film.Characters &amp; StoryWoody (Bruce Dern) is in his twilight years, and between post-traumatic stress from being in the Korean war, to drinking, his mind is rather gone to the point he seems like he has the early signs of Alzheimer's. But, with two sons, David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk), as well as his wife Kate (June Squibb) looking out for him, they try to keep him in line. However, with Woody thinking he won a million dollars, and now wandering off on his own, Kate seemingly is too old and tired to try to keep a grown man in line. So, David decides to give into his dad's fascination and take him to Lincoln, Nebraska since Woody believes that he has won a million dollars. This leads to what seems to be a road trip movie, but with a pause in the dad's hometown of Hawthorne, we get to meet his dysfunctional family in full and though this doesn't take Woody's mind off getting to Lincoln, it does help liven the movie a bit.PraiseBless June Squibb for being in this movie. She strangely becomes a comic relief helping to alleviate from the dullness of the characters who have southern drawls and seem like, while they may not be backwater folk, they certainly are far from city folk. And while they do bring some sort of intrigue, to a point, Squibb keeps you from falling asleep by being feisty, a bit vulgar, and blunt enough to maybe give Betty White a run for her money.CriticismHowever, in terms of when Squibb isn't on screen, this movie fits into such a niche where I can't imagine someone sitting through 2 hours of this and not becoming bored and more focused on how their tail bone is hurting. Woody, while interesting, isn't anything like Frank on Shameless. Yes, he is deadbeat dad, sort of; an alcoholic; and probably a bit off in the head; but rather than them try to embellish his issues into entertainment, they make him a bit more human. And while this perhaps should be applauded, it at the same time makes for a dull viewing experience. Then, when you add on Forte's character, and Odenkirk, you add more and more cast members who are depicted as so normal, that it is easy to lose interest and eventually doze off.Overall: Skip ItUnless, like me, you prefer knowing the films nominated for major awards, there is really no reason to watch this movie. And, to be completely honest, this is probably the first movie I reviewed I didn't finish. I got to about an hour and some change in, and I just had to tap out. For while Squibb is like that methadone drip keeping this film alive, it isn't enough to alleviate your suffering from the immense boredom this film causes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nebraska (2013)With the iconic simple title (and some resonance with Bruce Springsteen), you might expect something more epic than this realistic, slice-of-life tale. But no, the movie is a black and white homage to the ordinary dignity and absurdity of a certain part of America?the poor, rural white folk from a wide open northern country more about disheveled strip malls than steppes and savannas.Don't forget, this is a comedy. It's wry and filled with little excesses that are almost believable. All in a package of gritty realism buttered up in clichs. The story revels in its simplicity, but it's too simple in the end. It is what it is, and you pretty much expect it all to happen as it happens. Even the last gesture by the ever thoughtful son is practically a given. It's all tinged with sadness, but also with goodness, and the experience is warm and if not quite dull, at least considering it.The two leading men are terrific: Bruce Dern as the father with just enough alertness and physical strength to want to collect the million dollars he things he won from a publisher's scam, and Will Forte as his son, who is the one family member left with some patience for the dad. From Montana they then set off toward Nebraska, and it becomes a quirky road trip movie, and then a family reunion movie. It plays off of the expectations of both of those genres?the bonding and liberation of the first and the awkwardness and weird memories of the second. There is a thriving, low key segment of contemporary cinema that works with utter realism in simple ways. The idea is partly to capture and convey what is, without embellishment or hollywoodization, and even without the aesthetic overtones of indie and some euro films. The best of these work well enough (there are the Linklater films, and writer-director Edward Burns comes to mind). There is no attempt to be documentary, but there is a deliberate sense of keeping the dramatic elements in check. It's about the scene, the feeling of time and place, and the uncovering of real kinds of people and their real problems. And solutions.Of course, something has to keep it going. And here is it a combination of the low-key humor and the solid acting. Is it enough? For me, it wasn't. As sympathetic as the characters are, there is something too familiar about them from stereotypes. I guess stereotypes come from real types, and so you can make a case that this is also just plain realistic, with the witty overlay in the writing. But we are defined also by our eccentricities, by our differences from the norm. I don't see that here.See it? Yes, if any of this sounds appealing. It's very good! Clearly lots of people are deeply affected by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nebraska" was nominated for a ton of Oscars, though it received none. This isn't surprising, since the film is exceptionally well made but is also NOT the sort of film the average viewer would enjoy or even pick in the first place. As for me and my lovely wife, we both had a very nice time watching this strange slice of life film.Bruce Dern plays Woody Grant--a somewhat confused old man who insists he's won a million dollars from a Publisher's Clearinghouse type of giveaway. However, he's just received a form letter and fake certificate. No matter how much his wife and sons tell him, Woody insists he's going to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect HIS money--even though it's at least a 12 1/2 drive to the town from Billings, Montana. So, again and again, Woody sneaks off--and tries walking to Lincoln! Eventually, in desperation, his son David (Will Forte) agrees to take him. However, along the way they make a fateful decision to stop by a town where Woody and the family lived a long, long time ago. What's going to happen there? See the film--I really don't want to spoil the surprise.The film is a slow, gentle affair. The music is appropriate and the acting always seems very natural. However, it did seem a bit strange that Dern was nominated for Best Actor, as Will Forte really was more the star of the movie. I guess we can chalk it up to aging actors and the Oscars syndrome. In other words, the AMPAS folks who pick the awards, LOVE nominating or awarding actors who have long paid their dues but who haven't gotten an Oscar--such as John Wayne for "True Grit" (not one of his best films) or Geraldine Page for "Trip to Bountiful". In fact, it's a film with no one dominant star--just lots and lots and lots of wonderful little performances.If you don't mind your humor VERY dry and aren't looking for explosions, boobs or mega-stars, then I suggest you try "Nebraska"--it just came out on DVD and is also available through Netflix.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, Beautiful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most beautiful film I have ever seen...no violence or sex just the true love of a son for his father. I am still in tears after 30 minutes following the end. The acting is simply outstanding...and the black and white film works perfectly. There is also some wonderful comedy - old compressor!? Most people in the world have no idea that the real USA is as portrayed in this moving film.....it's not just LA and New York this is how real America lives and survives. Bruce Dern will probably not win an Oscar as this film is too sentimental but both he and all the other actors including his 'wife' June Squibb and his son Will Forte especially and (better call Saul!) Bob Odenkirk are amazing. Can't wait to tell everyone about this masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska, has one of the best original screenplays of 2013 and I would have to put it in my top three favourite films of last year. After being quite disappointed with Alexander Payne's last directorial effort, The Descendants, I still had high hopes for Nebraska, as I really enjoyed both Election, About Schmidt and after repeat viewings I also warmed up to Sideways. I have only ever seen parts of Citizen Ruth, and not the whole thing, so I will not comment on that. With, Citizen Ruth, Payne worked with actress Laura Dern, and now he works with her father, Bruce, for Nebraska, where Dern gives out of his all time best performances. This is a film that reminded me of films that I honestly did not think were being made any more. Smaller films with nothing fancy about the characters and how they dress, or the interiors, or exteriors of the buildings they were in. It reminded me of some great 1970's and late 1960's films where they were a little rough around the edges, but what mattered was they had great acting, script and direction and Nebraska, has all that as well. The film's lead character and antihero, Woody Grant, is really a very interesting character. He is stubborn, at times drinks a lot and often mumbles and is incoherent a lot of the time. His family and friends try to talk to him, but he just has a blank look on his face, so you are never quite sure if he isn't catching on, or maybe there is more to this character than we think. As the film goes on both Woody, and his whole family are introduced to us and we get to know them a lot better. There is a lot of dysfunction in this family, much as there was in last year's August: Osage County, but I think I warmed up to the characters in Nebraska, a lot more. Especially, Woody's son David, who played here by Will Forte, does an excellent job. He is a quiet man and mild mannered in many ways and it often seems like he is the only one trying to relate to his father and connect with him in whatever way possible. Everyone else just has their own agendas, or their own plans with little to no thought about Woody, but you can tell that even though they have a somewhat distant relationship, that David really wants to make things work between them. The story also takes an interesting look at family life and the various dysfunctions in it, but also people's attitudes concerning money and greed, where all of a sudden , people you haven't seen in a long time start appearing and asking for a handout , regardless if they ever lent you anything, or if you really have all that much in common with them anyways. Nebraska, was shot in beautiful black and white cinematography and the low key almost depressing surroundings give the film the right mood it deserves. At times I laughed out loud several times during this film, but there were also parts that were quite sad of lost hopes and dreams and things that could have been and because of poor misguided decisions sometimes what we end up with is not always what we want. We get to know more about these characters during these times. Are they hiding things from their pasts? Perhaps hurts, losses, or things that have scarred them either emotionally, or physically in some ways? The film looks at all that and while you may not pick up on it at first, it becomes more evident as the film goes on. Payne, who has written most of the scripts for his films, did not pen Nebraska. Instead it came from first time screenwriter, Bob Nelson, who as I said above, gives one of the best original screenplays of last year, if not the very best. There are so many layers to this film and so much going on and to think about after you have left the theatre. It all seems funny in a way, but at the same time also tragic and sad as well. The film is nominated for six Academy Awards, but unfortunately the competition is so tight this year that I don't think anyone from the film will be bringing home any gold. The film is a triumph though for it's look at people, family, the human condition and why as families we often fight and do not get along, but there is something there that nevertheless keeps us together anyways. I laughed, was entertained and also had a lot to think about after Nebraska, and I am so glad I had a chance to see it on the big screen. One of my top 3 movies of 2013 and be sure to check it out when it is released on DVD and Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies of the Past 10 Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska is the story of an old man and his son who embark upon a personal journey to get an old man's (Woody) million dollars. While his two sons and wife know that this is a scam, Woody insists on traveling to Nebraska to collect his money. The characters and story are impressively crafted. And the choice to shoot the entire film in black and white only adds to the dramatic approach of the film that I loved. The acting is exemplary on all accounts. My personal favorite would be Bob Odenkirk of Breaking Bad alum. I must say I feel that it's one of those movies that right afterward is slightly underwhelming, but the more you think about it and analyze it the better it gets. It has an emotional range from laugh out loud awkwardness to just plain sobbing. Nebraska is one of my favorite movies and I'd say second only to Spike Jonze's "Her" in 2013. There is no debate, this movie is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Showcase For Bruce Dern</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An aging, booze-addled father (Bruce Dern) makes the trip from Montana to Nebraska with his estranged son (Will Forte) in order to claim a million-dollar Mega Sweepstakes Marketing prize.This film has been also nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Alexander Payne, Best Actor for Dern, Best Supporting Actress for June Squibb, and Best Original Screenplay. Let us tackle these in no particular order.First, June Squibb. She is fantastic, and despite a long career (she is now 84), she has never been recognized. Does being a sassy old woman get you an Oscar? Perhaps not, but it should. While it might come off as a "lifetime achievement" award, she deserves such an honor. She is the backbone of this film even if she is not the lead.Second, Bruce Dern. He is possibly the most talked about nominee in this category, mostly because of critics and fans praising him. Others have said he has had other great roles and this, like Squibb, comes across as a lifetime achievement award. That puts him in a position where even if he wins, it might look like pity. And that is a shame. While this may not be his best role (he has been a dominant actor for over fifty years), few films have allowed him to express himself so powerfully. I would be thrilled if he wins, though I suspect he will not.The rest of the awards fall on Alexander Payne for writing and directing. This is a guy who has really made a career out of great films, even if they have sometimes gone under the radar. "Citizen Ruth", starring Laura Dern (Bruce's daughter), is a great film for its dark comedy and its incredible satire of politics without getting politic. And since then, Payne has kept on delivering.Here, he uses his bold vision wisely, by casting Dern over A-list actors (which would have been distracting). He continues to focus on middle America, while everyone else is too busy filming the three big cities. And he went for the black and white, an artistic choice that can be polarizing and is generally not marketable (unless you happen to be Jim Jarmusch). This, too, was a wise move.The film is charming and humorous without ever fully becoming a comedy. A touch of the Coen Brothers' "Fargo", a dash of David Lynch's "Straight Story" and just a pinch of "Napoleon Dynamite". But not enough of any of these to ruin the flavor that is distinctly Payne. His work needs to be watched and studied, and his nominations will hopefully boost his reputation.All that being said, will Payne win any Oscars? In short, no. The script is clever but not particularly strong. The directing is bold, but not particularly inventive. And as far as being the best picture, it just does not make the cut. Top ten of 2013? Certainly. Possibly even top five. But in such a strong field, this is not the winner.Alexander Payne has won for his screenplays (both for "The Descendants" and "Sideways") and this will be his third time nominated for best director. He will win that category soon, but this is not that time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is very heartwarming and moving. it portrays love in different forms. a drunk father who doesn't speak a lot and let his kids drink beer at 6 years old, doesn't mean he doesn't love them, he is just doing his best. the movie is beautifully and smartly written to show us the reason behind every action. for example when the family went to visit woody's (Bruce Dern) old house where he grew up, we sensed how he grew up in a dysfunctional family where his parents used to hit him if he enters their room. also even his brother doesn't speak that much, which show that this is the way they grew up, no feelings expression. also from other dialogues we know that he was shot during the Korean war and he used to love some girl and he lost nearly his whole family. so, after all that should we still give his some credit for being the best father and husband he could be, or should we consider him a bad father and husband as his son and wife claimed!!the characters are very well written and make us care about them and want to know more. also amazing performance by the entire cast especially Bruce Dern.the only thing i didn't like is the black and white, and this is only because i like colors and don't get b&amp;w at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a good thing I watch this from a DVD. I had to speed up the player because the movie is so slow. Not much goes on most of the time.No only is it slow, there isn't much of a plot. Whatever little plot there is can be summarized: a man received a "you won a million bucks" letter from a magazine-selling company and decided to travel to the company to claim the money in person. But of course he didn't win.Surely by reading the smaller letters one can see that one hasn't won. The whole story is just not believable.There is no famous actor/actress. It is a low budget movie.As if it's not boring enough, the producer decided to make this a black and white movie. I really don't understand the inflated ratings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully photographed but flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Positives: The cinematography is gorgeous. Almost every shot could be an Ansel Adams photo. Bruce Dern believably portrays an old man full of regret, who feels as if he could blow away at any moment. Will Forte wisely underplays his role, letting his facial expressions do most of the talking, and his mother and brother are both great. I also enjoyed his two big, unemployed homebody cousins.Negatives: This movie is glacially paced, and I am saying that as a big fan of very slow-paced movies (2001, Paris, Texas, etc). We basically watch a series of short vignettes on people that are getting old. The plot is so threadbare it barely even exists. We hear so many useless conversations ("You used to drive a Chevy, didn't you?" "What?" "Didn't you used to drive a Chevy?" "No, I drove a Buick." "Oh yeah. What happened to it?" "It stopped working." "Ah, yeah, it'll do that.") that are supposed to make us laugh because of how useless they are, but the joke gets just as old as the characters telling it when we hear it fifty times in two and a half hours.Most of the townspeople are as flat as cardboard. Dern's old auto mechanic partner might as well twirl his mustache evilly after every line he says. Everyone is singularly and very predictably obsessed with Dern's money, when a simple thirty-second explanation from Will Forte would have solved the entire issue. It very predictably causes family drama, even though there is very little reason for everyone to BELIEVE Dern's claim in the first place, especially since the entire rest of their family denies it at all points.The jokes have no punch. The scenes feel disconnected and unimportant. And who didn't see the ending coming a mile away? Of course there's no million, and of course he buys his dad the truck anyway. And why did Dern tell him to duck down in his seat? That made no sense to me. Especially when he knew (or suspected) that Forte had bought him the car, it seemed very un-classy.I dunno. I've seen better movies about growing old and facing down regret. This one felt like a first draft.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film really made an impression on me. The movie is fantastically directed by Alexander Payne who is renowned and has been praised for the movies Sideways and The Descendants amongst others. He brings a different style to the directing role through his inspired shots of the wide and stagnant Nebraskan country side and does a fantastic job at emphasising isolation, not just geographically but emotionally within the characters. His interesting take and choice of filming the movie in black and white, shows something about his vision of what seems to be the characters understanding of each other, but as the movie progresses we see that is not true at all. He has truly hit the spot direction wise and I am very interested to see what he will be coming up with in the future. The Camera work in this movie is astonishing. We have a fantastic variation of shots in this movie. We have shots varying from these long in frame, and duration, shots of the elegant Nebraskan farming scenery, to these close up and medium shots of David and Woody (and all the characters) that show us a very raw and corrupted relationship between a father and son. Through the arrangement of these shots we gain a rare insight and experience into this family's distraught life and gives the title 'Road Trip Movies' a new name. The juxtaposition of acting we get in this movie between Will Forte and Bruce Dern is inspired. The ex-alcoholic father and the son who will do almost anything to not turn out like him. We get a real insight into the mindset of all the characters in this movie through the incredible acting of not only Will Forte and Bruce Dern but the entire supporting cast as well. Through this movie we also get a fantastic contrast in the acting ability of Will Forte, with his interesting performance as the jerk cop in the comedy movie, 'The Watch,' and his stunning portrayal of a quirky yet gentle souled man who only wants to do right by his father and the rest of his family. I was truly taken in by this movie and really understand why Bruce Dern was given the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival and believed him, and the movie in general, deserved more credit than it was given at the Academy Awards. Overall though, if you are interested in semi-art type movies, you should enjoy this quite thoroughly, but if you are more of a blockbuster film type person I would suggest you look for something else unless you are willing to take a little walk on the wild side. Great movie though 9/10</fullReview>

But its beautiful and I love the way Payne tells the heart warming story of an old man and his son and the son fulfilling a crazy desire of his father.The movie captures the emotions of people and beautifully tells us how people change when they see the need in us.Burce Dern is fantastic as the old man running after something which doesn't exist. He has the spirit and is not ready to give up. Forte is another fine actor who beautifully plays the loving and caring son who is willing to go the distance with his father. And finally there is June Squibb who plays Dern's fire brand wife. She has all the best dialogues in the film and humiliates her husband every time. But stands upto him when it matters.A nice film to watch on weekends with family and friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it's accurate, it's an embarrassing indictment on small town America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching a film like Nebraska makes me wonder what exactly is the purpose of watching a movie? Well, for me, here are a few of the possible reasons and some of the feelings I expect to experience when I watch a good film.? Entertainment ? Amusement, laughs ? Excitement, thrills ? Shock, fear, horror ? Personal edification &amp; knowledge ? Enrichment, inspiration ? Happiness ? Sadness ? Sentiment and nostalgia. ? So where does Nebraska fit in? I confess that for about the first 20 minutes, I found the subject matter so dire that I almost gave up, and the only reason I kept going was because I had undertaken to write a small review, which I could hardly do if I didn't watch it. Thankfully, it did start to get a little better and in the end I was able to watch the remainder without resorting to 'fast forward' or the 'off' button.So what was so bad about it? (I hear you asking.) Let me start by saying what was good about it. It was well acted; it was beautifully filmed, (within seconds you forget that the film is in black and white, as the cinematography is so riveting); it was well- written; it was well directed; and, very occasionally, it was mildly amusing.So what was wrong with it then??? It was so effing depressing! It is a road movie about a senile, alcoholic old man thinks he has won a million dollars when he receives a scam magazine subscription flyer and is determined to travel nearly a thousand miles across America to claim his prize. It could have been written with a fair measure of humour, but sadly, it wasn't. The old man is a very unpleasant, cantankerous old bastard, and by all accounts he always had been ? according to his two, not particularly charismatic sons. His wife clearly hates him and can't wait to have him put in a home. His youngest son has a dead- end job selling home hi-fi systems to people who don't want them in the middle of a recession and just about everyone in the movie appears to be in financial straits. The old man's son is somehow persuaded to drive his senile father across country to claim his non-existent prize and on the way they stop at the old man's hometown where his long forgotten friends and some of his relatives still live.While there, he stays with more depressing members of his family who have two dreadful sons who believe his silly 'millionaire' story and try to rob him of the winning ticket. Other relatives come to visit and fights break out as they and other old friends decide it is payback time and demand some of the winnings from the senile old man. But you don't really feel sorry for the senile old bastard as he has absolutely zero redeeming qualities. You just don't care.I could go on and on but it's too depressing to write about.The director is Alexander Payne who directed the wonderful film, 'About Schmidt' ? which is another road movie that starred the brilliant Jack Nicholson in his prime.'About Schmidt' was as wonderful as 'Nebraska' is dire. Nebraska is mid-numbingly brutal on the senses. It has no uplifting moments, not even near the end, when the son puts his father behind the wheel of a truck to give him a few moments of rare happiness.Sure, there are occasional moments of mild amusement in the second part of the movie, such as when the two sons, in an effort to repay a supposed grudge of 30 years standing, steal an ancient compressor from the wrong, (run-down) farm, but believe me, these moments are few are far between and they really ain't that funny. Indeed, everyone in the movie seems to bear grudges against everyone else and there is total absence of anything approaching goodwill or love ? or even common to garden pity. The overriding message of this movie is just how depressingly awful are some of these small-towns that criss-cross the great American landscape, and how miserable and impoverished are its inhabitants ? especially when they grow old and start to lose their marbles.The professional reviewers are just purring about this movie and they all think it is one of the finest films of the year. Even most of the user reviewers on IMDb are positively glowing and it gets an incredible star rating of 7.2 out of 10. I suppose if you want to spend just under two hours being depressed by alcoholism, senility, poverty, slimy fast-food outlets, dusty, cheerless bars, couch- potato TV addicts, unfulfilled lives, greed, jealousy, bigoted ignorance and all the horrors of grim, Hicksville America, then this is the movie for you.It's kind of strange, as Americans seem to really like this movie, yet to me, if it's accurate, it's an embarrassing indictment on small town America. For the record, back in 2,000, I drove right across 'Hicksville America' and what I found was a million miles removed from the towns and folk as portrayed in the movie, Nebraska. I find it difficult to believe that such communities with such unremittingly grim inhabitants exist in quite the way depicted in this movie.But Director Payne was actually born in Nebraska, (of Greek descent) so maybe he knows better than me?..</fullReview>

All of the actors do an excellent job of making you forget they are actors. The small turns and twists keep it engaging without getting too far-fetched. It had me engrossed all the way through the closing credits, and some aspects of it really hit home (Bruce Dern reminded me of my late father in many ways).I doubt this film won any major awards but it should have.

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne directs "Nebraska". Another of the director's "road movies", it stars Bruce Dern as Woody Grant, an elderly man who thinks he's won a million dollars. In an attempt to collect his winnings, Grant journeys from Montana to Nebraska. Joining him is his son David (Will Forte)."Nebraska" recalls "The Last Picture Show", "Paris, Texas" and David Lynch's "The Straight Story". Like those films, it portrays a world in decline, dreams shattered, hopes dashed and aspirations stifled. Where "Nebraska" differs from its siblings is in the way its characters all parasitize one another. Everyone's extinguishing the dreams of someone else or using someone else to make their own desires come true. As a result, Payne's cast drift like bodies sucked dry by vampires, forlorn, dying, or on the verge of surrender. Even the film's million dollar prize is but a scam by a magazine company. Even the film's aesthetic ? chilly blacks and whites ? suggests a world sucked dry of life and leached of all colour. Even the film's settings, lonely and abandoned, suggest a world in decay. Even the film's...But David refuses to abide. He begins to empathise with his father, who longs for heaps of money and a brand new truck. The film's million dollar prize, David comes to realise, has become his father's last ditch attempt to reverse a lifetime of disappointment. "All he wanted was to sleep, was to dream of escape," characters say in "Paris, Texas". Woody Grant seeks a similar flight from reality. It's a flight which David facilitates. He buys his father a new truck and lets him drive it through his old home town; the bragging rights of an insecure man. An unappreciated man. And, at times, a monster of a man.Alfred Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt", one of the first films to subvert America's Norman Rockwellesque image of herself, ended with a little girl lying so that The American Dream might be preserved. "Nebraska" ends in a similar way. Neither David nor Woody really believe that a million dollars have been won, or that a life has been salvaged, but they choose to believe anyway. They choose to preserve a myth.Like most of Payne's films, "Nebraska's" female characters are poorly written and/or used as easy comedic props. Still, Bruce Dern is excellent as Woody and Will Forte is fine in a rare serious role. Elsewhere the film offers some nice landscape shots, all sad and wistful. June Squibb co-stars.7.9/10 ? See "Away from Her" and "Paris, Texas".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's Nebraska is the story of an elderly man's quest to collect a million dollar prize he's won in the post. Starring Bruce Dern - in a career-best performance - his character, Woody, is first seen trying to walk from Montana to Nebraska when he's stopped on the highway by a police officer. Woody isn't entirely clear of mind, whilst his sons are aloof and his wife, played brilliantly by June Squibb, constantly berates him. But Woody is determined to get his million dollars and endeavours to walk to Nebraska even when his son explains that it's only a mail scam that he's trying to collect. Undeterred, Woody is soon being driven to Nebraska by his son, where the narrative picks up on the conventions of a buddy/road movie, as they encounter numerous situations and characters along the way. In particular, Woody's devious old business partner, played superbly by Stacy Keach, and a leeching family who want their share of Woody's money. At times, Nebraska is reminiscent of Yashujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story, with the elderly characters being misunderstood and unappreciated by their children, until they learn of their lives, loves and a very full existence that came to shape who they are. This is brilliant and affecting story-telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie feels like a very early concept for "About Schmidt". Like "Sideways" and "About Schmidt", this is a road/travel movie. It's extremely minimalist: Low-key, very slow and filmed in black and white and hardly have "dramatic" scenes - I'm not saying all that in a bad way (actually, it took me a while to even realize it's filmed in B&amp;W, since it didn't "bother" me at all).The concept and tone is very similar to "The Straight Story (1999)", but IMO Lynch's movie is better.It's not a bad movie, it just doesn't even come close to the level of the masterpieces that are "Sideways" and "About Schmidt".Nice cinematography, nice score, good performance by Bruce Dern (I'm not familiar with his previous work) and June Squibb (who also appeared in "About Schmidt"). Do they deserve an Oscar nomination? I'm not certain. They are good in their roles, but I'm not certain it's Oscar worthy. Rance Howard (Ron Howard's dad) plays the brother.BTW, it's so weird to watch Bob Odenkirk outside the character of Saul from "Breaking Bad".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nebraska is a 2013 American black-and-white comedy-drama film directed by Alexander Payne and written by Bob Nelson. It stars Bruce Dern, Will Forte, June Squibb, and Bob Odenkirk.Cantankerous old buzzard Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) can barely walk down the street of his home in Billings, Mont., without stopping for a drink. So when Woody receives receives a sweepstakes notice in the mail and insists on making a 750-mile trip to Lincoln, Neb., to collect his prize, it falls to baffled son David (Will Forte) to accompany him. During a stop in their Nebraska hometown, word gets out about Woody's fortune, first making him a hero, then later, the target of predatory people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So long, Woody......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>tempestuous Montana father is convinced he's won a million-dollar magazine sweepstakes. His begrudgingly agrees to drive him to Nebraska to claim his winnings......Even though Payne makes relationships in his movies very acute, this has to be the most personal, the most intricate relationship story he has done.Its clear from the monotone film that the journey is going to be long, arduous, and very bitter, and in this sense, it doesn't let you down, it has that bittersweet edge that all of Payne's films have.Dern is brilliant in this, so brilliant in fact, that if he never makes another movie, he will be among those rare actors whose last film was exceptional. Not even Hackman, Connery, or Eastwood can claim to be in this group.He's wonderfully bitter, brilliantly stubborn, and the most immature character in the movie. We all know his journey is going to end with him being empty handed, but with all his ties and requests from townsfolk on the way to his claim, one cannot help but have their fingers crossed for him to win.Support from Forte and Keach is brilliant and even though the film is hilarious in places, it doesn't stop you from feeling cold and depressed at the same time.Its a great movie, Dern hasn't been this good in years, and rightly so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Substance over style, wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nebraska" is an excellent film, one I enjoyed a lot watching at the theater. This may not come very surprising as I am a sucker for good black-and-white films, especially modern ones. One of the highlights here was the soundtrack ("Their Pie"). It fit the melancholic tone of the film perfectly and there was also a nice karaoke scene using "Time after Time", which was also used in "Up in the Air", another film I like a lot. Bruce Dern won in Cannes and scored an Academy Award nomination, but I found his co-lead Will Forte equally convincing. He did not receive any awards recognition, but played his character wonderfully as well. June Squibb, who also got Oscar-nominated, brought a lot to the movie as the wife to Dern's character. She is a bit gruff, but you could still see that she loves her man, especially in that hospital scene when she gives him a kiss on the cheek, quite sweet and gave me a lump in my throat. Other than that she brought great comic relief by creating quite a unique character, that is as subtle as in-your-face. I wanted her to win the Academy Award, but Nyong'o is a good choice too, much better than Lawrence certainly."Nebraska" is the next great movie for Alexander Payne after "The Descendants". He is on quite a roll right now and I am curious about what his next project is gonna be. All the characters were excellently written and the actors who played them were casted accurately. There were scenes when the camera did not move at all and it worked so well with watching the characters from a stable point of view. Reminded me of the ending (the sofa scene) from "The Descendants" and I already liked it a lot there too. Those two fat money-craving hillbillies were so weird, but still it fit. They weren't even scared of robbery. And you could see why as they were probably already taught it when they were little boys. Pretty much everybody the main characters come across just wants money from them. A bit sad as these are people he knew for all his life. Forte's first punch at some point was certainly worth applauding. Seeing Bob "Saul" Odenkirk was nice too as I liked him on Breaking Bad.The film starts a bit strange as Dern's character is repeatedly stopped from the attempt of fetching his money. Soon you understand the context though and that is when it all makes sense. That was all I saw from the trailer, so i was a bit surprised how the movie turned into a completely different direction as a bit of a family reunion after 30 minutes. The son joins the father on his journey back tot he roots as he meets people from his past, women or visits a cemetery and realizes that so many are already gone.The story with the girlfriend of Forte's character was the only thing that did not do much for me. There is obviously the connection to whether he would marry her and why his dad would marry his wife back then, but other than that there really wasn't any significance to it. Better scenes were when the four accidentally break into the wrong house and how the two old people keep telling afterward about how the couple that lives in there were always such good people. The final scene was brilliant too. He did not get the money, but he made everybody think he did. So the old crank was actually right. Seeing their faces was pretty hilarious. However, it was equally sad to hear the woman at the office say how many old people come there to get their prize, because they just can't understand anymore that, in today's world, things do not mean anymore what they say. They just believe what they are told.This is really a quality film you would not want to miss and I am glad it got so much awards recognition. There is so much subtle humor and great character development in it from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the film Nebraska to be very interesting and different than most films I've seen in the modern era. The movie is filmed in black and white (or some version of black and white) and moves at a relatively slow pace. However, I could not stop watching this film as it slowly pulled me in. The film's plot is very simple. The film is about an old man who has supposedly won a $1 million and follows his journey to claim the prize in Lincoln, Nebraska. The film does an amazing job of depicting rural America and the simplicity of small town America. Being from rural America myself, I almost could feel the depressed and isolated nature of some of these small towns. During several scenes, I could certainly relate to this film. Again, the film does not move quickly, but there is a small mystery as to what is going to happen. Bruce Dern was fantastic as Woody Grant. He does an amazing job of depicting a man that is on the verge of Alzheimer's or some form of dementia. But there is something very likable and simple about Woody. Will Forte does a great job as David Grant (Woody's son). He gives a solid performance that was Oscar worthy for supporting actor in my opinion. June Squibb plays Kate Grant (Woody's wife) and she provides comic relief and blunt honesty. This film is for a more mature crowd in my opinion...35 and over. I don't think a young person would enjoy or completely understand this film. While the film is simple in nature, there are several deeper issues that would only be understood by people with life experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A middle-aged man, exasperated with his father's determination to chase a bogus million-dollar prize, takes the extreme step of accompanying his father on a journey to 'claim' his prize. The story is simple and heartfelt, exploring in well-observed detail the micro-frustrations and complex relationships of family. It also authentically depicts the corrupting influence of the lure of big money, and the claustrophobia of small-town living. However, the character of the mother is not quite convincing. She seems determined to say something shocking and amusing that becomes repetitive as the film goes on. Great acting, with Bruce Dern a standout in his sympathetic portrayal of dementia. A moving portrayal of the dilemmas of family life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful slice of small town life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(78%) A blunt, open, and very humorous look at life, death, family and getting old. This really is the best road movie ever based around a completely pointless journey, but of course the "winning" ticket plot device isn't the main or only concept at play here. Bruce Dern really is untouchable in this role, as he plays Woody without a shred of disbelief in anything the does or says, or indeed in a lot of cases what he doesn't say or do, he's just so damn perfect that this is his movie through and through. That's not to say the rest of the cast aren't very good too, June Squibb as Woody's very to the point wife gets a good share of the some of the best laughs, while Will Forte keeps everything together. Overall a somewhat highly recommended, non Hollywood glossed-over look at small town average life, that tells its simple yet thought-packed story very effectively at its own pace, and in its own particular way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Nebraska; Woody is a boggled drunkard convinced he has won millions. He embarks on a trip from Montana to Lincoln Nebraska to collect the millions, untrusting of the post, with his son David in tow acting as his guardian.The entire movie is bleak, portrayed entirely in black in white, though that directorial choice by Alexander Payne is not necessary. Casting, acting, script, costume and set design suffice to convey a dreary lower middle class existence. What starts as plot about a son attempting to take care of an unmanageable father quickly changes tone when they end up at Woody's hometown.Bruce Dern is nuanced as the slightly senescent and doddering central figure of this film as Woody. I will not be surprised if he scoops up the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. His character is not likable, and yet, you do not hate nor blame him because of his sincerity in conviction. Kate is far more disagreeable as his harsh, crude, judgmental wife. June Squibb is unwaveringly on point as this highly realistic personality. Both actors show a commitment to their craft in a subtlety that is typically lost in films nowadays ? worthy of their nominations and even potential wins.As a whole, the average moviegoer will probably not choose to watch this film. It is far too realistic in subject matter, which is a shame. But, for those film buffs who appreciate a superb and fleshed out story, this movie will be a treat.Find more film reviews at our website</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, irksome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I was touched by the father/son dynamic, I was irked by the tired stereotypical treatment that small-town America always seems to require when portrayed by the movie industry. The role of the two grown children of Woody's brother was particularly cartoonish, and the lines written for his wife were simply unbelievable. I have grown up in and around small towns, and found myself disappointed with the film's "straw America" attack. People in small towns, I have found, are typically of loftier character than what Hollywood would have us believe. I have always admired Bruce Dern, and am happy to see him on screen again... I just wish more respect had been paid to that generation that grew up in an age where people perhaps knew more of life than the one that critiques them.Was the black-and-white treatment supposed to suggest, as in Pleasantville, that these people lead colorless lives? Perhaps not. But sometimes I wished I could have enjoyed the blue sky Dern's character was absorbed by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very human and sympathetic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot entirely in black-n-white, paced slowly and mostly dealing with very ordinary human problems, Nebraska will nevertheless win you over with its wit, heart and humanity. It's a tale of Woody Grant (Bruce Dern), who's convinced he has won a million dollars and is now trying to get to Nebraska in order to collect it. Every other person knows it's a hoax, but eventually his son decides to humour him to give him peace of mind and to spend some time with his dad.From there we get... a road trip movie, more or less. The formula is nothing new here and even greatly resembles About Schmidt, the director's earlier effort. It even takes place in Nebraska, once again. Still, I feel that the shift to the point of view of an older man and the different people they meet along the way warrant the existence of this film.I also cannot praise Bruce Dern's performance enough. Woody Grant is an addle-minded drunkard, who has allowed people take advantage of his good will throughout his entire life. His wife doesn't like him all that much, his children regard him with pity and while most people would agree he's an okay guy, not many will miss him. And that's what makes him so human. Dern brings him close to you, showing the decent man beneath the alcoholic and the inept father beneath the good friend. He's oh so very flawed, but you'll find yourself pulling for this guy and you start hoping with him that it's not just a hoax.The supporting cast is also phenomenal and there is not a single bad character in the entire film. All feel unique and three-dimensional, like they all have their own stories to tell, like they belong.Nebraska is a simple story with deep execution, perfectly flawed characters, really good dialogues and enough heart to lift up your day instantly. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific family movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Senile old Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) in Billings, Montana received a mailing from Mega Sweepstakes Marketing. He insists on going to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his million dollars. He keeps trying to walk there and everybody thinks he's lost his mind. His wife Kate Grant (June Squibb) and son Ross Grant (Bob Odenkirk) have had enough and want to put him in a home. His other son David Grant (Will Forte) is in a rut and decides to take him on a road trip.Director Alexander Payne brings a sense of the western small towns to the big screen. It's a wonderful character study of this family. Bruce Dern is understated in his delusional state. Will Forte is making his best dramatic performance. June Squibb is out-of-this-world hilarious at the brassy wife. Anything could be coming out of that mouth and it's insanely funny. It's a great exclamation point for a long Hollywood career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Payne's excellent ode to human warmth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Paynes' heartwarming father-son road trip (with mother and another son join then quit in the midway) in his home state, saturated in a nostalgic black-and-white monochrome, NEBRASKA is sophisticated witty and charismatically affecting, comfortably sits in the niche of Payne's outstanding wheelhouse. Woody Grant (Dern) is simple-minded after his one-million winner sweepstakes, anyone with a sensible common sense would know it is a scam, as his wife Kate (Squibb) and two sons, Ross (Odenkirk) and David (Forte) eagerly dissuade him. But with early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, Woody is pigheaded, so, David is motivated to drive him to capital Lincoln to ostensibly collect his reward, while in reality it offers a rare opportunity for him to bond with his father, whom he doesn't know too much about as later when they have a short sojourn in Woody's hometown Hawthorne.When news spread in the town, many honest-to-goodness folks send their benediction, whereas Woody's former business partner Ed (Keach) and some of his remote relatives blatantly try to get a slice of the windfall, a vile entailment exists in even seemingly simple-minded populace.Cars and sports, are the two perennial staples in the stale life of those men animately depicted by Payne here, the Grant's men are all introvert and taciturn, a family gathering is sitting in front of the TV watching baseball, and the sole topic of their occasional men's take is cars. DP Phedon Papamichael creates stunning shots to expressly pay homage to the rustic vastness and the tender intimacy thickens when the story unwinds. A six-times Oscar nominee, BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR, LEADING ACTOR, SUPPORTING ACTRESS, ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY and CINEMATOGRAPHY. One sure thing is that the film squarely skews toward the demography of academy members. Dern downplays Woody's reticent nature and radiates a fierce acuteness against his senior posture, and never panders to showiness, silently one will be involuntarily moved by what a weathered soul he has, a good-hearted man's ordinary life with unspoken back story can be incredibly heart-touching. Will Forte (a co-lead in my book), against his nature as a laughter instigator, cogently justifies his bent in the field of melodrama, perfectly counter-balances Dern's obstinacy, acts as an audience's proxy to get close to a withdrawn father figure, which can be reflected upon one's own real life feasibly. Squibb, a firebrand and a real hoot to liven up the comedic sensibility, moreover, she is a relentless defender can tear down any barriers in the way of their family solidarity.Payne's direction is impeccable, especially focuses on those details which can be easily ignored in our mundane life and transmits a poetic affection to viewers, e.g, the final scene, after a show-off which avoids overcompensating with the vengeful ostentatiousness, life returns to its normal state, but afterward, it is a worthy trip to remind us to truly fulfill our filial responsibility, in a more spontaneous and earnest manner.</fullReview>

I could relate to the boredom of the lives these people portrayed as my family was originally from a near by state. We left. The black and white photography added to the film and wasn't just a hype for attention. Bruce Dern was terrific. He represented so many people in that age range and in that point in their lives. Sweetly done. June Squibb as "Kate" was very convincing as a horrible person. There were a couple of very stereotypical characters, but overall the cast and all of the extras were great.</fullReview>

Bruce Dern's performance in the role of the old Woody is simply astounding - as already happened, it's enough to lose some kilos to get an academy award without digging too much into the real calibration of the character. The starting scene is hilarious, with Woody just indicating by the fingers where he's coming from and going to, and the ending one is simply and genuinely moving, with him driving with his new truck through the old enemies, the lost loves and the forgotten relatives, looking at and waving them for the last time. Widely underrated, I am sure it will become a cult.</fullReview>

I guess the point is, getting old sucks, but we were human after all...something kinda tiresome and bland like that? Like the black and white photography? Like the contrived old-people raunchiness that's the only source of comic relief aside from "Midwesterneres are sure stupid aren't they?" Like a poorly thought out plot with holes (especially regarding the sons' money, transportation) and unrealistic, flat characters (the "villain", the "nice stupid Midwesterners")?

		<fullReview>Well, being a fan of 1999's "Election" made me admire Alexandre Payne's job, and after seeing "Nebraska", I can only laud him as a director. This movie's main plot is about an old man who believes to have won a prize in the amount of one million dollars. Although his adult son (David) knows it's just a worthless promotional letter, he, David, decides taking Woody to Nebraska, indulging to the old man. There are some hilarious scenes made with simplicity, like the teeth losing, the cemetery, the reception in Aunt Martha's home and the opportunist relatives in Hawthorne. But, what makes this story really comical is the strong character of Mrs. Kate, greatly performanced by June Squibb. She had all the energy to make the story funny and entertaining. Also, there is a great message of love when, after everything the boys get into, the son asks his father: "Dad, why do you want a million dollars or a truck so much, if you don't even drive anymore". And then, the old dad answers: "Because I wanted to leave something to you when I pass away." That scene felt extremely touching for me, and that's when I indeed realized I was seeing a marvelous drama. Congratulations for the team!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heartfelt and memorable trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems as though every year a small yet in many ways significant film comes out of left field and strikes a chord with both audiences and critics, normally these films are human interest stories that don't reach for the stars yet achieve it none the less ? last year this film was Alexander Payne's heartfelt and often bitingly funny Nebraska.Featuring veteran actor Bruce Dern in an Oscar nominated role as aged Woody Grant that will hopefully send his career out on a high and some truly wonderful supports from Will Forte as hapless son David, Bob Odenkirk as successful and less tolerable son Ross and perhaps most memorable of all June Squib (in another Oscar nominated turn) as loud mouth and speak as it is family matriarch Kate, Nebraska is a little gem of a film that will slowly but steadily draw you into its tale and quite often take you by surprise with its direction. That Nebraska is such a joy is not only down to a cast totally and utterly in synch with their material but a smart understated turn behind camera by successful director Payne and one of last year's best scripts by screenwriter Bob Nelson.Filming in a stark black and white palette and with fantastic cinematography from Phedon Papamichael (not to mention some great composing work from Mark Orton) Payne shows a real affiliation with the material here and it's arguably one of his strongest films yet even more so than Sideways and the oft overrated The Descendants. While Payne's direction is always leading the way the path before him was set by some smart, witty and emotionally charged script work by Nelson whose written journey becomes more than a mere road trip by morphing into a tale about fathers and sons and what shapes someone into who they are at the present. It's a relatable journey and one that will speak volumes to many different people and a masterstroke at the understated even though more than once you will find yourself laughing much harder than countless other comedies can only dream of achieving.In many ways a small film yet in many other ways a film dealing with big issues such as dementia, depression and family, Nebraska is a very fine piece of filmmaking that deserved to get recognised the way in which it did at Awards ceremony's the world over. Nebraska is worth the trip even more so when you consider the fine work by one of the industry's true veterans in the form of Bruce Dern who delivers one of the best old timer performances since Jack Nicholson in Payne's other road trip adventure About Schmidt.4 compressors out 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minimal fun, but a dash of heart.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in black and white and given its title, sounds like this one's going to be a slog.It's surprisingly upbeat, at times. And despite the heavy material there are some heartwarming moments.The humor's light, subtle and grey, but there's a handful of laugh-out-loud scenes. The two heavyset thickheaded cousins, played by Kevin Kunkel and Devin Ratray, are hilarious.There's a lot of sad dreariness you've got to wade through, but hey, it's about a delusional old man who's foolishly pursuing a fake million-dollar prize. It's one of those films, but it's pretty good!If you don't see a lot of movies, this isn't a high priority on your list. It's not a boring story; it's dull subject matter woven into a compelling narrative.Will Forte, Bruce Dern, June Squibb, Bob Odenkirk and Stacy Keach are all great in this movie. The acting's seamless through and through.The plot is occasionally frustrating, because everything that seems to go right is diminished by the events that follow.I like Nebraska, there's some funny stuff in here.I buy into the story, and am content enough to be watching it, but feel like I'm grasping for reasons I enjoy it.I really like the score for the first half of the movie and grow quite tired of it by the end.This material doesn't get me going though. I don't really enjoy watching the sad inevitabilities of existence."But Steve! It's real life man. It accurately depicts the way things are in reality."Yeah. It's profound stuff.Seriously though. Along with Amour from last year, August Osage County and this, the sad realities of elderly life are really getting pushed hard at the Oscars.I'm not sure why Nebraska's up for Best Picture. It's not nearly such an egregious error as August Osage or Gravity though.This is a good enough movie with strong performances from a talented cast, and decent laughs.Don't rush out and see it.But if you like to see all the worthwhile Oscar nominees, Nebraska should be on your list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, creative low-key drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rated R for vulgar dialogue. As far as profanity there are no more than 2 F-Words and swearing here and there, but it didn't rate that high on violence. So it is perhaps a tame R-rated film. The film was fascinating to me, as I am from the Northwest and was pleased that civilized Montana and everywhere from Billings to Lincoln got more coverage in the Cinema as there hasn't been enough. Billings (Montana's largest city) has about 110,000 people in the city proper and is absolutely in the middle of nowhere as far as looking for as a big city is concerned and before the road trip, the movie references places and streets in the city rarely heard of unless you are from around there. Woody Gran, played by Bruce Dern, who I most remember from Joe Dante films, is a gruff, elderly, alcoholic who is led to believe from mail that he was won a million dollars in a sweepstakes prize and is is no shape to make the 800 miles journey to Lincoln, Nebraska, so he gets in touch with his gentle and kind-natured but estranged son, David (Will Forte). The filming style is pretty artsy, and of course, it is in black and white and plays much more like a quirky drama than a comedy. Woody reluctantly hits the road with David and they stop in a bar along the way, drawing attention to themselves and Woody ends up in a hospital in Rapid City where his wife chooses to join them on their trip. Once in Nebraska, they set up home away from home at relatives, which includes David's cousins, which also includes Devein Ratray, who played the airhead, annoying older brother in Home Alone. I hadn't heard of him being in much since Dennis The Menace in 1993, but apparently he has taken more roles since then that I was aware of, so that got me more interested in the whole production. Word gets around in the po dunk Nebraska town that Woody has won a million dollars. The movie paints a picture of the kind of Small town American life with seemingly low standards and morals where the bar scene is popular. It becomes a reunion between Woody and his friends and kin from when he was a younger man and got married. David and his cousins even try and abscond with a piece of farm equipment from Woody's younger years. The kin become aggressively demanding of a share in the winnings. Nebraska was deemed a great tale of redemption. Woody was an immoral and got into a lot of trouble as a youth and a younger man and some of the dialect was pretty vulgar. Later in the movie, the father and son make it to Lincoln to see what the sweepstakes letter was all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So far this is my pleasant surprise of 2014 movie-watching at home. Oh, I was expecting a good movie, considering the director and the actors, but I had no idea ahead of time that it would be this good. All those award nominations it received were well-earned. The movie was shot with digital cameras and in black &amp; white, and it works extremely well, considering the stark but humorous subject. In the making-of extra you can see quite a number of locations and actors in color and it drives home the realization how good the B&amp;W choice was. I saw this on BluRay and the picture is super!The movie starts with the main character, Bruce Dern in perhaps his best-ever role as Woody Grant. It is 8:44AM and 28 degrees, as he walks along the highway at the Billings, Montana city limits, leaving town. He has decided to walk to Nebraska. He received one of those "you've won a million dollars" certificates in the mail and he doesn't want to take a chance of it getting lost in the mail, and he can't drive anymore. So he is walking ... until a policeman brings him home.Woody doesn't read all the fine print, "if you have the matching number", but his son, Will Forte as David Grant knows it is only a common ruse to sell magazines. It has been going on for decades and unfortunately ever so often someone thinks they really won the money.So, unable to convince his dad, and not wanting him to walk to Nebraska, decides to take a couple of days off his job as a home theater equipment salesman and take a road trip with dad. The diversion is welcome and maybe he and dad can bond a bit. So they end up with a few misadventures along the way and also end up in dad's old hometown, visiting with relatives and old friends. Of course some of those want Woody to give them part of his newfound loot.I can't say too many good things about June Squibb (wife who died in 'About Schmidt') who plays the mom, Kate Grant. Her character is brutally honest and funny and adds a lot of the spice to this movie. In fact all the actors are good. Just a real entertaining delight of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My father left "Nebraska" when he was a child and never went back or expressed any interest to go back. So I never knew many of my Nebraska aunts, uncles and cousins, nor did I ever know any of them very well. But there they are all were, conveniently packaged in a movie just like I remember them. In fact, one of the two brothers in the movie looks almost exactly like my brother, and it is kind of a standing joke in my family: My older brother, who has never been to Nebraska, keeps telling us that he wants to take his vacation with his wife in Nebraska to find his roots...and we keep telling him that no, he just needs to see this movie and he'll know everything about our family. In fact, this year my brother, sister- in-law, sister, brother-in-law, wife and I decided to vacation together...and Nebraska as our destination lost by a vote of 5- 1 (my sister-in-law owes me big time!). California and Arizona are full of the children of immigrants from Nebraska who will totally get this movie. But I'm not sure if persons from the eastern third of the US will get this movie. Of course, persons from the middle third of the US will wonder why anyone made a movie about the middle third of the US. After seeing this film I am so glad my father and mother left the Midwest!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time i've seen Bruce Dern has been in the ninety-seventies crime thriller The Driver (1978). Although a boy, i've been perplexed about his performance, not being sure how much of it had been acting and how much his own personality. Well, i've had exactly the same feeling of awe when watching Nebraska.Otherwise, the movie was shot in black and white. Although the purpose of this remained unclear to me, it did distract me somewhat from the slow paced linear story. I mean, i understand that not much was supposed to happen but at a certain point you might get a wrong impression of the American citizens living in small towns.The ending was... well, as bleak and uneventful as the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique film with a simple plot and creative story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Father and son relationships have been shown in art for centuries. In Alexander Payne's "Nebraska" we see old and worn out Wood Grant (Bruce Dern) 'win' $1,000,000 in a false mega-marketing sweepstakes prize. He is convinced that he has won, and leaves his son David (Will Forte) no choice but to come along and collect his money in Montana. Woody's wife Kate (June Squibb) comes along as well but is very unpleased with the situation. As the adventure to Nebraska unfolds we get to see some other family members of the Grant's in rural America. The film is shot brilliantly in black-and white to portray the setting. The story is creative, has a good theme, and leaves you pleased for two hours. However, it is extremely slow. The acting is fine but nothing special, and the story is well-done. The film shouldn't bring two much to talk about, but it has an interesting purpose of parent-child relationships and how money is so important to people, as well as hope and simplicity in peoples lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can pick any actor from this and tell him/her what a great job they did. There is a reason this movie was picked and nominated for the academy award (even if you disagree with some of their choices). The main character may be stubborn (actually he just is) and he may be wrong, but you still root for him. It's not the black and white filmmaking that is the main reason for that. It's the script and the performances in it, that make you feel that way.Payne has said that you could intellectualize the use of the cinematography, but the fact of the matter is, he just wanted to shoot it that way. He thinks it looks good and he is not wrong about that (and you'll that too, unless you dislike black and white movies in general). Really good drama with a superb ending to it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tirth yatra to Lincoln, Nebraska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For quite some time, I felt that reviewing a movie isn't my cup of tea. I am not an expert on what public likes, or how many types of acting are there, cinematography or technical direction. I like what I like. But this movie made me write this. I am a huge fan of the Mega American Blockbuster in 3D, so much as to end up liking up every take on Aliens and Zombies that the multiplex has to offer. But for me that land has always been an exotic locale with ubiquitous FBI agents, citizens who know their rights, geeks ending up with jaw-dropping beauties chasing monsters, gold-hearted bad-asses, guys in costumes crawling up the skyscrapers, terrorists wanting the nuclear launch codes, American President trying to initiate talks with the Aliens as the world leaders sit by. But for once, I felt that while watching Nebraska, that it is happening in my own backyard. Of course the setup would be different. Instead of taking your father to Lincoln to collect your Million Dollar winnings, it would be taking him up for a tirth yatra to the Chaar dhaam around the country. Taking good care of your parents is a primary duty of Indian kids, and my mom won't let me forget it!! And you see, that is the beauty of being a human, you always have something to live for: a dream, an aspiration, a desire that you wish to see get fulfilled and the spirit of chasing it, always. I felt like I was in the shoes of the son all the time: of course one would feel righteous anger and a desire to steal back the old compressor from a guy who stole it from your father (however old you may be, for that matter :-p). You might see, I am jotting down my disparate thoughts, but that has always been the case whenever I review a movie. This is my own, awkward way of saying that though I cannot exactly pour my emotions in aerodynamic and fluidic phraseology, I would for once like you to watch this movie. I cannot exactly explain you why I liked the movie (I don't think it can be explained), but do watch it. Maybe I would get better with practice. But you shouldn't miss out on this movie just because I am not glib enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After Sideways and About Schmidt, Alexander Payne returns with another existential road-movie, a genre he really seems to be fond of.The first two already quite average, even mediocre, and Nebraska unfortunately is no exception to the rule, it suffers from exactly the same flaws than its predecessors : the scenario, despite tackling interesting matters such as getting old and the illness, plays it by the ear in a false rhythm favourable to boredom, never developing a strong plot. The narration is extremely laborious and little constructive, the movie resembling in fact a big catch-all made of unstructured and incoherent ideas.The characters are very superficial and sometimes caricatural not to mention that no real chemistry emerges between the actors.As for the black and white, it doesn't sublime this movie that lacks a bit of everything.Alexander Payne seems to be one of the highest regarded directors these past few years and yet his work is pretty disappointing and, above all, he doesn't seem to improve over time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meditations on the core of humanity and the importance of direction late in life, all wrapped up in a slow-moving road trip picture. Sharp, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography does a masterful job of driving home the moral gray areas of its cast, while also reinforcing the bleak, desolate landscapes of the American plains in winter. Bruce Dern is hauntingly effective as the desperate lead character, teetering on the verge of dementia while his family deals in their own ways, but it's Jane Squibb who steals the scenery. Her turn as the family's stodgy, no-nonsense, firecracker of a matron is a real standout, deliciously funny in a picture that sorely needs that kind of relief. The remainder of the cast doesn't fare so well, with several reciting their lines so flatly that they might be reading straight from cue cards. It's a depressing bit of truth, one that seems to enjoy lingering in the moment, but generally moves along smoothly enough. An uneven patch near the end of the second act is the only bit that seems to drag. Poignant and melancholy, but also rich and familiar - I'd have liked a bit more activity, but that's simply not its style.</fullReview>

It was watchable but as with most of this director's output I felt that he could have been done a lot better with more refinement of the message and more development of the relationships. Small town Nebraska is depressed, full of old and overweight people, both money and moral fibre are gone etc. That is familiar and it's over-egged with the Mount Rushmore scene. Was it really worth saying again? Nothing original in the theme then. And individual scenes are predictable, hackneyed, well observed for sure ... but nothing more. The son gets annoyed in the bar and hits his father's bullying former partner - you could see it coming. He meets his father's old flame, ditto. Overall, there is nothing very interesting in this movie, but it makes for an OK viewing, once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An accurate and exaggerated commentary of the Midwest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nebraska" focuses on an aging, alcoholic, addled, Korean war veteran named Woody Grant (Bruce Dern). He has received a letter which claims he has won a million dollars. Unbeknowst that it is a scam, he sets off to Lincoln, Nebraska to receive his money. Knowing that it is a farce, his son David (Will Forte) and his mother Kate (June Squibb) join Will on his irrational and ludicrous quest. While the plot is fairly simple and not fresh, writer Bob Nelson and director Alexander Payne give us deadpanned, yet clever dialog and larger than life characters.Bruce Dern is more or less the main showman for this movie. The opening scene is a long sequence of him slowly and clumsily walking down a highway. When a police officer pulls over to question why he is taking a stroll along the Interstate, he casually points straight ahead and says he is going to Lincoln. When offered a ride, he says, "Nope." Will is a determined character. He has a clear objective and is willing to walk hundreds of miles to get to his destination. People may argue that any actor could play someone like Will Grant. After all, he is an individual that anyone can find along the streets in a Midwestern, urban environment. He is not a complicated character. And Dern portrays him in that kind of light. As I heard in an interview he conducted for NPR broadcast, he stated that director Alexander Payne told him to just do and not act. He had to rely purely on instinct for his performance and not just the script. This is an ultimate challenge for an actor, to simply just do and not recite lines or scenes. Bruce Dern does this with perfection. He can convey so much without uttering a single word. He has very little dialog which makes his craft all the more impressive. Will Forte may seem an odd choice for playing Will Grant's son. I have always associated him with comedies and SNL. For this film, he does a fine job. He works a lot of frustration and kindness into his character. We can understand where he is coming from in trying to comprehend a man he knew all his life yet still knows nothing about. June Squibb is more or less the comic relief as the sharp-tongued Kate. Like Dern, she has a sense of being natural with her character. I was particularly amused with how she spoke with an almost spot-on Midwestern dialect. The way she phrases her lines and days things as the way they are, and often with colorful language is a true feat. The scene where she visits a grave site and lifts up her skirt, informing a gravestone of a dead, past boyfriend "what he missed" will go down in history as one of the funniest moments in cinema. I chuckled just about every time she appeared in the movie. This is not because her character is so funny, but rather how she resembles some people I know from my extended mid- western family. The rest of the cast members unfortunately do not have as much depth and border more on mid-western stereotypes. There are the two fat cousins who always drink and talk about driving. There is the old, polite female employee who works at the paper. There is the heavy-set ex- girlfriend that wants to move on with her life. There are even a collection of old-timers that hang around the local bar all night, drink Coors, and talk about nothing. The one archetype that really set home for me is a scene where the Grant family gets together to have a dinner. One moment shows all the ladies in the kitchen preparing the food and gabbing up a storm. Meanwhile, all the men sit in front of the TV, beers in hand, not saying a single word. This was so true growing up for me!As described above, the social commentary that the writer and director gives us is both an accurate and exaggerated take of the Midwest. The fact that none of the characters are good- looking, absent of make up, and wearing poorly fashioned clothes makes a somewhat true yet surrealistic experience. The black-and-white cinematography adds to this atmosphere that the director achieves. Being a little biased, the digital cameras that were used do not hold up to 35mm film, which I think would have a bit more beneficial for this movie's intended mood. The black tones are a little off and some of the day scenes are overexposed. The score by Mark Orton is seldom and holds faithful to a feeling of poor boredom, which plagues much of the Midwestern states. To say in the least, "Nebraska" is a good film. But for a dramedy, it lacks excitement. While I enjoy slow paced movies, this one felt too slow. A lot more could have happened in the movie story-wise but it does not. This may very well have been the writer's and director's intent, but it after awhile it becomes almost too dull to watch. The 105-minutes feels like 150-minutes. I understand all the hype this movie has received, but I frankly do not think it deserved as much as praise as it got.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally Loaded But Mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska possesses an elegant but whimsical score that adds something extra to a borderline lackluster cast and series of performances.The only recompense for nearly two hours worth of mediocre acting skill (at best) is a moderately touching resolution. I cannot fully recognize why this film was so critically acclaimed, except for the fact that a number of shots are visually breathtaking, and the filmmaker's use of black &amp; white amplifies the starkness of the film's Nebraska setting. Maybe the director wanted his actors to give mediocre performances, to highlight the cultural mediocrity of this stretch of America. Not quite sure. Best scenes are when Will Forte punches the gentleman in the bar, and when he lets his father drive the truck for a small stretch of road, crouching down in the passenger seat and looking on in admiration and love.I've never made a film in my life, so it is easy to be critical. I am sure a ton of work and money were put into this movie, and someone important must have liked it because of all its nominations. I just don't connect with it fully on a personal level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes Nebraska good is the surprisingly intimate look it has on relationships, and family bonds in general. The movie really isn't about this old man looking for 1 million dollars at all. It's about rebuilding or in this case building a relationship between family members that have otherwise never existed.The major standouts are Bruce Dern and June Squibb. The ladder has some good comedic moments and I found every scene with her was golden. Bruce Dern was also great as an old drunk who is very honest, generous (or was), and frankly never cared much for his sons and never gave them the attention they deserved. What comes out of it is a good father-son movie. It's one of those situations where you know someone close to you is wrong but you stick by them anyway because well, their family! Bob Odenkirk and Will Forte were great as the sons that are both fed up and concerned for their aging father who is just about on his last leg.There were only a few scenes that I thought were bland and useless. Those being the big family scenes at the Aunt's house. The two cousins were very annoying and I don't think just watching all these old people watch football on T.V was a good use of screen time. Lets face it, everyone knows where this story is going from the opening minute but it doesn't take away from how unique and good Alexander Payne is. At least this time he has a clear cut ending and not leaving it up to us to decide.7.3/10</fullReview>

And the more I hear "it's called STYLE, Steve!" the more I hear someone too pretentious to listen to anymore.But, there you go: Nebraska, which I think would've been a gorgeously shot film otherwise, was in black &amp; white. Oh, and by the way, I got over it right away. Despite being disappointed in not seeing the lush backdrops of the states our "heroes" occupy in color, I concurred that it was what it was.Every year I attempt to watch all the Best Picture nominees and have been successful for the past decade or more. This year, I had about four left on my list and I barely made it through before show time, or the Oscars telecast. This was not only wasn't high on my list of must-see films, but it was dead last in the nine nominee list.Which is sad. I really did like this movie a lot. It was humorous, original ? a quality I seek and most of the other nominees sorely lacked, adventurous at a different level than most "adventures," deep and fun. I loved the characters, the interactions, the tension and the backgrounds of the leads. Also, it all felt a little too real ? um, except for the whole black &amp; white deal.Woody won! Or so that's part of the premise. Aging alcoholic Woody takes off, sometimes on foot, to claim his prize he feels he won from an ad in the mail. His son reluctantly ? to put it mildly ? agrees to aid his pop's journey across a couple of states to get rich somewhat quick.The journey of these two might seem subdued, but the leads keep it lively, especially Will Forte's turn as the son. Definitely recommended.* * * Final thoughts: I can forgive Schindler's List for the reasons they chose and Psycho for the reasons they had to, but if it were up to me, if color did exist and the company could afford to shoot in color, I would always prefer that method.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's follow-up to his 2011 film "The Descendants," "Nebraska," a resonant meditation on family and growth, again utilizes Payne's signature knack for getting the most out of realism and simplicity."Nebraska" centers on Woody Grant (Bruce Dern, in a career performance), an ancient, alcoholic Korean War vet stubbornly determined to walk to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim one of those phony million-dollar magazine sweepstakes prize. His adult son, David (a surprisingly believable Will Forte), reluctantly allows him to temporarily live out his delusional fantasy by driving him there. Is Woody suffering from a degenerative mental disease? Is he implausibly gullible? Or is he just stupid? Smartly, Payne never attempts to answer these questions, instead focusing on how Woody's delusion affects the complex relationship between father and son.Along the way, they take an extended break in Woody's old hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, where Woody reconnects with old acquaintances and bars, gradually becoming something of a celebrity due to his newfound millionaire status. The film goes out of its way make Hawthorne feel like a decrepit nursing home. The town hums with depression and gives the film a molasses-like viscosity (think "Napoleon Dynamite," I daresay) that takes up the bulk of the movie. This eventually becomes overpowering, however, drawing the film into an irritating and disappointing lull that tends to distract it from its higher themes. Nebraska's restraint is admirable but often misguided, turning some the film's relatively empty parts into little more than a slapstick sitcom.There are, however, some deeply resonating moments. At times, Woody seems resigned to his fantasy, aware of his delusion but unsure of how to stop himself (one scene in particular stands out in the mind). These scenes are pathetic and vulnerable, executed to perfection by Payne and Dern, the caliber of which does not, unfortunately, appear quite enough throughout the film."Nebraska" comes off as more comedy than drama (a converse of The Descendants), and much of this can be attributed to June Squibb, who portrays Kate, Woody's eccentric wife. Kate appears to be in the film primarily for the purpose of a kind of brazen comic relief that contrasts with Woody's foolishness. Plenty of critics have lauded Squibb's performance, calling her a scene-stealer. Squibb, though, is consistently overacting in Nebraska, and her character's comedic, irreverent outbursts quickly become tiresome. Visually, the film is sparse and austere. It is photographed beautifully in black-and-white by Phedon Papamichael to reflect the story's somber, geriatric drawl. However, too often this style acts as nothing more than an uncomfortable gimmick, forced and occasionally out of place (for example, the interior of a modern electronics store does not take kindly to a grayscale treatment). Payne, a Nebraskan who has set most of his films in his home state, seems to both glorify and mock his fellow Midwesterners. He diffuses the stereotype that his corridor of the country yields only hard-working, honest folk by exhibiting the sluggish and morally indecent underside of Middle America (for example, David's pernicious and scheming cousins, Woody's pernicious and scheming old acquaintance, the pernicious and scheming sweepstakes prize company). Nonetheless, there is an elusive but ever-present air of sentimentality, as if Payne himself is Forte's character, leading his father, representative of the region, through a soul-searching journey. "Nebraska" is at the same time a delicate tribute and a Horatian satire. The final act "Nebraska" is by far the best part of the film, where the deep and moving themes truly come into play, although "Nebraska" undoubtedly falters in comparison to "The Descendants," which is a superior film from both a thematic and an entertainment standpoint. Still, "Nebraska" is a resonant and solid film, simple and satisfying, a worthy addition to Payne's impressive filmography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since we'd just sent back the disk of the Coen brothers' "Inside Llewyn Davis," I wasn't sure we were ready for another bleak, wintry, critically acclaimed auteurist statement from Netflix. No problem! Bruce Dern deserves all the praise he's gotten for his performance as Woody, the scruffy old coot who goes walkabout in search of his sweepstakes winnings. June Squibb, as the trash-talking Kate, doesn't seem to belong in the same movie (to say nothing of the same marriage) at first, but something's clearly needed to balance out all the tight-lipped, blandly affable Nebraskans they encounter on the road; the scene where she "pays her respects" at the family plot, played repeatedly during Oscar season, really is pretty great. Will Forte does a fine job as Woody's estranged son David; the subtle way the plot line as it develops enables him, in the midst of all this emotional distancing and taciturnity, to piece together the story of his father's chaotic life, with the help of a few offhand remarks and words shouted in anger, is really brilliant, poignant without being sentimental. The rest of the cast is just about perfect?I'll single out Tim Driscoll and Devin Ratray as the disdainful doofus cousins?and Alexander Payne's affection for the weathered farmhouses and one-stoplight towns of his native state shows through in every frame. The storyline's quite entertaining in a low-key, Midwestern way; comparisons to the 40s small-town comedies of Sturges and Capra (not to mention "The Last Picture Show") are not out of order. Glad AP was willing to fight for the delicate grayscale cinematography; it really adds a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nebraska" reminds me of two movies. One is a remote and gloomy association: some of the shots of the desolate fictitious Midwest town Hawthorne conjure up images of the last few shots of "On the beach" (1959) ? ghost towns in Australia after the last of post-nuclear-holocaust human beings were wiped out. The other, with a lot more similarities is David Lynch's "The Straight Story" (1999) for which Richard Farnsworth, like Bruce Dern, also got an Oscar nomination by playing an eccentric old man embarking on an Odyssey-like road trip. Farnsworth's character was driving a tractor on this journey to fulfill probably his last wish of mending relationship with an ailing brother. In Dern's case, his character Woody Grant is driven by a caring second son David (Will Forte) from Billings to Lincoln to claim purportedly a million dollars of prize money which is in fact nothing more than an advertising gimmick. He is also trying to fulfill a dream, to replace his old truck (even when he doesn't drive any more). A million dollars would do it, with change. But what he really wants is just a truck.Unlike in "The Straight Story", the movie on Woody's journey ends up playing out mostly in the aforementioned town Hawthorne en-route. Here at his hometown (which he hasn't visited for years) he and David spend a weekend with his brother (that he hasn't seen for years) as nothing is open until Monday in Lincoln where he is going to claim the sweepstake. This evolves into a big family reunion when various brothers (except for those who are dead, and will not come, as his son wittily quips). His wife Kate (June Squibb) and elder son Ross (Bob Oden Kirk) also travel from Billings to join them, by bus and driving, respectively.The two most absorbing sequences in this movie are father-and-younger-son touring various part of Hawthorne and the entire family of four visiting the long abandoned homestead where Woody grew up. David's intention of indulging in his sometimes-dementia-afflicted father's fantasy is to get him away on a short trip where he can still dream and enjoy life a little. Through meeting with various people that had generally last saw him as a cute little boy, David discovers things about Woody that he never knew e.g. how the effect of serving in Korean War has turned his father into a taciturn and somewhat grumpy person.In this nostalgic environment, memories in both father and son are rekindled, a lot of them pleasant and heartwarming. The unpleasant ones, on the other hand, feed some funny gags for the audience's pleasure. When David asks why Woody and Kate had Ross and him, his father's reply: "I loved screwing and she was Catholic". When challenged by David for being an alcoholic, Woody quipped "You would drink too if married to your mother".Neither Farnsworth nor Dern won an Oscar, although they both deserved to, or at least are as deserving as their competitors. Squibb playing a down-to-earth woman who has no reservation whatsoever in speaking her mind also deserves to win in the Best Support category, for which she is nominated. Forte is most endearing, especially in the last few scenes. Kirk as the sensible older brother does not have a big role but provides solid support. Other supports, essentially friends and folks in Hawthorne, including both species of likable and despicable, serve splendidly. I understand that some are played by real inhabitants of Nebraska who are not professional actors."Nebraska" is a little bit like Hemmingway's prose, at once lean and rich. It is filmed in delightful black and white.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The story of Woody Grant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is essentially a movie about Woody Grant (Bruce Dern).We meet him as he is shambling down the road in Montana, labouring with the delusion that he has to pick up the million dollars he's won from a publishing clearing house. We come to meet his wife, his sons, his brothers and extended family, his old friends and neighbours. We see the Nebraska town where he grew up and we visit his ruined childhood home and the graves of his parents. We learn pretty well his entire life story, including a few surprising facts.This personal history unfolds slowly, and in black and white, over the course of the film. Very little of this comes from Woody himself, because Woody is taciturn, gruff and rather addled. The driving force behind this exploration is the desire of his son David (Will Forte) to help his difficult father. The main plot twist is that everyone in Woody's home town seems to buy into Woody's delusion, and start treating him like a lottery winner.I know this description doesn't make this film sound that interesting ? but somehow the film works quite well. It's got the right amalgam of strong local feel, character development, intelligent writing, competent acting, understatement and humour. Primarily however this movie is about the sometimes painful reality of family relationships.There are a few real gems in the movie: June Squibb's portrayal of Kate, the astonishing revelations of Peg (Angela McEwan), the brothers watching the hockey game.Eventually David comes to better understand Woody to the point where he is able to help his elderly, confused father achieve, in a small way, some closure with regard to his childhood and youth in Nebraska. This movie doesn't have much of a message, except perhaps this: take the time to know more about your parents before they're gone. It won't be easy, but it'll be worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bruce Derns Best Performance Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A relatively simple tale of a man who is way past his prime. A man who wished he had accomplished something in his life. A man who wished he had something to pass on to his family when he was gone. It was about more then passing along a fortune. The movie was about passing along his character, his history, his life's story, his emotions and many more things. In his travels with his reluctant son back to the town in which he was raised, met his wife, married and left...he shares so much of himself...more than his son has ever known about him before. In the end, with his hopes dashed, after being humiliated by all of the people in the town who wanted to see him as a failure, his son comes through for him. His son provides him with the pride and glory befitting an old man and in front of the old townspeople. The black and white motif simply emphasizes the drab dull character of the life of the man played by Bruce Dern. This was an Academy Award winning movie for Dern. The film itself deserved a best picture award, however the sympathetic vote went to a tale of slavery, degradation, escape, freedom and the horrors of slavery in our country. A fitting topic but well over worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old man goes to Nebraska with his son to get "his" money.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has many different facets, but it is extremely slow moving (like the characters).The movie starts with an elderly gentleman, Woody Grant, walking down the road, trying to get to Nebraska, where he thinks he will collect a sweepstakes of a million dollars. After Woody continues to runaway, (to walk to Nebraska), his son finally agrees to drive him there.Throughout their journey, you start to see why Woody may be the way he is.... a stubborn, worthless, alcoholic. His wife Kate is constantly berating him, yelling she should put him in a home (who wouldn't drink after constantly being yelled at!). Woody also tells his son that they never wanted children, he just liked to have sex (ornery old goat!).On the way to Nebraska, they make several stops. In a bar, they meet Woody's old business partner, Mr. Pegram. When he finds out Woody won a million dollars, he announces it to everyone, and asks Woody to stand up and take a bough. After Kate nudges him out of his chair, Woody looks around at everyone clapping, and gets an ever so slight grin on his face, and feels a little proud.After a few mishaps, Woody's son David, tells him that it is all a hoax, and they should go home. That he just doesn't understand why winning a million dollars is so important....that they have enough money to get by. His response surprises David. I won't go into details, but David finally realizes what his Dad needs, and works on getting it.As far as a story goes, it is well written. I just wish it wouldn't have taken so darn long to get through it! I also don't understand why Bruce Dern was nominated for an award. I have seen him in many movies and have always enjoyed his work, but this was just an elderly man, playing the role of an elderly man. Nothing more (in my opinion).</fullReview>

Unlike Payne's earlier movie About Schmidt (a movie also with an old lead character), this movie was not boring but was filled with comical kicks and Payne never hit a false note in the screenplay. I still hated the fact that the movie was colored back and white as it carried some wonderful sceneries at the countryside of America. The actress June Squibb was cool too right from her first shot in the movie. It was such a treat to listen to the somewhat 'dysfunctional' family conversations between the dad, mom and the son (played by Forte). The score was minimal and sentiments were apt. The movie carries profane phrases and so not for children.The movie is very slow-w-w-w and in b&amp;w, still journey to Nebraska is not to be missed.</fullReview>

This Black and White Filming is kind of Pretentious and was Hardly Needed because the Character's, Highlighted by Bruce Dern's Effortless Portrayal as Woody, are not much more than Beyond Black and White.What with Their Stifled World View from Small Town Bubbles, None of Them Grow Outside the Box of Farmland Grids and Street Corner Watering Holes. These Folks are Virtually Wordless, or Idealess, albeit Somewhat Wholesome in a Family Values Kind of Way.But that Tight Knit Kinship can Unravel Easily, Especially if there is a Pot of Gold to Divy Up and Estrangement has Strained the Family Unit. This all makes for a bit of Confrontation but also Allows some Father-Son Bonding and Late Life Revelations. It is all done with Sombre Sobriety, Dark Wit, and a Scathing Steal the Show Smut Mouth Mom Played by June Squibb.Overall it is Certainly Worth a Watch if Nothing Earth Shattering in its Uncovering of Human Foibles, Family Secrets, or Conditions in America's Withering Countryside that Seems to Stem from Peoples Deadly Sins.

		<shortDescription>Funny, sharp &amp; beautiful road trip that is mellower than The Straight Story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's (Sideways, About Schmidt) latest offering as director takes him back home. Nebraska is a bittersweet journey of loss and discovery, of families and the tragedy of emotional distance. Less accessible for the masses than his previous film, The Descendants, Nebraska is a wonderful, meandering road movie that is darkly witty and closer to home than many viewers will realize; at least until their own parents reach their twilight years.Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is an aging father with a wayward mind, a pickled liver and a wife, Kate (June Squibb), who looks as though something large and unpleasant broke wind on her face. When Woody receives a piece of junk mail informing him he has won $1,000,000 he repeatedly runs (okay, staggers) away from home in order to claim his winnings and is picked up and returned home variously by the cops and his frustrated son, David (Will Forte). When Woody makes it clear he is both unable and unwilling to see the truth of this mailshot con, David relents and sets off with Woody on a road trip, from Montana to Nebraska, of truth, discovery, friendship and greed.Nebraska is a monochrome trip to the end of a rainbow to find a pot completely devoid of gold. Payne's decision to shoot in black and white is not particularly brave (surely we've evolved beyond for colour to guarantee enjoyment) but is perfectly calculated for his film. Forget the glossy sheen of The Artist, this is the dusty monochrome of westerns from years gone by but it is never dull, with colour pouring onto the screen through the characters and their language. Bob Nelson has written a beautifully real screenplay of sharp barbs, humorous asides and mumbled truths that sting and amuse because they could come from our own relatives, or at least the embarrassing relations of good friends.There are obvious comparisons with The Straight Story, another wonderful road movie with a central performance from a septuagenarian that remained on the periphery for many but hit straight at the heart for those who sought it out, though Nebraska is slower, gentler and mellower than its predecessor. The former was a heartening story about a man seeking to make amends in his own stubborn way while the world around him magically fell into place to aid him, but it was a film we enjoyed about a journey we only observed from a distance. Nebraska is less sweet at the outset but ultimately more involving, because the subject of family estrangement is closer to our own experiences. Payne gives us a son who doesn't understand his father, and a father bemused by his son. With a sharp-tongued wife/mother and cousins most of us would cross a continent to avoid, the repertory of family members is complete and there is someone for everyone to identify with.Nebraska is funny, dark, and rustically beautiful with long, lazy shots, exquisite cinematography and a fantastic soundtrack that carries us along miles of open road and accompanies us as we visit awkward, frosty family gatherings. Nominated for six Oscars, I suspect it will depart the Dolby Theatre empty handed, but every Nebraska nominee belongs in the race and just maybe, hopefully, I'll be wrong.Another film review from The Squiss.

		<shortDescription>Typical Alexander Payne film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska is a typical Alexander Payne film. If you have seen some of his previous work (Sideways, About Schmidt, The Descendants) and you've seen the trailer you should have a pretty good idea what to expect. An old guy (Bruce Dern) got a letter saying he won 1m$ so he and his son go on a road trip to 'collect' the money from this fake ad letter. Along the way they meet/visit old acquaintances and the son gets to know a bit more about his dad past and grows closer to old guy. This is a tried and true independent formula film which you might have seen a couple of times before at least. There's good acting and beautiful stretched out black and white landscapes combined with sad violin music but for me this doesn't qualify as Oscar material. The film is very slow and there's not much happening (it's all intentional I know) and it's full of old people. This wasn't a film I had to see personally but I'm sure it has an audience who loves this kind of stuff.</fullReview>

Unemployment, economic devastation, scratching to survive really hit home in this movie. They specifically show up in cards when all the "want to be millionaires" come out of the woodwork in Hawthorne NB to cajole, intimidate, congratulate, and yes strong arm Woody Grant to get a piece of his million dollar windfall. The acting in this movie is superior and the script superb. This movie also contains insightful and poignant family type revelations that are well worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With glorious soft-focus black and white cinematography by DP Phedon Papamihael and a beautiful string-based score composed by Mark Orton, this whimsical dramedy is a delightful viewing, in spite of being a tad on the slow side. Concerned more about exploring the unspoken intricacies of a father-son relationship than sharpening up it's quirky plot ? middle-aged man David (Will Forte) takes his elderly dad Woody (Bruce Dern) on a road trip so he can collect a million dollar prize that doesn't exist ? Bob Nelson's script is subtle, witty and utterly affecting. Directing from someone else's screenplay for the very first time, renowned filmmaker Alexander Payne (The Descendants, Sideways) still brings his trademark poignancy to the proceedings, most notably in the way he captures the lifestyle of central U.S.A. in all it's uncomplicated and unhurried splendour. Payne also casts his film with perfection, from the top billed stars to the non-professionals filling supporting roles. With his wispy hair and detached gaze, Bruce Dern's mentally declining Woody is simultaneously hilarious and heart breaking, earning the 77-year-old thespian his first Academy Award nomination since 1979. SNL alumna Will Forte is solid in a rare serious role as the unambitious David, whilst June Squibb is an absolute riot as Woody's fed up, straight-talking wife Kate, who delivers some of the movie's most memorable lines. Simple, sweet and gorgeous to look at, Nebraska is right at the top of Payne's already revered body of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, Dull, and Dull with Irony Galore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Nebraska" isn't the best movie that "Sideways" director Alexander Payne has helmed. This black &amp; white road trip about a father and a son and their misadventures on the highway as they leave Montana and drive to Lincoln, Nebraska, so the elderly father can claim his million dollar payday is painfully slow. Bruce Dern plays the father and "Saturday Night Live" comedian Will Forte is cast as his son. The son assures the father than he hasn't won a dime, but the father stubbornly clings to the illusion that a pot of gold awaits him at the end of the rainbow. This odyssey of self-discovery and the characters who turn up in it are good for scattered laughs, but everything is so muted and downbeat that the humor works only occasionally. Woody (Bruce Dern of "The Cowboys") is a man of few words, while his wife is an obnoxious harridan who doesn't have a good word in her body for anybody. She gets a laugh when her husband and son visit the family graveyard, and she gets to tell off a dead man. Davey (Will Forte of "MacGruber") agrees to take his father on this road trip because he simply wants to get out of town. They encounter many of Woody's old friends, and most of these fellows believe--like Woody--that he has won a fortune. One of these old business partners is Ed (Stacy Keach of "Mike Hammer") who wants to call in some markers that Woody owed him. Eventually, almost two hours later, our protagonists wheel into the parking lot of the business that sent Woody a sweepstakes notice that he has won the money. The lady informs them that they didn't have a winning number so they turn around and head home, but not before the lady gives Woody a baseball cap with the words Prize Winner on the hat. The strategy is obvious here. If you underplay the obvious humor, people will laugh themselves silly and "Nebraska" has its share of amusing moments, but the humor is so dry as to be non-existent. The performances are good and Payne and his scenarist try to milk it for every laugh that they can get. Watch paint dry would be more fun that watching this irony-riddled epic his visually unassuming in every respect. Ultimately, the father and the son reach a point to where the son allows his father to indulge himself. Nevertheless, "Nebraska" isn't a laugh riot, much less a rib-tickler.</fullReview>

It's a film that's about many things ? parents with their grown kids, ageing, small towns, jealousies, greed,and money. These themes never detract or topple over each other ? it's more of a blend. The film doesn't gets carried away with itself. It's never over-acted, no big heart-rending scenes. And that is its strength. The pacing is slow and the delivery perfect.

		<fullReview>Woody (Bruce Dern) receives a letter from the PowerBall Lottery telling him he has won $1-million and he wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his winnings. His son David (Will Forte) tries to tell him this is not true. Woody doesn't believe David and makes every effort to walk to Nebraska from Billings Montana.When is the last time you watched a movie in Black and White? I fear you are going back to the 1960s and that is wrong. No, do you remember THE ARTIST (2011) with what's- his- name? and that everyone went Ga Ga over the movie and this actor I cannot recall his name? Ga Ga indeed! Not a fun movie as the promos promised. This movie is in Black and White all the way through. It was okay, but we missed seeing many great landscapes of Montana with that Big Sky looming everywhere. The B/W effect served it's purpose showing the starkness, hopelessness of Woody and his family, other relatives and life in general in that part of the USA. Many friends and relatives believed Woody has a touch of Alzheimer's, but David explains that is not the case, but that Woody has a tendency to believe everyone. But, he doesn't believe David, he believes in the letter. It is very sad watching Woody with David who is trying to be accommodating, and ends up being a Care-Provider as David decides to make the trip to Lincoln, Nebraska with Woody to get all this out of his system. This is slow-going, but the dialogues are very sharp and are quite funny at times. Example: David asks Woody why he drinks so much and why did he marry his wife Kate (June Squibb) who does nothing but complain about everything. Woody says, "You'd drink too if you were married to your mother." There are a lot of good lines in here and you have to be patient and listen carefully. On the trip, David learns more about his family than he ever thought possible. He learns these things from relatives and some of Woody's friends that he meets in Hawthorne, Nebraska where they stopped off and where Woody used to live. David meets Woody's old girlfriend who still has eyes for Woody as she remembers how it used to be with her and Woody. While in Hawthorne, Woody is now the Hero of the Moment as all the relatives and friends learn that he will receive the $1-million prize. They all line up for their share as they give a sad story why they feel money is due to them. David is cringing all the time not knowing how to get out of this. The only true animated character in here is Kate, Woody's wife who for some reason not explained took a bus ride to Hawthorne. She complains about everything and becomes quite earthy when they all visit a graveyard in Hawthorne. Her comments about some of the dead relatives and friends are somewhat shocking. David is aghast. In some ways, watching Bruce Dern's Woody I got the feeling I was watching a different kind of version of WEEKEND AT BERNIES. Yes, it is very sad watching someone up in age who does things that are can be construed as comical at times. We feel for David who is helping and making sure Woody doesn't fall down as he goes along. If you laugh too much, all I can say is that, in time, you will get there too so be more understanding. And, you might learn something if you sat down and talked with elderly family members.Ah, there is a twist near the end. You probably think, as I did, that Woody will have the last laugh and produce the winning lottery TICKET. Well, you would be as wrong as I was. There is another twist. A good oneThis is a slow movie, but quite rewarding if you give it a chance. (7/10)Violence: Not really. There is a so-so mugging. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Sex talk: Yes, at times by Kate. Language: One F-bomb by Kate. And, some soft stuff in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nebraska is the story of a persistent and stubborn man named Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) and his journey from Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska in order to claim a bogus million dollars sweepstakes prize. Woody will get there by any means necessary, even if he has to walk 900 miles on foot to get there. In order to stop him from hurting himself and getting him to calm down, his contemptible loser of a son David decides to drive him there, not because of the money, but because perhaps he can spend some quality time with his absent minded father. There's a lot to like about Nebraska including the acting, atmosphere, cinematography and bundle of noteworthy characters. It's a troublesome tale about greed, mistakes, forgotten acquaintances and father-son bonding and it's here to stay as one of the most notable films of 2013.Bruce Dern without a doubt catches your eye as Woody; he truly has made this performance his own in mannerisms, speech, and Woody's thought process. Right from the opening scene we get the hint that Woody will be a handful in this film as a police officer stops him on the open freeway trying to walk to Nebraska. From the way he walks, talks, eats and blinks Bruce has made Woody his own creation and is a joy to watch on the screen and is no doubt a strong candidate for best actor. Other strong performances grace the screen including Will Forte as David, and June Squibb as the sassy and sometimes overbearing (but loving) motherly figure Kate. Every character is part of a strong circle that is hard to break and is one of the reasons why Nebraska is so good. There are past acquaintances Woody meets up with on the road and he still has his enemies. Once the word is out that he's hit the jackpot almost everyone wants a piece of it; especially Ed Pegram (Stacey Keach), who tries to fork ten grand out of poor Woody. Things get ruthless and even close family members want some of the winnings. During the journey, secrets are spilled and facts are told but the main issue comes from David trying to connect with his father on this trip, who has seemingly (if accidentally) shoved his family to the back of his mind. David sets off with his father because he believes some good will come out of the trip. And it does. Even if Woody's expectations are too high, and things don't fall into place, the best things can come out of it, which is what Alexander Payne wants us to think about life in general. Even though Woody doesn't win a million dollars, he earns a consolation prize for his trouble; love and respect from his son and a brand new pickup truck, which is something he's always wanted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet and artistic and a film that subtly grows on you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had some lofty expectations going into Nebraska. I have seen so many good films as of late (some of them Oscar contenders) that were so poignant and dealt with life and love and growing older and I thought Nebraska just looked like it very well could be brilliant. I kept putting off seeing it so my expectations grew and grew. I admit the first half hour of the film I was worried that my expectations were simply dashed. I thought it was slow and dawdling and the characters really seemed unlikable and sort of a bunch of jerks. Then the story begins to immerse you into these people's lives and you begin to see where they came from, how people interact and you begin to understand why this film IS and where its coming from. For most of the movie I kept asking myself...why is this black and white? Why is Payne using this gimmick and does it really mean anything? Now that the credits have rolled...I get it. At least I get it for what it means to me. I do believe you could discuss this film for hours (a trait I love in a smart movie) and to me the black and white represents not only this elderly man's view of his current world but it also strips away the distractions to show human condition. I honestly can't tell you how much my opinion changed from the beginning of this movie to the final scenes which are heart wrenching, beautiful, emotional and just damn sweet.Bruce Dern is our title character Woody. A man in the twilight of his life and he is just plain tired. We don't really know why and we don't know a lot about him before this but he is a sad, tired, desperate man who latches onto his one point of redemption to leave behind a legacy...a million dollar sweepstakes prize. Dern is terrific, truly outstanding and worthy of his nomination (though not quite good enough to beat some of his fellow contenders I would dare say.) Will Forte I liked the least (in the first half hour.) I thought he seemed boring and monotone and I felt like he was repeating the same lines over and over again. And then I slowly began to understand his character too. He was tired...he seemed to be the main caretaker to his ageing mother and father, struggling in mid-life having just lost his girlfriend and questioning his future and the latter years of his life as mirrored in his Dad. The connection that becomes the backbone of this film between Forte and Dern is mesmerizing. This is a father son relationship that upon further inspection is deeply presented. June Squibb who is also Oscar nominated is good in her role but honestly I felt like she paled compared to most of the other cast. She's funny, quirky, irritating but honestly she didn't really seem to have the depth or time to really impress me. I thought she was just good and not great. The supporting cast were really terrific with especially good performances from Bob Odenkirk and Stacy Keach (a brilliant turn as a bully and sleazy human being.) I don't mean to downplay the quirky, fun and eccentric smaller characters all of whom serve to make this a terrific, fun and moving film.Alexander Payne has now impressed me twice. The Descendants came out of nowhere for me and really touched me in a lot of the same ways Nebraska did. This is an often sad, bleak movie with so many undertones and I think you could likely watch it three or four times and get more and more out of it or maybe something different. I hate to agree with the professional critics so much this year but many of the Oscar nominees truly are amazing and this is one of them. I don't necessarily think its best picture material but this is a deep film that deserves recognition. 2013 ended up being a much better year for films than I initially thought and when you hear so much about how there is no originality in Hollywood you have films like this or "Her" (see my review), or Philomena, All Is Lost, Dallas Buyers Club...these are movies that touch you and play with your emotions and showcase brilliant performances either subtly or in your face. I completely understand the mainstream crowd finding Nebraska boring because there isn't a lot here for your standard movie going crowd but for someone in the right mood and looking for an introspective film about life and ageing and family...this one will certainly be remembered fondly. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I'm not trusting the mail with a million dollars." Woody Grant (Dern) is an older man who has just received the best news of his life. One day in the mail he receives a letter that notifies him that he has won a million dollars. All he has to do is go to Lincoln, Nebraska and claim his prize. When he tells his son David (Forte) about this idea David tries to reason with him. When all else fails the two set out of a road trip to claim his prize. I wasn't really sure what to expect from this. After watching it I have to admit the movie is also kind of hard to describe. While it's not exciting or fast moving it really isn't slow either. The movie is not depressing but it also isn't a happy movie. You know from the beginning what is going to happen when Woody reaches his destination but the longer the movie goes on the more you hope you are wrong. This really shows how people act when the possibility of those they know become rich. That isn't always a good thing. There are some funny parts in this but I would not consider this a comedy. Alexander Payne's movies (About Schmidt, Decendents) have a certain feel so if you have seen his other ones then you know what to expect. This is a good movie with great acting but Woody's wife played by June Squib is great in this and she really stands out. Overall, a very good, bittersweet movie that's worth seeing and June Squibb is my pick for Best Actress at the Oscars this year. I give this a B+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks previous Payne brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm being a bit harsh here, but I felt Nebraska was a good film but not on the scale of most of what I saw in Sideways and my absolute Alexander Payne film, The Descendents. Starring Bruce Dern, as the lost and confused Woddy Grant, an old father of two, Nebraska presents us with a story that resembles the close family roots and complicated relationships that Payne's films are known for. I would say the most important and overall the main relationship in the movie is that of Woody and his younger son, David (Will Forte). When everything comes to fruition, Woody and David their bond and learn more from each other than they thought possible. At the end of the day, Nebraska is yet another interesting take on people and their human behavior with others, something I enjoy Alexander Payne bring to the screen. However this film failed to truly amaze me like previous efforts from this director. The beautiful and unique cinematography combined with some good performances make this an enjoyable film to watch, just not something that matched my expectations.Rating 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle story of hope, greed, friendship and disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should strike a chord with anyone whose parents are over 80. It shows how stubborn old people can be, and how little respect they sometimes have for reasonable arguments. They've seen it all, they've lived their lives and they don't want to be told how to do things. In the case of Woody Grant, this attitude has far reaching consequences. He is convinced that he has won a million dollars and is determined to travel from Montana to Nebraska to collect his money. Even if that means doing the whole trip on foot. Everyone but Woody sees that the prize is fake. The letter is from a commercial sweepstakes company and contains lots of fine print. Woody's son David agrees to drive his grumpy old father to Lincoln, so he can see for himself he hasn't won. On their way there, they pass through Woody's old hometown. The news of the 'millionaire's' arrival spreads rapidly. David can only barely prevent the local newspaper from writing a story about his father. During their stay, lots of old disagreements between family members and friends resurface. At the same time, people start rubbing shoulders with the new 'millionaire'. Director Alexander Payne tells this story of hope, greed, friendship and disappointment in a very subtle way. You can see that David can only barely prevent himself from cursing when his father has pulled another stunt, like losing his teeth, drinking too much or telling strangers about his imagined fortune. At the same time, the film has some scenes that are in an almost surrealistic way very funny. I liked the scene with a group of middle-aged men watching a television show in silence, until Woody out of the blue asks no-one in particular: 'Do you still drive that Chevy?' Also hilarious is the scene where Woody's foul- mouthed wife Kate lifts her skirt to the tombstone of a former lover, to show the deceased 'what he could have had'. The strength of the film are the characters: the stubborn, straightforward people of the Mid- West. Payne focuses on his characters and their feelings for each other, as he did in most of his other films. The wide open landscapes of this road-movie are also an important ingredient, as is the black &amp; white cinematography.The end of the film is by far the best part. There's a wonderful nice little twist. In many ways, this is a tragic story, but the final scenes make it a feel-good movie that make you leave the cinema with a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels like Little Miss Sunshine...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...was all I could think while watching the entire film: Family bound on the road to discover themselves through one ultimate failure of purpose everyone recognizes (Olive won't be any good in the pageant, Woody won't actually win a million dollars), quirky struggles and humility along the voyage, and ultimately coming to terms with their permanence in life and contentedness with returning to their lives by going out in a fashion of self-confident impudence at the end (Olive being an abrasive, non- conformist with her dance, and Woody driving a 'new' truck down main- street). Not necessarily obvious connections, but an LMSS comparison isn't always a positive...in that the way both films reach their delivery is lackluster and laborious for viewers. For Nebraska, Woody's character was much too predictable and the only real accomplishment we get of his development was his son David becoming content with his father's life. Ross' character contributes basically nothing to the film, except to help enforce the sorrow of David and Woody's lives as not being as successful, to thus bolster the connection of their relationship they've since developed. The only real highlight performance of film comes from June Squibb's character as the jaded and idiosyncratic wife of Woody, Kate. Kate's character is eagerly at the helm of life to either criticize, remorse, or display near every emotion throughout two hours of film as an exasperated elderly woman from the MidWest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only one weakness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can't go too far wrong if your backdrop is the Dakotas and Nebraska. Just a video of the scenery will leave your heart longing to be there. To be taken back to a simpler time where people are real, iphones are new fangled gadgets and to a place where there's actually community roots. The film takes full advantage of these qualities to milk your emotions and it does a great job.It also does a fabulous job in displaying the taciturn nature of prairie farmers and townsfolk in that area and the casting is just superb. The family scenes are so real you'd swear they'd just used the locals and let them carry on their business as usual. "Don't worry about these movie stars , they'll only be here for a day or two" The only real fly in the ointment for me was that Will Forte's performance seemed flat. He didn't imbue the character with the range of emotions you might expect in a storyline like this and I thought his delivery was "rote-like". Maybe he was just over-awed by Bruce Dern or maybe he was miscast but he just didn't pull it off enough to cement the relationship and make the movie the real cracker it could have been.(it always surprises me that they don't ask me for advice on casting.) Nevertheless it was a great couple of hours entertainment, Dern was utterly convincing in a bravura performance and June Squibb was just a hoot in her role. Stacey Keach was good too, mendaciously menacing as only he can be. Even the bit parts produced some amazingly touching scenes, very much like some of the ones in Fargo. When you put all the good bits together, how deftly the country music is used and how the black and white heightens the starkness of life in these towns... you've got yourself one of the better movies of late!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slow Developing Road Trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>6.25 of 10. Without June Squibb, this film would be less Fargo-like humor and more just a slow, sad tale of an aging old man in the middle of nowhere. Either way, it's a slow developing road trip/self-discovery film, going from Montana to, surprise, Nebraska. While there's a minor mystery involved, there's none of the crime and action that kept Fargo moving during its slower, less funny parts.There's plenty of interesting scenery so it's not an impossibility to pull off, but filming it in black and white detracts more from the setting and story than it adds. Winter is the time to do a black and white film in any state connected to Nebraska.Dern's acting in the lead roll is sincere and entertaining. It, like the story, does get redundant and long well before the end. Another 2013 film that needs to be about 10 minutes shorter.All the criticism and nit picking aside, it is worth watching, especially in the winter when the color and life of the planet seems to have disappeared so as to make the cinematography more believable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Psychologists say that humans need three things for happiness. Something to do, someone to love, and something to look forward to. At this point in his life, Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is searching for all three, and we are invited along on the journey in the wonderfully made Nebraska (2013).Things don't get easier as you get older, and Woody latches on to an obvious marketing ploy in the belief that he has won a million dollars. It shows some of Woody's confusion and borderline dementia, but it also shows Woody's need to find some kind of meaning to his life in his waning years. Along on this journey ise his son David (Will Forte), and he discovers a side of his father that he had never seen. They are joined by a quirky group of friends and family that round out the film.I loved Nebraska. The story is populated by multiple themes of longing, searching, and family. And the age old truth that you can never truly go home. It reminds us that people that are old now weren't always old. They had lives that were full and meaningful. They lived and worked, fought and loved, and filled their lives with meaning. And in Nebraska we hear older people talk like real people, not the caricatures that populate many films. From the greedy "friends" and family members to the crass rantings of Woody's wife Kate (June Squibb) these are real people with real feelings.Nebraska will probably not win the Best Picture award for 2013, but it is certainly my favorite film of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Middle-aged David is the younger of two sons from a mediocre family in Billings, Montana. Working in a mediocre job and struggling with the relationship to his - sorry - mediocre girlfriend, he is also in worry of his dad Woody, whose dementia starts to kick in.Woody's concern these days is a sham $ 1 Million price money he believes he has won in Lincoln, Nebraska, many miles away, and he is determined to walk there. Woody gets dutiful David involved to drive him there: "What else you got going on?"Along their way lies unemployment-struck Hawthorne, the place Woody grew up, and for Hawthorners his million dollar win is big news. A curious, gracious, envious crowd assembles to share their memories of Woody and his spouse, Kate. On his journey through the past of his family, they are joined by Kate and David's brother Ross, better known as lawyer Saul from Breaking bad.Soon we notice that all those old faces of Hawthorne have their story to tell. David starts to learn that his parents may not have been the same old boring people he used to know. But although the faces of Hawthorne have grown old, their stories, their friendships and their rivalries remain young, making us wonder where all the time has gone.In a great closing scene, David turns back the clock for Woody. And after a short while, reality forces its way back into course of life, leaving behind aging Woody, his grown-up son David and their everlasting young stories.Without understating, Nebraska is one of the calmest movies I could imagine. The monochromatic screenplay is a good fit for the plot. The gentle country music soundtrack, mostly in 3/4 beat, is a great support for the constant flow of the story. The acting of basically all actors, but especially of starring Bruce Darn, is super-authentic, leaving behind Hollywood or blockbuster performances that mostly thrive to thrill and seduce. The storyline is profound, clever, witty and logic. No need for big effects; and you won't find a lot of sex-appeal in Nebraska (ha-ha). This is a solid movie with a warm heart and I recommend it to anyone who.... well, to anyone. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit, I'm really surprised a film like this, this restrained, this quiet, has made such a splash in the big award bodies. That's not to say it's no good (although I wouldn't classify it as one of the best of the year) but it's shocking, compared to The Descendants and Sideways it's a lot less flashier. Dern is really good here, but the stand-out is June Squibb. Sure, that's because unlike everything else in the film, she has a pretty flashy role and she nails it. She's a lot of fun to watch and should be in contention for winning the Oscar (of which she has no shot at). All in all, this is pretty good, but the screenplay at times does have some holes and it's a bit too on-the-nose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nebraska" is a simple journey, told with beautiful black and white photography, of a father who thinks he has won a million dollars and a son who doesn't know what to do with his father except go along with him. Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) suffers from dementia but he'll argue that point with you straight to the pub. David Grant (Will Forte) lives a fairly empty life so decides to head to Nebraska with his father.Kate (June Squibb), Woody's wife and David's mother, steals the show as an aging woman who is going to have her opinion heard no matter what. Examples include, "I never knew the son of a bitch wanted to be a millionaire. He should have thought of that years ago and worked for it." And to David, "You're just like your father ? stubborn as a mule."The movie is just littered with one-liners, all of which are pretty damn funny. But as you may have guessed, you'll need to be okay with explicit and sexually-laced language. On route to Lincoln, Nebraska, Woody and David stop in Woody and Kate's hometown filled with family members who want his money, past acquaintances who have done him wrong (or more likely that he has done wrong), and a cemetery filled with family members who have passed on. But Kate manages to tell their story from beyond the grave with biting hilarity."Nebraska" is a simple film done pretty much to perfection. Simple story, simple characters, simple photography and simple comedy (or deadpan humour).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because I have appreciated the acting talent of Bruce Dern back to the 60's. I was really glad to see him in another role. I was not disappointed. What arose out of this movie was something unexpected. Out of the Nebraska milieu, was delivered a lot of very familiar vignettes of mid-western realism that really made me laugh. I encountered a lot of the people that were depicted in this movie. Creating this film in black and white made these characters even more starkly evident because it cast them against the bleakness of a cold autumn landscape. This movie had a lot of heart without being sappy...compassion without tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is OK, but that's about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was mildly disappointed when the credits started to roll on Nebraska. By the end of the film, I didn't feel like anything happened. I thought about how that could be a theme in the film - they're in Nebraska, so everything is supposed to move slow and feel limited. However, I was expecting a solid, Oscar-worthy film, as it has been nominated for 6 of the prestigious awards. For the most part, though, I was just bored. There are a few scenes that made me laugh quite a bit, but I believe that the film is too long and could have benefited from another cut. The humorous parts actually make the movie in my opinion, because I think they reflect so much about the small-town culture. If they weren't there, I probably would have walked out. Bruce Dern was incredible, and Will Forte had some great moments, but June Squibb did not seem to realistically portray her character at all. In the beginning, when she first confronts Woody, I felt like she was just reading her lines without putting much thought into the complexity of the character. I'm not sure if it was how the dialogue for her character was written or if it was her performance, but I just couldn't see her as Kate Grant. I think the cinematography was exceptional, especially because it was shot in black and white, which adds a lot of complexity to the lighting setups. At certain points, I could see them refocus the shot (the screen either squeezed or expanded), and I don't know whether that is because of black and white or not, but I found that very interesting. I also really liked the wide shots of open prairie, as I believe it set up the world of the film very well.Overall, I thought Nebraska was just sort of average. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I definitely did not watch an Oscar- worthy film. It was shot very well, and some performances were great, but there's really no point to the movie. None of the characters change, and there's no real overarching theme. I know that many people will probably love this movie for what it is, but I guess I just expected a little more. To me, it was just OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Nebraska' is a feel-good film about an old man named Woody Grant who receives a letter telling him he has won a $1,000,000 prize which he and his son travel to Nebraska to collect. It's well written, well acted and well directed. It's also beautifully shot. And it's also downright charming.The movie is up for two acting nominations at the Oscars. Firstly Bruce Dern for 'Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role'. For me his performance was solid, whilst nothing brilliant. He's basically an old man playing an old man. His performance was accurate but not all that much of a stretch. The real star for me was June Squibb who is nominated for 'Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role'. Now while her chances of winning the award are not high, they should be. She was nothing short of fantastic. From her facial expressions to her perfect delivery of some of the funniest lines I have seen in years (she owes screenwriter Bob Nelson a lot for sure), she was perfect in her role.The film is shot in black and white. I'm usually not a huge fan of that style, but it works alright on this occasion. Director Alexander Payne is on record as saying he wanted an "iconic, archetypal look". That's all well and good but I fear it may dissuade some viewers (particular younger ones) from taking the time to see this wonderful film. That would be a shame.'Nebraska' is fully deserving of all six of its Oscar nominations this year. It starts of a little slow, but makes up for it big time after that. It's heart-warming and thought-provoking and earns its admission price with Squibb's performance alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A low-key story about fathers, mothers and brothers as well as life and death. Its characters are contradictory and rich. There's a lot of small-town satire here, with a melancholy-comic tone. Director Alexander Payne ("Sideways," "The Descendants") makes movies about people, not superheroes. He takes his time, allowing the viewer to observe and form opinions about men and women in all their frayed and imperfect humanity. They do the ordinary things that people do ? eat, travel about, find places to sleep ? and we gather a lot from those everyday ordinary actions. His films are both surprising and logical, and "Nebraska" is one of his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understated, Funny, Quirky</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is a brilliant filmmaker. Nebraska shares the humor and strangeness of his other films - "About Schmidt," "Sideways." and "The Descendants." Bruce Dern plays Woody Grant, an old codger who has received one of those misleading letters that are sent to everyone from Publisher's Clearinghouse. At a glance you could believe that you have been chosen to receive $1 million. Woody, an alcoholic, married to a terrible nag, believes his ship has come in. His truck has not been operational for 10 years, and he has no drivers license - which is a good thing since he would rarely have a blood alcohol level low enough to allow him to drive.His friends and family tell him again and again that he hasn't won anything. Nevertheless, Woody disappears regularly. He is found along the highway walking to Lincoln, Nebraska, from his hometown in Montana. No matter how often they bring him back home, he sets out for Lincoln sooner or later with his letter in his pocket.One of his sons works on air at a local television station. His youngest son is played by Will Forte, known for Saturday Night Live appearances. Forte, as David Grant, portrays an understanding, patient son, and Woody's only ally. At length, David gives up trying to discourage his father from walking to Lincoln, NE. He decides to drive him to the location where Woody can claim his prize. On the way, a family reunion takes place in Nebraska. Woody moved to Montana long ago with his wife.Filmed in black and white in Payne's home state, the film looks barren in the flat landscape. There isn't much to see, and these Mid-Western people have few words. European films have a standard funny scene where people do little or nothing. The humor arises out of the emptiness of the scene. We see this technique a lot in Nebraska. People stare at the television and say nothing to each other, even though years have passed since they last saw each other. Elsewhere you might expect excited conversation as the people catch up. In Nebraska, they don't care. This is the opposite of slapstick. Instead of comic motion, there is the pregnant pause and the lack of motion. There are lots of laughs in Nebraska, but the film tells subtle jokes. There is visual humor and much irony. Nebraska will not entertain everyone. Viewers expecting comedy to be like the "Hangover" franchise might be bored.Good performances by Bruce Dern, Will Forte and June Squibb, the meanest wife in the mid-West.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie because of Bruce Dern and the praises for his performance. He portrays the gruff, hair uncombed, alcoholic father of two sons. This is the story of a son who wants to find out more about his father - who he is and why he is the way he is. The father has the letter saying he has won the million dollars IF he has the right numbers and he wants to get to Lincoln, NB by a certain date. Of course many things happen - the Mt. Rushmore scene is priceless - "it doesn't look done to me". The rest of the family that appear to befriend the millionaire - as expected they all have their own motives and none are good. Will Forte is so good in this movie - very low key, trying with frustration to get his dad to understand and then giving in to help the father see the truth. June Squibb is good as the wife - no one helps her and "I'm the one who does everything around here". She is in the movie more that some best supporting actress nominees in the past. I found the movie to be slow and at times boring - due to the long driving scenes (I hate the drive through Montana to get to the Dakotas - made it many times with my parents). And I am one of those who sits and watches all the credits at the end. I got up and left as soon as they started.BUT the more I think about this movie -the more I like it - it will stick with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that's a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska is a story that was wonderfully done and made me wonder -- with all the shoot up, bang up, blow up, young-naked Hollywood films making so much box office, how this ever got done. Alexander Payne is how it did, he directed a wonderful story. It's not for everyone, and I think that some people who watch it now and disliked it, will see it 30 years from now may not dislike it so much as they may see it in a different perspective.The easiest thing to 'get' about Nebraska was that it is about an older man Woody, played wonderfully by Bruce Dern, who believes he's won a million dollars through a mail marketing program. He's headstrong as he wants to claim his prize and nothing will stop him from doing so, but there may be more going on there such as a degenerative order like Alzheimers or Dementia. His son, played by Will Forte, knows what this program is about, but cannot convince his dad it is not what it seems. So the two sets off on a road trip to claim the prize.What we get is a road trip mixed with all sorts of people, some quirky, some jealous, and for me, some a few overblown (the cousins, for example) but it did not ruin the film for me. They all worked as some folks that reminded me of real people. The multi-layers come in when it gets out that Woody may be a million dollar winner. Some people are happy about it, some people want to take advantage. While we know the mail marketing company may have taken advantage, people can too especially where any hint of money is concerned. So besides going through Woody's ordeal, the film also goes through his family's, the town, his so-called acquaintances and a father-son bond that by the end of the film becomes heartwarming.This is filmed in black and white, but a very sharp black and white which I think enhances the film. The supporting performances by Stacy Keach (as Ed Pegram) and June Squibb (as Kate Grant) were stand out as well. It's not a film for everyone, but for those who just want to see a story being told that will make you think after it's over, Nebraska is for you too.</fullReview>

I suspect, though, that Will Forte's equally first-rate work will be overlooked in the justifiable rush to reward the wrinklies.Thematically the film treads some very familiar ground: THE STRAIGHT STORY and THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL are just a couple of titles that come to mind. All the same, NEBRASKA, scripted and directed with great assurance, has its own atmosphere. I emerged from the cinema glad that I'd seen it, which doesn't happen a lot these days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had little knowledge of this film other than that it was by Alexander Payne. I appreciate what he's doing and expected that I would enjoy "Nebraska", and I did. I was not prepared for Black and White. When I realized that the film would be B&amp;W, I had to reset my expectations -- sort of take a breath. I think it is my same response if a film is subtitled; there is compact that needs to be reached before undertaking the experience. One more thought about the Black and White is that it is not this incredibly rich depth of field or contrast. There is no intense contrast in the light or shade - this isn't "Elephant Man" or "Raging Bull" B&amp;W. Everything is washed out a little... fatigued, much like the Wintertime setting, or the desolate flatness of much of the landscape. It's as though the settings are a flat canvas for the portraits. So the allusion to fatigue, Winter, the mundane absurdity of survival are all in force, but there's something more about it than just survival. It's about "having survived" and there isn't much left or much purpose to carry on... yet they do. Payne is at his best with journey/road ventures, whether to wine country, or Winnebago trips to Denver or drives to the plains of Nebraska. There is a stark banality to the humor at times. The acid tongue of the mother (June Squibb) is particularly funny but painfully real. Many points of humor are set up very early and pay off very well. Many extras (with lines) appear to be locals from either Billings of Hawthorn - real people. Bruce Dern is very believable, and in many ways I think he acts so well that he doesn't seem to be doing much. I suppose he'll be nominated for awards, and no doubt deserves recognition, but for me the best acting was the mother, June Squibb. I would hope that she's nominated for a Best Supporting Actress. My only mild misgiving with the film is the ending. Somewhere near the end there is a great line about the father's vulnerable nature (not just in his twilight, but always). The force of that line deserves something a little more cathartic than the ending offered. Maybe "About Schmidt" was on my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nebraska is a satire, in part a black comedy and ultimately a drama.A demented boozer is convinced he won a million dollars and feels compelled to travel to another state and claim his prize. He tries to go on foot, is stopped by the police but will not give up and despite fierce opposition from his family, he simple must have his way.This win is by far the most significant development in this insignificant man's insignificant life. Having been discounted as a daft who ought to be institutionalised by his sons, his marriage on the rocks, this important win matters. They try to reason with him that it is an advertising scam but he wouldn't listen.Suddenly this nobody has been elevated to a somebody. Who would want to give that up? My favourite part is the bit that he goes back to his hometown and will not stop bragging about it. People he grew up with, friends and foes suddenly treat him like a celebrity. In this middle of nowhere little town there is a millionaire. Everyone rejoices but also soon many will gather as crows to carcass to get a bite. If someone felt they were nice to their friend 30 years ago why shouldn't they be entitled to a share of his million?In the midst of confusion, misunderstanding and chaos Woody stands out. Whilst he clearly has lost his marbles, he often comes across as the only sane one and in his unyielding, dignified quest he manages to win over his son and that is no little thing.A beautiful emotional tale, filled with poignant portrayals of the human nature and psyche.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne has a knack for creating quirky characters in Oscar-winning films like 'Sideways' and 'The Descendants'. His newest movie strikes a more somber note than his previous work, but still manages to deliver some laughs. The black- and-white road trip drama exposes a family's appalling behavior when one member believes he's hit a sweepstakes jackpot. With an impressive cast led by Bruce Dern and Will Forte, 'Nebraska' may even garner some awards come Oscar season.Woody Grant (Dern) is a senile, bitter old man. He's first seen walking very slowly on the side of a highway in his hometown of Billings, Montana without a care in the world. His youngest son David (Forte) has just been dumped and works a retail job, and wants a better relationship with his estranged father. His mother Kate (June Squibb) steals every scene she's in with witty insults toward her family and stories of her promiscuous youth.Woody can't drive so well anymore, and often sneaks out without telling anyone. At first, we figure that he's lost his mind. Although this might be a little true, we soon find out that Woody has received a letter in the mail claiming that he has won a million dollars. All he has to do is travel to Nebraska to claim his prize. I'm sure we've all received similar junk mail before, but in Woody's mind, he believes that this is legit. In an effort to reconnect with his dad and give him his one last goal to live for, David agrees to drive him to Nebraska so that Woody won't have to walk 850 miles, which he's completely prepared to do.At first, 'Nebraska' plays out like a road trip comedy with some funny scenes involving missing dentures, a railroad track and Mt. Rushmore. As father and son reach about 60 miles outside their destination, they stop to visit Woody's brother Ray and his family. David's mom and his older brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) join in on this impromptu family reunion. It seems like the men of the family are silent 98% of the time, leaving the women to bring up the past and ridicule one another. No matter how much David insists how obviously fake this million-dollar letter is, everyone's true colors come out, as they try to scam, physically harm, and threaten Woody and David for a piece of the non-existent loot.Payne paints a portrait of the true nature of family life with plenty of satire. His decision to shoot the film in black-and-white emphasizes how the small Midwestern town has been pushed aside and left for dead. Businesses are closed left and right, and people in town seem to be on their last legs. The beautiful cinematography might also be a metaphor for the foggy mindset and depressing events that plague this family. However, in the end, family proves stronger than anything.'Nebraska' is chock full of great characters, hilarious dialogue and strong performances by everyone. Dern never overplays his character's senility. At times, he shows that Woody is still sharp as a tack. Forte is also pretty terrific as a depressed man desperately trying to enjoy life. Squibb's comic delivery and eye rolling had me laughing out loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would a senile old man do with a million dollars? Well, he'd buy a new air compressor and a pick-up truck, that's what. Nebraska is one of the more under-appreciated classics of the last few years. I fell in love with it almost immediately. The characters are quirky in such a real, subtle sense. You want the old man, Woody, to be happy, even though you know it will only lead to rejection. It's a fable about patience, and unconditional love. The father-son dynamic is really, really touching. A little movie like this was easily shadowed by the bigger films it was up against in 2013, but it accomplishes what many films in 2013 couldn't.. finding the sublime in the simplistic. Nebraska is a million-dollar winner in my book.</fullReview>

That's where he belonged. But even Ross and Kate's plan--to put Woody into an institution of some kind--would have been better than the pointless and moronic road trip to Nebraska.I hated Woody, and I hated David even more, and I hated Kate, and Ross, and Ed and the disgusting cousins and everybody else. I HATED this movie.Alexander Payne seems to be everybody's darling, for some reason that I cannot even begin to understand, but after suffering through this one I'll avoid his movies like the plague from now on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne's "Nebraska" is a cinematic sweepstakes winner!!! Payne has marveled once again with a powerful piece of filmmaking depicting lead male characters with conflicting dilemmas. Veteran actor Bruce Dern delivers what is his top performance in his long but underrated acting career. Dern is stern starring as Woody Grant, a boozed-up cranky old-timer living in Billings, Montana; and of course, Dern's grand work deserves top billing here. Woody thinks he has won a million dollars in one of those bogus sweepstakes marketing schemes, a la Publishers Clearinghouse. Woody decides to clear house himself and do whatever it takes to collect his "so-called" million dollars in Nebraska. Will Forte (in an outstanding performance) co-stars as Woody's son David; a noble son who vehemently informs his stubborn dad that he has not won a million dollars. However, Woody is set that he has won the cash prize and will stop at nothing to go get it. But unfortunately for Woody, he can't drive anymore. David decides to take the old man to Nebraska to fulfill his dad's wishes but most of all to have time to bond with Papa Grant. "Nebraska" does turn out to be a bit of a road movie, but incorporated with so much of authentic Midwest America in it; in fact, Payne paints the picture as a love letter of Midwest USA. I have to now squibble scrabble about June Squib's scene-stealing work as Woody's foul-mouthed but devoted wife Kate; what a whopper of a performance from June. Breaking in nicely quite well and not badly was Bob Odenkirk's strong supporting performance as Woody's eldest son Ross. Also loved Stacy Keach's work as Woody's former business partner in his Nebraska hometown;, where many of the standout scenes of the movie actually take place. Bob Nelson's screenplay was a divine grassroots scribe that shined at every second. The cinematography of "Nebraska" was husking small-town beauty at every view. "Nebraska" is definitely one of my favorite movies of 2013, and it is a grand winner in so many ways. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's only 850 miles from Billings to Lincoln</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska (2013) was directed by Alexander Payne. It stars Bruce Dern as Woody Grant, and older man who is not doing well mentally or socially. Woody is convinced that he has won a million dollars in a sweepstakes, and decides to travel from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his prize.Because Woody can't drive, his son agrees to travel with him to Lincoln. Everyone but Woody knows that the certificate is just a piece of trash. However, the old man himself can't see this, and his son decides that the easiest thing to do is humor him, let him learn the truth, and then take him home. So, what we get is a road movie of father and son traveling through small towns on the way from one small city to another small city.Woody has led a life that is far from ideal. We learn that he was considered quite a catch in his youth, but he's an alcoholic and has been an inadequate husband and father. When father and son get to Woody's home town in Nebraska, they are set upon by people who accept Woody's millionaire status. We don't see the "dear hearts and gentle people" in this home town. Everyone wants a piece of Woody, now that he's rich. Old secrets are uncovered, and old wounds are reopened.Will Forte does a good job in the thankless role of Woody's son, David. His character provides the film with probably the only decent human being we see. In fact, the ending of the movie, as engineered by David, doesn't ring true and doesn't appear realistic given all that we've been shown before.Even with the unrealistic ending, this is not a feel-good film. It's worth seeing to watch Dern inhabit the role of Woody and make us believe in him. (We don't like him, but we believe in him.) It's a true acting tour de force. I've never before commented on the location choices in a movie. However, for Nebraska, I take my hat off to Location Manager Jon Latenser V, who got the locations just right. From the first shot, of Woody trudging along in the snow next to a railroad yard, until the last frame, the film looks and feels realistic. Latenser has an understanding of small-city and small-town America, and he demonstrates it in this movie.We saw Nebraska in Rochester's excellent Little Theatre, but it should work very well on DVD. It's one of the great films of 2013. Seek it out and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska out-Coens the Coens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is either a long-lost Coen bro or has gone to school on them, as this bleak, stark,lonely, black and white film would be recognized as a Coen film if you didn't know Payne made it instead. For my money, it is a lot better movie, and more Coen-like, than the Coen's latest, Inside Llewyn Davis, which I did not like but, of course, pro film "critics" did. Typical critics.........."Let's all say we liked it to show how cool we are." Will Forte as son David, he of the sad face and endless self-sacrificing nature of a neglected son who never got a bit of respect or notice from his father but always tried to be the good son in spite of it, was the glue that held this father and son road trip story together, along with some great character bits by his very outspoken mother Kate, played by Jane Squibb, who had all the best lines in this story and could be counted on to wield a funny but scathing word sword at any opportunity. Bruce Dern as Woody, the father, was as demented and detached from the real world as anyone not yet living in a nursing home, but his son would not give up trying to prove to his father that his fantasy was not reality, and that the real world was a better place for him. And, how hard he tried to do that! On the way to Nebraska to pick up Woody's prize money that never was, visits with oddball family and old "friends" brought out the stereotypical greed and bad behavior of those looking for an unearned payday when big money is coming. In the end, the trip was for nothing, but was it? No prize money of course, but perhaps father and son got something more out of it in personal connection than just some time together on a useless road trip. One had to hope, bleak as it all seemed.One of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne's latest film, Nebraska, is a heartfelt, humorous, offbeat father-son story. It's a beautiful little movie about dreams and regrets.As the film begins, retired alcoholic auto mechanic Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) keeps wandering away from his home in Billings, Montana. It seems he's determined to walk to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he's won. His family is dubious, but Woody is steadfast. Finally, his youngest son, David (SNL-vet Will Forte), agrees to simply drive him there in order to settle the matter once and for all. But Woody is injured shortly after the start of the journey and David decides they should take a detour to Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska to allow him to recuperate for a couple of days. Once there, Woody retraces his past and encounters some old faces; David, meanwhile, gets to know his father in a way he never has before.Dern gives a brilliantly restrained performance, proving that less-is-more. Forte is perfectly deadpan as the patient, accommodating David who is experiencing a role reversal now that he's the one who must care for his aging parent. And June Squibb steals every scene she's in as Woody's self-centered, brutally frank wife. For her, an Oscar-nomination would be much deserved.The movie's aesthetic is beautiful simplicity. Phedon Papamichael's black and white cinematography helps set the tone, as does Mark Orton's terrific score, which is performed using sparse, acoustic guitar-driven arrangements. The dialogue is wonderful as well; screenwriter Bob Nelson has a great ear for how people really talk.Whether or not Woody is really a prizewinner is a mystery that's not solved until the end. But moviegoers are all surely winners for having the chance to experience this small gem of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 2013's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Nebraska, talented director Alexander Payne manages to create yet another film that is uncanny in its approach, yet undeniably poignant in its resonance. It's a film that features a simple and confined story, yet delivers on its themes to excellent effect. In it, we see an old, borderline senile man, played by Bruce Dern, who falls for an obvious sweepstakes scam. Despite assurances to the contrary, the man becomes convinced he won a million dollars, leading to a reluctant road trip with his son, played by Will Forte.Nebraska stands out in a number of ways. For one, Payne decided to film it entirely in black and white. Initially, this appears to be a weird choice, yet grows on you as the film progresses. It gives the film a noted poetic feel, and seems to accentuate the rather dull tones of the film. Secondly, it features characters that are largely disinteresting, at least on its surface, painting us a picture of people we can all relate to. The lives of the characters are mundane, their dispositions muted, and the lives they lead appear pointless. What Nebraska does is expose this, with some excellent societal commentary, but also build upon this. With humor, it finds the true humanity at the heart of its story. The world building is also keenly executed, with a truly authentic representation of rural America. The performances in Nebraska are all very realist, with Bruce Dern having the strongest showing. His portrayal of Woody is both daring and simplistic. He is matched well by June Squibb, who's excellent as his cantankerous, yet caring, wife. Will Forte did a generally good job, though he is certainly more fit for straight comedy. It's hard for Forte to anchor a scene in a dramatic way, sometimes undermining the film.An overall very interesting and noteworthy drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'NEBRASKA': Five Stars (Out of Five)'NEBRASKA' is another Oscar hopeful from director Alexander Payne (the director and co-writer of such critically acclaimed hits as 'SIDEWAYS', 'THE DESCENDANTS', 'ELECTION' and 'ABOUT SCHMIDT'). It's a comedy drama flick about an old alcoholic living in Montana who sets out on a trip to Nebraska, with his son, to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize. It was written by first-time feature film writer Bob Nelson and stars Bruce Dern, Will Forte, June Squibb, Stacy Keach and Bob Odenkirk. The movie is funny and a very touching look at family and the Midwest.The film is a road trip movie about a father and son traveling from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska. Dern stars as Woody Grant and Forte (of 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' fame) plays his son David. They stop for the weekend at a small town in central Nebraska, called Hawthorne, where family drama ensues (due to the Woody believing he's won a million-dollar sweepstakes prize and telling everyone about it). Woody's relatives and old friends of course all want a piece of his winnings.The movie reminded me a lot of the Coens brothers' classic 'FARGO'! Not just because the title is the name of a Midwest location but also because both film's are all about the people (and the people and locations are very similar). I've been to North Dakota several times and both movies reminded me of being there. It's also the best thing Will Forte has ever done. It's nice to see him in a lead (somewhat serious role) and although Dern is the scene-stealing star of the film Forte is the relatable heart. I found the two actors' character development (and scenes of bonding) to be extremely moving and the movie has a lot to say about caring for the elderly. It's also a film that's fit for the whole family to see, despite it's R rating (which is for just two F words and nothing else)! It's a hilarious comedy and a powerful family drama as well; one that shouldn't be missed (especially if you live or have relatives in the Midwest).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gmBnRGZV8o</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Superb Alexander Payne Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska (2013) conveys that same level of intimacy and importance in the lives of its principle characters Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) and son David (Will Forte). Woody, a hard drinking curmudgeon has deluded himself into thinking he won a million dollars as part of a sweepstakes scam. Unable to convince him otherwise, David agrees to take his father to Lincoln Nebraska from Billings Montana to get his prize. On the way they stop by Woody's old stomping grounds and get reacquainted with the family.Co-starring Bob Odenkirk and the revelatory June Squibb, Nebraska is like a 21st century update on The Last Picture Show (1971), only with a much more hopeful dimension to it. Director Alexander Payne is arguably one of the most gifted directors working today. His personal stories about men on the edge provide an unusual sense of depth for modern Hollywood, and his keen eye for humor is inspiring. Every time I watch a movie of his in theaters, there's always a smattering of chuckles coming from different directions and at different times from the audience. There is no telling when someone will relate to the situation to the point of laughter but when it happens it's never coaxed, it's real.Walking in I knew Will Forte was going to be in it in an understated performance. And not to take anything away from his brilliant work but I was surprised by the appearance of another comedy giant Bob Odenkirk playing Will Forte's brother. Both were 100% believable and sympathetic in their roles and I wouldn't doubt that despite Academy buzz surrounding Bruce Dern's pernickety performance, both could enjoy very successful careers in serious drama.Of course one can't write about Nebraska without mentioning June Squibb's firecracker performance. While Squibb has been working regularly since the 90's her work has never gotten much attention until late. I remember her only slightly as the deceased wife from Payne's other elderly magnum opus About Schmidt (2002). Those sitting through Nebraska in theaters will likely remember a lot of moments but the best lines come right from Squibb's feisty elderly mother Kate's mouth. Without her earthy, charismatic performance Nebraska might have been doomed to be an Ingmar Bergman rip-off.While sitting through Nebraska my mind wondered back to Iowa. Both states have much to offer in the sober, calming landscape department. I was worried that with the film being shot in black and white one might not take full advantage of the true beauty of middle America. I couldn't have been more wrong. The cinematography by Payne collaborator Phedon Papamichael is majestic in its austerity; a grand symphony between earth, sky and the camera. It's cinematography that is not meant to create an aura of bleakness like the aforementioned Last Picture Show but a serene silver lining for characters to perch their aspirations.All said and done, Nebraska isn't a sad movie but nor is it a light romp through the heartland. It's a movie that attempts to create characters that are as real as you and me and peering into the woodwork to see what makes them tick. It's a story about hope, set in Anytown, USA which may have seen better days but will keep going until there is light at the end of the tunnel.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landscapes and home truths - a joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's latest offering is a visually rich, black and white homage to the wide open spaces of middle America. Payne uses their majesty and sheer size to draw attentions to the minutiae of family life for those who live in such areas, and the tiny details which shape their everyday existence.Bruce Dern, as the curmudgeonly star of the story, is a revelation - an unkempt, borderline dementia sufferer who refuses to take the advice of his family and maintains his seemingly pointless quest to prove he is right. Will Forte, as his "straightman" son, provides a clever foil for Dern's grumpy old man, giving humanity to the relationship between the two with some light touches, knowing looks and clever interplay.However, for me, the star of the show is June Squibb as Dern's long suffering wife, whose no-nonsense mother has some of the best lines in the movie. And thanks to some deft, light touches by Squibb, you also see the power of the relationship between the two which existed before age diminished the passion and introduced disinterest to the party.As in The Descendents, Payne allows the landscape to speak for itself, highlighting the isolation of the location and throwing sharp focus on the relationships therein. The supporting cast, including Stacey Keach as a thoroughly unpleasant cove and the older actors playing Dern's siblings, is first rate, and the untried acting dbutantes brought in from the area by Payne as supporting stars add richness and true colour to the overall impression of scale and scope.The cut that I saw was maybe 15 minutes too long, but that is a minor quibble in another triumph for Payne which should see him, the cinematographer, Squibb and Dern nominated at multiple awards ceremonies for their efforts. This is a joy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nebraska (2013) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) believes he's won a million dollars but everyone in his family, including his son (Will Forte) and wife (June Squibb) know that it's just a scam. When Woody begins walking from Billings, MT to Nebraska the son agrees to drive him down there only for the father to hopefully realize what's really going on. Alexander Payne's latest film is certainly another winner and it's also one of the most fresh and original movies of the year. Sure, we've seen countless films dealing with delusional old men, fathers and sons as well as strange relatives but Payne manages to take the screenplay and give it a fresh coat of paint and it really does seem as if you're seeing this material for the first time. It's doubtful that anyone is going to be shocked by anything that happens in the film but the thing has a good-natured feel to it that makes it seem like something from the Golden Era of Hollywood and not something being made today. Payne's direction is top-notch and especially when you consider the deliberate slow pace that's going on as well as how he can make you laugh one moment but then turn things dramatic in a split second. The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael is without question the highlight of the film and the beautiful way the B&amp;W brings the setting to life is something great to see. Another major plus are the terrific performances by everyone from the leads down to the smallest of roles. After years of being neglected, the underrated Bruce Dern delivers the strong performance we've seen from him in decades. There are so many different ways to play a "crazy" person but Dern is just so tender with it that not for a second do you feel like you're seeing a performance. The character doesn't say many words but Dern's wonderful way of just "looking" into the distance is something so memorable. This character is certainly one of the most memorable of the year. Forte also deserves a lot of credit as the son trying to reconnect with the father who never really did much for him. Squibb also deserves a lot of credit as she's flawless in the role of the wife who isn't afraid to speak her mind on any subject. NEBRASKA isn't a laugh-a-minute comedy and it never tries to be. The laughs are often small and come natural but this just gives the film a real authentic feel.</fullReview>

The black and white, poignant Nebraska is a road film about that old man and his son, David (Will Forte), as he takes dad from his home in Billings, Montana, to the prize office in Lincoln, Nebraska, to claim his money. No digital proof for him?just the pieces of junk mail that he counts on to comply with his credo that he believes what people tell him.Along the way on this gentle and fulfilling journey, David meets old friends and relatives in Hawthorne, Nebraska (Main Street stores and old folk images straight out of Walker Evans), where the two sojourners rest for a few days. Of course, director Alexander Payne mines the descendants, eccentrics, and aging folks for laughs and not a small amount of local lore about rivalries from the old days and the meaning of wealth. Yet with all that wealth to come, Woody wants only to buy a truck, even though he doesn't drive. As he did in Descendants and About Schmidt, Payne gently lampoons the selfishness and greed of family and friends.Woody's wife, a tell-it-like-it-is-Melissa-McCarthy type, provides the recurring comic irony in what is otherwise a melancholy peek at the fading dreams and values of the heartland and, by extension, America. To walk the streets of Hawthorne is to face an economy that has let everyone, even whole towns, down with little to look forward to but death. So, too, with Woody, who mostly lets everyone down with his alcoholism for most of this life. But he's family, and a son has his duty.Like Alvin Straight's Odyssey to his ailing brother on a tractor in The Straight Story, Woody needs to complete this road trip before he goes on his final journey. He may see that money brings out the worst in some friends and relatives; David's reward is to learn that dad has some romantic and heroic parts of his past worth admiring. Woody doesn't seem to learn a thing, but David grows enough to give dad love that he hadn't shown before.We learn about the dreams an old man can hold onto despite the naysayers. Although younger folk don't like to encourage foolishness in elders, it may be more joyful to let them dream with hope. No one is lying, much less the old because wishes can come true and obliterate the lies we need to tell ourselves before we shuffle off this mortal coil: "Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying!"

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne's Nebraska is one of the most oddly cathartic movie-going experiences that I've had all year. Here is a modern black-and-white filled with a cast that, at a cursory glance, might make you think twice before going to see. But I must counsel you now at the beginning, don't think twice because Nebraska is a true diamond in the rough.The film opens up with a hunched over Bruce Dern slowly making his way upstream a busy rural highway, a police cruiser slowly coming to a stop behind him; the officer gets out of the car and approaches the still walking Dern, asking him what he's doing and if he's lost.Check out the full review here: http://www.triplemreviews.com/#!nebraska/cwgd</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: Nebraska/Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question at the surface of Alexander Payne's newest feature is; what would you do with a million dollars? Although the very fabric of this question is at the core of Payne's newest film, whether or not Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) receives his loot and the events that lead as result of his winnings are actually the least interesting aspects of Payne's little piece of Americana. Instead, what comes to the forefront of Payne's quaint independent feature is the relationship between this ailing alcoholic and his son David (Will Forte) and the small adventure they share together that wouldn't be too far fetched as a trip with your own old man.One of the most consistent characteristics of an Alexander Payne film is his focused vision and of course his ability to surprise us with his choice of actors and their undeniable charm. Payne, who's position as a writer is vacant from the credits, instead puts his focus on directing Dern and the rest of the cast to acting bliss. Woody, an aging booze-addled Hillbilly makes his way into our hearts with very little words and timidly transparent gestures. By the end of the film, Woody's successes (although few) shine over his many failures.One of the most surprising performances of the film is by Forte as the always understanding and overly forgiving younger son David. David, who always had to live in the shadow of his ambitious, go-getter brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk), poses great questions to Woody's thoughts on love, life and the pursuit of happiness. Not to mention the chemistry between Dern and Forte is somewhat of a cinematic marvel.Nebraska has an ingeniously stylistic film-making approach and is formulated into a highly affective lasting anecdote. The setting surrounded by large empty plains, as well as the choice to screen the film in black and white, seemed a bit gimmicky at first. As the characters within the film begin to resonate, a pattern of behaviour starts to take shape. Not only does the black and white aesthetic add to the commentary in which Payne is making about these simplistic people and their mundane lifestyle, but it is a creative juxtaposition in that many of the people who inhabit that lifestyle usually don't have many choices?other than the plain black or stark white life choices predestined to them, without much grey in-between. The progression of the lives of the resident's of Hawthorne is best explained by Woody's gossip-queen wife Kate, who has an encyclopedia of dirt, backstories and not-so-small tabs on everyone in the town. Her constant judgement of people in the town she left behind adds as a fantastic contrast against the falsified life she, along with her family, leads in Montana.Surprisingly enough, one of the most important characters in the film, a character that allows all the other characters to reach their monumental highs and embarrassing lows, is the symbol of the questionable lottery winnings. Ironically enough, the questionable million dollars that Woody has luckily obtained, shows the reality of such fortune and the inherent misfortunes it brings. As the deep family history and greed begins to take hold of the better part of each character, far- forgotten instances of the past are re-hashed along with individuals who have long left Woody's life. One of these individuals is Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach), an old-business partner to Woody and untrustworthy friend. Keach, who was throughly convincing as the leader of a white supremacist group in Tony Kaye's cult-classic American History X, inherits evil and becomes real-world menacing in a way only Keach could pull off. Pegram along with unsuspecting members of Woody's family become a mob of expectations for Woody's kind-hearted, generous ways.Nebraska becomes a reminiscent slice of real-life. Focusing on a low income household, with familial inconsistencies and moments of poetic irony, the film is a wise and weathered cautionary tale. What may seem unconventionally bizarre and just plain weird to some families, becomes the norm for others. Nebraska is filled with scenes involving the Grant's that just don't make sense, but it allows each member of the family to bond and connect in ways that only unexpected circumstances could foster. There lies the beauty of family.Not only is much of the film bristled with dry dialogue, callous humour, and a black and white film stock, but the subject matter will definitely have issues finding a niche audience outside the festival and award demographic. Sadly, Nebraska is a film with a ton to say. Uninterested in giving expected narrative hand-outs and warm emotional tokens of redemption, the film is never a disillusioned scam. Heart-rendering and unexpectedly warming, Nebraska solidifies the idea that the illusion of something is much more important than the actual thing itself.Check out the REST of the review at www.nightfilmreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is recommended.In Alexander Payne's new independent film, Nebraska, we meet a boozy, cantankerous fool named Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) who wants to be a millionaire more than humanly possible. In his alcohol fermented state of mind, Woody firmly believes that it is his unalienable right to travel from Billings, Montana to the Cornhusker State and collect his prize money from a sweepstakes marketing ploy. His few friends and family members try to convince him that this journey is sheer folly on his part, particularly his straight-shooting, no-nonsense wife, Kate (June Squibb) and his two estranged sons, David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk). But go he must (with the aid of one son), and so must we moviegoers partake of his odyssey to nowhere.Nebraska is a meditative ode to Americana (as seen by Preston Sturges with a Diane Arbus sensibility). Exquisitely photography in glorious black and white by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, this road movie shows the rural vistas and its struggling working class population with a poetic elegance. Every crack and wrinkle of its people and their small town ways is exposed along the way, no more so than in the vivid performances of Mr. Dern and company.Dern has created a complex and, at times, dislikable codger, a man dissatisfied with life, selfish in his motives and often cruel to his traveling companion and whipping boy of a son. His commanding portrait of a grumpy old man who has lost sight and reason about everything and everyone in his life is acting at the finest level. Will Forte as his put-upon son is quite subtle but effective in his role. Their strong chemistry bristles with bottled-up anger and an unspoken sadness. The entire ensemble is flawless. Stacy Keach, Mary Louise Wilson, the previously mentioned Odenkirk, and especially Squibb as his perfect comic foil of a spouse whose off-color remarks are priceless, all deliver memorable performances.At times, the film appears to be as fool-hardy as its main character. Nebraska spends an inordinate amount of time basking in its simple but heartfelt story and leisurely creating its characters with a rare poignancy and honesty that is usually lacking in today's films. Still, the film becomes a tad redundant and overstates its message of loneliness and dysfunction. Some scenes feel unnecessary and inessential, more atmospheric than plot-driven. A few minor characters seem predictable and too much a rube stereotype.But Nebraska is that rare commodity of intelligent filmmaking and richly detailed narrative. Much of the film's success is due to Payne's observant vision of everyday life and a literate screenplay by Bob Nelson whose clever dialog and awkward conversations are reminiscent of the 1970's classic, Five Easy Pieces in tone and cadence. Payne's direction remains perceptive and thoughtful throughout the film. More than just a character study about one man's wanderings to self discovery, Nebraska locates the heart of a nation in its uncommon insights amid the spacious skies and our amber waves of grain. This is masterful filmmaking, even if there are a few minor missteps along the way. It's certainly worth the visit.

		<shortDescription>A touching, cynical throwback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska is a movie that hits the sweet spot between cynicism and sentimentality. I hated Alexander Payne's last film, 2011's The Descendants with George Clooney, because it felt like an unbearably irritating hodgepodge of weepy dippity-doo-da melodrama and asinine comic relief. Because that film failed to strike a decent balance between emotional sincerity and cutesy dramedy, I found myself taking a strong dislike to the characters when, clearly, the movie was trying desperately to make me like them. Nebraska, with its rough edges and bitter undertones, has more or less the opposite effect: it made me become attached to the characters and their world despite the film seemingly doing everything in its power to inspire contempt for them. The crucial difference, I would image, is that of choice?choice over what to make of the characters and whether or not to like them, rather than a manufactured warm-and-fuzzy feeling. Nebraska is the stark, Last Picture Show-esque black &amp; white antithesis to The Descendants' idyllic, colour-saturated quackery. Nebraska has a simple story. Woody Grant, a senile alcoholic, is led to believe that he has won a million dollars in a mail-in contest and stubbornly drags his long-suffering family across two states to collect the prize money, stopping to reconnect with his old hometown along the way. This synopsis makes the film sound more like Wild Strawberries or The Straight Story than it actually is. The fact is, to the movie's greatest credit, that the character of Woody Grant (played letter-perfectly by veteran character actor Bruce Dern) doesn't give a hoot about anything most of the time. One would think that, beneath it all, the pilgrimage to Nebraska is just a plea for affection or familial bonding, but it really isn't. All he wants is that prize money, and to show all of those people who've doubted him and taken advantage of him over the years that he isn't such a bum after all. Like I said, it's a very cynical film, but it has a sweetness to it.The sweetness of the film, I think, comes from the magnificent chemistry between the actors. It helps that none of them are recognizable starts, for one, despite all turning in top-of-the-line performances here. Bruce Dern, who won the Best Actor prize at Cannes for his work in the film, on his own carries great pathos as well as a certain level of mystique as Woody Grant. Given his senility and lack of understanding of what is going on around him most of the time, most of what we learn about his character and his past is from the other characters, most of whom chalk him down to a reckless drunk, a burn-out and a sponge. That is, everyone except for Kate, his wife, and David, youngest son, played by Jane Squibb and Will Forte, respectively. The interplay between Squibb, who balks loudly at Woody's stubbornness at every opportunity and yet still finds it in her heart to kiss him on the cheek when he winds up in the hospital for the umpteenth time, and Dern, who remains mostly silent (or, perhaps, merely feigns unawareness), is simultaneously touching, brilliantly humorous and thoroughly genuine. It is Will Forte, whose over-the-top antics I remember watching on Saturday Night Live when I was a preteen, who is the heart and soul of the film, however. Here, playing straight man against the various grotesque figures who circle Woody Grant like vultures upon learning of his alleged fortune, Forte provides a stable, tender-hearted center to the film. Even more so than Kate, Forte's David is the only character capable of finding the patience to understand and sympathize with Woody and his foolish quest. The viewer effectively experiences the film through his eyes, cringing and shrugging shoulders along with him as he trails behind Woody from tavern to tavern and humiliating episode to humiliating episode. And, because the relationship between Woody and David is never played for cheap laughs, by the end of the film, these actors come across like a genuine father and son. And that, I think, is precisely what makes Nebraska definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Alexander Payne has proved yet again that he has a remarkable eye for characters, and no need to bury those characters deep in plot. About Schmidt, Sideways, and The Descendants provided us with characters we could laugh with, cry with and feel with. His latest is his first film which he did not write, but it's clear that he and screenwriter Bob Nelson are similar type people watchers.What you notice immediately is that this film and its characters move at their own pace. There is no rushing or urgency. They do things and say things in due time. Or not. What you also notice is that the camera does the same thing. Filmed in stark black and white, the camera is exceedingly quiet and still ... just like the characters and landscape. We can thank Director of Photography Phedon Papamichael, who also worked with Payne on Sideways and The Descendants. Even the score is a bit offbeat. The blending of trumpet and guitar is rare, yet seems to fit just right.Bruce Dern is 77 years old and in his sixth decade of acting. While I have liked him quite often - and really liked him in The King of Marvin Gardens (1972) - this may be his best performance and best role yet. Dern's Woody Grant is an alcoholic, and hard of hearing, and crotchety, and isolated. More seriously, he seems to be in the early stages of dementia given his insistence on walking to Nebraska to collect his "winnings" from a mass marketing mailing similar to Publishers Clearing House. With minimal dialogue, we "get" Woody. That's thanks to Dern's physical performance and ability to emote through simple gestures. We feel his quiet desperation in the search for meaning in a life that is slipping away. He just wants to be somebody before the end.The delivery mechanism is a road trip shared by Woody and his very patient son David (Will Forte). We sense David looks at the trip as an opportunity to connect for the first time with his dad, and maybe even get some life questions answered along the way. On the trip, other family members join in, including Woody's other son Ross (Bob Odenkirk), and Woody's colorful wife Kate (June Squibb). The trip takes them to Woody's hometown where they cross paths with other family and old friends.Woody's insistence that he is about to be a millionaire brings out the "true self" in those whose paths they cross. Many of his old friends are truly happy for him and wish him nothing but the best. Others aren't so kind. True colors can be hard to watch, especially as shown by Woody's old partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach), and other family members who are just after "their fair share" of the loot. The movie excels in these moments ... watching a fiery Kate put these vultures in their place, while defending the husband she has spent the whole time badgering is priceless.Ms. Squibb delivers the film's funniest lines, but she also gives a depth to Kate that adds the level of realism. Will Forte is surprisingly effective given his Saturday Night Live background, but we never lose sight of Bruce Dern (and his hair). The characters we see are grounded rural midwesterners who live their life from day to day, depending heavily on family and friends. Their interpersonal skills are quite different than what is found in metropolitan areas, and those born and raised in heavily populated areas may struggle to relate.The film should garner Oscar nomination consideration in multiple categories, and Mr. Dern is probably a shoe-in for a Best Actor nom. So slow down and take share this trip from Montana to Nebraska ... while I can't promise a prize of one million dollars, you will definitely be rewarded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's certainly funnier from an outside perspective; those who can relate to caring for the elderly might not be as amused.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frazzled, grizzled senior Woodrow T. Grant (Bruce Dern) of Billings, Montana is adamant about walking to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect a $1,000,000 sweepstakes prize. It's a gimmicky marketing promotion that isn't worth the sheet of wrinkled paper it's printed on, but that doesn't stop Woody from falling for the false advertising. His obstinate wife Kate (June Squibb) claims she'd put him in a nursing home if she had the prize money, equally insistent that the old man's obsession not be buoyed by their son's encouragement. David Grant (Will Forte) knows there's no cash, but wishes to let his father have his little fantasy for a few days more, as it clearly gives him something to live for.When Woody refuses to give up on his mission to reach Nebraska, David calls in sick to his electronics store job and plans a road trip. As the journey starts, Woody's alcoholism leads to a brief hospitalization that extends their vacation through the weekend. They stop in Hawthorne to stay with Aunt Martha (Mary Louise Wilson) and Uncle Ray (Rance Howard), where a small reunion of nearby relatives is planned. During their visit, Woody can't help but reveal his newly acquired millionaire status to all sorts of acquaintances, igniting rumors amongst the townsfolk, resulting in plenty of small talk, delusions of grandeur, and "buzzards" from the past coming forward to demand a cut of the winnings.As if to mirror Woodrow's meager, deteriorating situation, his son lives in a tiny, shabby apartment full of dying plants, with nothing to do in his free time and a chubby ex-girlfriend (Missy Doty) who desires some epiphanic development or sincere commitment to their two-year relationship. Somber music chimes in with melancholy notes to further augment the moroseness of the characters and premise. Stark black-and-white cinematography is also employed, perhaps to highlight the uncomplicated motives of simple people, or to give corresponding colorlessness to the visual bleakness of poverty, old age, and the seemingly inescapable, meandering spiral of small town contentment that sparks evanescent ambition.Director Alexander Payne culls humor from the despondency, easily extracting the jocose authenticity of waning years through mental declension, stubbornness, and frank conversing. It's certainly funnier from an outside perspective; those who can relate to caring for the elderly might not be as amused. A drink in a bar evolves into a bonding session for father and son that is primarily saddening ? the pondering of failed relationships, disinterest in love and raising children, and a general lack of compassion proves to be sorrowful stuff. Solid jokes do come along, but the pacing is slow and the spotlight placed on the pitifulness of the supporting roles is occasionally enraging.While examining the lengths some will go to bestow happiness on others, and the revelation of waiting until the last minute to achieve a worthwhile legacy or bequest, quirky old people spout off-color comments and speak candidly about sex for a few laughs, with the younger characters matching witlessness through physical idiocies. Dern delivers a fine performance (a considerable distance away from ruthlessly killing John Wayne) and Forte and Bob Odenkirk (as the less encouraging son Ross) excellently provide personas on the opposite end of their standard comic relief parts. But it takes too long to get to the point, presenting a purpose that is as plodding as Woody's gait.- Mike Massie (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review: 'Nebraska', Starring Will Forte and Bruce Dern</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who's seen Will Forte's work knows that he's best known for doing comedy. He's been on Saturday Night Live and starred alongside comedy gurus like Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller. So it might be surprising that Forte appears in Alexander Payne's Nebraska, but Forte actually does a pretty good job with the drama in the film. It also helps that the film isn't too depressing and has a lot of lighthearted moments. Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) believes he's won a million dollars. It's one of those sweepstakes we all have gotten in the mail at some point or other and thrown away because they're scams. Well, according to Woody's family, he tends to believe everything that people tell him, and so everyday he takes his winning paper and starts walking to Nebraska from Billings, Montana in an attempt to get his money. David (Will Forte), Woody's son, finally humors his dad and packs their bags so that they can make the two-day trip to Nebraska in order for Woody to get what he wants and stop driving people crazy trying to walk there. On the way to their destination, the two stop for the weekend at David's uncle's house in Hawthorne. While there, David begins to learn things about his dad that he never knew before from the mouths of family and people in the town who knew Woody when he grew up there. In one word, Nebraska is a pretty good movie. Alexander Payne puts a lot of effort into it to make it look as natural as possible, so much so that it's shot in black and white, and it works effortlessly. The scenery, acting, and story all blend together really well and create an atmosphere of realistic sadness and humor rolled into one. It's real life and Payne paints that really well. Comedic actors usually flow into drama pretty well given the right material, and Will Forte does it well enough. His character is kind of the crutch that holds up his father and supports him as they trek through this adventure together. Whereas Bruce Dern is the lost, constantly zoned out and slightly confused father. Dern is unkempt and hell bent on getting to Nebraska for reasons other than what you might think. Stacy Keach plays a real asshole as Woody's old buddy who basically sold him out way back when and now wants money once he realizes that Woody will become a millionaire. He's obnoxious and the epitome of a greedy and unfair friend that it really hits home when he makes fun of Woody and Woody takes it quietly. It's a telling trait that distinguishes each of their characters. While the entire cast is really good, it's June Squibb as David's mother Kate Grant, who really shines and steals the show. The woman is a fire cracker and really gets the laughs rolling. She has so much gumption and attitude that she just steals every scene she's in. The movie is much more vibrant with her in it. The film has a lot of themes that keep cropping up and finally come to a head at the end. Themes about family, being taken advantage of when it comes to money, and finding out what's really important to people in life. Alexander Payne brings us a heartwarming and wonderfully told story about a father/son adventure that is layered with much more than it seems. Natural storytelling and atmosphere, Nebraska is Alexander Payne at his best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enchanting black and white presentation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two time Academy Award winning director for adapted screenplay for the movies 'Sideways' and 'The Descendants'. This time for original screenplay and 5 other nominees, including best motion picture and direction. The 2nd of march 2014 evening will decide how many it would grab the little golden statues. Till then we have to wait with no option.The movie had no big names in the cast according to the current market value, but still got a big slide to the 2014 Oscar. Except seeing the posters I never interested to take a peek inside the promos like teasers and trailers. Before watching the movie yesterday I thought it was Jack Nicolson in the poster. I thought they were working together again after the success of 'About Schmidt'. Then realised and surprised about this simple but a beautiful movie.The story was very impressive, in fact, realistic subject. About the old generation people and their misunderstandings of the current world's advertisement gimmicks. The black and white presentation was enchanting. It would have been different if the movie was in colour, I guess I could have liked a bit lesser than now.It was begun like a father-son's road adventure, then later turned into a drama about a family reunion. Dialogues were very good, filled with many dark homours. The story sets with the backdrop of a lottery ticket and takes different avatars which reveals other stories. Like stories of our protagonists birth town, old friends and girlfriend. It's always heartwarming to see the aged guys struggling in a movie. It makes to lean your fondness towards that role. If you are a weak it will emotionally appeal, but also entertains with its dark humors. Either way you will have a great 2 hours with it.One of the best movie of 2013 after 'Gravity', 'Frances Ha' 'Short Term 12', 'Rush', and few others. Definitely a pure family entertainment. If you ever enjoyed the director's earlier movies, then you would do same for this as well. So highly recommended. Don't listen to critics, what I came to know is they are bashing this poetical movie fiercely.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A story with characters, not caricatures. Bruce Dern's best performance in years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie presents a bleak picture of the United States today. Old, desolated, decrepit, and sinking fast - these are the images of the middle of the United States depicted in this movie. And not only about the scenery, about the people too. The movie contains scene after scene of emptiness - empty land, empty homes, empty people. Bruce Dern gives a masterful performance as an aged alcoholic who is a metaphor for the United States today - wobbly, cranky, confused, irritable, knew better days. Nobody can help him, he is tottering to nothingness. His wife is a shrill, angry cynic. Relatives are estranged, everyone is bidding their time. Young people are absent. The center of town is a virtual ghost town. Pettiness prevails; everything is going downhill. Filming the movie in black and white adds to the bleakness. The world depicted in this movie is not a bright, colorful world. It is a gray world, with gray people whose usefulness is past. Everything seems pointless. Old people gather at the bars to drink. The director succeeds in telling a story that is relevant, engaging and thoughtful. There are characters, not caricatures. It is reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Danny Boyle, Alexander Payne, the Cohen Bros - three directors whose works I will always try to see. I go to many more movies than theirs, but am not drawn to them for any particular personnel involved. Unfortunately I have yet to see Boyle's last and was not particularly thrilled with the Cohen Bros. "Inside Llewyn Davis," but Alexander Payne's 'Nebraska' was everything I expected. My 80-year-old father, who attended with us, put it among his all-time top 10.As with all of Payne's movies, or the ones I've seen since I 'discovered' him at least, the characters are very real, and a strong undertone of family unity is prevalent. There is always humor, but no caricatures. You can always relate to the situation someone is in. In this case, I to the son, who was simply trying to make his father happy, though not because of any great tragedy from childhood, but simply because he felt it the right thing to do.I don't know if the movie was enhanced by being shot in black-and-white, but it certainly didn't detract from it. I would have liked to have seen some of the panoramas in color, but I believe b&amp;w kept the emphasis on the characters, so cannot criticize it. Well worth seeing in any format.</fullReview>

Like others have said, this movie starts out very very slooooooow. After about 35 minutes, I contemplated walking out of the theater, but decided to stick it out and I am glad that I did. I agree with other reviewers about the beauty of it being shot in black and white; this was a good choice. The acting of the three main characters was good, but I was not drawn to any of them. None of them pulled me in the way a good movie should. Like I said, the movie did get better and I wanted to see what would unfold and how it would end. This movie was clearly about a journey (for both the actors and the viewers) and the movie was redeemed by the end of the 110 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All about family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you could see into a window of an average American family what would you see? Movies have always tried to portray the average family life, but there is always one problem, they are played by movie stars. I mean when I walk around my neighborhood I don't see anyone that looks like George Clooney or Jennifer Lawrence. I think that filmmakers get the act down, but the look is just so hard to get, it's hard to fake it. Well with that all said, I think someone finally got it right and also made one of the better movies of the year."Nebraska" is Alexander Payne's new movie about life in the Midwest. Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) has received a letter claiming that he has the winner of a million dollars. All he has to do to travel from Montana to Nebraska to claim his prize. That is exactly what Woody intends to do, even if he has to walk to Nebraska. Lucky for Woody he has a son, David Grant (Will Forte) who wants to help Woody live out his fantasy, even though he knows he hasn't won anything. So against David's mother's wishes, David decides to take Woody on a trip to Nebraska to claim his prize. David, whose life as a home electronic salesman isn't the greatest, wants to use the trip as a chance to spend time with his father. David and Woody decide to stop by Woody's home town and see Woody's brothers and his old business partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach). What follows is the perfect story about what family truly is. I think if you were to ask twenty different people what their definition of family is; you would get about as many different answers. Family to me, put up with you no matter how you act and they are always there when you need them, no matter what adventures you take. Alexander Payne knows how to show a family that just feels right and just like in 2011 "The Descendants" you feel like these families could be your neighbors. Unlike with "The Descendents" though Payne only directed this film, but seems to have found a kindred spirit in writer Bob Nelson. The story is amazing, but what lifts Nebraska to greatness is the performance by the entire cast. Dern, who has always been a great actor, gets one of those roles that win you awards. Forte, who is better known from his days on Saturday Night Live, doesn't welter next to Dern and more than holds his own. As great as those two are, the show is stolen by June Squibb, who plays Woody's wife and somehow gets all the best lines. With this movie you can go from laughing to more laughing, and to just taking in a great flick. If it was up to me it would be required that Alexander Payne makes a movie every year like Woody Allen. I wish I had that power, but I don't, so I will just enjoy his movies when they come out, and I promise you this is one you will enjoy quite a bit.

		<shortDescription>Poking in to my eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska is one of those unfortunate films that failed me even though I constantly tried to stay positive about it. So I, too, failed in my attempt. And why? Was it due to my or film's shortcomings? Nebraska suggests that it deals with some elementary human issues, but it never gets further than merely spelling them out for us in one syllable words, poking in to my eye and mind this very phony, artificial way, without displaying any true vision into the issues at hand. I dare to say that the more one understands of life and storytelling, the less he/she likes this film. This of course is an outrageous claim, but as I feel it expresses the core my criticism, I let it stand, allowing myself to become heavily criticized, possibly misunderstood.Nebraska may have meant to be a dark or black comedy. I say it's not such, but a cheap one. In it we meet paper thin one purpose characters.I am surprised that the director Payne has not noticed or paid attention to the numerous faults of the screenplay (in case the screenplay resembles at all the completed film). Many critical reviewers here have pretty adequately pointed out these faults, so there's no need to repeat the issues. But I don't advise not to watch Nebraska. In fact I suggest everyone to see the film and then ask him-/herself "did I believe in this film, in these characters, in their behaviour -or not". And then formulate reasons for whatever the answer was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Negative and mean-spirited</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne, in his comedy-drama Nebraska, paints a picture of a decaying rural America, one that has become a spiritual and economic wasteland for the few that remain. Its empty streets, boarded up storefronts and the few businesses left cater to an elderly population that seems to care nothing about improving the quality of their life. Winner of the Best Actor Award for 77-year-old Bruce Dern at the Cannes Film Festival and nominated for six Independent Spirit Awards, Nebraska is a strange mixture of charm and despair. While the film includes people who express their love and support, the main protagonists are confused and declining old people, argumentative and negative families, and boring, uncultured Midwesterners.Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is the grumpy old man with declining faculties in the latest version of the doddering curmudgeon type that movies seem to think defines old people. As the film opens in Billings, Montana, the alcoholic Woody is taken into custody by a police officer after he is seen sauntering down the freeway. We soon find out that Woody is under the false impression that he has just won a million dollars after receiving a notice in the mail sent to lure gullible folks into buying magazine subscriptions. To collect his winnings, he is walking to Lincoln, Nebraska, telling his son David (Will Forte), that he's not "trusting the mail with one million dollars!" Filmed in black and white and set to a "down-home" guitar score by Mark Orton, Woody seems to parallel the director's experience with his own father. "I think many of us", he said, "have experiences with fathers who ... are loving, they are nice, but somehow they're on another planet" Woody, however, in the view of his son David and his wife Kate (June Squibb), is neither loving nor nice but stubborn, mostly distant and uncaring and, yes, definitely on another planet. Though David repeatedly tells his father that the million dollar certificate is a scam, Woody insists on going to Lincoln and David, who has just broken up with his girl friend, takes some time off from his job as an electronics salesman to drive him, hoping to bond and erase the bad feelings that have surfaced over the years.The abrasive Kate is against the idea and calls Woody an idiot, one of many acidic tirades she launches against him that come across more like self pity than tough love. Along with David's brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk), a TV newscaster in Billings, she wants to put Woody in a nursing home but David strenuously objects. The heart of the film is David and Woody's visit to relatives and old friends in the fictional town of Hawthorne, Nebraska where Woody was born. There's not much aliveness in Hawthorne and in an iconic shot, two heavy-set brothers (Tim Driscoll and Devin Ratray), and other family members sit on a sofa drinking beer and staring at the TV without talking or showing any expression.The brothers have a good laugh ridiculing David for taking two days to drive to Hawthorne from Billings, a put-down to which David does not respond. Word soon gets around that the old man has won a million dollars. It doesn't take long for everyone, especially Woody's former business partner Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach), to suddenly recall the money that Woody allegedly owes them and line up to put in their bids for some of his millions. The only one that doesn't have their mind on money is Woody's childhood sweetheart Peg (Angels McEwan), whose kind and loving presence seems to have caught the sourpuss scriptwriters off guard.A very funny scene in which the brothers try to steal a missing air compressor is offset by a scene notable for its caustic irrelevance. As the family visits the cemetery to pay their respects to deceased family members, Payne scrapes the bottom of the barrel by turning the visit into a vitriolic gossip-fest by the ever-loving Kate. Without question, Nebraska is marked by convincing performances that will most likely be recognized by the Oscars and the film has moments that are truly tender and very affecting, yet the overall thrust of the film is so negative that I lost interest in what happens to the characters.It is one thing to show economic blight, small-town ignorance, and damaged family relationships, but if the characters in Nebraska are not believable as real human beings, the statement loses whatever appeal or impact it might have had. While much of Nebraska is funny, it also has its mean-spirited aspect. In this age of political correctness, if the elderly were portrayed as a high percentage of them truly are: creative, energetic, loving, and compassionate, Hollywood scriptwriters would have no one left to get cheap laughs from.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless and slow as molasses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is dull, pointless, depressing and presents nothing new or interesting. The characters are a bunch of low-lives who have nothing interesting to say because they are basically dull people. The main character, Woody Grant (played effectively enough by Bruce Dern), has no redeeming virtues at all, and you wish someone would just give him a swift kick in the butt.The plot, such as it is, moves at a snail's pace, inducing boredom and, ultimately, sleep. I went with two of my adult sons and about halfway through we had it and walked out. I almost never walk out of a movie I've paid good money to see but I just couldn't sit through this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After an addled Dern is caught numerous times wandering the streets in an attempt to go to Lincoln NE from Billings MT to collect what he believes is an authentic million dollar prize, his son Forte agrees to drive him knowing full well the supposed loot is a scam. On the way, they encounter old faces who are unaware of the falsity, and proceed to tell their own stories of why they're owed a piece of the money. There's a point in the film where Forte mentions the main motivation of humoring his father is simply for a change of scenery, which helps parallel the setting shift that's so different from the L.A. or New York locations we're so used to?and this quality really helps the movie stand out. Orton's gentle score accompanies the farmland atmosphere terrifically; however, it's also apparent that the music is used to fill gaps of residential establishing shots to needlessly prolong the runtime. Very much a film worth seeing, but some of the punch-lines don't land on target and you can't fault someone for calling this "boring". The black-and-white doesn't add to the mood.*** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska Gets the Indie Treatment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Forte plays the son of a mildly deranged elderly man who believes himself the winner of a million dollar prize which he must travel across state lines to collect. It is a scam, of course, but the circumstances of the man's illness warrant a change of scenery for all the characters involved. Forte takes his father from his home in Billings Montana to claim his prize in Lincoln Nebraska, but along the way he stops at his boyhood home, and in doing so the old man's past is slowly revealed to the son. It is apparent that he has not made it this far in his life without upsetting his family and causing many to believe that he owes them a part of his "million" dollar prize.Personally, this movie reminds me of all the things that annoy people about the elderly, and family in general. The dialogue resembles conversations I can imagine having with loved ones. The situation where Forte must placate the old man by taking him on this trip because it is the only way he will ever be satisfied feels very real.The film is shot in black and white and at times comes off as the picture of Indie Cinema, as in, it can come off as pretentious and off-putting. It is a little slow, maybe 15 minutes too long and not as funny as I wanted it to be. I do think that if I lived in this region of the country I might not like the film's treatment of its people. But maybe it is accurate. And there were moments to enjoy, notably the elderly mother telling the money grubbing relatives what they can do with their requests. Overall, a mildly engaging film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid but slightly strained drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like 'About Schmidt' which came a decade before it, 'Nebraska' is a tale of an elderly man who embarks on a seemingly menial journey across the United States which becomes a rather contemplative and character-building odyssey. Unlike the earlier Jack Nicholson film, 'Nebraska' lacks the potentially cheapening Sandler-esque comedy, and Bruce Dern's senile character has little of the self-deprecating and tongue-in-cheek misery of Mr Schmidt, which makes 'Nebraska' a more profound work of commentary on the exploitative and cruel world inhabited by the vulnerable. I've read a few comments in discussion of this film that have criticised the performance of, or at least the character of, Will Forte. I've also seen the retort that Forte's character, David Grant, is simply an introverted and reserved man like his father. I think that's a tenable argument, but I don't know how well it was implemented in the film; when Bruce Dern's character, Woody Grant, is a similarly inwards-looking character without much to say, the dialogue and exchanges between the father and son comes across as a little awkward and strained. Realistic? Sure. Fun? Not very. This led to me being very grateful for the presence of June Squibb's enjoyably crass character, Kate Grant. (I can't help but wonder if the dysfunctional family of 'About Schmidt' would have similarly benefited from Squibb's survival, but I guess that runs against the premise of the film!) Overall, the story of an elderly man and his son embarking on a na?ve trip to reap a dubious reward is quite an enjoyable one, and, like most good dramas, I can imagine that the satisfaction and/or evocation is amplified if the viewer can relate to the tale. It is far from the perfect drama, in my opinion, as ? like I said ? the interactions between father, son and family sometimes appear a little forced. Nonetheless, 'Nebraska' is a solid title, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the much-cited 'About Schmidt'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Comedy that's Just a Bit Too Artsy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have a dry sense of humor you're going to love this movie. I myself found it to be quite funny, and I laughed out loud at several points in the film. My girlfriend, on the other hand, found the humor to be drab, so it's a style of humor that's not for everyone. I might compare it to a Coen Brothers style of film, albeit without the trademark violence of the Coens. The film centers around Woody Grant, an aged man suffering from mid-stage dementia who is convinced that he has won a million dollars from a magazine sweepstakes scam. This prods his son, David, to take him on a trip to Lincoln, Nebraska to satisfy his insatiable desire to claim his winnings. Along the way the pair stop off at Woody's hometown, where a variety of encounters with long lost friends and family take place.This movie is both hilarious and yet also very heavy and deep all at once. Woody's character, along with most every other character in the movie, is far from noble or ideal. And yet he has an endearing quality, and his dementia makes him likable in spite of his abrasive persona.That said, the film's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The movie has an intentional "artsy" feel to it, evident in both its score and its black and white format. It also goes to great lengths to establish its dry humor. As I mentioned above, this effect works great for some viewers, but will be lost on others.Finally, the acting in the film is a bit spotty here and there. For the most part the main characters offer up strong, convincing performances. Where the movie struggles, though, is the haphazard dialogue between the main actors and some of the more minor cast members. Interactions with bar tenders, secretaries, etc, come off as imperfect throughout the movie, which betrays a mediocre directing job in spite of the lavish attempt to pull off a well made, artistic film.Regardless, this is still a well made film that is certainly worth seeing at least once. I give it 7/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Payne should stick to Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne once showed a lot of promise, with movies like Citizen Ruth, Election (my favorite!), About Schmidt, and Sideways. But then he made The Descendants, a very boring movie about rich Hawaiians and what they do with their inheritance. Now this.Payne is venturing out of his specialty, which is episodic comedies, and into Coen brothers territory. Newsflash to Payne: The Coen brothers already did that.This movie is about a senile codger who thinks he won a million dollar sweepstakes, when in reality he won nothing. He cannot be convinced, however, and insists on being driven to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his winnings. His tender son finally gives in, hoping at least to turn the trip into some positive, last father-son experience before the old coot dies. They run into caricatures of parasitic relatives and friends on the way after stopping at a town the old coot grew up in. Nothing really happens in this movie; there is no real catharsis or growing. It is just a tender little story, pathetic even, about a man who wants to do something nice for his father. For that, we have to watch a tedious near two-hour black and white movie that crawls along the flat Midwest.Payne is taking himself too seriously (perhaps About Schmidt ruined him?),and his last two efforts show he is out of his true element: quirky, original and faster-moving comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woody Wants His Money, and You'll Want Yours Back too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At one point in the movie Woody's son played by Will Forte comments to an office worker saying that his father just believes everything people tell him; this of course is in reference to the bogus letter stating he has won a million dollars that Woody wants to travel to Lincoln,Nebraska to claim. Well as my first major point of concern: if Woody believes everything everyone tells him, then why are the members of his family, and seemingly everyone else around him the only people he won't listen to? From the start this film is frustrating. The constant location changes vary from the open road, to bars, then back to a house somewhere in the middle of nowhere, to a bar again, and then the open road some more, and again to some boring houses. The script itself ins't really that deep or interesting either, granted that probably isn't the point, but while attempting to showcase a more 'realistic' portrayal of life in the middle of the country where they doesn't seem much to do, it's rather insulting when you think about it; and heck, I live on the east coast. Somehow it just seems very wrong that a movie about a drunk who drags his sons and wife through the ringer for most of their lives, including these latest debacles, garners a best best picture nod and has people singing the praises of Bruce Dern. Honestly, he has perhaps the fewest lines on screen, is not all that interesting, and causes all the families problems therein.It may sound like I'm just bad mouthing this film, but this frustration has more to do with the politics of cinema more than the actual movie itself. If just left alone to discover perhaps I wouldn't have such a beef with how great it supposedly is for a modest motion picture, but given the vast praise it received from critics and academy members before I saw it, upon viewing, this movie is a let down. It's not the worse by any stretch but it's hard to recommend, since it's filled with boring locations, a bare bones script, unlikable characters, and a grim portrayal of life that teeters a little closer to cynicism than actual reality. Considering these are the things that most critics bash bigger films for employing, they seemed to have no problems loving all over this dud for the same exact things.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DERN Boring Wild Goose Chase</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viewed at Jameson CINEFEST Miskolc, 2013 NEBRASKA, the prestige film by prestige helmer Alexander Payne chosen to close the festival following the awards ceremony, is the kind of picture you have to respect because it is the work of a respected director, shot in sober black and white, and features an iconic Hollywood villain, Bruce Dern, 77, in an unrecognizable twilight years role, for which he was awarded a best actor distinction at Cannes this year. I must confess that I found this tale of a grizzled senile Midwestern oldster on a wild goose chase after a non-existent $million dollars extremely boring, and thought that the role of "Woody" the stumbling senile elderly hero did not require much acting and could have been done by almost anybody. The feisty wife was a much more interesting character but then, there is no accounting for uncanny French perceptions of Hollywood -- after all over there Jerry Lewis is regarded as a Great Director. Mr. Payne graciously called in his congratulations to the fest on a closed circuit TV clip at the closing ceremony. Only recommended for die-hard Bruce Dern fans and die-hard residents of the upper Midwest. I have always admired Dern as an actor but it looks to me like he must have needed some spot cash pretty quick to submit himself to this insult to his genuine talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant portrait of father and son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the premise of a black and white movie about an aging man traveling with his son from Montana to Nebraska, I admit it sounds like a cure for insomnia. But when you consider it was also nominated for six Academy Awards, it becomes evident that there is so much more to this film. Woody (Bruce Dern) is an elderly alcoholic who receives a sweepstakes letter in the mail claiming he has "won" a million dollars. Woody decides he is going to travel from his home in Montana to Nebraska to claim the prize, despite the fact that he does not drive nor have the means to get there. After first attempting to walk there, his long-suffering son David (Will Forte) agrees to take him, against the wishes of his acidic mother Kate (June Squibb). David knows the sweepstakes prize is just a scam, but it seems to mean so much to his father that he can't resist. On the ensuing road trip we gradually find out more about the family history, about Woody himself, and his relationship with his son. Nebraska is a film about family, past mistakes, regrets and broken dreams. But its also a film about the decline of rural America. There is many long distance shots and sparse settings which emphasizes the expanse of the landscape, but also the loneliness and predicament of the characters. The performances are all first class. Woody is a man of few words but Bruce Dern delivers them all to perfection. Woody is the source of both the humor and the poignancy. He is one of the most memorable characters I have seen in a film for some time. Will Forte is also great as Woody's son, and their father-son relationship just seems so believable. Nebraska was never really a serious Oscar contender. There's no flashiness or big stars or special effects to garner attention, but in some ways that's the point. It is simply a film about real people and real lives that is expertly made and acted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twenty minutes into Nebraska I found it so awful that I took another look at the reviews to make sure I was watching the right movie. I decided to stay with it, and I'm glad I did. The movie turns elegiac and wistful, and somewhat affecting.But the underlying premise of the movie remains silly. And while some will argue that Payne treats his characters with respect, and he is after all from Nebraska, to me too many of the characters came too close to caricatures of dumb, oafish hicks.Altogether, I don't think the movie compares with Payne's best work -- it represents a step back for him. Bruce Dern's taciturn Dad didn't do it for me -- there simply wasn't enough there to tell what he thought of many of the memories relived in the movie. But do stick with it...it gets better as it moves along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska: A fading man reaching for his delusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woody Grant(Bruce Dern) is an old guy who has been living in Billings, Montana for many years since he moved from his hometown in Nebraska a long time ago, and it is clear to us right from the opening scene that he has some serious mental health problem besides aging. He wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska for himself just because he received a letter notifying to him that he won $1 million sweepstakes prize, but, as his caring son David(Will Forte) soon finds out, it is one of those mail scams which actually promise nothing while making receivers purchase magazine subscription instead.But Woody is stubbornly oblivious to that in his mind which sometimes seems to be pretty foggy and delusional, and his continuous attempts to go to Lincoln for collecting that false sweepstakes have driven others around him crazy. His sarcastic wife Kate(June Squibb) does not tolerate this foolishness at all, and the same thing can be said about Woody's other son Ross(Bob Odenkirk, who looks less brash than he did in TV series "Breaking Bad"), who, like his mother, thinks sending Woody to nursing home may be the best option for both him and the family.David, who feels rather sorry about his father although their relationship was not so good even when he was young, decides to help him on one day. After all, there is nothing harmful about driving his father to Lincoln just for satisfying his futile delusion, so David leaves for Lincoln with him, but he only finds again that his father is a difficult man to deal with. During one night, Woody somehow gets injured on his forehead while losing his denture somewhere, and that leads to one of many amusing scenes to come in the movie.Going deftly back and forth between humor and pathos as he did in his previous works such as "About Schmidt"(2002) and "Sideways"(2004), Payne depicts his characters as flawed people with understandable human behaviors, and they feel as real as his melancholic version of faded Americana unfolded on the screen. Through the black-and-white cinematography by Pehdon Papamichael and the old-fashioned logo of Paramount Pictures at the beginning, the movie evokes the ambiance of American films made during the 1960-70s, but it also feels contemporary as reflected by several small details including a flat screen TV and a Kia car(the movie was shot by digital camera instead of film camera, by the way).With this contrast between the old and the new on the screen, nostalgic feelings are amplified around the characters whenever they come upon the remains of lost time. In one poignant scene, David encounters a woman who was once Woody's girlfriend before he married Kate, and he came to learn about his father more than before as spending some time with her at her workplace. She tells him she is satisfied with her life which has been pretty good to her, and she really looks happy and contended, but you may sense that she is wistfully wondering about what her life could have been as she is kindly showing Woody's forgotten past to David.The scene in which Kate and Woody visit the town cemetery with their sons is also filled with the wistful nostalgia toward a bygone era. As Kate recognizes more names on tombstones, we observe an undeniable truth in the closing chapter of their life; many people in their life are gone now and they may be the next ones to go gently into darkness someday. While earnestly recognizing that depressing fact of life, the movie does not lose its sense of humor, and we are amused to see that Kate still retains some of her wild spirit despite her age.And Bruce Dern, who received Best Actor award at the Cannes Film Festival in last year and then was Oscar-nominated for one of the best performances in his long career, gradually takes the center. Besides his many other negative aspects, Woody is a pathetic and delusional guy who is not changed much even in the end, but, thanks to Dern's unaffected performance, he comes to us as a sad, broken man who is left with nothing much to do after used by not only others but also himself. There are many moments when we are not so sure about what is exactly going on inside Woody's rather elusive mind(it is possible that he is going through the early stage of dementia), but, while never reaching for pity or sympathy, Dern and Payne make us understand that this unhappy man desperately holding onto a false hope deserves a little kindness at least.As Woody's acerbic wife, June Squibb, an 84-year-old veteran actress who previously appeared as Mrs. Schmidt in "About Schmidt", has deservedly received lots of acclaims and attentions along with her recent Oscar nomination for her enjoyable performance. Wearing her feisty heart on her sleeve as she probably did before, Kate has no hesitation in showing her frustration and annoyance toward her husband, and we can only imagine how much she has endured him during their married life, but one brief scene quietly implies that she still cares about her incorrigible husband as the life-long partner who has spent many years with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Realistic, Heart-Warming and Memorable Journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film on a rainy Friday afternoon, whilst eating some vanilla ice-cream; with high expectations of another realistic and compelling story from one of my favourite directors, Alexander Payne. Additionally, the cast including the legendary Bruce Dern enticed me further to give this film a viewing. And so, with my spoon dipped in ice-cream, my heart awaiting precious scenes which I can relate to, and my eyes ready to gaze upon the glorious high definition, black &amp; white cinematography... I was ready to watch 'Nebraska'.The opening shot of the film (seemingly bland to some people) hooked me straight away; the characteristics and carefully crafted movements of Bruce Dern instantly creating the character of a troubled, lost, yet experienced old man (Woody) made me wonder what events will unfold within the film. The introduction of other characters throughout the film evoked the exact same feeling; making me wonder what sort of route each character will take physically and mentally, and how each route will influence further events awaiting to come. Will Forte portrays a caring and loving son perfectly, likewise with Bruce Dern and June Squibb perfectly portraying a lasting old couple, in an incredibly realistic and highly compelling way to watch. There is no need to list all the actors, according to me each actor involved in this film gives it their best, including Stacy Keach once again portraying a villainous character very effectively.To conclude, the film did not disappoint, in fact it exceeded my expectations far more. Once you become enticed simply through the characters, the film has succeeded, however 'Nebraska' furthermore provides you with stunning visuals to match the amazing screenplay written by Bob Nelson and directed by the master of story-telling, Alexander Payne (a great combination). Tears were shed of course, thanks to the realistic, heart-warming and memorable journey this film created for me and most likely many others. It was delightful watching this film with my Grandmother, and I would highly recommend watching this film with a close family member; your mother, your dad, your grandmother, your grandfather, your uncle, your auntie, your brother or sister... it doesn't matter, because I guarantee they will be moved by the perfectly executed characters from this masterpiece of a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Academy Movie Review: Nebraska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the film trailer for Nebraska. It did not look good, or entertaining. In fact, it looked downright boring. Dry. Filmed in crisp black and white, and with a limited original soundtrack, Nebraska is Rated R for language. The 114 minute movie, directed by Alexander Payne, caught me off guard. 220px-Nebraska_PosterThe picture was nominated for six Academy Awards. Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Bruce Dern), Best Supporting Actress (June Squibb), Best Original Screenplay (Bob Nelson) and Best Cinematography (Phedon Papamichael).Although Bruce Dern did not take home an Academy Award, he did win a Best Actor Award at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Fifty-four years in the business, and a solid work history. The man is talented. The award well deserved.Woody Grant (Dern) lives in Montana. He received a Sweepstakes announcement in the mail. It says he's won $1,000,000. To collect he needs to mail the form back (with a list of new magazine subscriptions) to Nebraska. However, Woody would rather visit Nebraska to collect the winnings in person.David (Will Forte), Woody's son, sells stereos. His girlfriend left him. Nothing is going right. When he sees the letter his father carries around, he tries his hardest to get his absentminded father to understand the announcement is a scam, that there is no money to be won.Woody's wife, Kate (Squibb), is at her wit's end. Woody's tireless efforts to reach Nebraska on foot are causing the family to consider placing Woody in a retirement home. David steps up. He needs a break from life, anyway. He loads his father into the car and plans to take him to Nebraska, hoping to bond and salvage a relationship that was never good anyway. When family and old friends learn of Woody's "good fortune," everyone feels they deserve a piece of the pie.Squibb, Devin Ratray and Tim Driscoll ?who play David's cousins? are hysterical. Forte is the straight man. Dern is slow and calculated with nothing much to say, but everything he says either comes out profound or comical.I loved the movie. I highly recommend it. Highly! 10 out of 10 Stars, easily. Easily! Throughout the movie, I compared Nebraska to Napoleon Dynamite. It is the same style of storytelling, with just a bit more drama. The one-liners are non-stop. I laughed out loud from beginning to end. The story was fantastic. The pacing was perfect. The acting (with the exception of Forte, sadly), was excellent.Phillip Tomasso Author of The Vaccination Trilogy www.philliptomasso.comThis is my 3rd Academy Movie Review, (See also Dallas Buyers Club, and 12 years A Slave).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bruce Dern and I go way back.My earliest recollections of movies included him quite frequently.He often played cold steely eyed baddies.I didn't like him much then,but that was before I understood that he was play acting.I grew to appreciate what he did in all of those early films several years later,and began to admire him as an actor.Over the years,we began to see him less frequently,as he popped up in a supporting role here and there.I was thrilled recently to learn that he would be the main attraction in this film,and couldn't wait to watch it.This is a funny,quirky story and it was a delight to see Bruce finally escape that stereotype that no doubt has plagued him for a long time.He finally got the ultimate chance to prove that he could play character that,although he has his faults like everyone else,isn't so bad and do it well.Bravo Long Hair (his character in The Cowboys).Congrats on a job well done and a well deserved Oscar nod.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fantastic comedic tragedy of human life. I would have rated it as 10 except for the colour. Lack of colour reduces the effectiveness of the movie. B&amp;W movie only makes sense if film viewpoint belongs to some colourblind person, otherwise life is always worse in B&amp;W than in colour. B&amp;W movie made now assumes viewers are stupid and can't imagine the past in colour. All people were not colourblind in the past, so why now? So much beauty, texture, and variety is lost when moving from colour to black. B&amp;W makes the movie drab and lifeless. You can get the same effect in colour too. You want people to watch the movie and not avoid it. Just try to get someone to use a 20 year old cell phone for free in exchange for a smart phone. Progress is generally positive and an improvement for people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The commodity is empty; it has no exchange value any longer. Everybody knows this, but nothing has come along as a symbol of value to replace it (the commodity), so everybody keeps helplessly and hopelessly following it."Only if we are able to disentangle the future (the perception of the future, the concept of the future, and the very production of the future) from the traps of growth and investment will we find a way out of the vicious subjugation of life, wealth, and pleasure to the financial abstraction of semiocapital. The key to this disentanglement can be found in a new form of wisdom: harmonizing with exhaustion." - Franco Berardi Bifo, The UprisingAlexander Payne knows all of this, but he dropped the ball. Was he scared? Did he not realize (this is a special pyrrhic victory of the late Capitalist system) that the secret to making transgressive ideas taboo is to give the impression that they belong to outmoded dialectical thinking and are just "too 60's" in their nature to be taken seriously? In other words, to defang them rather than ban them, as other totalitarian systems do, did and have done?Payne was able to show how the symbology of American Exceptionalism (Manifest Destiny, the Frontier, Mt. Rushmore, Regionalism, etc.) has become exhausted and used up. When John Ford, at the end of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence showed how Shinbone's peacefulness and modernity had been bought at the cost of authenticity and aura, he was in deep exploration of the dialectic of enlightenment and all of the problematic around notions of "progress". Payne's town of Hawthorne is like Shinbone more than a hundred years later, with its dismal bars, and its Coors Light, and its Nail Salon.So why don't I really like this film? Because it's overladen with sad little over - telegraphed "Epiphanies", almost none of which are believable...Epiphanies are happy accidents. The artist is in a rough position: he or she must "create" them, but, at the same time, must polish and work them to the point where they seem to just ARISE. But this film is full of ersatz little moments - ersatz the way that the sentimental, uncritical use of such weighted signifiers as Black and White photography and refracted Roots Music are ersatz. This little kiss. That little glance. Someone babbles away ironically - then stops all of a sudden. The camera holds on that moment. And we realize "oh, this is LOSS - real LOSS. With nothing left that can cover it up". Man, we're banged over the head with that point before the movie is over. And all this does is to take a film that could have had something beautiful and hard in it, that could've said something real and important about the death of a dream and the grasping at empty talismans and turn it into Goyishe Schmaltz.And the ending! The victory of appearances, again! Well, at least it's consistent...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nebraska is perfect. It is the reason we haven't lost faith in cinema. While the world is out there making films like Twilight and After Earth, Alexander Payne sticks to the classics. The true art of making gritty films about human relationships. Bruce Dern is so good in his portrayal of Woody Grant. Woody isn't a superhuman, he isn't even the perfect human.But in the end you love his flaws like your own. Nebraska is about how flawed we as humans are. It is about how we all need a reason to live and how we will hold on to that reason no matter what. The cinematography is outstanding. June Squibb is the sarcastic mother we all wish we had. This movie is a must watch as it is the closest a movie has come to being perfect (along with Silver Linings Playbook).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie but for me it was painfully difficult to watch. Obviously we are less astute when we get older and make cognitive mistakes regarding correspondences, things we see or don't understand, as well as technology. This movie encapsulates all of that with the inclusion of the immediate family, extended family, and friends. Bruce Dern gives a great performance and the supporting cast is equally good. I gave this movie a 5/10 only because it's not compelling enough to warrant a higher grade. While the acting was good there lacked drama to the overall plot. The best part was in the end (Spoiler) when Woody drives by everyone in Hawthorne in his new truck.If this is what I'm going to be like...let me know and don't patronize me;and please don't let me wear socks with my flip-flops.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NEBRASKA (Alexander Payne, 2013) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When in my comments on HARRY AND TONTO (1974) I had stated that the movie felt like one of today's "indies", little did I know that I would so quickly come across a modern effort that really substantiated this claim! Indeed, NEBRASKA has quite a lot in common with that Oscar- winning comedy-drama ? to begin with, the narrative revolves around an elderly eccentric and his relationship with various family members and acquaintances, and it is also takes on the form of a road movie!77 year-old Bruce Dern undertakes the role of his life here (for which he emerged the deserving recipient of one of the film's six Oscar nominations ? which include Best Picture, Direction and Original Screenplay): despite the protagonist's various shortcomings (negligence, gullibility) and afflictions (alcoholism, dementia), he is lent a quiet dignity and, above all, authenticity by this most consistently underrated of character actors. It was also nice to watch Stacy Keach (aged 72) in what passes for a villain in this type of realistic, thoughtful fare. Anyway, Dern is a man who receives word of having won $1,000,000 ? his wife and two sons realize it is a scam, but he is adamant in picking up the prize, which means traveling from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska; indeed, the movie's opening shot shows him already walking off(!) towards his destination. Eventually, the younger offspring decides to accompany him (to his foul-mouthed{!} mother's consternation) ? taking this opportunity to have a break from his own drab day-job as a home theater/sound system salesman and to visit Dern's extensive family in his old hometown (which happens to be on the way); a detour by the enthusiastic son to check out Mount Rushmore is amusingly put down by his deadpan elder in a matter of minutes.In due course, Mum (an Oscar-nominated and, to me unfamiliar, June Squibb ? most hilarious when insulting a clutch of her husband's deceased relatives during a visit to the local graveyard!) and the elder son also join in the trek. Unsurprisingly, Dern's good fortune elicits a host of varying emotions from the people he comes into contact with. Countering the heartfelt congratulations from old-timers and even a former flame he no longer recalls (now editor of the newspaper covering the would-be event), there are his own brothers, their relations (including a couple of obese and speed-crazy twins) and ? most threatening in his approach ? former business partner Keach who all descend upon him for a share of the hypothetical loot, insisting they had helped out when he was too often plastered to serve his domestic duties!When, at long last, father and son reach the office of the company that held the sweepstake, they are told that Dern's ticket was not in fact a winner but merely eligible for the final draw!; taking pity on the crushed old man, who has come a long way in vain, the female employee attending to them allows the duo to take a "Prize-Winner" cap! The son, then, realizing his old man's predicament, buys him a truck and an air compressor (lent to Keach some 40 years previously and never returned!) ? which is what he had intended acquiring with his winnings in the first place. One of the comic highlights here involve Dern's two sons forcing their way into what Squibb takes to be Keach's garage to take what belongs to their dad?only to be told a short while later it was probably the wrong address and nearly getting caught by the rightful owners upon trying to put it back! By the way, the film has been praised for its Oscar-nominated monochrome cinematography: though the small-town flavor is admirably captured by this stylistic decision, the resulting dreary look is far removed from the rich black-and-white one had gotten used to in Hollywood's golden age! Conversely, I am genuinely surprised that Mark Orton's atmospheric score ? alternately folksy and brassy ? has not been similarly shortlisted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's funnier than some of the comedies I saw in 2013 but I prefer Payne's films when they're tragic and sad too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne is one of the best filmmakers in the world. Few directors currently working are as skillful at balancing both comedic and dramatic tones in the same film. With a consistent writing partner in Jim Taylor, they've written four features together, he ensures that the screenplay is the forefront of his films. He understands comedy rarely stands alone. It is the magnification of the flaws of ordinary people that provides his films with a dramatic narrative line through even the smallest slice of life stories. He engages with themes concerning infidelity, dysfunctional families, and more broadly the failure of the American Dream. Seemingly tragic, these ideas are viewed through a lens that is highly satirical of American cultural and self-depreciating in its comedic voice. Payne was born in Nebraska, meaning there's a personal touch to the look and feel of this film. This is the first film Payne has directed without writing the screenplay himself. He was given first time screenwriter Bob Nelson's script over a decade ago. He resisted making the film immediately because he did not want to make another road movie in close proximity to About Schmidt and Sideways. It's not a coincidence that without Payne's prints on the screenplay that Nebraska is one of his weaker films. This isn't due to the film's minimalism. It was made on a budget of just thirteen million dollars. Payne also fought the film studio Paramount Pictures to have it shot in black and white too. It is because the lean story drifts, looking for dramatic and metaphorical significance, without achieving the emotional power of some of Payne's best and most tragic films.One of the bonuses of delaying the film though is that the narrative achieves contemporary economic relevancy. Nebraska is a state that is slowly recovering from the Global Financial Crisis. Its strengths are its manufacturing industry and food processing, with cattle being one of the defining financial components of its economy. The housing market is strong but it is not translating into job growth. Agriculture is also costly, with land prices rising by 25% in the last year. Farms that have been passed down between generations are being sold because people can no longer maintain them. This economic uncertainty is translated into the quest of Bruce Dern's character Woody, a fragile elderly man who is determined to take what he believes is a winning lottery ticket all the way to Nebraska. His wife (June Squibb) thinks he's mad and is disgusted when their son David (played by former Saturday Night Live comedian Will Forte) decides to go along with Woody's fantasy so that his father doesn't end up hurting himself. True to many of the cold, sparse and empty streets that David and Woody visit, the film seems uneventful and at times insubstantial in its highly linear trajectory. In the first half, there are endless shots of the wide open roads, as though Payne realised he had to fill in the time. The remainder of the film is a highly episodic, clich father and son bonding story. Payne himself has admittedly labelled it as corny. Woody and David visit several smoky diners, some bars, a cemetery and the house he grew up in. This supports Woody's backstory, including some bleak family history but it also makes the forward trajectory of the narrative and its dramatic peaks seem stilted. We learn he's not such a terrible father, much is made of his struggle to say no to people, and then David arranges to unselfishly repay him. Will Forte's character exists to mirror our emotions of rediscovering his father. Aside from his own relationship breakup, the character of David isn't as interesting, lacking the vividness of the leading men from Payne's other films. The desperation of the townsfolk, as they learn of Woody's fortune, is one of the stories most interesting layers but it's still treated lightly, without much heat. Payne still knows how to pitch the comedy at a quiet, deadpan level so that many of the film's jabs that the characters fire at each other are darkly funny. I especially liked a line where David declares that by the time his father manages to get his driver's license back he won't be on the road. The film's oldest leads in Bruce Dern and June Squibb feature strongly. Bruce Dern transcends visible acting techniques to immerse himself into Woody's physical and mental frailty as a man who is difficult to connect with. His own mind is quickly failing and no one can tell if he is stubborn or plain mad in his quest but he also displays a previously unknown selflessness. June Squibb injects her scenes with some hilarious verbal sparring. Her character has her own unexpectedly scandalous and colourful personal history. The film isn't a total misfire. Its sparseness is daring today and it's funnier than some of the comedies I saw in 2013 but I prefer Payne's films when they're tragic and sad too. It's his signature to express the pain of everyday life that resonates, not just light and quietly funny observational humour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne always injects a great dose of humor in his films and also thoroughly investigates the dramatic aspect of the main characters and their backgrounds. Nebraska certainly wasn't an exception and with its black and white format, it was a delightful, constantly funny and touching film. As usual, he manages to get the best efforts from the cast and even Will Forte, who is mostly known from his comedic work, gave a solid performance in a more serious role. Veterans Bruce Dern and June Squibb really shine here, displaying not only great comedic timing but also a nice emotional touch to their characters. Nebraska is a trip to the past, a journey of rediscovery, a story of redemption and the bonding of father and son, being very worthy of all the praise it's been receiving over the last months.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On 12/31/2013 my 17 year old son said to me and his mom, "I want to go see Nebraska tonight." That in and of itself should tell you enough about how beautiful and intoxicating this movie promises to be. It delivers on that promise................... The interesting thing about Nebraska is how - if you let it - the deep longings of each character can reflect your own life, even as the emotional and geographical landscape seems almost alien. For the first thirty minutes the introduction to the lives of these people is mostly shown through the places they inhabit. Each road, home and horizon echos the innermost emptiness of their lives. Slowly the dialog begins to mirror the surroundings and the tapestry of this family comes into sharp focus. As the geographical journey becomes more layered, the hopelessness of the trip to Lincoln, Nebraska is replaced by a deep knowledge that each of us simply needs to feel in some small way we have been known as a special member of our community. As the fathers fallacy unravels a new and surprising man comes to light through a history that is hardly even remembered. The moments of tenderness are profound, and the simple story - while keeping your heart at a steady pacing - also slowly and wonderfully extends our compassion. .................. Before the movie started we headed to the snack bar for popcorn, and my son commented that he was the only person in the audience under the age of 18. To which I replied "That's because you only watch good movies." He smiled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an allegory for a dying culture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I grew up in small-town Nebraska, and while Payne exaggerates some aspects of life there to the detriment of the region, there was enough unflinching honesty (in terms of images, language, and culture) to make me draw my breath in recognition of the film's daring. Payne (with his cinematographer) manages to capture both the magnificent beauty and the depressing ugliness of the area, the delicate feelings of some of the characters (the loving son and the fabulous newspaper editor) and the acidic bitterness of others (wow the mother is fantastic). To those who say the characters are unrealistic, I say: you haven't been there. I have older female relatives who could go toe to toe with the mother. And male relatives who look an awful lot like that array of guys in their chairs. What I see here is a question about how to heal some of the hurt and disappointment of life (including the disappointment of the fading one- time frontier). The answer is a tough one, provided by the son: just keep on being faithful and loving, when there doesn't seem to be anything to love. The big country is out there, and underneath all the tawdriness, it's still beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ties That Bind in the American Heartland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After stumbling a bit with "The Descendants," Alexander Payne has returned to top form with "Nebraska," easily one of his best films.Bruce Dern plays Woody Grant, a doddering, confused old man on the cusp of dementia, who's convinced that he's won $1,000,000 in a mail scam and determines to get to Lincoln, Nebraska (he lives in Montana) to claim his prize. His wife, played with deadpan hilarity by June Squibb, is done with him, as is his oldest son, played by Bob Odenkirk. They're tired of his antics and want to put him in a home. It falls to his youngest son, David, in an exceptional performance by Will Forte, to humor his dad and take him to Lincoln. David is no less frustrated with his father than anyone else ? he wasn't there for the boys when they were younger and their relationship is strained at best ? but he's in a funk of his own and the trip is a chance to do something, anything, to change the scenery.Bob Nelson, who wrote the screenplay, clearly understands the people and rhythms of rural American life. As Woody and David stop on their way to Lincoln to visit Woody's hometown and visit with their extended relatives, I was thinking, "These could be my relatives." And I imagine many people who watch this film will have a similar reaction. A tone of regret settles over the film as it unfolds, but one tinged with sweetness. Woody is lucid enough to miss his youth and the missed opportunities that have passed with it, including the chance to have been a better father. David regrets his dad's alcoholism and his indifference to having better relationships with his sons, but recognizes on their road trip together the opportunity to bond a little bit with his father and learn a little bit more about him and his own past. We know that this road trip is not going to result in David and Woody magically forging a strong father/son relationship (the world just doesn't work that way), but we're happy that they're able to connect even a little bit before it becomes too late to do so.More than anything, "Nebraska" is about the complications of family and the undeniable bonds that will make family members who don't even act like they like each other fight for each other when their family unit is threatened."Nebraska" reminded me a lot in visual style if not in tone of "The Last Picture Show," mostly thanks to the black and white cinematography of Phedon Papamichael, who's able to make images from the American heartland look like they belong on another planet.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alexander Payne Adds Another Excellent Film to His Resume</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With his first five films, director Alexander Payne has put us with the main characters as they go through their lives. Going from seeing Ruth caught up in a war between pro life and pro choice in Citizen Ruth, to seeing Miles spend a week with his best friend Jack before Jack gets married in Sideways, to witnessing Matt King decide on the fate of his land after finding out about his wife's infidelity in The Descendants. This time, Payne has put us with through a journey with a geriatric in his latest comedy-drama, Nebraska.Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) is an old man who lives in Billings, Montana. Woody has won a prize containing a million dollars. There's a catch: Woody has to go Lincoln, Nebraska and turn in his confirmation letter to claim his prize. He is determined to get there, even if he has to walk. He has even been stopped numerous times and it has driven his wife Kate (June Squibb) crazy. Woody's son David (Will Forte) reluctantly agrees to take him there, even though he thinks there is no million dollar prize. Payne has his film focused on Woody and David and their journey to Lincoln. Primarily, the film takes place in the small town of Hawthorne, Nebraska, where Woody is from and where his relatives live.Alexander Payne has been an excellent director and continues to show his excellence with Nebraska. Payne does a great job of having what is important to each scene and pointing the camera to what is crucial to the film. Payne does some nice work with shot selection and keeping the story interesting, funny, and having a nice pace.Bruce Dern stands out in every way possible. With the role of Woody Grant, Dern makes him more than a geriatric who is determined to claim his prize. Dern shows us a man who has lived a long life, who can be very funny, but there are times where we don't know if Woody is even listening to anyone else. Dern takes this role of Woody and makes him into a likable, three dimensional character. Will Forte plays Woody's son David. David takes time off his job to spend time with his father. Forte is primarily known for laugh out loud comedy films such as The Watch and That's My Boy. With this role, Forte trades some of that comedy and shows us that he is capable of doing drama. Forte also gives us a guy who is frustrated at his father's actions, but at the same time cares about his old man. June Squibb knocks the role of Kate Grant out of the park. She plays Woody's annoyed and frustrated wife, and plays the role of a crabby old lady who is annoyed at her husband's actions and always speaks her mind. I like how Dern, Forte, and Squibb let all of their emotions out there and not hold back.The rest of the cast all do fine jobs in their parts. From a technical standpoint, the best aspect is the beautiful cinematography by the Director of Photography, Phedon Papamichael. Papamichael captures very beautiful shots of the scenery when Woody and David are on the road and also does great work with the camera in capturing the small town and making me feel like I am there. Mark Orton does a nice job with putting in a country score that fits with the atmosphere Papamichael captured on camera. Kevin Tent does a nice job of putting the film together and getting the cuts just right. Bob Nelson wrote the script and does a nice job of making Nebraska as more than a father and son road trip movie. Nelson also does a great job of writing the characters so the actors can develop them and show their talents. The rest of the ensemble cast does a nice job of fitting their roles just right as Payne has an eye for having the right people play each character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you may (or may not) infer, the subject of Nebraska may well be Nebraska. In particular, the collision between the two connotations of the state that make it a useful emblem for current as a whole.Or as a hole. The black and white wide screen photography expresses the state's openness. The space isolates its inhabitants and embodies the bleakness of its mundane lives ? but director Alexander Payne finds a remnant beauty there still. There's a tension between the vastness of the space and the narrowness of its characters' lives. Hence the Hawthorne, Nebraska, Grant family scenes, glued brain-dead to the TV, their terse conversations proof that these still waters run shallow. Despite all that emptiness Nebraska is also known for the remarkable volume and variety of celebrities it has produced. Not just dolts like L. Ron Hubbard, Dick Cheney and Gerald Ford but national icons like Johnny Carson, Dick Cavett, the Astaires, Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, etc. From such an unpromising landscape, such success has arisen. That, in a nutshell, is the American Dream, which promises that a magnificent life can be achieved there through hard work and freedom. As wife Kate (June Squibb) contends:"I never knew the son of a bitch even wanted to be a millionaire! He should have thought about that years ago and worked for it! " But he didn't. Instead a come-on seduces him into another surviving myth, American exceptionalism. Without any effort on his part, for no reason, Woody believes he has won a million dollars. His certainty wards off everyone else's logic and argument. Woody's stubbornness, Alzheimerian obliviousness to reality, and sense of personal due effectively represents the Tea Party Republican's delusion of a long-past power and authority. David gains some insight into his father from Woody's old girlfriend Peg (Angela McEwan), who now runs her dead husband's newspaper. Clearly an attractive, sensible woman, she was attracted to Woody and cares for him still. There's a distinct wistfulness when she sees him driving away. But she lost him to Kate by refusing to let him round the bases with her. Kate was not so restrained so won the husband she now suffers and berates. But her love is evidenced when she tenderly kisses the comatose man in the hospital. What makes Kate the film's most compelling and positive character is her earthy realism. There are no airs or delusions about her. She did what she had to to win Woody and she does what she must to preserve him. That no-nonsense realism is confirmed when she flashes at a suitor's grave "what you could have had if you hadn't kept talking about grain" and when she gives her inlaws her climactic instruction ("Go ? yourselves"). She liked Woody's little sister Rose, "but my god, she was a slut." Kate refuses to honey coat reality. Indeed David is often embarrassed by his mother's earthy candour:? Jesus Mom! Was the whole town trying to seduce you?? These boys grow up staring at the rear ends of cows and pigs, it's only natural that a real woman will get them chafing their pants. Not just a real woman, Kate is a real Nebraskan, a real American. She is the honest and positive alternative to the Republicans' moral pretensions. Her realism is the bracing model for her corrupt inlaws and her country in its present state. for more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mom's mad at dad again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>a frighteningly and hilariously uncomfortable observance of the personal and sexual politics among family and community in a classic mid-western setting: an eternal struggle between taciturn men and their fiery wives who have to talk sense to them in short, vitriolic diatribes to keep the bullies, louts and drunkards in check. It's long and meandering but well worth it for the cathartic recognition of the kind of repressed yet angry passion that have ensnared many of us for much of our lives. On a softer side, a touching look at a man's attempt to connect with his aging alcoholic father and a journey of family discovery both light and dark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great, late-career performance by an actor Hollywood never really knew what to do with.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not all that surprising that it has taken 50 years for Bruce Dern to find a role that fits him like a glove.&nbsp;Here is an actor that Hollywood never really knew what to do with.&nbsp;He is an intense actor whose characters were always burning with a level of frustration that kept you at arm's length.&nbsp;He was too unpredictable and strange to be a leading man, so he took supporting roles in films like "Coming Home" and "The Great Gatsby."&nbsp;Yet, he always seemed to stand outside those films.&nbsp;There was a creepy quality about him that didn't fit any form outside of imploding villains.&nbsp;He admitted recently in a recent interview that after killing John Wayne in 1972's "The Cowboys" and then attempting to blow up the Super Bowl in 1977's "Black Sunday" that he really had nowhere to go.Now, at 77, Dern has finally found a role that not only fits him like a glove, but got him the Palm D'Or last spring at the Cannes Film Festival.&nbsp;In Alexander Payne's funny and emotionally tender black and White mid-western comedy "Nebraska", he plays Woody Grant, a grouchy old coot with a wisp of unkempt white hair who becomes hell-bent on getting from Montana to Nebraska to claim a million dollars after receiving one of those "You May Have Already Won" scam letter designed to sell magazines.&nbsp;Despite all common sense ? and a reasoning explanation from his son David (played by Will Forte in a wonderfully understated performance) ? he heads out a fruitless, 850 mile trek to claim his prize money.&nbsp;David, knowing that it is a trip to nowhere, figures that it might be great to spend a couple of days with dear old dad, and decides to drive him.Woody's motivation is more or less based on a blind trust.&nbsp;At 77, he's part of the heartland take-people-at-their-word generation.&nbsp;He believes what people tell him, and when someone says he has won a million dollars, he thinks it might be rude not to check it out.&nbsp;At home, he has no earthly reason to hang around the house.&nbsp;His wife is Kate (June Squibb) is a loud-mouthed battle-axe who never stops talking, and worse, decides to join them.&nbsp;A great deal of her behavior explains a great deal of Woody's.Payne has found a gem in Bruce Dern, who is a wonderful case of the right actor in the right role, and if he had to wait until he was 77 to play it, it was worth the wait.&nbsp;Woody's mind seems to have been disillusioned by his trustworthy upbringing mixed with a world that refuses to play fair.&nbsp;He wants to be trustworthy, but he has reached the age at which he has outlived all the tricks and all the games people play and has worn down to a man for whom good fortune is a mere a concept.Dern has moments in the film in which his face speaks volumes even when he doesn't say a word.&nbsp;Note, for example, a scene in which the family visits an old cemetery;&nbsp;June tells David the identity of each headstone.&nbsp;Behind them stands Woody whose face is haunted by a memory of a younger brother that died in infancy.&nbsp;Visiting his old boyhood home, there something sad in Woody's eyes when he remembers being punished for walking into his parent's bedroom.&nbsp;What is special here is that Dern can tells us everything we need to know with just a few words, or in most cases, no words at all.&nbsp;It's that good of a performance.The movie was directed by Alexander Payne who specializes in telling laid back stories about people with problems who come to understand the future only by what has come before.&nbsp;He previously made "Sideways", "About Schmidt", "The Descendents" and the criminally underrated "Election", which featured Reese Witherspoon's best performance.&nbsp;Here he puts together a film in which the characters are built on words.&nbsp;Listen very carefully to the dialogue and notice how different conversations deepen our knowledge of the characters beyond just their immediate circumstances.&nbsp;One conversation gives us a little information about Woody and Kate, and then another conversation later by a different person gives us more information.&nbsp;By the end, we feel that we know their background through the dialogue.&nbsp;This is a smartly written film that pays off beautifully in a scene that is based on blind deception that the movie has been building all along.&nbsp;This movie is as much a pleasure to listen to as it is to watch.**** (of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Forte is the star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alertIt is about as un-Hollywood as a movie could be. More like an indie.Filmed in B&amp;W (or as one know it all said on IMDb they just moved color saturation down to zero) so there was no being distracted by 'oh wow...look at the sunset'. But just like in 'The Artist', once you got used to no color, it became rather liberating.It left you with no distractions. No 'pretty' scenery to let your mind drift away from what was playing out on the screen.No sir, what was left on the screen was plain, simple and bleak. This added to the feeling of being stuck in a no name town in a no name job (those that had jobs...'Cole' didn't have a job because he had been in jail for 'rape' according to 'Kate Grant'...'it wasn't rape, it was sexual assault' screams Cole's mother, 'Aunt Martha'.)Bruce Dern's wife played by June Squibb tried too hard to make it look like she wasn't acting and got lines that felt forced like when she remembered telling her mother-in-law that she was a city girl so wasn't going to be milking no cows.As did the dialogue at the family grave site where Kate tells David about Woody's sister who slept around. This appears to have been added only to add some comedic lines . Will Forte is the story here...brilliant acting in that it was non- acting.He was the patient son of ageing parents with an alcoholic father who was a man of few words and fewer emotions (my FIL was an alcoholic so the look and actions and single mindedness were very familiar to me). One review said Bruce Dern didn't actually act...he stayed still while those around him acted. That may be so but when the 'light went on' in the last 10 minutes of the show, his eyes came alive, his breathing changed and he WAS Woody Grant, a new man with a purpose and dignity now that he had his prize.It was neat to see Will Forte in a serious role..I kept waiting for a look or comment in SNL style but he held true to form. He ended up going on a journey with his father and discovered things he never knew about him...from other people. Reminded me of how little I know about my dad's life because he too was a non talker.We saw a matine in a city in the sun belt and the other three dozen patrons were retirees like us. They enjoyed it. This is a movie the critics will love but perhaps not the box office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie of reflection and memory proving that life does age and pass still look back on it thru a trip!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you watch Alexander Payne films you know that most are about life, family and dealing with the pain and problems of the everyday world. And most of his works include a journey and travel mostly the theme of self discovery and self finding. With this work "Nebraska" the film is a journey a travel which brings the past and memories back to one old aging old man named Woody Grant(wonderful work from veteran Bruce Dern known from"King of the Marvin Gardens"). Woody thinks he's won it all when he gets a million dollar sweepstakes letter in the mail. So from Montana he takes a road trip with his son David(Will Forte)it's to his old haunts of Nebraska for him to claim the prize. Along the way Woody meets his family and friends from the past it's a time to reflect and feel thru a journey of lost love while looking for new hope and the want to feel young again. Still Woody doesn't change his ways as the beer drinking and hard headed ways continue as his high strong wife Kate(June Squibb)is enough to handle. In the end this film feels strong and touching with a sentimental feel as a father and son find meaning and connection as "Nebraska" is one film to watch for reflection and living life out toward the end on a road journey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>he sometimes tends towards clich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne undoubtedly has his fans and I feel that his films turn out pretty much the way he intended. It's just that I either prefer my films a little more eventful or challenging or, on the other hand, more thoughtful and meaningful. Payne is clearly fascinated with the 'taken for granted' things in life. Not big on philosophy or exploitation he is more interested in character studies of the ordinary. Unfortunately I think he sometimes tends towards clich and even to making fun of the very people he is supposedly fascinated by. This begins in an amusing enough way as Dern's character keeps wandering off, ostensibly to collect his prize, but as the film progresses (if indeed it ever does!) I found that staring at people staring back or at the TV, less than appealing and not very funny. Seems to me it's not difficult to make small town America look dreadful and to make some of its less well off inhabitants much the same. You can tell I didn't find this a bundle of fun, nevertheless, it just about held my attention and Bruce Dern and June Squibb do very well and I was delighted to see the much underrated Stacy Keach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sharply Observed Character Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in black-and-white in homage to the classical Hollywood era, NEBRASKA is a highly superior road movie. The plot is straightforward enough: Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) travels from Montana to Nebraska with his son David (Will Forte) to claim a $1m dollar prize that Woody believes he has won in a sweep-stake. This is nothing more than an illusion, but David understands how important it is for Woody to make the journey as a way of sustaining his self-esteem. Director Alexander Payne's film is a sharply observed character-study: Woody might have had a dissolute existence in the past, but he is now frail and often dgag (probably in the early stages of Alzheimer's). As the journey unfolds, so he and his immediate family grow closer together; his wife Kate (June Squibb) starts to care for him more, while David's elder brother Ross (Bob Odenkirk) takes a break from a burgeoning career as a television anchor person to help his father right a long-standing wrong committed by Woody's so-called 'friend' Ed Pegram (Stacy Keach). Phedon Papamichael's cinematography, shot in widescreen, captures the desolation of the landscape and the loneliness of the Grant family's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska: no one walks the streets, while the bars are populated by a few elderly men and women. This environment embodies Woody's outlook on life; he is a lost soul, imprisoned by loneliness and unable (or unwilling) to communicate his thoughts to anyone. Nonetheless he retains a certain stoicism which ultimately proves admirable. The film has a happy ending, which we feel Woody somehow deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Pick For Best Film of 2013</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a year that saw the release of an unusual number of good movies, I finally only just caught up with Nebraska tonight and I was stunned. Having been a fan of Alexander Payne for a long time, I expected it to be good, but this is easily his best film by far. It is just about perfect in every way: direction, script, cinematography, music, and, yes, acting. Sure, Bruce Dern and June Squibb deserve the plaudits they've received, but I also want to give high marks to Will Forte, who I really didn't think had it in him, but who gives as good a performance as anyone else in the picture. His character is a good son trying to deal with a difficult parent who in the end achieves a kind of grace. A deeply moving, very touching film, without a false or overly sentimental note in it. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A road-movie from a master movie maker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne could now best be described as a world-class director whose every film is an event to look forward to and to celebrate and to paraphrase John Ford when he said "I make westerns", Payne could just as easily say "I make road-movies", and he makes road-movies unlike anyone else. Like Ford, Payne's films deal with small people in large landscapes coping with the daily grind of the mundane, the comical and the tragic. Death, loss and regret figure prominently in Payne's landscape but he handles these subjects with a remarkable lightness of touch and his films deal with journeys, both literal and metaphorical, that end in an epiphany.In Payne's latest film, "Nebraska", the journey is of a father and son, (and latterly a mother), back to the place of the father's upbringing. But this is no nostalgic bonding exercise; the father, (a magnificent Bruce Dern, in a career-defining performance), believes he has won a million dollars and must travel to Lincoln, Nebraska to claim his prize. The son knows it's all a scam but indulges his father's whim and drives him there, mostly because there is nothing much else going on in his life. The journey, like the journeys in "About Schmidt", "Sideways" and "The Descendants" is, of course, about more than the literal travelling from one place to another and about moving to another place within ourselves that we had either lost or have yet to find. Dern is a simple man who believes anything he is told and everyone who tells him. Consequently he is taken advantage of by everyone around him and it's only his son, (a lovely, subdued Will Forte), who is prepared to tell him the truth yet even he is prepared to hide those truths that he knows will hurt his father.In dramatic terms not a great deal happens yet you could say all human life is here. Most of the characters are old and have lived lives of little consequence in the greater scheme of things yet they are mostly happy. They haven't missed what they haven't had. Life hasn't passed them by; it's just something they've observed from the sidelines and a million dollars will buy Dern the new truck he has always wanted and the compressor he gave to an old friend thirty years before. That's all a million dollars means to him.It is, of course, a comedy; as funny and as sad as "About Schmidt" and "The Descendants" and like those films the humour is largely organic, stemming from the characters and not the situations. There are scenes that are laugh-out-loud funny while others will move you to tears and it's beautifully written, (by Bob Nelson), and played, not just by Dern and Forte but also by June Squibb, (Nicholson's wife in "About Schmidt"), as the foul-mouthed mother, Stacy Keach, in a stunning return to form, as Dern's old friend and nemesis and a whole load of faces so lived in they don't seem to belong to actors but the people they are playing.Payne chose to shoot "Nebraska" in monochrome, conjuring up images and memories of a past literal and cinematic. In that respect it sits well beside Bogdanovitch's tributes to Ford and earlier cinema, "Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" as well as a number of classic Ford films going all the way back to "The Grapes of Wrath". It's as good as anything I've seen this year and it confirms Payne as a master.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The road trip movie is an expression of an existential bleakness of life. Story of an elderly man with perhaps a mild case of dementia goes on a road trip with his son to claim what he thinks is a winning ticket of a million dollars but the ticket is in actuality an advertising come-on . The central part of the story is a stop in a small town in Nebraska where the father grew up. Showcased is the spiritual nowhereness of these people in the town mostly consisting of the man's extended family. They are living nowhere of consequence, they don't really communicate about anything interesting or of relevance and they are likely going nowhere. It seemed perhaps the impetus was this man's break against these themes he lived with his whole life since he is trying to grab onto something and get something (the million dollar winning. This is not to say that the film is not entertaining since infused within it is distinct very dark humor and very interesting characters.The ordinary/realistic look of the characters surprisingly draws you into them more than familiar faces do. We are presented with fun realistically conceived main characters highlighted by the mother. Her raw essence expressed through her off-color, blunt and uninhibited comments amusingly stole the scenes.The road trip takes us from Billings Montana to Lincoln Nebraska. The naturalism of the sets and people freshly created an immersion into mid-American blandness. It was refreshing and a bit of a novelty to portray realistic settings of these cities and towns. The bleak environs of the road from Billings to Lincoln, the utter mediocrity of the cities, towns and environment created a visually moody empty beauty as though the feeling of time is slipping away from these middle age or mostly elderly characters. The existential sensation was felt as questions arise concerning whether or not it really matters that time is slipping away. The use of black and white wisely further emphasized the world without color further adding to the essential emptiness that was exposed within the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alexander Payne has done it again. He has an excellent command of emotions , be it between best friends (Sideways), father and daughter (Descendants)or between sons and aged father. Nebraska is about a son David grant who goes all the way to fulfill every desire of his aged father Woody Grant. Drives from Montana to Nebraska so dad can hear with his own ears that he did not win a million dollars. Bruce Dern as Woody Grant , is the aged father of 2 nice adult sons Ross( Bob Odenkirk..from breaking bad)and David. Woody comes from a family of who do nothing much , say a few words and sit and watch TV. Woody manages to leave Nebraska and settle in Montana. But now en route to getting his million dollars , he and his son David spend time with his family in Nebraska. June Squibb as Woody's wife Kate and son Ross join them in Nebraska for unplanned family reunion. Kate is loud, talkative, rude and makes fun of her old husband wanting a million dollars. But she is full of memories and identifies every family member in the family cemetery. Woody and June are husband and wife for years and June knows her husband's family very well. the last scenes are handled very well. especially with Woody driving a new truck and making sure his adult son David is not seen as front seat passenger guiding his old , fragile, shaky hands. There is self pride and joy in all humans, old and the young. Bruce Dern as Woody is excellent and Will Forte as David, younger son , expresses his love for his father very well in both words and actions. June Squibb as loud woman but an extremely caring wife is terrific. Bob Odenkirk is good. Sometimes silence is too long. Other than editing, Nebraska is definitely Oscar worthy, for Direction and for acting. Will Forte , Bruce Dern and June Squibb did very well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This poignant journey of life and family is perhaps Payne's most accessible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aging is hard, as it accepting your lot in life. "Nebraska" adds another poignant story about life's tragic beauty to Alexander Payne's filmography and it's likely the most universally accessible of all his previous efforts.Whereas his last film, the 2011 Best Screenplay winner "The Descendants," drew some criticism for being overly depressing, "Nebraska" has sadder moments but is much lighter in subject matter. Don't let Payne's choice to film in black and white fool you: this is a contemporary film that will connect with adults of all ages.Bruce Dern and Will Forte star as father and son, Woody and David Grant, who set out from their hometown of Billings, Mont. after Woody receives a marketing sweepstakes letter telling him he's won $1 million, though he has to go to Lincoln, Neb. to cash it. The prize is obviously a scam, but when Woody keeps sneaking out of the house in attempt to walk all the way to Lincoln, David thinks maybe a little road trip would be good for both of them. On the way, however, they're forced to detour through the Nebraska town where Woody grew up.Small-town jokes, sarcasm and senility humor abound, but both Payne and this spot-on script from Bob Nelson (HBO's "Hung") always keep the futility of this quest in perspective, and the time-tested theme of "it's about the journey, not the destination" informs the plot's many twists and turns, as does the basic human desire of having something to live for.When all of Woody's hometown friends and relatives hear that he's won a million dollars, they take immediate interest in his return to town. His similarly quiet and stubborn brothers, former business partner (Stacy Keach)and former girlfriend all come into the picture, and then there's the relationship between Woody and David, which goes through its own rigmarole. Woody has been an alcoholic in denial for most of his life, who never developed a relationship with his kids (David's brother is played by "Breaking Bad" star Bob Odenkirk)and from what we can tell, spent most of his life indifferent if not regretting his marriage to Kate (June Squibb), who lambastes him at every possible moment for being useless, crazy and stubborn, like an all-too-familiar grandmother figure.Dern's portrayal of Woody is scary authentic. Most great performances have some kind of emotional, dramatic heft to them. Dern stays true to the inexpressive nature of his character, yet watching him you can see the seasons and the life experiences and the underlying emotion, the hardship and the regret, even though we only learn of it through dialogue or stories from other characters who knew Woody way back when. He does so much with silence and short, curt responses and that has a dramatic power of its own.Squibb as his wife Kate is absolutely hysterical as whip-smart elderly woman with a great memory and no filter along with the most brutally honest opinions you can imagine. Nelson writes her some outstanding dialogue, but she sells it. Payne, of course, is known for getting outstanding stuff from his cast. How many others could cast Saturday Night Live alumnus Will Forte ("MacGruber") and still have their film considered among the year's best? Music and scenery play a huge role in this film as with Payne's previous work. The black and white seems like a curious decision, and though it's hard to argue that it was 100 percent necessary, it certainly adds to the nostalgic moments of the film such as when Woody, David and family explore parts of Woody's past. Mark Orton's score also adds so much to the poignancy of a film that has nothing but images of flat, rural Nebraska to try and elicit an emotional response from its audience.At times loud and hysterical and at others quiet and sad, but so is "Nebraska" captures so much of this duality that's so true of life itself. The longing of a child to connect with and understand a parent, and the longing of a man in the twilight of his life to find fulfillment are universal sentiments true of the young and the old. "Nebraska" certainly isn't the flashiest or most exciting of dramatic comedies, but Payne hits all the right emotional notes with his film's simplicity.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

		<fullReview>. . . sums up the current release NEBRASKA best. That's shorthand for saying the writing is wonderful, the movie is hilarious, the Midwestern characters are priceless, the plot keeps you guessing, and the agricultural dystopia is convincing (enhanced by director Alexander Payne following in the footsteps of Peter Bogdanovich 40 years ago in my neck of the woods, when Pete shot THE LAST PICTURE SHOW in black and white to emphasize that the "glory days" of small-town America are long gone forever, if they ever existed in the first place). Bruce Dern nails his role as father of two, Woody, a halfway absent dementia sufferer focused on a single idea (not unlike Christopher Walken's character in SWEET AND LOW, but further out of sync with reality). Will Forte plays the younger son, David, with a heart of platinum, attaining heroic stature by story's end. June Squibb is a hoot as Woody's sharp-tongued spouse (and David's not-quite-doting mom), Kate. The rest of the supporting cast is equally superb, and the tale is devoid of false notes, cheap sentimentality, or Deus ex Machina. If you see NEBRASKA, you'll never again look on Grandma's magazine sweepstakes offers as just "innocent junk mail."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tripping To Bountiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a superficial level this could be described as a male version of Horton Foote's The Trip To Bountiful; both feature senior citizens set on making a journey with joy, pleasure, happiness, at the destination, both journeys doomed to end in disappointment and each involving a son of the senior traveller, and, if it comes to it, the Texas of Bountiful is in roughly the same half of the country as the Nebraska of Lincoln. The comparison holds in the sense that both films share outstanding screenplays, directing and acting but sooner or later they need to be acknowledged and discussed as separate films. The protagonist in Bountiful - which began life as a stage play as opposed to Nebraska which was written directly for the screen - who had clearly never read Thomas Wolfe - had a long established yearning to get to Bountiful which was her childhood home whilst the protagonist in Nebraska has expressed a desire to go to Lincoln for only a short time, since, in fact, he fell for a scam and fully believes that in Lincoln he will find a check for one million dollars with his name on it. This is a film of observation and not only that but a film in which virtually every character seems to be a real person taking part in a documentary rather than a Fictional feature film. I suspect that this will be more convincing in England where although the second male lead has an impressive track record it is 95% in television shows such as Saturday Night Live which are not screened on terrestrial channels here. This is an excellent film which deserves to find its audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alexander Payne does it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that "Sideways" will always be my favorite Alexander Payne film, because it was just so perfect in every possible way. But I, like most people reading this, have learned my lesson over the years being quick to highly recommend a movie that I love only to find that it fell completely flat for someone else. I feel that might be the case with "Nebraska" because there is a large segment of the population who say they want to go to the movies to be "entertained", and would find this film really depressing, with unlikeable characters in uncomfortable situations.I, on the other hand, go to the movies to be told a good story -- and I really don't need every loose end tied up with a bow or to leave the theater with a spring in my step. For that reason, I loved "Nebraska", and thought it told a pretty realistic tale in a sort of Fargo-meets-About Schmidt kind of way. Yes, the characters were quirky and somewhat stereotypical, but hell -- I grew up in Wisconsin, and I can tell you, some of those people and the lives they led were pretty spot-on. And, at the end of the day, it did have a nice conclusion in that Will Forte's character got to do something nice for his dad and I don't think it went completely unappreciated. If you caught the quick, stolen glance that Bruce Dern gives Will Forte as the two are driving away from the dealership in the new truck, you might agree.It goes without saying that the acting, cinematography and art direction are really top-notch, and added a lot to the film's overall effect. I would expect a slew of Oscar nominations -- and with an extremely strong Best Actor field this year (Robert Redford in "All is Lost", Forrest Whitaker in "The Butler", Chiwetl Ejiofor in "12 Years a Slave", to name a few) Bruce Dern will definitely be in contention to take home the top prize. I hope that Academy voters will also recognize Will Forte and June Squibb in their supporting roles, but it has been an unusually strong film year so the competition will be tight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The black and white filming . . . only left me guessing what season of the year this happened.The lead actors were professional.However the character portrayal of middle Americans is close minded and nasty. Nebraskan's are owed a huge apology from the writer. Many family scenes were out of order, so the story line lacked clarity.The critics ratings were so far out of line, they must have been paid to give this thing a high rating?Camera shot angles were above average. Alcohol, family culture and social economical problems are the focus?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reat the screenplay- SKIP the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Nelson wrote a really fantastic screenplay, "Nebraska." But the buck stopped there. Alexander Payne botched this production hard.For some reason, Payne decided to cast Will Forte as the lead. I have never seen an actor fail so badly in a high profile (6 time Academy Award nominated) film. You can really see Forte trying to act. He has absolutely no screen presence and not one time was he ever in the moment. What's worse- the costars are worse than Forte! Much worse. It's actually remarkable that Payne managed to mis-cast this film to such an extraordinary degree. It's almost as if Payne went into the town of Hawthorne, Nebraska and asked random town folk if they wanted to be in a movie to sell the realism. But even more embarrassingly, half of the cast are seasoned actors... like the kid who played McCully Culkin's brother Buzz in Home Alone. What a joke.Nebraska looks like a decent student film. Not a great student film, but a half way decent one. Yes, Payne shows his "world" of the midwest like he always does, and the cinematography and music are great (par for ANY Hollywood film). But if it wasn't for the great Bruce Dern, this film wouldn't have been nominated for f### all.Save your money. Download the screenplay for free and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alexander Payne's mid west bittersweet suite</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nebraska is not the first time that Alexander Payne has put his attention to small-town minutiae and tragic-comic discontent in the middle of the country (and in his native state ), but what it has in common with his About Schmidt mostly starts and stops with it being about an older man with a screwy family (don't we all have 'em?). The unique tenderness felt here about a man duped?or just stubbornly hoping against all other logical odds?that he's won a million dollars comes from Bob Nelson's script, which understands how much resentment and petty vibes nestle under the surface. After taking on memorable roles for 50 years, Bruce Dern (remember him in Marnie?) plays Woody Grant, a hard drinking (even, especially, in his 70's), short-sentence-speaking man, as a man who has so much pain and sorrow under the surface (so much so he hides it with gruff words and actual dissonance as a hard-hearing old man to son Will Forte, also a great player unexpectedly) and such an inner life that he is more than just an irascible old-timer.Nebraska is a fine film about a father and son coming closer together and a better, even masterful film about what it is to be a man, with an ending that is both funny and brings one to tears at the same time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashes of talent throughout...yet the scenario is emotionally stunted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Alexander Payne's film about an old coot in Montana, hard-headed and a heavy drinker, is visually expressive yet it isn't very rewarding emotionally. The elderly protagonist is determined to get to Nebraska to collect what he believes is a million dollar pay-out in prize money; one of his two sons decides to "call in sick" at work and drive him there, figuring there isn't much time left for he and his father to share. Will Forte gives a beautifully restrained performance as the faithful, loyal son who very much wants to leave his neglected childhood behind him (we watch the picture through his eyes), but screenwriter Bob Nelson seems more interested in the stubborn, hen-pecked oldster (Bruce Dern) and his grating wife (June Squibb); how one ultimately responds to the film may relate directly to these two (I couldn't stand either one of them). Worse, an extended stay at the home of relatives bogs the movie down in ungainly caricature, with absurdist visual humor both ugly and unfunny (as if Diane Arbus suddenly took over behind the camera). The finale is gently effective, providing a nice ripple of feeling, but a great deal of "Nebraska" flat-lines. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Midwest looks miserable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would've been easy for Alexander Payne to use "Nebraska" to make fun of its elderly protagonist. But Payne did the smart thing and depicted him as forgetful but good-hearted. Bruce Dern and former "Saturday Night Live" cast member Will Forte play a father and son who travel from Billings, Montana to Lincoln, Nebraska where the dad expects to claim a prize. They stop in Hawthorne, Nebraska, where some old wounds among family and friends get opened.The black-and-white cinematography helps emphasize the bleakness of both the land and the characters' existence. Hawthorne looks like a REALLY miserable place, the sort of town where there's nothing for anyone to do except go to bars. But Payne does a great job showing all of this. The movie has some very funny lines. It's a perfect movie in every way. So far I've liked every one of Payne's movies, and this adds to it. I recommend it to everyone, and I recommend Dern and Forte - as well as June Squibb as Dern's wife - for Oscar nods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne, in my opinion, has never made a bad film. From Election, About Schmidt, Sideways, to The Descendants, Payne has mastered the genre referred to as Dramedies. His new film Nebraska never falls short, and has one of my favorite performances of the year.Woody Grant (Bruce Dern) believes he has won a million dollars. His wife Kate (June Squibb), and his two sons David (Will Forte) and Ross (Bob Odenkirk), all know its a scam. They try to tell Woody but, Woody won' t listen, and wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska to collect his winnings. David and Woody then drive from Billings, Montana to Nebraska, while encountering old friends and family. Bruce Dern gives his best performance of his career. Dern fully envelops a style, a walk, and mannerisms for Woody, and you can see it in every frame. It's rare that you can point that stuff out about a performance. Don't get me wrong, I know that there are plenty of exceptional actors, but there is something truly special about Derns performance. He deserves a nomination. June Squibb is annoyingly perfect as the mother and wife, always nit- picking, but she is hilarious, and unlike her brief role in About Schmidt, Squibb soars on screen.Will Forte is perfect as a the former alcoholic, now straight-laced son. Forte has an off beat way about his acting, but I think he will be extremely successful in the future, if he continues to do more dramas. Bob Odenkirk, although the role is limited, Odenkirk delivers some huge laughs.Alexander Payne chose to film in black and white, and it looks incredibly beautiful. The black and white contrasts the vast, empty landscape perfectly. Payne has made another fantastic film. Might not do as well as The Descendants did for him a few years ago, but I believe critically this film will do well, might be hard for the general audience though. I give Nebraska a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misleading and Depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, Alexander Payne is from Omaha, he grew up in Dundee about 3 houses away from Warren Buffet. That might officially be in the same state as some of these small towns in the movie, but that's about all it has in common. I will grant him that small-towners are now poorer and no longer have good manners like they did 25 years ago. Thanks to liberals many small towns are full of deadbeats waiting for a handout. This movie does show how fat people are in rural areas. I really didn't think the old people talking crudely was that funny because it's so common place now. American small towns used to be special places, now thanks to government checks and TV, they are depressing hellholes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nebraska is slow &amp; old but written well in black and white.,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you watch a movie that's filmed in black and white you can expect hidden meaning and purpose. Nebraska would of been allot better filmed in color to keep it from looking like The Last Picture Show. The slow pace of the story needs a pick up that the dull humor can't make up, even though it did get laughs from the audience. With that said, the acting and story line are good but I need to stay awake to see the whole movie. But the characters really attack my intelligence all the way from Billings, Montana to Nebraska with what appears to be pure ignorance or lack of common sense. There's only so much small town living I can take at one time. Its worth seeing once but only once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insult to America's Heartland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect in this film but given the Oscar buzz and the quality of the cast and crew, I thought it would be worth seeing. The performances are magnificent, true. Will Forte steals the movie. Bruce Dern, Bob Odenkirk, et.al. are all wonderful. But this movie is just downright insulting to anyone over 60 and to everyone born and bred in America's heartland.The screenplay defines "elitism." The screenwriter is obviously soooo superior to these folks. My guess is that whomever penned this (and this goes to Alexander Payne too) rarely sets foot out of Los Angeles. They are sooo much smarter than the folks in the "middle" of the USA about which they obviously know nothing.Not everyone over 60 or who lives in America's heartland is a complete idiot, but you wouldn't know it from this movie. They never read a newspaper or a magazine; they have no Internet; and they watch television, but have no idea what is being transmitted. They're all greedy and ignorant. The family relationships are all superficial or full of scorn. The only laughter is at someone else's expense. The Will Forte character is the only one who has a genuine human emotion, but in this movie, it is only a plot device.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Mo.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What year does this story take place? It starts with a retro Paramount logo that seemed vintage 60's. it was shot digitally in black and white with graininess added. There are no computers or cel phones but there seemed to be flat screen TV in the appliance store. The guys are sitting around watching football and the audio clearly says "after further review" which didn't start until the mid 80's. Forget these problems? You have to do something while watching paint dry.Granted Bruce Dern gives a noteworthy performance as an old coot. What's the stretch? The sons are convincing. There are a few nice moments. Some of the humor works. Caring for the elderly not quite at the level of "Where's Poppa" may not be funny for those with the real life experience.No reason to see this in a theater it will be just as slow if you watch it from your sofa. If you are looking for a state titled movie, try "Oklahoma".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rubbish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alexander Payne- what is he doing anymore? Had low hopes for it after The Descendants but this is literally a movie about nothing. No plot. No plot points. Just meanders from one hackneyed situation to another, centered around an unlikeable, irascible old misanthrope and his reluctant, unmotivated son. Believe me: I love Bruce Dern. He does nothing here but grunt and look bewildered. Will Forte gives a gutsy performance with out benefit of a character. June Squibb is a caricature with a couple amusing moments. Worst of all, the story asks me to believe Bruce Dern is so out of touch that he thinks he won a million dollars in a scam. I mean, I was waiting for him to come out of this fog and give me something relatable, something real, anything. Instead, his son just puts up with this guy and learns nothing substantial except the old man probably has early stage Alzheimers. A joke that people pass this off as a tone poem. It's sloppy writing. See Last Picture Show if you want a movie about the changing times, aging, and western America. 4 stars thanks to nice photography and a good Forte.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreary.. like watching paint dry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie is like watching paint dry. It is slow, boring, and the story sucks. Its like watching a dysfunctional Leave It To Beaver show. There was a lot of wasted filming making the scenes more dreary than they were. Some might say this movie was a statement about out society, but those are the same people who have no life and will think this is a good movie. Those that think this was a wonderful movie must have been watching it while on their meds. Have no idea why they thought Bruce Dern deserved an Oscar for best acting, while he was good as was his wife, the other actors were awful. It was similar to watching high school students acting in a play. Hollywood might like movies like this, since they love dysfunctional people in stories, but for me it was a bomb, and that is in the sense of a BAD movie. I for one will avoid Alexander Payne directed movies, they are truly Payne-ful to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot understand what the attraction is to this movie. First, its in black and white. I could understand if it was pre 1950's era, but this is modern day!!! I almost fell asleep several times during the movie and had to ask what was going on to my family who was watching. If this gets any votes during the Oscars, it just means the ones voting are retarded. I think the main problem is just hype from the movie fanatics. I have never reviewed any movies before, mainly because none of them disappointed me so much as this one has. I mean where is the draw for this movie? This old guy goes on a trek with his son to get money he doesn't even win and his son goes along with the ride for no apparent reason and it leads to no where. I mean absolutely no where. It ends on a dry highway in the middle of nowhere. It was just a false attempt to make a movie in hopes to get attention and it looks like they won. Guess I'll be looking out for better movies in the future...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Holy cow! By far the worst movie of 2013. The way that they portray simple folk is really appalling. The writing, directing, and acting is pretty bad here guys. Sick of independent films making movies this way. Every independent film lately seems to be made with what they think is realism, and it ends up turning into a sad depressing satire that is a carbon copy of another. Please entertain me. What makes all this worse is the fact that most of you guys support this trash that should not even be considered as a film in the world of cinema. Alright, enough bashing, if this is what does it for you, be my guest, indulge... But do not say I did not warn you.</fullReview>
