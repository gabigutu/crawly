		<shortDescription>Definitely the greatest western of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pale rider" is truly a spectacular film and unquestionably the very greatest western of the 80's. The fact that western was slowly dying as a genre already in the 70's is a sad but regrettable truth. Clint Eastwood still appeared in three of 'em: he played the amusing leading role of "Joe Kidd" (1972) - great, peculiar and funny little film - and he directed two magnificent masterpieces "High plains drifter" (1972) and "The Outlaw Josey Wales" (1976). What else did the 70's had to offer? Not too much. "Little big man" (1970), "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" (1973) and "The Shootist" (1976). At the dawn of the 80's western was pretty much dead. "Silverado" and exceptional "Pale rider" (both released in 1985) are quite likely the only notable westerns of the decade in question.And "Pale rider" is the better one - Clint Eastwood's last traditional western. Of course he climbed back to saddle in terrific and highly awarded "Unforgiven" (1992) but it was no longer a traditional western - more like an unusual anti-western. In "Pale rider" Eastwood is was once again (and for the very last time) the quiet, calm, cool and mysterious cowboy, (called "the preacher") classic and almost a supernatural character that rides into small, dusty town. Late John Russell with his terrific Lee Van Cleef-like looks is outstanding as the ruthless villain Stockburn. Movie is simply marvelous: amusing, well-written and exciting and it has a superb acting. This is a fantastic, gripping film that future generations will remember as one of the last real westerns. "Pale rider" is just one of the many reasons why I adore Eastwood. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Rides a Pale Horse!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pale Rider" is Producer/Director/Star Clint Eastwood's unofficial remake of George Stevens' "Shane" (1953). I've never heard that he's acknowledged it as such but the two stories are more than a little similar. The film also presents Eastwood in another variation of his "man with no name" character, similar to the one he portrayed in "High Plains Drifter" (1973).The story begins with a raid on a small mining community by rival miners trying to drive the residents off of their claims and take them over. Among the miners are Hull Barret (Michael Moriarity), his intended Sarah Wheller (Carrie Snodgrass) and her budding teenage daughter Megan (Sydney Penny). When Megan's dog is killed during the raid, she prays for someone to help her against the oppressors.Out of the mist comes a mysterious stranger (Eastwood), whom the scriptural passage Megan is reading describes him as "death riding a pale horse". The stranger saves Barret from a beating at the hands of the town bullies and comes home with him wherein he reveals himself to be a preacher. We learn that mining magnate Coy La Hood (Richard Dysart) and his son Josh (Christopher Penn) are behind all of the troubles.When LaHood's men including McGill (Charles Hallahan and the gigantic Club (Richard Kiel) are unable to handle this preacher, he sends for gunslinging Marshal Stockburn (John Russell) and his six deputies. Meanwhile, one of the miners, Spider Conway (Doug McGrath) goes into town alone after striking it rich and is goaded into a gunfight with Stockburn &amp; Co. Conway is brutally gunned down in front of his two young sons after which Stockburn tells the boys to tell the preacher to meet him on the street the following morning.The preacher then goes to retrieve a strong box containing his hardware and into which he tosses his preacher's collar. He and Barret then start for town where............Eastwood's character as in "High Plains Drifter" appears to embody elements of the supernatural. We see the scars of several bullet holes in his back and at one point is recognized by Stockburn as someone he had killed years before. The teen-aged Megan throws herself at the preacher (she's only 14 in the story) but he wisely (for the sake of the censors) let's her down easy while having an eye for her mother.The comparison between this film and "Shane" is inevitable. In "Shane we have the squatters versus the cattlemen; here its between the powerful miner and the "tin panners". There's the solitary gunfighter who helps out the underdogs, the vicious hired gun, the loner who gets gunned down in the street, the bad guy who turns good and the hero who rides off into the sunset all common to both films.Though not Eastwood's best western it is nevertheless good enough to wish that he had made more of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot on location in Sun Valley, Idaho, and to some esteem to "Shane," "Pale Rider" succeeded with sweeping landscapes and magnificent cinematography, to be an interesting Western that helps to bring back something from Eastwood's mystique? In 1850 California, a small group squatters and their families find themselves terrorized by Coy LaHood (Richard Dysart), who are standing win the way of his progress? Desperate, LaHood begins using violence in an unsuccessful attempt to run the peaceful yet determined homesteaders from their land? Leading the homesteaders is a decent man Hull Barret (Michael Moriarty), who dreams of a better life for himself, his girlfriend Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgress) and her lovely daughter from a previous marriage, 14-year-old Meagan (Sydney Penny). Into the lives of these strong-willed people rides a mysterious man?tall and lean with something strange in his eyes ?known only as "The Preacher" (Clint Eastwood). He says little, divulges nothing of his past, but for a man wearing a clerical collar he seems an expert at handling weapons? He pulls the miners together and gives them the confidence to defy LaHood even in the face of mounting violence... Although both Sarah and her daughter become enamored of the pale preacher, he gently rejects their advances and makes them see that Hull is a less capable but far better man? There is a good scene when Spider Conway?went into town alone and running out of steam?invited LaHood to come out and have a drink with him? But instead Stockburn and his deputies came out asking him to dance? Richard Dysart creates an all-too-believable villain, and Western veteran John Russell is well-cast as a middle-aged mercenary and his hired guns to face a legendary hero? It's an old score and it's time settle it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Pale Rider'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns of the 60s, Clint Eastwood rose to fame playing the man with no name. In 'Pale Rider', Eastwood creates his own variation of this character. Eastwood plays a mysterious gunfighter who is given the name 'preacher' because of the preacher's collar he wears. When the 'preacher' arrives at a gold mining community, he helps them stand up against a callous landowner.Eastwood cuts deep into the film's characters in what is a rather standard script. Particularly, in the scenes involving the preacher and a gold-mining family. Eastwood also succeeds in giving his film a dark atmosphere which only adds to its intensity.'Pale Rider' may not be as good as the director's best westerns, 'Unforgiven' and 'The Outlaw Josey Wales', but it can be regarded as a strong effort in what has been an illustrious career for Eastwood.Rating: (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man With No Name Rides Again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Westerns is what gained Eastwood mainstream recognition, and he returns to prosperous grounds with this movie. Much like his character, he returns the Western from the dead and avenges their loss of appeal at the box office. A few years later, he was to strike gold with ?Unforgiven' and although this story is not as gripping as ?Unforgiven', it is well crafted with minor flaws.The similarities between this movie and his well-known Spaghetti Westerns are vast, but the difference lies with the superior quality. Once again he is the ?Man With No Name' defending the weak and settling an old score. Where this one differs from his earlier work is that the characters and dialogue are realistic surpassing the one ? dimension norm for the genre. The characters are credible in the sense that each has believable motivations for their actions. The Hood are motivated by their greed and the gold miners are motivated by their dreams. The credibility is thus intact with regards to the characters drives meaning that we now do not have to rely on suspension of disbelief as we witness the action unfold. The dialogue is in sync with each character. The Hood speaks with an educated tongue, but his desperation is apparent as the Preacher stands his ground. The miners speak with little sophistication thus reflecting their social status of the times. The Preacher speaks as we would expect ?The Man With No Name' to speak. He is cool and rational and what little is said carries a lot of weight. The dialogue thus enhances the rich diversity of characters.Of special note is the casting. All the actors are well suited to their roles. Stockburn and his deputies are particularly memorable. The deputies look like they are all recruits from Hollywood B type action movies. This by no means understates their significance. Instead of playing their usual outlandish bad guys, they relied on their natural ability to exude devilish intent. They look cold, dark and menacing. There was no dialogue which accentuated their malevolence - talk did not interest them. They were there to do a job and small talk was meaningless. Their movements were slow and methodical thus adding to their character's coldness and creating tension as the harbinger's of death prepared to deal out their own brand of justice ? the kind of justice that only dollars can buy. Although the screen time dedicated to these characters was limited, their impact was far greater.The casting of Stockburn as a Lee van Cleef look ? alike was also very good. This could be construed as a lack of originality, but it was ideal for the story. He looks like a weathered, tough baddie, much in line with the impression we have of those times as provided by Hollywood, who had dealt with many situations such as these with a cool, ruthless hand. His dialogue, with assistance from a menacing voice, mirrors his appearance ? hard and to the point.Eastwood is the archetypal ?Man With No Name'. His natural coolness forms the basis for the character. He has the ability to limit his dialogue and communicate to the audience with the assistance of minimal body language the emotions of his character. The sharpening of a glare was all he needed to show that he was a man with a past who could be dangerous. This was vital to the character since it helped create the enigmatic figure that the Preacher was supposed to be.An indication of the craft of the movie is the scene where the Preacher starts to help his freind break the rock. The rock became an obstacle that they would have to overcome and they began to realise that if they pulled together, not only could they beat the rock, but the Hood as well. Scenes such as this elevated this movie beyond the Spaghetti Western. Attention had been paid to the story and gratuitous action was obviously never the intention. This is not to say that the movie lacked action, it means that action scenes were an integral part of the story and not as eye ? candy offerings for a hormone charged audience.As well crafted as it is, it is not without flaws. The first is the scenes within the town. It is easy to tell that the town is a small set for the movie due to the camera angles. This became particularly evident when the Hood is trying to bribe the Preacher with an offer of a church in a rich town. This immediately draws attention to the shots within the town which thus highlights the flaw. I have not checked to see whether this is a consequence of a low budget, which would be feasible since Westerns were not as bankable at that time as they were in the past. Even with due consideration of this fact, the cinematographer could still have made more creative use of camera angles to negate this limiting factor.A more minor flaw is the how the character of Megan is used in the movie. The book has her name in the title which is indicative of the fact that the story is told through her eyes. The telling of a story through the eyes of a young innocent can add various dimensions to the story. The adventures that unfolds before her would have a greater impact on the audience since the struggles of a child will touch the audience more than that of an adults. People always sympathise for the young. It can add complexity to the story since a child's emotions and pre ? conceptions will create more opportunity for conflict. There was effort made in this direction, but I feel that if Megan had been given more opportunity to tell the story from her perspective, the story would have been more emotive appeal.Westerns will always have an audience, although their popularity may fluctuate over time. The lawlessness of the times set the stage for good storytelling and unfortunately also poor storytelling. In the past, they concentrated on a Hollywood B style movie with characters existing as an excuse to pull a trigger in the outlawed West. This formula worked for a while, but the stories lacked the substance to withstand the test of time. This has led to the present situation where the few that have now been on offer have shown an increase in quality. This is probably due to the fact that the limitation in audience appeal has meant that the story has to be of solid value in order to attract the investors. As with all genres, they have actors that are naturally adept to the role. Eastwood was such a man for the Westerns. We now wait for his successor to carry on the legacy of ?The Man With No Name'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overlooked Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood made this film in 1985 and at the time many people said it was the best movie that he had ever made. Some people even went further and said it was the best western ever made. But the raucous shoot-em-up Silverado came out that very same year, basically foisting Kevin Costner onto an unsuspecting world, and it ended up making a bigger splash in 1985 than did Pale Rider. Then, after that, two more things happened: Costner went on to make Dances With Wolves (1990), and Eastwood went on to make The Unforgiven (1992), and with all that Pale Rider slipped into obscurity. The Unforgiven now wears the mantle of being Clint's masterpiece, his finest western, of being maybe the best western ever. And other people marvel much the same way at Dances With Wolves. Meanwhile, nobody thinks about or even remembers Pale Rider, a sorry fate that this fine film doesn't deserve.There are two distinctly remarkable things about Pale Rider: On the one hand we have a return to The Stranger, the character Eastwood played in High Plains Drifter (1973). But, he's no longer called "The Stranger," maybe because he has evolved in life, and he's now known as "The Preacher." But he seems to be the same guy, at a different place in his life's journey. When you think about it, The Stranger from High Plains Drifter was pretty much just an Americanized presentation of the no-name character Eastwood played in the spaghetti western dollar series for Sergio Leone. And if you're going to categorize it, that's probably where this film belongs, as a part of that Sergio Leone series: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1967). Add High Plains Drifter and this, Pale Rider, into that mix and you have a complete set. And it's noteworthy that Eastwood never again returned to the character. Eastwood's The Stranger appears to be finito.All that's on the one hand. On the other hand we unmistakably see Eastwood using Pale Rider to pay homage to what was once regarded by many as being the finest western of all time, Shane (1953). In fact, it's more than mere homage that's being paid here. Pale Rider is really a full-blown retelling of Shane, updated, done in Eastwood's style, and with Eastwood's trademarked mystery man stepping into Alan Ladd's boots for the classic Shane role. Same story. Same plot dynamics. The biggest difference from Shane being that in Pale Rider the young lad is replaced by a blossoming adolescent ingénue, the gender change altering the tensions between the characters. Whereas in Shane the boy compared his father to Shane, and found his father lacking, in Pale Rider the girl competes heads up with her mother for The Preacher's attention. Another difference from Shane is that here the dirty deed is accomplished. Yes, Mama beds the manly stranger. In Shane's life and times the cowboy way was to resist that temptation --to rise above it-- and walk away. But here The Preacher takes off his boots and drops trousers. I suppose in Eastwood's view the world changed between 1953 and 1985. Of course one aspect of the story was "fixed" to make this "acceptable." While in Shane Mama was ostensibly an otherwise happily married hausfrau, here she was a widow, unremarried, thereby rendering the tryst at least technically non-adulterous, although Mama was in a semi-committed relationship with her intended. But don't misunderstand. Pale Rider is a fine film. I like it a lot. I like it as much as Shane. I like it almost as much as The Unforgiven. It ought to be remembered. It deserves to be remembered. It is a well-told western from the 1980s, and there weren't many of those made. If you like good westerns, I strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening to Pale Rider is just excellent, at first all is calm and serene, but then the peace is shattered by the thundering of hooves. A group of men employed by Coy LaHood, tear thru a small mining community, shooting guns and trampling over all in their way. During this callous act of bullying, one of the men shoots and kills young Megan's dog. When Megan buries her beloved pet, she calls to god to send someone to help them against the greedy LaHood, because LaHood is intent on stripping the locals of their claims, and he literally will stop at nothing to get them. Later on Megan is reading from the bible, she reads aloud to her mother about "beholding a pale horse and that the man who sat on it was death", we then see a lone horseman riding towards this under fire place...Behold the pale horse because the man that sat on him was Clint Eastwood! And that's all you really want to know as regards what drives the film on. It had been quite some time since the movie watching world had witnessed a damn good Western, so it is obvious that Eastwood, knowing the genre inside out, felt it time to remind all and sundry about this engrossing genre and all its little peccadilloes. Riffing on his own High Plains Drifter from 1973 and homaging Shane in the process, Eastwood again uses supernatural leanings to play out this intriguing tale. Pale Rider works well because Eastwood cares for the genre so much, no frame is wasted and the acting on show delivers the necessary amount of quality to enhance the picture's impact. From the thundering opening to the gorgeous final shot, Pale Rider is an expertly crafted Western that still holds up today as a great entry on Eastwoods CV. Pale Rider. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film that revived the Western genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the early 80s, the Western genre was beginning to lose its position in Hollywood, and losing its impact on the audience. And the financial disaster of the Western "Heaven's Gate" did not really make very many producers any more enthusiastic about putting their money in to make Western films. But one of the producers, more famous as an actor and director, who was willing to make another Western, was Clint Eastwood. Maybe because Westerns like "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" had started his career in the 60s, he felt he owed it to at least himself to try and revive the genre before Hollywood officially threw it in the scrap pile."Pale Rider" was, and still is, a phenomenal success of a film. After its release, the Western genre was saved and brought back to life for several more years. It has fallen down nonetheless, but has not disappeared from cinema screens. And we really owe it all to Clint Eastwood for this film. "Pale Rider" is one of his best Westerns. It is well-acted, well characterized, has plenty of action, and is overall a great achievement.As one might expect, Clint Eastwood plays a mysterious stranger in this film. Very much like in the Dollars Trilogy and "High Plains Drifter", his character is never given an actual name. The character Eastwood plays in this film, however, is different than the squinting gunslingers he played in the past. This character is more anti-violent than the previous ones and doesn't even put his hand on a six-gun until the film is more than half-over. He mingles with the bad guys plenty of times, but rarely ever with a shooting iron. He's still a man of few words, but isn't as cold and self-concerned.Along with Eastwood, we have a cast made up of fine actors such as Michael Moriarty, the late Chris Penn, Richard A. Dysart, and one of the most popular of Western villains John Russell as a corrupt marshal by the name of Stockburn. Russell's character is one of the coldest cinema villains I've seen in a long time and his limited screen time aids in his impact and appearance. Russell's cold, almost lifeless voice added with Lennie Niehaus's eerie background music score brings a spine-chilling atmosphere to the film when the character speaks some of his first dialogue in the film. Like Eastwood's character, Stockburn is a character that says little, yet still delivers an enormous impact.Scenery in "Pale Rider" was absolutely beautiful, especially when combined with the effective lighting and cinematography. Many times in the film, we see a mountain directly smack center in the background. The cinematography is most of the time, dark and eerie. Dark scenes are even darker than usual, making this vision of the Old West even dirtier and savage than in most Westerns. And yet it isn't shown as being entirely savage, for it wasn't. True, the West was a tough place to live in the 19th century, especially during feuds over gold, but it wasn't a day of just regular killing.Some people have accused "Pale Rider" was being a rip off of the classic 1953 film "Shane". I will not deny the fact that they are very similar in a lot of regards and share similar scenes. A stranger coming to a settlement in the Old West during a feud between a successful land tycoon and homesteaders on land he wants was used in "Shane". But "Pale Rider" is in no way, shape, or form a rip-off. Any similarities to "Shane" is a homage, a tribute of respect. After all, Eastwood was attempting to save the Western genre, and perhaps this was his way of reminding the audiences of the great films of the past. Yet, he could do it without copying it. He just re-visioned it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One good reason to watch it: Clint Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll give you one good reason why shouldn't miss this movie: Clint Eastwood. If you are a fan of Westerns or even when you only like to watch one occasionally, than you should know more than enough. In my opinion Clint Eastwood is the one and only true Hollywood cowboy.When a mysterious preacher - no-one knows where he comes from, what his past is, they don't even know his real name - comes to a gold mining camp near a small town in the mountains, the local miners are in great danger. A ruthless landowner has decided to take their land, he doesn't mind using violence and he has the support of the sheriff. No one seems to be able to stop them. But than the preacher proves to be more than a man of God. He's a good shooter, the sheriff is afraid of him and he's the only one brave enough to rise against the landowner...If you are looking for an original movie, than you'll have to look somewhere else. This movie uses all the possible clichés that can be found in this kind of Westerns. But on the other hand I must also say that all is done in a very proper way. Eastwood is a fine director and he did what he was best in at the time: he made a Western. The story, the direction, the acting, the scenes,... it all looks professional and more than OK and especially thanks to Eastwood's acting performance in it, this movie is still a 'must-see'. I'm not a big fan of Westerns, but every time that I'm able to see one with Eastwood in it, I'll not let it pass. My advice: if you can see past the fact that it isn't very original, you will almost certainly enjoy it. I certainly did and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Shane'' Revisted - Another Eastwood Western Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a solid western, one of many through the years from Clint Eastwood, who knows how to make an entertaining film. "Pale Rider" is almost like a modern-day "Shane," in which the quiet stranger enters to help the picked-on landowners and then winds up with a showdown with the evil men in town. In this film, Eastwood plays a "preacher," (that's all he's called in this movie, but he's really a gunfighter) who saves the day for the town miners, led by Michael Moriarty who is always good in low-key roles. Eastwood's "Preacher" handles the immature love-struck teen (Sidney Penny) well, but blows his moral reputation by having sex with Moriarity's fiancé (Carrie Snodgrass) near the end, although no one knows that except the viewer. So - as usual - there are a lot of mixed moral messages in this film.A couple of things that are not mixed are 1 - the interesting characters; 2 - the convincing bad guys; 3 - the beautiful scenery and photography; 4 - the involving story that makes you care what happens. All of these make this an entertaining film you would watch a number of times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western of the 80's?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if this is the best Western of the 1980's, it wouldn't be too hard I suppose as there wasn't really that many made in that decade, or now unfortunately. Its the best Western of that decade that I have seen, the only other good one I can recall is Silverado and Young Guns was pretty good though the sequel was even better. The 1990's was a much better decade for Western fans, Dances with Wolves, Unforgiven, Tombstone, Wyatt Earp, Young Guns 2, The Quick and the Dead and of course Bad Girls (Only joking!). Anyway Pale Rider seen Clint Eastwood return to the Western after quite a few years doing other types of movies and luckily Pale Rider is a great film. As has been mentioned in numerous other user comments it does borrow very heavily from the Classic Western Shane and Clint's own High Plains Drifter but it never tries to hide this fact and its a great film in its own right. Very moody and beautifully shot with great performances all round. Clint was on top of his game on this one and produced a top notch Western that ranks amongst one of his best below The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Unforgiven and The Outlaw Josey Whales. I would love to see Eastwood make another Western but find it highly unlikely as he couldn't possibly top his last one Unforgiven but at least Kevin Costner has got one coming out later this year. Look out for Richard Kiel in this one he played Jaws in a couple of Bond films and Sean Penns brother Chris, who was a lot thinner in those days! Highly recommended ***8/10***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Clint Eastwood's effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pale Rider has a Cult-classic like reputation, but frankly, is undeserved. It's a very weak attempt by Clint Eastwood to close the "man-with-no-name" circle of films, and kinda retire him. The story though is way too cliché and forced. There is nothing good, in fact, about it. It's a boring and clearly uninterested film to pledge the viewer. The acting is horrendous, cringe-worthy. The plot is surreal and almost everything isn't explained at all(how the man-with-no-name got the priest clothes and etc). Storyline, as I said, cliché. The old and overused 'rich wants to take the poor's lands' kind of plot. But of course, wholly uninteresting. You know how it's going to end in the first twenty minutes or so. And what bothered me more is the fact that the 'man-with-no-name' made both daughter and mother to fell in love for him. Just laughing. And worse, there is a lot of time wasted in that pathetic sub-plot. It alone definitely lowered a lot the level of the entire film.And even the climax is a mess, because there isn't any tension on it. All we knew is that the 6 bandits had killed a drunk man. That's all. What to expect from these villains? Obviously they would gonna lose to mister badass, and as I said previously, it was predictable in the very first twenty minutes. One-dimensional characters, cliché story?only the cinematography is worth, I guess. Maybe not even it. Don't waste your time with that film. 5.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood reinvented the western. Where are the good westerns these days? Where are the Clint wannabes? This is what Westerns should be...Forget Duty.Forget Honor.Forget Courage.Just pray to god the preacher-man will come around and beat your enemies into submission.Clint was downright scary. He carries off a sword-fight scene in a western with aplomb. He's big, mean, tough, and bad. The baddest of the bad. And unlike Dirty Harry, he's not bad cause he nuts. He's just bad because he is. He's a force of nature.And seeing Clint in a clerical collar...if that doesn't scare you, nothing will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pale Rider (1985)An American Western trying (and often succeeding) at being an archetypal example of the genre. Clint Eastwood is a maturing actor and director at this point, and the movie has a kind of heft of someone who knows the ropes and has a good crew.But Eastwood as director maybe lacks perspective on his abilities, and he overwhelms the intelligence of the excellent cinematographer (Bruce Surtees, son of the legendary Robert) and the young be competent editor. Mostly this doesn't matter--the many rough edged character actors keep an Old West authenticity to the acting, and the sets and scenery are both true and real seeming. It's more the little decisions now and then that push you from the realism, and not in a stylized way other directors make obvious.An example right away: when one man is shot, he gets a dozen or twenty bullets in him and is still alive and responsive. It takes a final bullet to the head to put him down like a dog. This is theatrics, and it's dramatic in a cheap way. Much of the movie is not cheap, but somehow Eastwood can't avoid himself.Other example. The first scene is a classic, intelligent case of parallel editing--two separate stories told back and forth in tandem until they meet. We see the galloping bad guys interspersed with scenes of a small settlement of innocents. Suspense builds. We see the inevitable coming, and then it comes. Mayhem death and destruction.So why do the two women have to act like idiots? I mean, there are a dozen horses ravaging the tents and buggies and people in the village and instead of running to the trees or just hiding, the two women are running through and between the horses, oblivious to their danger, the younger one of them mindlessly looking for her dog. It's sentimentally nice, but it doesn't seem right. Or smart. The women actually serve as props for manly expressions throughout, from the 14 year old hitting sexually on Eastwood (his ego is unbridled, but the character, flattered, avoids such obvious abuse) to her mother wanting, just once, to know what making love to this great paradigm is all about (before marrying the much nicer fellow who loves her a lot).I don't mean to put too much emphasis on what doesn't work here. The movie overall is a masculine, beautiful western in the updated sense of later westerns, anything after "The Wild Bunch." Eastwood always enjoys playing the unorthodox hero. The enemy is a corporate kind of presence, a ruthless mining company with no environmental tenderness. The archetypes of good and bad people run wild here, and if you let them it's fine. So really we have what is another reworking of familiar themes from the genre, well enough done to keep it afloat if you turn a blind eye now and then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange preacher comes to defense miners in their struggle against the nasty owners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A drifter (Clint Eastwood) comes to a mining village in the Old West just in time to reckoning gunslingers and owners . He is a mysterious preacher who comes to the aid of gold prospectors and protects a humble embattled prospector (Michael Moriarty) and his woman (Carrie Snodgres) from a greedy mining company (ruled by LaHood , Richard Dysart, and his son Josh LaHood , Chris Penn) trying to encroach on their land . Meanwhile , the Good Stranger is idolized by their daughter named Megan (Sydney Penny). As the wealthy owner contracts a group of outlaws as hired gunfighters (led by John Russell who also acted as villain in Rio Bravo) to kill miners . The title ¨The Pale Rider¨ refers to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelation, chapter six , Megan is reading the exact verse when she and her mom first see Preacher ride up to their house. Well crafted Western with interesting screenplay written by Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack . Although atmospheric , it's also sometimes slow-moving and winds up into a spectacular showdown . This stirring picture contains a powerful examination of morality and hypocrisy on people as well as an enjoyable message about faith and hope . Clint Eastwood is unforgettable in the title role coming to help a group of struggling miners and homesteaders . Clint Eastwood revealed in interviews that his character is in fact a ghost. Other clues to the Preacher's true nature are the ghastly bullet wound scars seen when he is dressing, and his sudden appearances and disappearances throughout the movie . During shooting, Clint Eastwood sustained what he describes as the worst injury he has ever had on set when a horse he was riding fell through thin ice and launched him forward as Clint suffered a dislocated shoulder . Good casting with several secondaries as Carrie Snodgress , Chris Penn , Doug McGrath , Richard Kiel , Charles Hallahan , Billy Drago and special mention to John Russell as a downright nasty. Exquisitely shot in Panavision by Bruce Surtees , son of classic cameraman Robert Surtees , with a magnificent cinematography on the wooded exteriors and snowy mountains backgrounds. Acceptable production design by veteran Edward Carfagno , though the train station built for production was used again late in 1988 for Back to the Future Part III . Thrilling as well as sensitive musical score by Lennie Niehaus . The film is made in somewhat similar style to ¨Shane¨ by George Stevens , and which so much cloning of ¨High plains drifter¨ also directed by Eastwood only this time the drifter appears to have been sent from hell rather than heaven to right from ordinary injustices . Star, producer , filmmaker Eastwood realizes an excellent film and perfectly directed . This classic Western as good as the notorious ¨Josey Wales¨ is splendid in every way . Later on , Eastwood produced and directed another successful Western ¨Unforgiven(1992)¨ also with some common theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another Western from Eastwood - very good, but not totally brilliantly conceived or executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will about the man or his methods of storytelling, Clint Eastwood is a master at his own particular kind of style. It's so subtle that it's called easily as conventional, but there's something there, something very dark in his style that has come out in many of the films he's directed (and sometimes starred in). In fact, in one way or another to greater or lessor digress all of his directed/acted westerns (High Plains Drifter, The Outlaw Josey Wales, Unforgiven) run a streak of the bleak in them, and only once in a while become resolved in light of a happy ending or something decent. They're still (usually) traditional stories, only stripped away of all of the BS that John Wayne had to carry with him like an insecure badge of masculine honor.Pale Rider is one of the 'happier' ones, by proxy that a) Eastwood, in a rare outing, plays something that is actually more-so the hero than an anti-hero, only anti in that he doesn't quite play by the law (then again, neither do the law in the film- the six or seven "deputies"), and b) there is something of an actual happy ending, different from Fistful of Dollars only inasmuch that, again, the Preacher is a true good-guy Man-with-no-name. This doesn't necessarily make Eastwood's character any less of a bad-ass than usual, or how he plays him by proxy, which makes it even more interesting. There's moments of insatiable one-liner-type wit, or just a couple of laugh-out-loud bits of real "grit" that we come to love from Eastwood in these kinds of roles. What makes it work as something nearing the wholesome (if not entirely PG-rated) is the conscience of the Preacher- who, actually, hints at not being a preacher at all in a wonderful scene with Sarah Wheeler- and the spirit of the small-townies vs. the big money-barons like Coy LaHood.The story, perhaps, isn't quite original. Even without having seen Shane (or, for that matter as a slightly opposite but relevant comparison, the Seven Samurai), I can tell there are used parts here, not least of which the last scene with the girl crying out for the Preaher on horseback. And there are some scenes that just ring as corny with the dialog or not all there performance-wise - sadly by this I mean the two principle female characters played by Carrie Songress and Sydney Penny, the latter having usually excruciatingly delivered lines like her miracle-plea. Maybe some will dig that part of the sub-plot, and while I didn't it did not detract from the overall entertainment value of Pale Rider. It's mostly a lean, effective and fun/dark/absorbing thriller with killer climax and meaty male stock characters (i.e. Richard Kiel's mute Club, a serious parody of the parody Mongo from Blazing Saddles) that reveals the psychology behind the director while going for what works, simply, for the mainstream crowd. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pale Rider" is sometimes cited as the greatest Western of the eighties, although it had so little competition that that accolade does not seem much more than the cinematic equivalent of being the proverbial big fish in a small pond. (What competition it did have came principally from "Heaven's Gate", "Silverado" and "Young Guns"). The plot is that familiar one- familiar from films like "Shane" and Clint Eastwood's own "High Plains Drifter"- about the mysterious stranger in town who helps the locals fight off a gang of bandits. (Eastwood was a brave man to make a film on this theme in the eighties, as this was the plot satirised by Mel Brooks in "Blazing Saddles", his brilliant spoof Western from 1975. Club, the character played by Richard Kiel, even has something in common with Brooks' Mongo).The film is set in a small gold-mining village (references to Sacramento suggest that it is in California) in the late nineteenth century. Coy LaHood, the wealthy boss of a powerful mining company, is desperate to drive the prospectors (whom he sneeringly calls "tin-pans") off their claims, and has hired a gang of ruffians to achieve this end. The tin-pans are on the verge of giving up; only one man, Hull Barrett, wants to stand firm. When Barrett travels into the nearest town to buy supplies he is cornered by the ruffians who threaten him with a vicious beating, but he is saved by a mysterious stranger, who later reveals himself to be a preacher. (We never find out his name; he is simply referred to as the Preacher throughout. The character played by Eastwood in "High Plains Drifter" remained similarly anonymous). Despite his clerical calling, he clearly knows how to fight with both a gun and a club, and his arrival gives the tin-pans hope to make a stand against LaHood and his bullies. Realising that his tactics are not succeeding, LaHood calls in the corrupt Marshal Stockburn and his team of six deputies, who have a reputation as lethal gunslingers.This may be a familiar story, but Eastwood is able to inject some fresh elements into it. Firstly, in line with eighties thinking about the environment, there is an ecological viewpoint lacking in most earlier Westerns; the tin-pans' method of prospecting for gold is far less environmentally damaging than the methods used by LaHood's men, which involve blasting the rocks with high-pressure jets of water. (The film also has an anti-capitalist slant, favouring the little man against the big corporation). Secondly, there is a sub-plot involving Sarah, Barrett's widowed fiancée, and Megan her teenage daughter from her earlier marriage, both of whom fall in love with the Preacher. Although in both cases their love is unrequited, this gives the film an element of sexual tension not normally found in films of this type.Thirdly, there is a strong religious or mystical current running through the picture, and not merely because the main character is a clergyman. The film's title has a literal meaning, in that the Preacher rides a pale grey horse, but there is also a quite deliberate Biblical reference. At one point Megan reads the following words from Chapter 6 of the Book of Revelation:- "Behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death". Stockburn and his deputies are together seven in number, a number which is often regarded (particularly in Revelations) as having a mystical significance. (It has also been suggested that they are an evil version of the seven gunfighters in "The Magnificent Seven").Eastwood gives a fine performance as the Preacher, calm rational and authoritative, a performance which leaves open the possibility that there may be something supernatural about the character. When he is washing we see that his back bears the scars of a number of gunshot wounds which, I would have thought, would under normal circumstances have proved fatal. When LaHood and Stockburn are discussing him, Stockburn says that he reminds him of a man he once knew, only to correct himself a moment later. "Can't be. The man I'm thinking of is dead". The implication is that the Preacher may be a vengeful ghost returned from the dead. Certainly, his ability in the final shootout to appear and disappear at will suggests that he may have powers beyond those of a mortal man.The film has a distinctive visual style, with strong contrasts of light and dark. The interior scenes are mostly dimly lit, the outdoor ones of some magnificent mountain scenery are shot in bright sunlight. This contrast may in itself have significance as symbolising the film's central theme of a clash of good and evil.The film has had a mixed reception from the critics; Halliwell's Film Guide, for example, rather superciliously calls it a "violent, pretentious movie with little to be pretentious about", although others, such as Roger Ebert, have defended it. In my opinion, however, it is a good example of the western tradition, made at a time when that tradition was out of favour. It does not quite have the depth of "Unforgiven", Eastwood's masterpiece from a few years later, but by most other standards it is a very fine film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where do you want your statue, Sir Eastwood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is a good director. Clint Eastwood is a bad actor. I don't care about his personality, he is plain dumb. This movie even surpassed Stallone in narcissism. Self-glorifying? That's an understatement. When the 15-year old offers herself to him, it is just disgusting. Sure it doesn't sound unrealistic, but I didn't need to see that, really.One good point is the supporting cast, that managed to turn a bad script into something at least watchable (Chris Penn in particular). Getting back to the glorifying part, the end scene where the girl shouts "I love you" after him is particularly disturbing. I mean he didn't even turn his head around. What the heck was that: "Yeah, yeah just another 15-year old wanting to have s** with me...my life is so boring...I'm off to the next town where there will be other women that will fall for me and I will let them wanting cuz I'm so pure..." attitude? But as another comment mentioned, it is excellent as a involuntary comedy. My 2 points are for the laughs and for Chris Penn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come back Shane! they're ripping you off!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only was I disappointed in Pale Rider, but I was angry with it. To put it as directly as I can, this story is a rip-off of the 1953 emotionally-unparalleled western 'Shane' with Alan Ladd.The plot is identical; only instead of cattle farming it is gold mining. Instead of the menacing gunfighter Wilson, we get a less menacing, crooked lawman who is no good without his deputies. Instead of cute little Joey, there is a dumb adolescent girl who just wants to have sex, and then there is the lead role of the Preacher.Clint Eastwood seems a little unsure of how to approach this character. He is not sure whether to make him a tough brutal gunfighter, or an emotionally warm human being. as a result, he is not much of either. I will say this, the first half hour of Pale Rider is sufficiently strong and engaging, enough so that you don't even notice the Shane connection. It is only when the conflict starts to emerge that things get worse and worse until the ending. Whereas Shane ended in a heart-wrenching, tear jerking way, Pale Rider ends in a bore. This is Clint Eastwood's weakest western, and it is not one I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Pale Rider" opens up with a beautiful shot of pointy mountains looming behind a lush fir forest which again form the background to dusty plains. Aross this beautiful landscape we see a pack of riders, whipping their horses into a frenzy as they cut through the scenery. Then we cut to an idyllic looking encampment where we see gold prospectors and their families going about their business, a goat here, a dog playfully licking a man's face there... For some time we keep cutting between these two images and we just know that something bad is going to happen. Tension is building slowly until the riders are unleashed upon their victims and make quite the mess. They even shoot a cow and a dog. The dog, we learn, belongs to Megan Wheeler, played by a very young Sydney Penny (Bernadette, 1988) in a wonderful performance. It is her loss and the subsequent burial of the dog which triggers the entrance of the Preacher, through some suggested divine intervention. Clint Eastwood (Heartbreak Ridge, 1986) arrives as an ominous silhouette at first, on the heels of rumbling thunder and shots of rugged mountains, and ending up framed in the doorway of the Wheelers' as Megan finishes her bible reading with the quote: "And I looked, and behold a pale horse. And his name that sat on him was Death." As we learn later, the assault was part of a tactic by the shrewd villain, Coy LaHood, played by Richard Dysart (The Thing, 1982), to drive the prospectors off the land so he can get his hands on the gold which is hidden away in their creek, and Preacher is a man of God coming to lift their spirits and lend a hand. Literary, his introduction to Hull Barret, played by Michael Moriarty (The Stuff, 1985) is in the form of a brawl with LaHood's henchmen where he dispatches divine justice through the conduit of a bat. Eastwood lends heavily on Sergio Leone's archetype: the man with no name, which he himself played to perfection in the 60s, but adds even more mystique to his character through all the religious implications and the semblance of a revenge motif from some mysterious past. Few, if any, can play the tough loner with the icy stare as well as Eastwood, and this character is no exception. Anyone crossing his path with ill intentions are met with silent intimidation of the kind that makes them quickly holster their guns and run away. The movie is not all brawn and myth-making though, the central family trio of prospectors, also including Sarah Wheeler, played by Carrie Snodgress (Murphy's Law, 1986), is the beating heart of the movie. All the performances are top notch. Every word spoken is done so with the utmost conviction and true to character. How Moriarty can churn out such a subtle and dramatically solid performance considering the rest of his 80s catalog (Q, The Stuff, Troll, It's Alive III...) is astonishing. There is some early hints that the young daughter is taking a romantic interest in Preacher, and when words about this is exchanged between the two, it seems certain that few screenplays can match the elegance at which it is handled.For anyone fond of westerns, this is a sure bet for a good time. Some might complain that the overall framework of the plot is formulaic, and if you don't like westerns this will probably not turn you around, but the quality in execution of writing, directing and acting are all top notch. This is a visual movie where the action, the framing of the shots and the gorgeous landscapes dominate the feel and atmosphere of the movie. It is also a movie with excellent use of music and sound, which always help in creating more tension or fleshing out the scenery. The movie is not especially realistic as there are a few logical flaws here and there, but most can be shrugged off as stylistic choices. Sure, it seems strange that one character would reach his destination faster on foot than another character on a horse cart with a head start, or awfully dumb when the main villain stands out in the middle of the street without cover while his men is combing the streets after a hidden and armed Preacher, but his defiance of a sudden death by lead just makes him look even more bad ass, and a worthy opponent for our mythical hero. The 80s were not a happy place for aficionados of the western, but this little gem almost makes up for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A staple of the Western genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We open with a small mining community on a beautiful mountainside going about their daily routine. In the distance, several men appear riding along on thundering horseback, like a dark storm cloud they are menacing in nature as they roll through the picturesque landscape. They are employees of a bigger gold mining company who have come to raise hell, and to frighten these small time tin panners into giving up their rightful (i.e. legal) claim to the land. After the havoc they provoke, a young girl living in the mining camp kneels down to pray for a miracle. In faded transitions emerging through the snow we see Clint Eastwood in long shot on horseback, seemingly the answer to her prayers.This brilliant opening sets the tone for what ends up being one of Eastwood's finest Westerns, and one of his very best efforts behind the camera as a director. I'm not sure if it was Francois Truffaut who said that a film should not be reviewed until it has been seen at least three times. I'm not even sure if that is the actual quote. As this was my first viewing of "Pale Rider", I'm hesitant to write about it so soon because of how moved I was by it, even though I feel my affection for it will only increase upon future viewings.If you don't include "Bronco Billy", this is Eastwood's third Western that he has both directed and starred in. 1973's "High Plains Drifter" was his first, and feels like his American interpretation of the spaghetti western genre that made him famous for his Man-With-No-Name roles, an element he borrows for "Pale Rider" as he is only referred to as 'Preacher' throughout the film. The second is 1976's "The Outlaw Josey Wales", which might be viewed as his first revisionist Western, taking the time to show the harsh realities of a Civil War veteran/guerrilla fugitive running for his life on the frontier. What "Pale Rider" gets right more than those two films is the scenery; the snowcapped mountain ranges and the scenic valleys make it arguably the most visually stunning film Eastwood has directed. Utilizing only three main locations, the sense of space is also perfect and gives the film an almost tangible feeling.I usually have a problem with the under lit quality of the cinematography in Eastwood's films as director, but here he actually puts it to good use. He takes full advantage of the beautiful locations, and saves the dark lighting for the interior scenes, whether it is a miner's cabin or the general store in town. This effect gives the film a more realistic or even revisionist quality, while the supernatural undertones of Eastwood's mysterious main character are a throwback to his main character in "High Plains Drifter", though the results are far less stylized. These dueling aspects work in the movie's favor, like a fusion of his two earlier Westerns as a director.Much has been made about the plot similarities between "Pale Rider" and George Stevens' 1953 classic Western "Shane". Yes, there are numerous scenes and characters that feel like an updated version of that classic, but the general storyline is similar to many films of this particular genre, immortalized by "Shane" but not specifically original to that film. On the contrary, Stevens' film is so highly stylized that it feels as if it were aiming for that classic status during its production. Eastwood's film, while borrowing heavily from that film's plot, is grittier and meaner, and has a different relationship to the landscape and nature so that it feels more like an Anthony Mann-Jimmy Stewart Western collaboration from the 1950s instead.The film's climactic showdown is what you'd expect from a Western, masterfully presented and suspenseful in the process. The supporting cast is also a great element to the film. Michael Moriarty is good as the simple miner trying to follow his dreams, and Carrie Snodgress perfect as his love interest, a woman embittered by time and circumstance, who receives a new spark of life when Eastwood's Preacher rides into the mining community. On the opposite side, Chris Penn does a fine job as the villainous son of the rival miner, spoiled and cowardly in his attempts to outdo the settlers he feels are in the way of his father's empire. And Richard Kiel, best known for playing Jaws in a couple of James Bond films, adds a quiet malevolent touch to the proceedings. From the casting to the setting, all of these elements come together nicely to form one of the greatest Westerns ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So So... A few spoilers ahead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have recently held a little bit of a private "Clint Eastwood Festival", renting many of his classic movies one after the other. Having watched this movie after some of the great Italian as well as American westerns from the 60's and 70's, I was quite disappointed.The story was quite weak, which in itself would not have been such a huge deal if there was some kind of depth and history to the "preacher's" character in relation to his old nemesis the marshal and his deputies (having them all standing in line wearing the same type and color trench coat looked rather comical). The only reference to the past were some scars Clint had, showing six gunshots he had somehow survived (Yeah, right) then, in turn, shooting the marshal in the same gunshot pattern with one additional shot to the head. So we know they were enemies in the past. That's all we know. How did Clint become a gunfighter? How did he become a preacher? What was the feud about?The romance side plot was rather silly, I guess when you direct and produce a movie in which you are the star, you can have a beautiful 15 year old girl and her mom both fall in love with you. Many other small details bugged me as well: The "Kung Fu" like scene at the beginning, in which Clint kicks all these guys' asses, didn't look very good; the final showdown scene was full of overstated clichés: the hat on the ground, the oil lamp dangling in the wind, telling the restaurant owners to take a walk, etc. In addition, the way he took out the six deputies and the marshal was just too easy. Overall, the dialog was weak. The scene where the girl stood at the edge of town calling "Goodbye" and "I love you" with those dreadful echoes was embarrassing. What did Richard Kiel add to the movie? I also thought Clint didn't look too good in this movie, it almost seemed like he just had some dental work done and he was in pain. And so on.Was there anything to like? A little: the scenery was nice; the camera work was good although nothing radical was demanded of it; a small part for Chris Penn. That's about itThe best I can say about this movie is that it probably won't really hurt you if you watched it on some rainy afternoon with nothing else to do.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale Rider is a Pale Copy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shane is one of the five best westerns ever made. Pale Rider is dreck. The normally sure footed Eastwood should never have attempted this perfectly awful remake. The word "hubris" leaps to mind as the only reason he might have stumbled so badly in this case. The writers, I would assume at Eastwood's suggestion, took a powerful, straight forward tale of good versus evil and poured a heaping helping of metaphysical nonsense over it. Eastwood's Preacher is just one more tired turn as The Man With No Name from his Italian period -- but lacking even a faint hint of originality or creativity. The supporting players were as pale as the rider. Nowhere did we see the power of Van Heflin's performance as Joe in Shane. Heflin was Everyman. Jean Arthur, Jack Palance, Brandon DeWilde, all were perfectly cast. Palance was particularly effective in evoking quiet menace. Eastwood needed to add a back-up group and collectively they couldn't summon up the smallest chill. And Alan Ladd, of course. Stoic without being dull. Projecting a man of flesh and blood instead of some mythic gunslinger. If you want to see Eastwood at his best rent The Unforgiven and steer clear of this pitiful mishmash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pale remake of a great classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PALE RIDER is essentially a remake (howbeit, a mystical version) of one of the greatest westerns ever made, and fans of SHANE (1953, George Stevens) will readily recognize this fact after watching PALE RIDER.For the most part, Eastwood's filmology is a history of hits and misses--respectable, but not earth shattering. Then there was UNFORGIVEN, with which he established himself, once and for all, as not only a good director, but as one of the few who have wrought masterpieces. Unfortunately, PALE RIDER is not a happy addition to his life's work.Clearly intrigued by SHANE but not eager to face the kind of critical scrutiny that is especially vigilant when one presents a remake of a classic, Eastwood blinked and instead presented a ghostly retelling of the original story with more guns, more gunman, one more love interest (two, instead of just one) and more violence; and changed the story-line (along with the tittle) just enough to pass it off as an original. Of course, this is not the first time that someone in the industry has tried this, but it is the first time that someone has tried this with such an acclaimed classic without at least giving some credit to the inspiration.Eastwood should have shown more guts than gall and simply made an out-and-out remake or abandoned the idea altogether, as attentive fans of SHANE are neither fooled nor amused. This film is awful--not only as it stacks-up against SHANE, but also as it stacks-up against everything else that Eastwood has done. A true remake would have been better! Though he may not have equaled, let alone surpassed, the original, Eastwood is more than capable enough to have at least made a decent showing. On the other hand, some classics have aspects, techniques really, that are so intricately part of what makes them great, they are better left alone.Eastwood should have left this one alone.I give it a 2 out of 10 for gall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too simple, and boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most boring and predictable Clint Eastwood westerns. It's ok if you're desperate for an Eastwood western, but once you have seen it, it's not really worth watching again. The acting is pretty poor and the dialogue is too hokie. Of course this is just my opinion, and if you don't believe me go watch it for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Preacher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even without a ton of dialogue, Clint Eastwood earns my attention in Pale Rider based on pure charisma and stature. He's done many great westerns, but this one ranks up there among his best.Of the many interesting things about a lot of Eastwood's westerns is that he often plays a wandering mysterious figure who happens to come upon conflict. Pale Rider is no different. This time, Eastwood is known as 'The Stranger' and 'The Preacher' who decides to help a small village of people from miners who intend to take over their land. For all intents and purposes, this feels a whole lot like a fresh take on the Seven Samurai structured story, but with only one bada** man.If it wasn't obvious already, I'm very high on Eastwood's performance here. He seems like a humble and honest man in his mannerisms but when push comes to shove, no one can take him in a gun battle. The supporting cast is formidable for the story they're telling. But besides some fun Richard Kiel moments, and an interesting 3rd act arrival from John Russell, the cast is really nothing to ride home about.Touting the lone two female characters are Carrie Snodgress and Sydney Penny as a mother and daughter from the village the Preacher is trying to protect. Although I think their performances are solid, some of the character decisions made them feel much more hollow and more down the line of clichéd females in film, sadly. Not to mention the unnecessary romantic angles Eastwood took with his direction of them.In terms of a western, Pale Rider hits all the beats you want. It has a compelling lead, high stakes, and one amazing gun-blazing final scene. If you're looking for another well-strung western from Eastwood, this is the film for you, even if some of the supporting characters and shoe-stringed romance misses the mark completely.+Eastwood as the Preacher is gold+Final battle+Fun appearances from Richard Kiel and John Russell-Romance angle is botched8.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Clint Eastwood western, a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pale Rider is the only western Clint made in the 80's and while there are slim pickings for westerns in that decade, Pale Rider is in my opinion the best western made in that era. Pale Rider is best described as a combination of Shane and High Plains Drifter. The storyline is almost identical to that of Shane, but has the brooding, supernatural tone of High Plains Drifter, with the unique bad ass presence of "The Man With No Name" as only Eastwood can bring. Clint is a stranger that comes into town known only as Preacher. He rights some wrongs for folks who are not strong enough to stand up for themselves, while settling his own scores and bringing retribution for events of the past. The film looks sharp, moves fast and has great dark ambiance with an excellent score. The support cast is solid and Clint is in top form in front and behind the camera. Pale Rider is a classic western that only Clint can make and a very enjoyable and well made one it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-packed Clint Eastwood's climaxed epic best western masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take Clint Eastwood's best climaxed action packed masterpiece western film, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Pale Rider (1985) is my third favorite Clint Eastwood western film in my top 5 Eastwood western films. It is a film that I truly believe that it is a stone cold classic climaxed epic western. I think this was the last one Clint Eastwood's masterpiece. I know a lot of people are rooting for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Unforgiven as been Eastwood's best masterpiece, I don't. I think they are both classics and a great western films but not Clint Eastwood's best that will be still Pale Rider for me, that is my opinion! This western classic is action-packed filled with climaxed in one of the most exciting showdowns ever. This was the second Clint Eastwood's western film when I saw a child and I have grown up watching this movie. Clint Eastwood did a solid acting performance as the same time he gave performance as the director. I love this movie and it I still going to be my favorite Eastwood film. Great movie one of the best westerns I've seen more complex storyline, more serious a great movie.Plot: A mysterious preacher protects a humble prospector village from a greedy mining company trying to encroach on their land.This was the film that was 12 years absence from Eastwood's western movie since "High Plains Drifter," which Clint Eastwood brings back his "Man with No Name" character first seen in A Fistful of Dollars (1964). This was the biggest hit in 1985, since Eastwood returned playing mysterious stranger with no name. The film is fast paced, exciting and you root for Eastwood's character. The End has the best shootouts ever. I seriously loved the shootout Eastwood pulled off. John Russell as Marshal Stockburn was a fantastic villain with his seven deputy's. The violence in this movie is gore and very bloody. The film isn't that long it is fast paced filled with a lot of excitement and action. It is an action-packed adventure climaxing in one of the most exciting showdowns ever filmed. I love this film to death and it is rousing entertainment with Eastwood at his best! A grizzled Clint--"squint, squint, squint like Clint"--reprising another, more earthly version of his avenging and vengeful angel role, is about as guilty a pleasure as one could ask for in a Western. Michael Moriarty is surprisingly good in his role as the hapless gold-panner-become-family-man. Richard Dysart is quite good as the mean-spirited town boss. Well-paced, with the occasional light touch. There is, in fact, "nothing quite like a good piece of hickory." We also have Richard Kiel in this which I remember him from James Bond 007 - The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) and Moonraker (1979) as my all time favorite villain character Jaws and of course young Chris Penn who sadly died 10 years ago and is no longer with us anymore. A classic western in the old style. A true example of how your sins will find you out and that sometimes miracles do happen....... in the wild west :P It is True, Eastwood's spaghetti westerns are all classics, but in this, he returns to the genre with maturity as an actor and complete control over the product as director. There's an air of mysticism that transcends the story line yet is integral to the subtext, while avoiding clichés that could have trivialized his return to the open prairie.Overall: This western movie has everything in it that I love: it is a true American western movie, a mysterious rider who helps poor harmless people against tycoons, nice shootouts and the story with actors is great. I love this film it was my second western film with Clint Eastwood that I have saw as a kid. This film get's a perfect 10 and it is well paced flick that I love.Pale Rider is a 1985 American western film produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, who also stars in the lead role. The title is a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as the rider of a pale horse is Death.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: The Malpaso Company, Warner Bros.

		<shortDescription>Nothing much to take away ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the engrossing 'Unforgiven', I went to this movie. Maybe that is the reason I was not much impressed by it. I even believe that the movie is overrated.The script is stereotypical but somehow seems lame to the other Western ones ! Well, the Christian concept of 'Pale Rider' is intriguing(destroying an 'evil empire' by sword, pestilence, famine and wild beasts) but there was no need for the central character to wear a clerical collar, then people take him as a 'Preacher' and the audience is expected to connect him to the biblical 'Pale Rider'. It seems a trick unworthy of noticing but dilutes the intention. Megan reading the Psalm(or verses, I am naive at the term) would have been sufficient.Eastwood, as always, has given full justice to the character - the sangfroid when meeting the goons, LaHood and even while eliminating the deputies. The demon underneath seems to arise only twice in his eyes which Eastwood should be given a notable credit ! Except the 'Preacher', Hull Barret is the only character that leaves some impression - he is a common, vulnerable man but still does his best for the family and the folks. The Stockburn's character seems like a last-moment patch implemented in a software to save the script. Fails to impress even for a second as a villain. Better than him is LaHood who at least in some scenes appears to be a professional mining mafia/don.Frankly, I didn't even notice any background score - that itself speaks of it's lameness :P . Since the script revolves around the camp, the mine and the town, one is deprived of the typical Western panoramas, the horse riders amidst terrain and so on. The town too appears modern and synthesized, lacks the dull and the creaky yet appealing look of a troubled Western stereotypical town.To summarize, one should watch the movie only for a glimpse of the vintage 'Western Eastwood', any more expectations can result in disappointment. Yes, the movie has rekindled my old interest in 'Apocalypticism' :) .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Hell followed with Him</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Western sees Clint Eastwood return to the saddle almost a decade after his last outing in 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' This film is set in California where a group of independent gold miners find themselves terrorised by a rival, Coy LaHood, who wants to take over their valley and bring in his modern, and highly destructive, hydraulic mining system. After an attack on their settlement teenager Megan Wheeler prays for a miracle? shortly afterwards a stranger saves Hull Barret, the man who is courting Megan's mother Sarah, when he is attacked by Coy's thugs in town. This man returns to the miners' settlement and reveals himself to be a preacher. Upon hearing how he helped Hull the other miners start to rally together and stand up to the threats. Coy isn't a man to back down though and soon he employs one Marshal Stockburn and his deputies; officially lawmen but in reality gunmen who will kill for whoever is willing to pay them. The Preacher will have to take off his dog collar and pick up his guns if he is to protect the miners.By the time this film was released it was thought that the Western genre was over? clearly it wasn't even it would never be as popular as it used to be. Eastwood may be showing his age he is still a solid presence; in fact his slightly grizzled look adds to the characters toughness. It has been said that this film is clearly inspired by 'Shane' and has obvious similarities with Eastwood's earlier film 'High Plains Drifter'? this isn't really a problem though; it is still an enjoyable film that tells the story in an interesting way. There is a slight supernatural element to the film although it is strongly suggested rather than made clear. There is a good amount of action from start to finish but there is also plenty of time spent on character development so we grow to care about the members of the miners' settlement; most notably Hull, Sarah and Megan. As one would expect Eastwood is great as the preacher/gunfighter. The rest of the cast are fine too; especially Michael Moriarty who plays the gentle but strong-willed Hull Barret and young Sydney Penny who played Megan. While there are one or two uncomfortable scenes there is little to offend? I suspect if it were recertified now the BBFC would give it a '12' rather than the current '15'. Overall this might not be Clint Eastwood's best western but it is still well worth watching if you are a fan of Eastwood or Westerns in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A blend of traditional western and supernatural tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small group of miners and panhandlers are trying to make their claims pay despite local magnate and bully LaHood trying to force them out. Into the middle of this conflict arrives a hard man, known only as the Preacher. He provides a figurehead, encouraging the underdogs to stand up for themselves. Then LaHood brings in bogus lawman Stockburn and his deputies as enforcers.Superficially, this is a perfectly conventional western - underdogs vs bully, with the Preacher as the external catalyst who gives the underdogs the will to fight. Even the "family" who adopt the Preacher (the mother who might have a thing for him, and the daughter who definitely does) are no great surprise.But running alongside the formula is a secondary story, the subject of the film's title: dialogue tells us that the rider of the pale horse is Death, and it pointedly tells us this just as the Preacher rides up on his pale horse. The number of bullet wounds on his back is the same as the number of Stockburn's deputies. And Stockburn knows that the Preacher could not be HIM, because he saw HIM die. This mysterious and somewhat supernatural part of the story is never explained, and the film is all the better for it - we really don't need to know the nuts and bolts of the Preacher's previous existence.I'd put this one on a par with High Plains Drifter - they both have a quasi-supernatural thing going on alongside a traditional western story. This is great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale in Comparison to Other Eastwood Films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pale Rider (1985): Dir: Clint Eastwood / Cast: Clint Eastwood, Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress, Sydney Penny, Richard Dysart: Western filled with disgusting images of excessive violence. I am not sure what the title is implying. Perhaps the rider lacks colour. Perhaps a trip to the spa will fix that problem. Clint Eastwood directs and portrays a character he has played countless times in a film recycled from other westerns. He is a mysterious man called Preacher who arrives in a California gold rush where a mining syndicate feuds against independent prospectors. He encourages these idiots to grow a pair and fight back with his help. Eastwood eventually shoots up the entire town. Flawed with its view of violence as a problem solver. Familiar plot with bang bang throughout. Eastwood is a skilled director but this character is hardly new to him. Flat supporting stereotypes played by Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress, and Sydney Penny. They all sit there with their hands together hoping Eastwood will solve their problem. There is a big difference between how Gary Cooper deals with a similar issue in High Noon, and how Eastwood tackles the problem here. Richard Dysart plays the idiot villain threat whose personality is no different than any other Western town villain. There is nothing featured here that hasn't been done before. The result is a pointless graphic mess that should be used for target practice. Score: 2 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood western - enough said</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is so well-known for his roles in the Dollar trilogy and in the film Unforgiven that it's easy to forget just how many other westerns he has graced with his presence. Case in point, Pale Rider is a pretty average film on the outside. A lone cowboy with a tormented past rides into town and takes a stand against the injustice deeply rooted therein. But in this case Eastwood makes it work with his sheer charisma and ability to play a badass character. Not to say that the plot of the film is in any way bad, as it isn't. It's just somewhat predictable. You see a small gold miner community that tries to make do under the pressure of an amoral miner tycoon and then you see a lone preacher riding into the town, after which you can pretty much guess how the movie will go thereon.So yeah, plot-wise this movie doesn't offer all that much, but rather it's the execution of this basic plot that makes this movie shine. As stated, Clint Eastwood manages to save a lot of this film. His Preacher is a fascinating character. A clergyman with a sordid past, clearly well-acquainted with violence and whose sheer appearance screams peril. Yet he acts with a surprising gentleness and care for his fellow man. It's contrasts like these that make for great characters and Preacher is a fine specimen, if you don't mind my opinion.And the rest of the cast ain't so bad either. Sydney Penny as the fifteen-year-old Megan Wheeler is perhaps the weakest link as she just doesn't quite hit the correct notes, but even she was just average instead of good or great. The rest of the main characters were played very well and they all felt surprisingly real and dirty. They felt like actual human beings, warts and all, if you don't mind the old saying.The rest of the movie holds up rather nicely as well. The settings and the various shots have that overly bright 80s feeling to them, but that's part of the charm nowadays as far as I'm concerned. Plus from what I understand the town in the film was an actual Gold Rush town, so extra points for that.All in all this is a decent western. Not the best I've ever seen, but good in its own right. Any fan of either Eastwood or westerns in general should give it a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Preacher On Horseback</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood takes us back to the Wild West in this beautifully filmed Western action adventure. The script is that of a typical Western flick: The villain is a bad guy in power (LaHood) terrorizing the helpless (in this case a group of 'squatters'). Desperate LaHood uses violent measures to drive them away until suddenly an enigmatic preacher shows up.Eastwood definitely adds his signature touch. He humanizes the story and the characters which is what makes his films different from the usual Western flicks that were popular when the genre was at its peaks. The women aren't cast as showpieces or mere damsels in distress and the men aren't all evil or all good. Even a despicable person like LaHood shows a human side and Stockburn's expressions leak fear and vulnerability.Then there are the strong good-guy characters: Hull, his girlfriend and her daughter. All three are drawn to the Preacher. Hull admires him and maybe even sees him as a role model as a result of which he gathers courage and learns to fend for himself and what he believes in. Sarah has fallen in love and she knows that they have no future but she begins to appreciate what she has. Megan has her first crush and even though The Preacher respectfully rejects her advances, she takes her first step towards adulthood and responsibility. The Preacher is mysterious, generous, quiet and a loner. He may be the good samaritan but he isn't without his share of faults and secrets.The breathtaking landscape is captured beautifully with stunning cinematography. The editing is also solid as the pace is quite steady. The art direction and costumes are brilliant. Sound effect is decent and the score works well. The horses are awesome.Eastwood is excellent as the mysterious brooding but likable Preacher. Of course he's used to playing such characters and he does them so remarkably. Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress and Sydney Penny are equally great. Richard Dysart makes for an entertaining villain.In my opinion, Eastwood's Weaterns have stood the test of time. I can enjoy them today just as I did years ago. 'Pale Rider' is no exception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nearly the perfect western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It had nearly 20 years since I saw this film. So when I picked up the DVD I had completely forgotten which Eastwood western this one was. As such I was expecting a classic Clint Eastwood western with the patented Eastwood glare radiating from his character.But the film is so much more than that. Unlike the plethora of other westerns this one has a definite Kurosawa influence. The themes and mythos employed are joined together with incredible editing and solid cinematography. To top it off the emoting by the cast is appropriately theatrical for the type of film this is. Plot, story, and general film movement come together to present a classic myth of biblical proportions in terms of theme.But like all great films there are a few flaws. Not many, but stand out ever so mildly. Some back-story needed explicit exposition. If I understand correctly it seems to have been intentionally left out, giving the film that much more of an artistic fog for the audience puzzle over. But, properly shot, the back-story may have offered a closure to some logical loopholes. That, and it may have added some needed gun-play to help set the stage for the film.The other quibble is with the final confrontation between the Marshal and Eastwood's character. Without unveiling a possible spoiler I'll say that it was needlessly over the top just prior to the climax, and again needed more gun-play before the moment of truth.Having ridden horses and fired guns when I was younger, and spent a good portion of my childhood in the Sierrra Nevadas, I can say that this film brought the mountainous border of California to life in this film.Now, my one real gripe is with the DVD transfer. I'd seen this a few times on TV on what used to be the independent KTVU Channel 2 (now regrettably a Fox affiliate), and the print they showed was always crisp and clear. The current DVD release needs a good deal of revamping. The color temperature is skewed in the opening, the film is dark much of the time, and the overall image is borderline grainy but just unimpressive overall. The film's actual content makes up for a lot of this, but it's somewhat hard to watch.A magnificent western that's not in the traditional western vein, and because of this, is so much more. But a few minor plot holes and poor DVD execution just make it merely an enjoyable experience. Then again that's all one can really ask for.If you're tired of a lot of the usual shoot-em-up bang-bang western with white hats and black hats, then check out Eastwood's classic. If you can over look the mediocre DVD transfer you should enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the slightly-too-long opening shots to the hurriedly cut-off ending, Pale Rider gives the impression of a great film that needed just a bit more time spent on polishing off the rough edges.Eastwood plays the steely-eyed stranger as proficiently as ever (although you occasionally get the Jack-Nicholson-esque feeling that he's perfected one character and re-cycles it as often as possible) and Sydney Penny plays the doe-eyed youngster to perfection. The main problems with Pale rider lie in the predictability of the plotline and the pretty shaky script. You can imagine Clint Eastwood being flattered that he's written into the story as being irresistable to women from ages 14 to 40, but the out-of-the-blue 'cabin' scene with Carrie seems tacked-on and the, albeit well acted, scene in the woods with Megan is cringeworthy in its scripting.The lack of a memorable "big boss" bad guy is also unfortunate, as Richard Dyshart's character never really chills the watcher (although Chris Penn plays his snotty son very well) and the sudden addition of 'old-school' cowboy Stockburn at the end seems a last-minute attempt to add real adversity.Nevertheless, Pale Rider is very watchable. The supernatural element is never explored to its full potential; occasionally seeming that items such as the parallel between the Preacher and the biblical "rider on a pale horse" are forgotten about (as Hell never does follow behind him in the same way High Plains Drifter invokes this), but overall the good acting usually makes up for the poor script and leaves a film that is not amazing but never disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint's the man...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here Clint Eastwood manages to nail down the Western genre in perfect form. An obvious homage to both Shane, an iconic western if there ever was one, and one of his previous, and under-appreciated films, High Plains Drifter. He's a man called Preacher, that rides into a small mining community on the outskirts of a town ruled by a ruthless strip miner. Here the strategy is to set himself up as the heroic Alan Ladd type character who just wants to be, but who cannot escape either what he is, or his past. He's a skilled gun fighter, and that comes in handy when the miners are assaulted by the hired goons that LaHood, the virtual big fish in the little pond, has let loose on them. He wants that land. When Clint's ways become too much for the goons to handle, LaHood sends out for some truly experienced men to do the job. A crooked Marshal named Stockburn, and his bevy of "deputies" who amount to no more than a tag team of ruthless killers. All have a tragic connection to the Preacher, ala the slain sheriff in High Plains Drifter. Great setting, and some light hearted moments to take some of the rough edge off. Great flick.</fullReview>

Pale Rider has an eerie feeling all through out. and leaves you wondering about the Preacher. i highly suggest that after someone sees this movie that they go out and watch Shane and high plains drifter it will shock you how well the two movies mesh into one of the best westerns of the 1980's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pale Rider starts on Carbon Canyon high in the mountains where a group of prospectors are panning for gold, however local businessman Coy LaHood (Richard A. Dysart) wants the land to expand his own mining company &amp; is using intimidating tactics to force the prospectors to move on. While in town one of the prospectors Hull Barret (Michael Moriarty) is beaten by some of LaHood's men, then seemingly out of nowhere a mysterious preacher (Clint Eastwood) comes to his rescue. The presence of the preacher brings the feuding prospectors together &amp; they decide to stand up against LaHood &amp; his bullying tactics, however LaHood has had enough &amp; calls in gun for hire Stockburn (John Russell) &amp; his six deputies who kill for the right price...Produced &amp; directed by Clint Eastwood who also stared in it Pale Rider is an entertaining western that I rather liked. The script by Michael Butler &amp; Dennis Shryack tales itself very seriously with a fair amount of character development, anyone looking for constant gunfights &amp; action would be advised to look elsewhere but if your looking for a solid, well written western with a moral then you could do a lot worse then Pale Rider. It deals with faith &amp; pulling together &amp; those are it's main themes which it gets across in a effective manner. The film has a sedate pace about it, it's not the fastest moving film ever but at the same time I never felt bored with it. The ambiguous nature of Eastwood's character is well handled &amp; his origins are intriguing although we never find out anything about him other than he's a preacher &amp; that at some point he has met Stockburn before, I have to say I liked the mystery surrounding him &amp; it cuts down on sentimental type dialogue. Overall I thought Pale Rider was a decent western that I enjoyed.Directed Eastwood does a good job, I'm not sure how he can direct &amp; star at the same time but he pulled it off here. The crisp 2:35:1 widescreen photography is very nice as it captures the mountain locations very well as does it the period town. There's a good atmosphere to Pale Rider &amp; the climax where Eastwood kills the six deputies is a well sustained tension filled sequence. There's not much in the way of violence here, a few gunshot wounds &amp; a couple of fights is about it.With a modest sounding $6,900,000 budget Pale Rider is well made with top production values &amp; period design. The acting is very good from all involved, it was nice to see &amp; recognise Billy Drago as one of the deputies, Richard Kiel better know for playing Jaws in a couple of James Bond films makes an appearance &amp; Chris Penn turns up in an early role for him.Pale rider is a watchable western with some nice action scenes &amp; a decent story as well, I liked it &amp; it's as simple &amp; straight forward as that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rich, Exciting, Spine-Tingling, Gorgeous-Looking Avenging Angel Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small group of panhandling gold miners are gradually being run off their land by thugs working for Coy LaHood, the local robber baron. Things look bleak until a mysterious preacher on a pale horse appears to defend the mining community. Who is he ? Can they trust him ? And can they follow his example ?This is the last of Eastwood's great mythic westerns he began with Per Un Pugno Di Dollari / A Fistful Of Dollars, and my personal favourite of his American cowboy films. The only criticism I could possibly make of it is that it's a little derivative - it's essentially the plot of Shane mixed with Eastwood's earlier High Plains Drifter. But it's better than both those movies, and Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack's script (they also wrote The Gauntlet) is full of strong characterisation and accentuates the mystery and mythicism of The Preacher with just the right balance of subtlety and action. We really have no idea who he is but his origin, his connection with the gunslinger Stockburn and the hints at his past - like the bullet-hole scars in his back - are endlessly fascinating. This is also a movie which looks gorgeous, thanks to Bruce Surtees' incredible photography of the Sawtooth National Forest in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho. Surtees is a great cameraman; this was the last of his twelve films with Eastwood (see Dirty Harry, The Outlaw Josey Wales and Firefox especially) and one of his best - the first seven minutes are a textbook in shooting men on horseback, there's an amazing night-time campfire scene with no artificial light, and the showdowns are perfectly poised. Equally first-rate are the cast, with Eastwood, Moriarty, Snodgress and McGrath all excellent, and Kiel and Russell truly iconic as LaHood's head goon and killer-for-hire respectively. As ever, Eastwood's direction is calm and unhurried, giving his performers all the room they need to develop their characters without losing sight of the story. Lennie Niehaus' ominous brass percussive score tops off a memorably atmospheric picture, which, for my money, is much richer than the Oscar-laden westerns of a few years later (Dances With Wolves and Eastwood's Unforgiven). The Biblical title derives from Revelation, chapter six, verse eight, "And I looked, and behold a pale horse; and his name that sat on him was Death ... ". No other actor has managed to epitomise the mythical western stranger like Eastwood, and this is his last great hurrah in a genre he made his own. Not to be missed. 7/10</fullReview>

Didn't Squint already ride into town as a ghost of some abused sheriff, in another movie, High Plains Drifter? This is just another example of Squint portraying himself as yet another hero. This movie implies he bedded down Sarah Wheeler, gee Squint did it not feel right to get Megan, too, hey how about a three some? Stockburn and his boys shoot that poor guy in the street about 40 times and he's still standing, yeah right ! Squint you're better off behind the camera. There, you seem to have a better sense for things. I suggest you viewers see the movie Shane, a true classic and some real drama and acting and of course, directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale Ripoff Of "Shane"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically, it's the story of "Shane", only watered down. The plot is essentially the same-powerful bully and his hired thugs make trouble for a local family over the same patch of land, mysterious stranger comes in, deals with the bad guys, and leaves. Even the kid shouting "I love you!" to the departing hero is ripped off.So what are the differences? In "Shane", the eponymous hero has a connection to the people of the story; here the mysterious stranger remains so...a ghost, maybe? The father is suspicious of the stranger-and then is reassured because the stranger wears a preacher's collar. (Like a person wearing religious garb is by definition a good person? Even in medieval Europe, artwork depicted people in religious garb being sent to the Devil if said people were evil despite being of the Church.) The villain in "Shane" wasn't so much greedy as terrified of the future; the homesteading family represented a dire threat to the Wild West he had always known. In this movie, he's just a generic bad guy. And Shane left the family he had saved for a definite reason; the wife was attracted to him, and he knew that staying would cause trouble to the family. In this movie, well, if the mystery man is supposed to be a ghost, why ride off when he can just disappear?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair return to the western for Clint Eastwood...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 7/22/2010 -- 4 out of 10 (Dir-Clint Eastwood): Fair return to the western for Clint Eastwood but the movie followed a lot of formulas that have been seen too much in this genre. The story is about a loner(played by Eastwood...isn't that original!!) coming into a mining town that has both individual family's trying to survive and a big company trying to run them out and take over. Eastwood portrays kind of a gun-fighting preacher who's not quite as hard as his other famous gunfighter of the spaghetti western's of the 60's but carries some similarities. The family's are struggling just to stay in town when he arrives and he gives them a fighting spirit that helps them hang on, and also does a little actual fighting as well. The movie is very similar to the legendary movie "Shane" with a couple scenes that seem to be a homage to the film, except that there a few silly turns that didn't make sense. Both women of the primary mining family fall for Eastwood's character at different points in the movie with the younger one only being 15 years old! Michael Moriarty portrays the befriended male father figure character but he's neither a father or husband to the women he's in care of(he's just taking care of them after the death of a spouse). The acting outside of the male characters is somewhat unbelievable, which doesn't make you really care for them and this hurts the film. The ending of the movie seems to take forever and most of the time I could tell what was going to happen next. These things didn't make for a very positive experience. I think Eastwood just felt the need to return to this genre but did better later with "The Unforgiven" -- this one just didn't quite cut it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Eastwood, it seems, can do no wrong. He, for some unknown reason, has Audiences, and most Critics, in the Palm. Enter this Rip-Off, overrated and completely Styleless Movie. There is virtually nothing here that is not a tireless retread. From the Story to the Violence, everything is flat.A manipulative Movie is an understatement. This is a Self-Absorbed Vanity Piece. Here we have our "Hero" casting spells over Women and Young Girls wearing the Collar. Steering Men with but a word, Everyone is awestruck at this Mystical Figure of a nameless Man. The Director/Star shows us not one but two shots of a Dying Cow complete with blood oozing from the mouth. Not the only Animal who suffers, he shows us the Family Dog shot down, complete with burial, prayer, and youthful innocence wondering why.The final shootout is about as lackluster and boring as possible only eclipsed by the more boring multiple shots of dynamite throwing and explosions. This "Auteur" also seems to have a fetish for gunshots to the forehead, again, multiple times. It is amazing, not only do we have bad scenes and expository shots, the Director is so clueless, and full of Himself, that he shows them all many times. This is just BAD Movie Making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite Westerns of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pale Rider is one of my favorite Westerns of all time. The story is of a stranger arriving in a small mining town on a pale horse, thus Pale Rider. This man is tall, fearless, strong, brave, and a man of God. The story starts off when a much bigger and stronger mining company tries to force a group of people that are mining for gold off their territory. They try to do this by stampeding their camp with their horses and using guns. After the dust has settled the leader of the camp {Hull} goes into town for supplies. While there, the gang that just stampeded the camp beats up Hull with hickory sticks. This all ends when the stranger throws a bucket of water on one of the men to stop him from lighting Hull's wagon on fire. Then the beating beings. The stranger goes threw these four men with his own hickory stick like they weren't even there. All of them laid out on the dirt road in pain. Hull then invites the stranger to the camp for food and somewhere to stay. Through the whole film the Preacher, as everyone calls the stranger, stands up for the people of the mining camp. Clint Eastwood gives a strong performance with his double role as a preacher and man with no fear that is not afraid to fight and stand up to people bigger then him. The end of the film is one of the best ends for a Western or any film for that matter that I have ever witnessed. People say that Pale Rider copies off Shane, that might be true in some aspects, but Shane is slow and somewhat boring when comparing it to Pale Rider. I give Pale Rider * * * ? {out of four stars} and an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good If You Like To See People Get Shot In The Face...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysterious preacher protects a humble prospector village from a greedy mining company trying to encroach on their land.Clint Eastwood has been known for playing all sorts of roles as anti-heroes during his long career, and this film is undoubtedly one of them. Pale Rider is a good movie, it features some good acting and some exciting scenes, although I wouldn't rank it among Eastwood's best movies. The one thing that this movie kind of lacks is originality, as the movie contains many plot points and elements that were lifted directly from Shane, with a couple of scenes being so obvious, to the point where I was expecting one person to say: "Come back Shane!" The movie is violent, since it's a Western film, and if you like to see people get shot in the face, then you might find this movie to be good, as there are a lot of face and head shots in this film, but then again, you might cringe at that as it can be a little uncomfortable in a few instances. So since this is a Clint Eastwood Western film, expect some violence, as there is plenty of it in this film.The movie does have a good cast to it. Clint Eastwood is superb in his role as The Preacher, who has to protect a family and a group of miners from some corrupt businessmen. Michael Moriarty gave a good performance as the father of the family that Eastwood is trying to protect. John Russell plays Stockburn, a corrupt U.S. Marshall and old enemy of The Preacher. I thought that the cast was good, with the exception of Sydney Penny, who plays Megan Wheeler, who has taken a liking to The Preacher, near the end, when she is confessing her love to him, it sounds rather forced and is almost cringe- worthy. But apart from that, the acting was pretty good, with Eastwood giving the best performance.However, the movie does have some flaws with it. Such as a couple of scenes being predictable, particularly the ones that were based on scenes from Shane. And also, there's one scene that's kind of laughable. It's a scene where Stockburn and his deputies make one of the miners dance by shooting bullets at his feet. After shooting up his piece of gold, they shoot him full of bullets before Stockburn shoots in him the forehead. What was laughable as how dragged out the scene was, and the miner yelling and trying to pull his gun out before getting shot. And on top of all of that, the deputies fired more shots then the guns that they were using were capable of holding.All in all, while Pale Rider isn't the best thing that Clint Eastwood has to offer, it's still a good movie all the same, and if you watch it, you might like it. Also, you might like it if you don't take the fact that it's based heavily on Shane into account. And hey, it's always fun to root for Clint Eastwood and see him take out bad guys, considering how he's usually known for playing characters like that, and he's good at it too.7/10</fullReview>

This results in Hull later finding the nugget.Then when Megan is being assaulted by Josh, Club wades in looking like he intends to pull Josh away (and possibly beat the living you-know-what out of him). The Preacher arrives before he can protect Megan, but Club's intent is clear.

		<shortDescription>A solid 80's western from Clint Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pale Rider is like an 80's update of the earlier western High Plains Drifter. Not only do both films have Clint Eastwood as both director and lead actor but they also share a story about a possibly-maybe supernatural gunfighter who assists a community terrorized by hoodlums. It's a fairly specific set of similarities that both films share. Pale Rider is less cynical and revisionist than High Plains Drifter though. The community Eastwood helps here is fairly clearly sympathetic, whereas in Drifter the people of the town have a dark history and Eastwood's character intends to punish them as well. Consequently, in the latter film he plays a definite anti-hero, a nameless lone gunman out for revenge, which was much more in line with the spaghetti western tradition that was popular at the time. For me Drifter is slightly the better film as a result of its more stylised and dark presentation, Pale Rider is less morally cloudy and more traditional and a little more run-of-the-mill. But it is still a good western nevertheless.Its story has a mysterious preacher - perhaps from beyond the grave - answer a teenage girl's prayer for assistance after her small mining community has been attacked viciously by a gang of thugs. These hoodlums work for a ruthless local businessmen who wants their land. He, in turn hires an immoral, murderous Marshall and his group of killer deputies to put an end to these people but the preacher seems to have some kind of history with this man and is out for vengeance of his own.The implication that Eastwood's character is from beyond the grave is an unusual one, making the connection with High Plains Drifter all the more clear. But in this film this plot angle is less oblique. The preacher is an avenging angel who it is implied was murdered before. He will help the people but only if they are first willing to help themselves. The wintry mountainous location where the action takes place is a nice backdrop too, giving it a different feel in tone to the more common sun-baked locales in most westerns. In fact, its 80's origins can be detected a little by the topical green issues that are integral to the plot. While the good guys mine the land in a responsible manner, the rich villains destroy the surrounding area by blasting it with high powered water cannons to get at the gold. All-in-all, another strong western from Eastwood and one of the very, very few good ones to be made in the 80's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Pale Rider" features one of the most potent lines in the history of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's 1985 Western "Pale Rider" is an obvious combination of two earlier Westerns: "Shane" from 1953 and Eastwood's own "High Plains Drifter" from 1973. "Pale Rider" is, no doubt, an homage to these films rather than a rip-off.THE STORY: A mysterious drifter with a clerical collar rides into town as an angel of mercy to the local miner settlers and an angel of punishment to their rich oppressor and his men.The difference between "Pale Rider" and "Shane" is that "Pale Rider" is a much more modern take on the same basic story; plus, unlike "Shane," "Rider" possesses a supernatural element. Although "Shane" is definitely the better film in a historical sense, "Rider" is a more palatable experience to modern viewers. As for comparisons to "High Plains Drifter," "Pale Rider" is a much better picture. "Drifter" has a slow, tedious vibe and all the characters are unlikable (but two). Eastwood plays a mean anti-hero who enacts revenge on an entire town and three villains; he only displays kindness to two people. In "Drifter" he's SOLELY an agent of vengeance. This is not the case with "Pale Rider" where Eastwood's character, known only as 'The Preacher,' is equal parts mysterious, intriguing, heroic and supernatural. In other words, the viewer both likes and roots for 'The Preacher.' As noted in my title blurb, "Pale Rider" features one of the most memorable lines in cinematic history. Megan, an almost-15-year-old girl, informs The Preacher that she thinks she loves him. The Preacher coolly responds: "Nothing wrong with that. If there was more love in the world there'd be a lot less dying." It's a powerful scene/line and good advice to live by.The film runs 115 minutes and was shot in California and Idaho.GRADE: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best western of the 80's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 80's the western movies weren't really popular . It was a good time for science fiction and fantasy movies , since the special effects became really professional then . It doesn't mean that westerns weren't made , they simply just weren't that popular anymore . They were few western movies from that era that stood the test of time . One of them is "Pale rider".Some people accuse Eastwood's movie of being a rip-off "Shane" . It's a rather absurd argument since many western use the " stranger comes to town and defeats bandits" theme. Eastwood adds something new ? a religious undertones to his movie. You can wonder if the main hero (Eastwood is cool as always) is a symbol of death , ghost or something else. It adds a new depth to the story. There are some really touching scenes like the prayer at the beginning of the movie or the ending. There are some intense scene like "Gentelmen , music" and the final shootout.The movie is gritty with good dialogues , well written characters , nicely photographed and well effective violence. There are two interesting love triangles. Acting is good and the direction is solid . I was happy to see Billy Drago ("The Untouchables") as one of the sheriff's deputies. Overall , it's a classic western that might be Eastwood's best movie in the 80's. I give it 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was on TV the other night and I decided to watch it , partly because I love Clint Eastwood movies but mainly because I was thrilled to find Richard Kiel was in it (best known for 'jaws' in the James bond movies).To be honest, i was slightly disappointed by the movie. Clint Eastwood plays 'preacher' a mysterious character who starts to protect a village from outlaws. And indeed it was mysterious...the sudden appearances and disappearances of preacher and when villain Stockholm claims 'he should be dead'. Then it hit me. Preacher is a 'ghost' who has died previously but now, inexplicably, is back into existence. This unrealistic back story brought the movie down for me, in this way it distinguishes itself from other Clint Eastwood movies as it pushes the bounds of realism.However, the movie itself isn't bad. It's entertaining , instantly recognisable as an Eastwood western and Richard Kiel adds some much needed humour and lightheartedness to the screen, albeit an underwritten part in the movie. However, it is predictable and I wouldn't classify 'pale rider' as a classic. But a good western yarn nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preacher to the rescue in the west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some say this movie is sort of like a remake to the classic western "Shane" to some degree. The plot is a bit similar and has slight similar elements but this movie has enough of it's own to be it's own film in most way. The premise is a bit far-fetched a bit but it's been done in many westerns and it's just something your going to have to just go with in order to enjoy this film. Where a group of people on a village which is used for mining gold is getting kicked off there own land by a tyrant. But a girl prays for a hero and than there comes the gun-slinging preacher who fights for what is right. And than you get the story. But the movie has more to it than the generic element you would expect from the plot. Clint is very used to playing a lone-wolf gunfighter in many of his western, but this time he plays more of a righteous gunslinger. Anyways Clint was able to add elements to the characters for what would have ended up being a standard western story to something more. This isn't one of the best western Clint has directed but that isn't to say this is not a good western. In fact this western is close to being great, just isn't one of the best I seen when it comes to this genre. Although this movie comes out a bit dry at times, it still got my attention most of the way through though because of certain aspects of this film. What really stands out about this western is the strong dialogue though, it isn't one of the greatest but it still stood out. Sometimes the exchange of dialogue between characters is enough to get the attention in this movie. So through the interaction and emotions shown in this movie is what really drives this western for the most part. Overall this is a western that has enough effort and good elements with symbolism in it to really stand out. It came close but didn't pull off being a great western, but it still came close to the point that it's really worth seeing for western fans.7.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's time for my .02 on this movie. While it's true that there are plot similarities with Shane &amp; the GB&amp;U series, those similarities are generic plot devices within the Western convention; lots of other Westerns use the "loner come to the aid" device to build a fleshed out story around. Many good Westerns, if not most of them, use a variation on this plot device. The Outlaw Josey Wales is excellent, &amp; tho Unforgiven was good, I thought it over-rated. Pale Rider is much more entertaining &amp; satisfying to me. The relationships with both the girl &amp; her mother are handled with subtlety and provide excellent counterpoint to the brutal action scenes. A well balanced story. One bit of trivia, John Russell, who plays Stockbridge, had a couple of short lived TV series in the 50's, including Lawman, where he plays a good-guy sheriff. He also had a small role near the beginning of Outlaw Josey Wales. I'm just guessing here, but I suspect Clint was trying to give work to a fellow actor from his past who needed the work/money. Generosity on Clint's part, to his credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not Clint's best western, but still pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood returned to the old west with this film, and its a very enjoyable one. The plot is pretty basic, he has to protect a small community from a gang of ruthless miners, but it still works. Once again he plays a mysterious stranger, but this time he's a preacher, who is amazing with a gun. The best part of the film was the ending shootout in the town. It was action packed and suspenceful. The only problem with this film was there is a corny subplot about a fifteen year old and her mother who are both in love with Eastwood's character. It would'nt have been so bad if they had'nt spent so much time on it. Aside from that, this is a very enjoyable western. It's no HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER or THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY but its still a lot of fun. 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood plays the messianic preacher character in PALE RIDER. In the film he paired against a corrupt gunslinger and his deputies who terroize a town for a businessman. PALE RIDER was a gritty western much the way JOSIE WALES was. The film has a uncompromising sense of quality to it and is a good movie. The film uses a plot which is clihe' in the western genre but the movie is anything but cliche. PALE RIDER has a sense of style that was ahead of it's time in 1985. A good viewing choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an atmospheric story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pale Rider is my all time favourite movie.From the opening scene with it's atmospheric audio sounds that bring the scenery alive to the Shane-like ending Pale Rider plays out as a very competent and well structured story.It is a thought provoking movie,leaving one wondering is this 'Preacher' really the physical entity he appears to be?Echoes of his past resonate throughout the film as to his past,and,perhaps,his fate.The plot is not original but is superior to the likes of Shane and HPD in that the cinematography lends itself to favour the subtle supernatural theme.Hazy filters in the forest scene where Megan buries her dog work to create a 'spiritual' effect for example,yet it is merely a 'suggestive' effect,and not everyone will pick up on it.The 'Preachers' arrival at the cabin just as Megan reads from the scriptures could be seen as purely coincidental, or is a higher power at work?The story builds to the inevitable showdown and again subtle ploys are used to suggest that the 'Preacher' is not all that he seems to be,though this time a finely crafted script is the medium to put the feeling across.The script is dry but is emotive and one gets a feel for the characters,not common in westerns.The ending is left somewhat open and has compelled me to write a 'sequel' which I've called Megans Odyssey.Sydney Penny's portrayal of the vulnerable yet strong willed Megan added the winning formula to this movie,creating both a romantic sub-plot and a sense of family values,another rare quality in westerns.A 10 out of 10 gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Plains Revisited...and a few others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood had kept the Western alive in the 70's with two acclaimed contributions to the genre: High Plains Drifter and The Outlaw Josey Wales. Slap bang in the middle of the 80's, though, the Western again was going no-where and neither was Clint's career artistically. It could only mean thing and it came in the form of Pale Rider. Big Clint plays the Preacher, the mysterious stranger who comes to the aid of a community in peril from evil local miners and agrees to fight for their cause. The film is a clever mix of Eastwood's own style a la High Plains Drifter with the classics, mainly Shane but also a touch with High Noon. The film does a good job in emitting a subtly supernatural feel but the classical style also inevitably leads to familiarity and predictability. The plot itself does not work out whilst certain parts of the script are considerably more interesting and exciting than others. However, Eastwood effortlessly brings a sit-up and watch presence to the film whilst he himself stages the whole affair impressively, helped by some splendid colourful, revealing and realistic photography. Not a classic Western or one of Eastwood's strongest but it certainly kept the genre on its feet respectably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant remake of "Shane"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most interesting comments I hear about this film is that it "rips off" the 1953 George Stevens western "Shane." Most of those who make this comment have apparently missed the point -- "Pale Rider" is not a rip-off of "Shane", it's effectively a remake of that film, which adds a good deal more in terms of character and atmosphere.Effectively, the plot is the same as a group of would-be tin-panners are terrorized by a major corporate concern. The squatters, led by Michael Moriarty (in a fine, low-key performance in the Van Heflin role), are near the end of their rope when a mysterious Preacher (Eastwood easily improving on Alan Ladd) answers a prayer and rides to their aid. Along the way, there is some wonderful character work among Eastwood, Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress and especially Sydney Penny. In particular, it is the sexual tension between Eastwood -- an older man of mystery -- and Penny, a young woman blossoming into maturity, that really keeps the tempo going. This tension, counterposed with more traditional Western moments makes for a fine Western experience, the type Eastwood the director has mastered in films like "The Outlaw Josey Wales" and "Unforgiven". Likewise, a slight element of the supernatural is added with the ending, not unlike "High Plains Drifter". While some of this is less successful, the impact on the film as a whole is minor.Eastwood and Moriarty are great in the low-key way, while Penny gets a role here that should have been the start to a big career. Other wonderful characters enhance the flavor of the picture even more -- Carrie Snodgress, Richard Dysart, Christopher Penn, and especially classic Western villain John Russell.If this film is a "ripoff" of "Shane", maybe we need more ripoffs. In my view, the film is one of the rarities -- a remake that surpasses the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable western action. Ever see the movie "Shane"? Well, the acting in Pale Rider was better because it wasn't in the developmental stage of movie acting, but that's about the only difference. A stranger rides in, stays with a family where the mother falls in love with him, helps with some stone breaking(wood chopping in Shane), beats up on some trouble makers, kills the bad guys and rides off into the sunset with a little kid shouting out after him. Belive me, of all the films that need to be copied or remade, Shane is not very high on the list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a lot of beautiful scenery in 'Pale rider', which is probably the best thing about it. The story, about a group of 'tin pans' who are in conflict with the big shot gold digger who owns most of the land around them, and more specifically, the girl who prays to the Lord to help them and then a tall, dark stranger is sent their way, could have worked, but things stay pretty simple, clichéd and blunt.The hero is always there at just the right moment and is basically a western Superman, even if he is also referred to as Death himself. The intended dramatic impact of the two women who both have their hearts set on the hero and the other man (Hull Barrett) who quietly wants to be part of the 'family', remains pretty much absent, all the more because the films switches between Eastwood's macho efforts, Superhero gunslinging, simplistic moral lessons and some bloody killings. But I wasn't much impressed with Sydney Penny's acting either. The rest of the cast did okay, mostly.Maybe this one is simply not for me, even if I was certainly mildly amused by most of it. 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Oddly, although I know he is a great actor, I know him primarily from cheesy films (particularly those of Larry Cohen). After seeing him in "Q", "The Stuff", "Pick Me Up" and others, it is odd seeing him play someone serious.We also have a nice, young, thin Chris Penn. Sadly, he always was in the shadow of his brother. Why? I have no idea... he is just as good here as anyone else could have been.</fullReview>

It doesn't grip you by the collar with any particularly thrilling scenes, but it keeps you intrigued throughout.The idea that the unnamed mysterious gunfighter (Clint Eastwood) is perhaps a supernatural being is sure to hold your interest and keep you guessing throughout the feature length.

The set was removed by Thanksgiving. Site restoration is so good that in 2004 you could not discern precisely where the "town" had been. The elevation of approximately 7000 feet and 2 1/2 miles up a rough forest service or old logging road tells one that filming was a challenge.The hydraulic mining scenes are impressive. Water was derived from a very small stream that was temporarily impounded which runs down from behind a very photogenic 11,000 ft. peak some four miles from the town site.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who is the mysterious stranger Clint Eastwood portrays in this movie? Some say an angel. Some say a dead man with a score to settle. The music, however, gives a clue. Anyone who has studied music in depth would pick up on this. Clint Eastwood's character's theme begins with the interval musicians call an augmented fourth, diminished fifth, or a tritone. In ancient times, this interval was called "The Devil In Music". Thus, it is now revealed who and what Preacher is. He's the devil. Of course, I am a little curious as to why he didn't demand anything of those miners for fighting for them. He just did his thing and went his way.This is a great movie. What can I say, you don't mess with my man Clint. Beautiful how he gives those strongarms what's coming to them without batting an eyelash.

		<shortDescription>Clint Back In The Saddle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a mysterious stranger who comes to the defense of gold miners threatened by corrupt business interests, Clint Eastwood dusts off the lone gunman persona that first brought him big-screen success in the Sergio Leone directed spaghetti westerns. Slow moving at times but building to an exciting climax, the film is a bit pale when attempting to pay homage to (or ripping off) the highly acclaimed and overrated George Stevens western, "Shane," but nevertheless proves to be an entertaining ride. In many ways, this is a remake of Eastwood's earlier "High Plains Drifter," especially in its emphasis on the supernatural. The lead character, known only as Preacher, is presented as a mythic avenger; he may be human, he may be a ghost. Whatever he is, he's a familiar and effective act in Eastwood's repertoire. We've seen variations on this character in "A Fistful of Dollars" and its two sequels, and, of course, in "High Plains Drifter."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale Rider Is An Awesome Epic Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTICE: SPOILER WARNING. I TALK ABOUT THE END AND MORE. I really liked "Pale Rider" and think it is an awesome epic film foreshadowing the greatness of Clint Eastwood's later masterpiece, "Unforgiven." Both films have a moodiness and spookiness about them that sends shivers up my spine and makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck. Both have elements of the the Holy Avenger theme. A man wrongly hung in "Hang Em High"; a sheriff wrongly whipped to death in "High Plaines Drifter"; and a man wrongly shot "to death" in the back in Pale Rider, the nameless man comes back for revenge. I also loved how Clint came back for revenge in "Unforgiven". He is there albeit for money to avenge the wrong done to the woman who was horribly maimed by the 2 cowboys and to avenge Morgan Freeman's death. But back to Pale Rider, Clint is the Man with No Name, suggesting he is an Avenging Angel from God answering the girl's prayer for a miracle. Like the Archangel Michael he is a warrior-angel who fights for God's people against the Devil and his evil minions. Of course the movie Pale Rider is reminiscent of SHANE with Alan Ladd. The Preacher character's name is never mentioned in the movie Pale Rider but the inference is that he is literally God's angel of death, or some kind of Death riding on a horse as is mentioned in the Bible in the book of Revelation. This is an epic battle between Good and Evil. Between God and the Devil. Between Order and Chaos. Michael Moriarty's character is left as the protector of the mining village at the end of the movie when The Preacher rides away and fades into nothingness. We are left with the message that God answers prayer and miracles happen but that God expects us to fight for what's right and that God helps those who help themselves. Evil can only succeed in winning when Good men sit around and do nothing. In this movie unlike "Fist Full of Dollars" the Preacher is not after money or gold. He is out to defeat the villains and inspire the miners. There is a wealth of moodiness and otherworldliness in this film. The voices in the wind. The way the prayer of the girl seems to magically summon the Preacher. Very spooky. The idea that Death himself is come to punish the Marshall and his Deputies and their boss is eerie. The movie comments on Ecology and GREEN issues as well with the way the villains "rape" the land for gold with their high pressure drilling methods. Clint's pro union like speech to the Miners about taking a stand is also very political and inspiring. This movie appeals to all types of people. Whether you are an National Rifle Association member or an Political Activist there is something hear for you. Clint Eastwood may have saved the Western with this film. It only gets better and better with repeated viewings and I highly recommend it. The gorgeous scenery of the setting for the filming in The Tuoleouno County, California area and in Idaho are breathtaking. I have been to the Sierra Mountains in California and the snowy scenery is just tremendous. I love the beauty of the California mountains and recommend this area for your vacation as well. Why not ride a horse while you are there ? A Pale horse of course.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last Great Eastwood Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great Westerns, not only as an Eastwood film, but of the genre itself. This came after Josie Wales and before the bloated Dances With Wolves and the horrible Unforgiven. There are only two really great westerns in the last two decades. The Grey Fox(Richard Farnsworth) &amp; this Pale Rider. In this Clint is 'Preacher'. Preacher is basically a rehashing of 'Man With No Name' from the Sergio Leone trilogy of the sixties: 'For A Few Dollars More', 'A Fistful of Dollars' &amp; the best of the three 'The Good The Bad &amp; The Ugly'. Preacher is also an older more slowed down but mature version of MwNN. Also with Clint here is Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgrass, the beautiful young Sydney Penny as Snodgrasse's daughter Megan, a young Chris Penn and a host of fine character actors who support Clint as good guys and bad guys. Pale Rider verges on the Supernatural for Preacher appears to be a man who was killed in a shootout some time before. Only indication to the audience is when Clint removes his shirt and five or six plugged up bullet holes cover his back. Preacher had been seemingly shot &amp; killed by Stockburn, a villainous killer Sheriff for hire, who has now been hired by the town boss to run out the gold mining locals. Snodgrasses character should've known how 'ghostly' Preacher was as they sort of seduced each other towards the end of the movie. Preacher's ghostly existence is never cleared up so we are left wondering. This is smart and might've been how Clint wanted the audience to view Preacher. Did I smell a sequel. But overall a beautifully shot on location film. And Sydney Penny(Megan), she's just beautiful.</fullReview>

Now that's what I called armed and dangerous! Richard Kiel known as "Jaws" in the 2 "007" movies did very well playing the baron's stooge who later helped the preacher out without any hard feelings after he got "sledged".

But don't discredit PALE RIDER too much, I know that everyone will not agree, but this western is a classic in it's own right. Not Clint's best, but it helped keep his star power afloat, when he seemed to hit rock bottom in the late 80's and early 90's, until he came up with UNFORGIVEN (1992), his crowing achievement. An exciting western from start to finish, I give it a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PALE RIDER is one of only a handful of films that has really been able to capture the dustiness of a gold mining camp in the "Old West." To Mr. Eastwood's credit as Director, the short, sharp delivery of lines by all the actors develops this sense the most, with different accents suggesting to the viewer that people have come from all over to find their fortune in Carbon Canyon. Acting is fine all the way around, with Sydney Penny bringing something a little different for a Western: a kid in an important and believable role. The screenwriting may seem simple but it's superb, and adds to character development. That viewers can learn the difference between gold-panning, sluicing, and hydraulicking is a plus. Beyond the characters and acting, one could almost forget to notice the cinematography, which is often breath-taking. PALE RIDER is original, all-around entertainment, still fun to watch a decade and some years after its release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pale Rider has long been one of my favorite movies. Clint Eastwood saddles up again as star and director and he does a great job. Actually I recommend this for two scenes. The first, early on in the film, is when Megan (Sydney Penny) buries her dog, A beautifully shot forest landscape, she quotes the psalm of King David. "I shall not want" "but I do want" the dialog is fantastic and Penny does really well.The second scene involves her as well. When she confesses her feelings for the Preacher (Eastwood) and he gently turns her down. Both Clint and Sydney do very well here, its a heart-rending scene that always gets to me.This is not to say the movie isn't action packed. Clint has some great moments opposite Richard Kiel and the final showdown is one of the best ever in a western. The whole movie plays at once familiar and yet so engrossing. I'm not really a western fan, but this one is excellent. Rated "R" I assume for violence, but its actually fine for 13 and up.</fullReview>

Both feature Clint Eastwood as an honest man returning from the dead for revenge in the old West in a supernatural Western. Clearly, this one is superior on all levels. The movie does lend a lot from the classic "Shane" which explains it's superiority. The characters are not cardboard stereotypes as they are in the ridiculous "High Plains Drifter". You wonder what they will actually do, and even care about them. The homesteaders aren't wimps, but they can't protect their property against a tyrant's men and work it at the same time. The Eastwood character, too, is far superior. The high plains drifter was just some punk you didn't care a thing about, and was just plain rotten, not just out for revenge. This character has feelings that are much more believable. Thumbs up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Mixes Western and Allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In talking about COMES A HORSEMAN I discussed a curious switch in the stereotypes of the characters there - that Jason Robards was not the all powerful land baron that appears in say SHANE. Oddly enough the same thing happens with Richard Dysart in this film, but while COMES A HORSEMAN is set in the late 1940s, PALE RIDER is set in the late 19th Century.Dysart is seen at the start of the film returning from a business trip to the state capital. He is leaving the train, and his face is tired and somewhat discouraged looking. The big honcho of the local area he is approached by the sheriff and his deputies about the news he has to bring. And here it veers closer to Robards' in COMES A HORSEMAN, and further away from...say Forrest Tucker visiting the territorial governor in CHISUM. Dysart says that due to changes (more middle class voters in the state than formerly) his clout is not as big as it was a decade or so before - especially because of the local farmers and the rival mining interests. And he does not know if he can reverse the trend. Like Robards the big 20th Century rancher in COMES A HORSEMAN, Dysart is finding that he is on a potential slippery slope to bankruptcy.It is an interesting aspect of the westerns we were raised on. So many fortunes were torn out of the American west - frequently by less than honest means, that it is not usually recognized that many of these fortunes did not last. For every Leland Stamford or James J. Hill or Harriman (the railroad tycoon we never see in BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID), there were others like Haw Tabor (the basis for Edward G. Robinson's millionaire in SILVER DOLLAR) who lost it all in the end.It is not the only odd thing about PALE RIDER. Clint Eastwood took elements from the film SHANE, and combined them with a type of dark-viewed religious allegory. His character, "Preacher" has some ancient history with the sheriff and his deputies and Dysart - they talk of some threat in the past that they took care of, and there is evidence that Preacher was once seriously wounded (maybe left for dead). Yet the silent, relentless Preacher almost seems more than an avenger - like an angel of vengeance from the Lord, perhaps. The weakness (I feel) in the movie is Michael Moriarty. He tries hard, but does not seem as forceful a father and husband as Van Heflin was in Shane. But perhaps that is just as well.One final interesting point in the film: Richard Kiel. Best known as the oddly likable villain "Jaws" (in the later Bond films with Roger Moore), Kiel plays "Club" who is one of the workers/goons used by Dysart to do his dirty work. But he is also supposed to keep order in Dysart's business. When Chris Penn (Dysart's son "Josh") and some of the others start molesting a woman, Kiel actually runs over to try to prevent it. He is preempted by the arrival of Eastwood, who thrashes Penn and his buddy. Interestingly enough, Kiel enjoys seeing the would-be rapists punished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful symbolic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First time I saw this movie I was Around Eight and few scenes made a strong impression with me especially the killing of Megan's dog and the end fight against Stockburn. Now that I saw Pale Rider again and understood the meaning behind. The main theme is about the conflict between a corporation and individuals. In these frameworks the movie addresses the exploitation of natural and human recourses, corruption of government institutions while the Establishment is shown with good intentions but incapable or slow to act. The themes seem to make the movie actual now more then ever. There is typical western composition of good against evil while good prevails. A priest rides in and pulls the people together. While it doesn't seem enough he disbands his signs of religion and picks up a gun and takes out opposition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the greatest westerns of all times.. They don't make 'em like this anymore! Clint Eastwood is perfect in the role of the nameless preacher. You would sleep easy at night,knowing he is there to protect you. Of course the bad-guys in this film are great characters too. The seven evil deputies are so evil,that every movie hero would have a hard time to defeat them,but not the preacher.. Carrie Snodgress is also perfectly cast as the lonely farmers wife,and Christopher Penn has a great brake-thru as a young villain. But the real star of the film is Eastwood as the silent preacher, who rides away in the deep deserts of loneliness after killing all the bad guys, in a blaze of gunfire and bullets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie? Yes. Great movie? No.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't labour the point about the plot; this has been done to death in other posts, so please refer there if you want to know the story.For me, PALE RIDER will always be the movie that HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER would have been if it had been made for TV. Yes, it has a good finale - but even that feels watered down, lacking the drama of its predecessor. Where is the terror? Where is the fear? Where is the suspense? Stockburn's men are supposed to be cold-blooded killers - yet they stroll casually around the town as though on a Sunday School outing, waiting to be picked off. Hardly edge-of-the-seat stuff. And the whole is not enhanced by the score - straight out of Hart to Hart or Murder She Wrote.While HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER was a genuine morality tale, PALE RIDER is really not much more than a revenge caper. Rollicking good fun for a couple of hours, and no-one's going to be too disappointed - but ultimately it's the sort of movie that you can leave playing in the background while you go to crack open another beer.The real standouts in the whole movie (other than a more-sensitive-than-normal Eastwood performance) are the supporting performances of Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress, and, in particular, Sydney Penny. Penny is superb and fully deserving of the awards she won for this performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shane! Don't Come Back, Shane!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS.You know what would be an interesting exercise? Rent "Pale Rider" and "Shane" at the same time and run them back to back. Then have the subject assign each movie a score between one and ten, ten being best. The difference in scores can be interpreted as an ability to distinguish between original craftsmanship and trash. We will call it the "Cinematic Aesthetic Sophistication Scale," or CASS. "Pale Rider" isn't a shot-for-shot remake, such as "Psycho" has been subjected to a few years ago. Let's say it's a point-for-point remake. Every figure in "Shane" has it's corresponding figure(s) in "Pale Rider." The plot dynamics are as close as you can get, with only enough changes to mock the source -- sort of like the Lone Ranger's mask or a cartoon burglar's, a mask hiding a mask. It doesn't really conceal very much but allows for deniability.What there is good in "Shane" -- and that includes just about everything from location shooting to production design and acting -- is here coarsened and cheapened. Instead of being addressed to a family audience, it's aimed at the population among them suffering from ADD with hyperactivity.Instead of filling up ten pages with examples, I'll just give one briefly. In "Shane" an attraction develops between the gunfighter and the farmer's wife. It is absolutely unspoken. We get it only through the acting and George Stevens' direction. In "Pale Rider" it's all laid out for us, as if we were a kindergarten class. The kid brings it up. And the farmer's wife tells the gunfighter all about it before kissing him and saying, "I didn't want to go to bed the rest of my life wondering what it would be like." A tasteless scene. What a disappointment when the director has so little trust in his audience.Well, I said just one example, but I lied. Two more. (1) Gold prospectors, unlike farmers, aren't really interested in putting down roots, building schools and churches, raising families, etc. They want to get rich. This leaves the core of their motivation for staying hollow but it doesn't stop the writers giving us the same baloney about building a community for their families. (2) "Shane" is a violent film. Know how many shots are fired in anger? Seven shots, resulting in four (possibly five) deaths. In "Pale Rider" at least twice that many bullets is pumped into the writhing body of a single victim. He's only the first among many. Instead of one rival gunfighter, about eight are imported. The reason there are eight instead of just one is that it provides for a higher body count.Even considered apart from its source, "Pale Rider" isn't really very good. Eastwood turns in an uninspired performance. The supporting cast are grotesques. The farmer's son is turned into a juicy nubile young teenage girl, which is a nice touch, but she's not that much of an actress. The setting is depressing, and so is this movie.The movie makers got one thing right. The miners in California sluiced the western side of the Sierras and destroyed everything. You can still see the scars. Our grandchildren will never be able to stand in Fiddletown and say to themselves, "This is the way God made it." But nobody cares anyway -- not the film makers and not the audience it was aimed at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing particularly new,...but it all comes together so nicely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PALE RIDER is a breathtakingly beautiful movie to watch due to its being filmed in the mountains of Idaho. With just a touch of snow now and again, the picture looks almost like a travel brochure! Interestingly enough, the movie is supposed to be set in Northern California! While apart from the pretty location, there isn't a whole lot new or innovative about this film, though the sum total of the parts make for a dandy picture. Sure, the film very heavily borrows from SHANE (particularly with the very end--I almost expected the girl to yell out "Come back, SHANE!!!" instead of "I love you") as well as Clint Eastwood's other Westerns--particularly FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. But, despite all this and knowing where the picture is going, this movie is an absolute standout film.Particularly noteworthy is the acting by Michael Moriarty. He does a marvelous job of playing an ordinary man who is willing to stand up for himself--especially with the help of Eastwood. Eastwood's character, not unexpectedly, is an enigma--sort of like the "man with no name" in his much earlier films. Here, he is just known as "the preacher", though many times throughout the film it seems pretty unlikely he is a man of the cloth. After all, for a preacher, he does some mighty fine shooting and drinks whiskey (though not to excess, mind you). Perhaps he is supposed to be an ex-gunfighter who has taken the call. The ambiguity of the man actually is a good thing--as it allows the viewer the chance to think instead of having this spoon-fed to him or her. Richard Dysart, the late Christopher Penn, Richard Kiel and the rest do a fine job of support.About the only part of the film that just didn't ring true was the tiny portion of the film when the young girl went for a ride on the mule. Right in the middle of a MAJOR feud, she just wanders into the camp of the enemy and almost gets raped!! This part is just too dumb and inexplicable to understand. Removing it from the film would certainly tighten up and improve the film.Now, a comment about the music. Unlike the "Spaghetti Westerns" Eastwood made in the 60s, this film has a very minimalistic score. The over-the-top and crazy music from these earlier films was exciting and cool in a silly way. This much quieter film score seemed more appropriate for an older and wiser Eastwood. Both were about perfect for each type of film.Finally, although this movie is rated R, I really cannot understand why. Sure there's some gun-play and a couple guys get bullets in the head. BUT, the film really isn't that explicit and could have easily been rated PG-13 or possibly even PG! The language isn't a problem either and there is no nudity in the film. About the only objectionable content might be when a girl is almost raped, but I would feel comfortable if I let my teens see the film.</fullReview>

I know that not all will agree with me, but I'll say again, this western is a classic in it's own right, a big hit under Clint's belt, not his best, but it did enough during those times to keep his stardom alive, until he came up with UNFORGIVEN (1992), his crowning achievement.

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's best in a while</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood returns to the old west after a 9 year absence with Pale Rider. He plays a mysterious preacher who rides into a small mining town that is constantly being terrorized by a greedy land owner named Coy LaHood(Richard A. Dysart.) Eastwood is ultimately able to fend off many of LaHood's goons and wins the respect of the miners including Hull Barret(Law &amp; Order's Michael Moriarty) and his girlfriend Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgress). But then LaHood calls upon a brutal sheriff named Stockburn(John Russell) who is able to uphold the law according to the highest bidder with the help of his six deputies. This ultimately leads to what I think is one of the best shoot-outs ever filmed.This is my second favorite Clint Eastwood western with Unforgiven being my favorite. Eastwood has directed a lot of good movies in his career like the aforementioned Unforgiven and Pale Rider, Space Cowboys, and True Crime. But also several of his best movies are also his most underrated like Absolute Power, White Hunter Black Heart, Heartbreak Ridge, and Firefox.Pale Rider gets a 10/10. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good western but a little bit dated visually</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie for a free afternoon, with some wisdom and interesting characters, but that has suffered the pass of time in his visuals and in the way the plot develops.The plot of "Pale Rider" is easy enough that anyone will understand it: some people live in a small settlement where they search for gold, while the bad guy and his henchmen want to force them out and try to scare them constantly. After their last attack to the settlement, where they injure some of the people, break everything they can and kill a dog, the young Megan, the owner of the poor animal, asks for help while burying the little fellow, and, voila, Clint Eastwood, appears. I say Clint Eastwood because we have here the hard-looking, tight-lipped, no-time-for-silliness portrayal that made him famous in his spaghetti-westerns. It may be "Preacher" but it's not so far away from his other portrayals of mysterious gunslingers who will not stop for anything till they finish their mission.Even if it is not very original, the movie is good. The actors are good and do a great job to go through some ambiguous moments (as when they have to decide if accepting an offer to leave the settlement), even if it is a story of bad, very bad, and good, but flawed, people. Clint Eastwood is as good as ever, bigger than life, expressing a lot without doing actually much. The best part is seeing the struggle of all the people that have to live in a hard world, without knowing what will come tomorrow and if there is a point in what they are doing. If you like westerns you will enjoy it, and if you like Clint, probably too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Along with "Silverado", helped keep the Western alive in the mid-80's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Returning to the Western genre nine years after "The Outlaw Josey Wales", producer / director / star Clint Eastwood is found to be in fine form in this solid effort that adheres to a traditional formula. A peaceable community that mines for gold the hard way finds themselves threatened by a big shot corporate miner named LaHood (Richard Dysart). The young Megan (Sydney Penny) implores God to help her people and help comes in the form of a tight lipped "preacher" (Eastwood). The preacher is able to properly motivate the "tin panners" to stand up for themselves, while both Megan and her mother Sarah (Carrie Snodgress) find themselves falling for the stranger. LaHood retaliates against the community by hiring an extra special marshal, Stockburn (John Russell) and his silent, unsmiling deputies, who are all loyal to whomever pays them the most. "Pale Rider" is ultimately too obviously patterned after "Shane" and Clint's own "High Plains Drifter" for its own good, but it's really not bad at all either, benefiting from a decent, straightforward story, a right-to-the-point approach, and a couple of fine characterizations. The showdown in LaHoods' town is lacking in suspense as he has too little trouble with LaHoods' own group of goons and Stockburn and the deputies. Still, it's worth waiting for the inevitable confrontation between Preacher and Stockburn as a possible past acquaintance is established, and Russell is a fun, Lee Van Cleef like villain. The cast features a large number of familiar faces: Michael Moriarty as the decent and brave Hull Barrett, Christopher Penn as LaHoods' creepy son, the hilarious Dysart who hams it up as the slick slime ball, Doug McGrath as miner "Spider" Conway, towering Richard Kiel as the character "Club", and character players such as Charles Hallahan, Marvin J. McIntyre, Fran Ryan, Richard Hamilton, Terrence Evans, Robert Winley, Billy Drago, and John Dennis Johnston. As we expect and hope for in a Western, the landscape gets reverently photographed, here in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, and the period recreation is as fine as we could want as well. The action begins behind the opening credits, cranking up the tension, and the set piece that follows is very well orchestrated. The miners are reasonably sympathetic, for the most part, and the villains are all perfectly despicable, especially Penns' Josh LaHood, and anybody who's seen this movie can see why. There are some little bits of comedy, which does break up the tension, but this is mostly played straight and reasonably compelling. Overall, a good if not great Western. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best, In A Decade Of Too Few Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's only eighties western, this takes the metaphysical vibe of High Plains Drifter, tones it down a little, giving the main character a softer more moralistic edge, with the unarmed hero seemingly forced into picking up his guns as a last resort.The action isn't as plentiful as previous films, with the dramatic scenes more compelling than violent ones this time around. The script really knows how to push viewer's buttons, making a few pointed observations about standing up to evil, especially in a surprisingly powerful campfire meeting scene, where Michael Moriarty really shines.Speaking of Moriarty, he's a brilliant and eccentric actor, stealing nearly every scene he's in. He really should have been (and still be) given more roles in mainstream movies.As much as I enjoyed Pale Rider, I have to admit that silliness begins creep in while watching Eastwood dodge the advances of both Carrie Snodgress and her fourteen-year-old daughter! Also, the finale was way too reminiscent of Shane, nearly crossing the line into plagiarism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Clint Eastwood Western!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entertaining but derivative "Pale Rider" pales by comparison with the previous Eastwood frontier outings such as the epic saga "The Outlaw Josey Wales" and the supernatural opus "High Plains Drifter." Indeed, "Pale Rider" looks like a variation on "High Plains Drifter" right down to the opening and closing shots of Preacher riding down from the mountains. Although it doesn't surpass either earlier western, "Pale Rider" represents a polished, superlative example of the genre. Animal lovers may not approve of the senseless slaughter of a cow and a small dog. Clint wears an entirely different hat than he has doffed since the derby in "Joe Kidd." Meanwhile, it looks as if Eastwood intended this heavily atmospheric western as a tribute to the classic Alan Ladd western "Shane." A community of dirt-poor gold miners and their families suffer from the depredations of a wealthy land baron who uses water pressure to tear mountains apart to find gold. This older city slicker villain plans to run these miners out of the territory and then appropriate the land. The chief villain believes that it is only a matter of time until he can triumph over the 'tin pans.' What he doesn't count on is an enigmatic benefactor who shows up out of the blue and changes everything forever. Essentially, Eastwood appears to be paying tribute to himself, too, because "Pale Rider" shares a lot in common with "High Plains Drifter." The protagonist isn't a ghost, but he reveals little to nothing about his past, The scars of bullet holes on his back speaks more eloquently than anything the character could have said. Preacher is a character shrouded in mystery. Unlike the stranger in "High Plains Drifter," the hero in "Pale Rider" does not seem to be riding the revenge trail. "Gauntlet" scenarists Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack never explore our hero's murky past to see how he acquired so many gunshot wounds and survived. Nevertheless, as westerns go, "Pale Rider" qualifies as a good oater with terrific cinematography, uniformly fine performances, especially from Michael Moriarty, Doug McGrath, and Richard Dysart. Eastwood takes his own sweet time setting up the predicament. In "Shane," a youngster revered the gunfighter, but in "Pale Rider" the stranger is sought after by a young girl who has lost her dog and demands retribution. As iconic as Clint Eastwood was at this point in his stellar career, he could not have cast a more accomplished western actor than John Russell to serve as the secondary villain. Eastwood orchestrates several shoot-outs and close quarters combat with his usual flair. The opening fight scene in town where Preacher wields an ax handle to flatten a number of thuggish opponents is amusing. This scene is about as close as Clint Eastwood has ever gotten to martial arts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood develops as a Western director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "Pale Rider" and "The Outlaw Josey Wales" in the same day and you can see how Eastwood developed as a director in the period between them. I enjoyed "Pale Rider" more for a few reasons. "Josey Wales" is a fairly conventional revenge Western while "Pale Rider" has more depth.The movie begins as a small mining community being intimidated by gunmen hired by a local mining mogul, LaHood. He wants to take over the stream they are panning as he has exhausted all the other local gold sources with his industrial style mining techniques. We see a young Sarah Wheeler praying to God for help as she buries her pet dog that was killed in the latest attack. Simultaneously we see shots of the "Pale Rider" heading from the mountains (or heaven) to help the miners.The miners have just about given up but the arrival of the preacher (Eastwood) persuades most of them to stay on their legally held claims for a bit longer.Having rescued Hull Barrett (Michael Moriarty) in another confrontation with the gunmen he agrees to stay in his house in the mining village. Barrett shares this with Sarah Wheeler and her mother, who he has looked after since her father died. As the Preacher gives the gunmen something to think about he also attracts the attention of both Sarah and her mother.Eventually LaHood employs a Marshall and his gang to do whatever it takes to run the miners off their land. However it turns out that the Marshall and the Preacher have met before. Cue an exciting final shootout in a deserted frontier town.Pale Rider is unusual as a Western in a few ways. It is set in the mountains rather than the desert. The attraction of the Wheeler women to the Preacher is quite a large element in the movie. From the very beginning there are hints that the Preacher is not an ordinary man. Is he a ghost or an avenging angel sent by God in answer to young girls prayers? This is left satisfyingly unclear to the end.However there are plenty of familiar Western themes. A greedy rich man tries to rob poor settlers trying to make their fortune in the wilderness. And Clint Eastwood plays a man who can shoot through the palm of a man's hand from a hundred yards away! On many levels this stands as one of my favourite Eastwood directed movies.</fullReview>

Clint Eastwood embodies the subtle and stoic title role like an expert. His presence alone makes the film enjoyable. However, there is more to it than just that. The way the title character is presented is interesting and there are some nice allusions that suggest possibilities about who he really is. Some are mystical and spiritual, while others hint at back-story, and they make the Pale Rider is an intriguing persona in addition to being a classic "good hero" archetype.The presentation of violence and justice is also very smart. Watch for who kills and and who dies and you can clearly see a statement about violent force and its applications.Naturally, the film draws from many other sources including other westerns, but it is most definitely NOT shameless rip off. --- 8/10Rated R for violence</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An often overlooked Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Clint Eastwood is probably one of the most influential man in the Western genre, not only for his famous portrayal of the "Man with no name" series of characters in Sergio Leone's revolutionary "Dollars" trilogy; he is also responsible of directing several of the most important revisionist westerns (starting in 1973 with "High Plains Drifter" and culminating with his 1992 masterpiece, "The Unforgiven"), films that have helped the genre to evolve and survive through the many years it has been dormant. Among this films, "Pale Rider" often gets overlooked and diminished as a mere "Shane" (George Stevens, 1953) remake, however, more than a remake, "Pale Rider" is a complete rework of that film that adds Eastwood's own ideas about the genre deconstructing the legendary film and respectfully paying homage to the Western at the very same time.In a gold mining camp in the California mountains, the miners are abused by a ruthless landowner named Coy LaHood (Richard A. Dysart), who wants to take their lands using violent methods to try to force them to leave. As the conflict gets more violent, a mysterious preacher (Eastwood) arrives to town and soon joins the miners in their crusade against the landowner. Living with the miners, the Preacher becomes part of the family, quickly becoming friends with Hull Barret (Michael Moriarty) and his "girlfriend" Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgress), as well as the romantic interest of her teenage daughter Megan (Sydney Penny), who sees the Preacher as her ideal man. However, the Preacher has a mysterious past, and when LaHood brings a gang of hired gunmen to town, the secret of Preacher will come to light.Often labeled as a "Shane" remake, the story by Michael Butler and Dennis Shryack is more a homage than a remake; because even when it follows the basic pattern of that classic western, it gives the story a whole different context, adding spiritual meanings and themes that have more in common with Eastwood's previous "High Plains Drifter" (1973). In fact, it could be stated that "Pale Rider" is a revisionist homage to those two classics, oddly continuing the demythologization of the Western genre by telling the story of a myth. The tale of the Preacher is a tale that mixes two of Eastwood's favorite themes: vengeance and redemption.Clint Eastwood knows his westerns, and by this point in his career (and several ups and downs) he has completely developed his own style of Western movies: a perfect mixture of the gritty realism of revisionist westerns with a slight touch of the mythic Spaghetti Westerns that gave him his first big chance. While "Pale Rider" literally pales (no pun intended) in comparison to his better known westerns, it's another step in the evolution of a style that would culminate in "The Unforgiven" (Eastwood's final ode to the genre) and it's also an entertaining retelling of the avenging gunfighter tale that "Shane" made legendary.The character of the Preacher suits Eastwood like a glove, as it feels like an extension of his character in "High Plains Drifter" (although definitely in the opposite context), but with a higher spiritual meaning. A lonely but kind soul, the Preacher arrives to help the miners, but also to settle a score with the world that probably rejected him, and also definitely with himself. Michael Moriarty delivers a low key performance as Michael Moriarty, a humble friendly man who wants to fight back against LaHood, but lacks the confidence to do it. This lack of confidence is what makes him feel inferior and unworthy of the love of Sarah Wheeler. Carrie Snodgress' performance is very effective, although the real scene stealer is the late Chris Penn, who at his young age showed the enormous talent he had."Pale Rider" is a very good and quite original retelling of "Shane", a film that really attempts to be more than a mere homage; however, the story ends up being a bit simplistic (specially when compared to Eastwood's other "Shane" tribute, "High Plains Drifter"), and even when Eastwood's dark themes are present, it seems that he toned down the film a bit as it keeps an atmosphere similar to TV films (although of great quality), never as deep or dark as his previous meditations on the genre. Still, "Pale Rider" is an excellent Western, as even Eastwood's lesser works are miles ahead the others.Probably in 1985 Lawrence Kasdan's "Silverado" was the Western of the year, but "Pale Rider" did more than to play with Western clichés, it demythologized them and made them real. Just like "Shane" becomes a myth in "Pale Rider" we see the myth becoming real again. In short, "Pale Rider" is not a bad film, it's just that it definitely could had been a little more. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the Western genre dating back to the beginning of film making, it's not difficult to find movies that repeatedly make use of the same themes and ideas. One could make a case, I suppose, that "Pale Rider" was a remake of the Alan Ladd classic "Shane", and with some stretch you could also find similarities to practically every Durango Kid film starring Charles Starrett. Quite independently of other IMDb posts for this film, I had the thought myself (regarding "Shane"), but not until the very end when teen aged Megan Wheeler (Sydney Penny) wistfully calls after Clint Eastwood's Preacher character as he disappears into the wilderness.It's interesting that many of Eastwood's Western characters are men of inner strength. The Preacher is at the same time a most fitting yet ironic symbol in the 'man with no name' mythos, a man with a mysterious past who now wears a white collar. The revelation is made as a miner quarrels with his intended wife over the propriety of offering him comfort and a meal in their home. It's a cleverly done scene that changes the dynamic of the movie from a simple revenge tale.Also clever was wrapping the story around the Biblical Book of Revelations. The title itself is taken from Chapter Six, Verse Eight - "And I looked, and behold a pale horse..." It's actually a quite frightening passage that Megan reads, almost demonic in tone that portends unknown evil - "and his name that sat on his back was Death, and Hell followed with him".Much has been debated over the relationship between Preacher and Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgress), and my own initial inclination was that their union was consummated. Now I'm not so sure. Certainly there's ambiguity in the closing of the door to the cabin and the lights going out. However it's LATER in the story when Sarah desires to kiss Preacher one time so she can hold on to the memory of it. It seems to me a passionate night would have involved some kissing. Also, Preacher's arrival on the scene is marked with a certain moral courage to resist evil and stick up for the underdog. Betraying Hull Barrett (Michael Moriarty) by taking advantage of a woman's uncertain feelings toward her betrothed would be crossing that moral line. No such decision beguiled The Stranger in "High Plains Drifter", there his cause as a gun for hire was more clearly defined, and the 'taking' of a saloon girl was deemed to be in bounds.I always enjoyed John Russell as Marshal Dan Troop in the classic TV Western "Lawman", he with those spooky white eyes. Somehow I might even enjoy him more as a villain. His casting as hired gunman Stockburn helps lend credence to the doomsday scenario presented to the miners. The threat of his arrival prompts Hull's speech that gives the men the resolve to stay and fight against LaHood and his men. For another great Russell turn as a villain, check out the John Wayne film "Rio Bravo".Unfortunately, whenever I see Richard Kiel in any film at all, I always expect to see a grin revealing a mouth full of steel ('Jaws' in "Moonraker"). My question here, and one I'm consistently puzzled about - Why did he save The Preacher at Josh Lahood's mine camp? I can only surmise it was a measure of respect for the only man who ever defeated him, or at least caught him off guard long enough to knock him silly, while at the same time helping him get back on his horse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood continues his reign of incredible film making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now it's true it's been years since I've seen Unforgiven and I will see it again soon I hope but I remember thinking it was one of Eastwood worst films (entirely in my opinion.) Eastwood is one of my favorite actors and directors although I haven't seen a lot of his work on Westerns so it was with high expectations I watched Pale Rider, a brilliant, beautifully made Western that continues to establish Eastwood as one of the most talented men in film history. Pale Rider has a deep story line, gritty, real characters and still hammers home the essential Western recipe necessary to make it great. One thing about Westerns is I don't think it necessarily has to have any great actors or characters. Westerns really are all about the setting. The gun fights, the lonely small towns, the evil gangs, the saloons and so forth so when you get a Western that still keeps those necessities alive and then provides incredible characters it's a very important film and Pale Rider does that!! Clint Eastwood takes on his usual role as the hero...a mysterious rider only known as The Preacher. Eastwood does what he does best, he's macho and dark and gritty although I thought his performance as The Preacher had a little more depth than some of his previous Western characters. He has a past, he's mysterious and mystical and it all shows in his body language. Even his voice was a little less raspy. Nonetheless it's a stellar performance. Michael Moriarty gives a stand out performance as Hull Barret, the leader of a small camp of pan miners looking for gold. They and their families are constantly being harassed by a local big shot rich man and his family in an attempt to drive them off the land. During an unfortunate run in with some members of the LaHood family Barrett is saved from a brutal beating by the preacher. Moriarty shows some real strength and depth to his character and is a great hero that shows real emotions. Carrie Snodgress plays Barrett's love interest/fiancé Sarah Wheeler who unintentionally falls for The Preacher. Her role is rather drab and doesn't carry a lot of weight. I thought her character was more annoying than anything. Sydney Penny plays Sarah's daughter Megan. Her performance is quite well done and she too falls in love with The Preacher. She shows a lot of emotion and does well for a young actress. The late Chris Penn plays the "bad guy" Josh LaHood. He looks very young, and thin and a little green around the edges but he still has a scowl and way about him that makes him a mean bad guy. He doesn't stand a chance against Eastwood but very few actually do. John Russell plays Stockburn, the lawman hired to get rid of The Preacher and get the rest of them off the land. He's only in it briefly but his facial expressions and quiet tone makes you wish the battle between him and Eastwood lasted longer. The rest of the supporting cast are worthy and fit in well and everyone does a decent job.Eastwood as director is a perfect fit and by the time he made Pale Rider, he was an old pro. And Eastwood and Westerns are like Coffee and cream...a perfect match. The story is well done and interesting, the usual Western stereotypes are downplayed a little in order to provide a different sort of style that really draws you in. But it never deviates too much from what everyone loves about a Western. You have to be a fan of Westerns to appreciate them so if you are than Pale Rider is an absolute classic that must be seen. I only wish there had been a sequel or prequel to follow up on the entire back story because there was plenty there. Another Eastwood classic for sure!! 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as good as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly or the Outlaw Josey Wales. I would certainly rate this movie in the top 5 Clint Eastwood Westerns. The acting, dialog and plot are very good. I especially liked the Preacher's meeting with Stockburn and his deputies. It appears to me that the character of the Preacher may be the man with no name from High Plains Drifter. They are characters that suddenly appear, never state who they are or where they come from and help out in a crisis. They seem to be connected with someone who died violently prior to their arrival. They are made out to be avenging angels or demons. As further evidence of their being supernatural characters notice the bullet scars on the Preacher's back and Stockburn's wounds. In High Plains Drifter notice the flashbacks to the death of the sheriff. A definite must see for Eastwood fans. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood makes some films with big messages or deep themes. Then he makes other movies for pure entertainment. "Pale Rider" looks like the former but is firmly in the latter camp, with Clint putting on his cowboy hat one last time (almost) and giving his audience what it wants - bullet holes in bad guys.Clint is "The Preacher", a man of uncertain origins who inspirits a camp of prospectors to stand up to two sets of bad guys - first ruthless stampeders trying to chase the prospecting "tin-panners", then seven hired professional killers. Is the Preacher a pro himself? Why does he go to the aid of the miners? And what's the deal between him and the pretty middle-aged Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgress)?If you're looking for answers to these questions, you won't find them in "Pale Rider", which prefers to leave things in a ghostly haze. You will find some good lines, a terrific supporting performance by Michael Moriarty as a prospector named Hull, and immersive, textured camera-work from Bruce Surtees. Eastwood makes for reliable company here, even if he's hardly challenging either himself or us.You realize right away this is one of those 1980s Eastwood films where he's speaking in taglines when he confronts a group of rowdies about to set fire to Hull's goods. "You shouldn't play with matches", he says, a handy pail of water in hand.Later on he shoots a gun out of a man's hand with a revolver from 100 yards. When he goes into town to take on the hired killers, think not of Gary Cooper from "High Noon" but Freddy Krueger from "Nightmare On Elm Street" for the way the Preacher appears and disappears from behind woodpiles and under water troughs, leaving bodies in his wake. There's even a pretty teenage girl to bat her eyes at Eastwood, even if Sydney Penny comes across less as authentic frontier stock than a Smith débutante in need of a good face-scrubbing.Okay, I've gotten the Rex Reed out of my system. What's cool about "Pale Rider" is the way it delivers on the action-film expectations of its audience while throwing an occasional curve. It's a tense film from the opening scene, yet nobody gets shot for over an hour. When Eastwood has a confrontation with a strong man (the awesome Richard Kiel), it works as a comic relief without undercutting the movie's overall tough feel.The message of hanging tough against big odds is presented in an offbeat way - the head baddie, LaHood (Richard Dysart) tries to buy the prospectors off with what they have to admit is a fair offer. But how to react when the threat of violence is what makes them think of accepting? "One ounce of faith, they'll be dug in deeper than ticks on a hound" LaHood warns.That's especially true when Clint Eastwood's playing the guy backing you up. "Pale Rider" doesn't rise to the level of classic, but it works as fist-pumping entertainment. So score another for Clint the Squint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>white is bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comment is primarily an attempt to correct the "season/snow" reported goof. I think there is no goof here but intentional brilliant poetry instead. The town is the cold/frozen/winter place, because it's LaHood's place. In contrast, the digger's village is the warm/tempered/friendly place. When Spider is assassinated the nasty way by Stockburn's crew, the "darkest" scene of the movie, the town is completely covered by the snow. Then, in the final, the snow in town progressively disappears as the preacher cleans the place from the bad guys, and when the work is finished, there's no more snow at all. Many other examples... In summary, seasons (and visible consequences, e.g., clothes, light,...) fit to characters, states of minds, places, and action. Also, someone in the comments remarked that, surprisingly, the good guy is in black/dark clothes while the bad guys are in white/clear clothes. Snow is white. Big work of art I say!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale Imitation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actor/director Clint Eastwood shoots himself, so to speak, in this competent remake of a much better movie.He's still clinging-on to his youthful man-with-no-name image that Sergio Leone so skilfully crafted many years before. Here, the persona, like the man, is beginning to look a little threadbare.'Shane' set a wonderful standard of an (almost) nameless stranger reticently championing the cause of a community threatened by an avaricious villain. Alan Ladd cut a much more believable and human figure. He appeared as an ordinary bloke, whereas Eastwood had to be a preacher turned ken-do expert. A pretty unlikely combination. Shane got the micky taken out of him and a bloody good hiding. He also got shot, all of which - again - Eastwood's vanity evidently wouldn't stomach. The rather strange-faced boy of the earlier movie is here replaced by a young girl scarcely beyond the age of puberty. Quite what she would see in a grizzled old cuss like Eastwood is unclear. He must be old enough to be her grandfather in this portrayal. Perhaps it's his vanity showing again. The cut-and-shut editing between galloping horsemen and the peaceful mining community is a slightly over-laboured intro. And the final shoot-out is one of the biggest anti-climaxes in western history. That said; Eastwood does a competent job of trying to sanitise the mysterious man-with-no name persona and pad-out his character a little. The other players fill their parts well, even though most are little more than cameos. There are some sly little interactions between the lead characters. Though 'Spider's' drunken tirade is rather over-the-top, I think. Ambiance, lighting, sound and camera-work all deserve their due.Locations are extremely well chosen. There are some fine if chilly panoramas of America's snow-flecked 'big country' that remind me of 'The Shootist'. But the ending, with the kid hollering after the departed hero reminds us all too clearly where Eastwood found his inspiration, and how pale his imitation.It's a very competent movie in its own right, and well worth a watch. But it's also an inferior copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PALE RIDER is Clint Eastwood's retelling of the Alan Ladd classic, SHANE. Eastwood plays a supposed minister who rides into a small community beset by bad guys. In this case, the community consists of a mining camp living out of tents while the nearby town is run by a greedy capitalist type (Richard Dysart) and his minions. Dysart calls in a group of rough riders, headed by TV Western veteran John Russell, to finish Eastwood off. You can guess who finishes whom easily enough. Michael Moriarty of LAW &amp; ORDER fame is the head of the miners and Richard "Jaws" Kiel is one of the bad guys. The movie is not as good as SHANE but it has that unique Eastwood style to pull us through the slow moments. Russell's final confrontation with Eastwood echoes the final showdowns from several other Eastwood oaters, most notably A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pale Rider is for me the greatest Western ever made. It contains many elements that are found in other Westerns and many that have never been seen before or later. The exception being "High plains drifter", which had a shot at the same thing but failed terribly. That is because it made the central character somewhat evil, while Pale Rider imposes good on the same character, resulting in something completely different.Clint Eastwood plays who as usual has no name. But there is a twist on this character that transcends every Western ever made. I won't tell you the twist because it is the thing that blows my mind about this movie. The character is no different from what has been seen before, but the twist makes all the other characters around him different.Dark and funny, looking at evils of the modern world and evils of ancient times, this movie blew me away the first time I saw it.I love the gun fight at the end, for once I can believe one person can kill six others. This gun fight references the ninja "arts of invisibility". The battle of the axe handles is also nice too.Maybe a little bit slow for action fans, too mysterious for those who like modern gritty realist westerns and forget that what made the spaghetti westerns so great was the combination of realism and high concept.Greatly underrated for a whole range of reasons. Maybe it won't affect you like it affected me, but it should still be enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Clint's best, but a damn fine western anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pale Rider is often reputed to be below the standard of the rest of Eastwood's oeuvre, and this would seem to be the case, but even a lesser Eastwood film is a damn sight better than the majority of other westerns. This time, Eastwood stars as a more benevolent incarnation variation of his classic 'man with no name' character; a preacher that rides into a town that is being terrorised by a neighbouring landowner, intent on stealing the locals' land. Eastwood, after helping a man fend off some other men that are trying to steal his goods, finds himself at that man's home living with his fiancé and daughter. What we are then left with is a sort of mix between spaghetti western, and a story of an outsider living with another man's family. That, coupled with the central theme of the townsfolk being oppressed by their invaders makes gives the film a number of different angles.The film is slow to start, but unlike many films that are slow; this one is never boring. The drama and the way the scene is set is constantly engaging, and even through you're watching and want gunfights; I doubt that you'll get bored. Clint Eastwood directs and stars in the film, and does a great job at both. The way the landscape is photographed is spectacular, there are more than enough moments of tension, and the gunfights are very well staged. There's no need to go into Clint's performance as it's solid as always and overall, he proves why he's my favourite actor. Some actors just exude cool, and Clint is the coolest of the bunch. Despite having a slow start, the film still manages to boil down to one of the most exciting finale's in western history. In fact, the film is worth watching just for that. As I mentioned, there is a theme of invaders taking what isn't theirs going in this film, but other than that it's pretty thin on substance. Still, it doesn't matter because it's lack of substance is made up for with lots of fun and basically; if you like Westerns, you'll like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a mysterious stranger who comes to the defense of gold miners threatened by corrupt business interests, Clint Eastwood dusts off the lone gunman persona that first brought him big-screen success in the Sergio Leone directed spaghetti westerns. Slow moving at times but building to an exciting climax, the film is a bit pale when attempting to pay homage to (or ripping off) the highly acclaimed and overrated George Stevens western, "Shane," but nevertheless proves to be an entertaining ride. In many ways, this is a remake of Eastwood's earlier "High Plains Drifter," especially in its emphasis on the supernatural. The lead character, known only as Preacher, is presented as a mythic avenger; he may be human, he may be a ghost. Whatever he is, he's a familiar and effective act in Eastwood's repertoire. We've seen variations on this character in "A Fistful of Dollars" and its two sequels, and, of course, in "High Plains Drifter."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I like Pale Rider, I cannot believe the author of the novel Shane that the classic film is based on didn't sue for plagiarism. The only thing I can think of is that he must have allowed the copyright to lapse. Clint Eastwood reworked the plot of Shane to fit a mining camp located in a canyon where a big mine owner is looking to take over. The film opens with hired help of the mine owner, Richard Dysart, running through the place, shooting it up and causing general mayhem.Clint with clerical collar displayed is called 'The Preacher' although you see no sermons in this film. He's pretty handy with whatever it takes, fists, clubs and a six gun and upon his arrival in town helps out miner Michael Moriarty who is being set upon by five of Dysart's men. Moriarty ever so grateful takes him home to meet his intended and her daughter, Carrie Snodgrass and Sydney Penny.Alan Ladd's Shane was a quiet peaceable sort whose manner belied his skill with a weapon. Clint Eastwood's Preacher is borrowed a whole lot from his character in High Plains Drifter. As a preacher, he must definitely favor the angry old vengeful Deity of the Old Testament. None of these bad guys gets much of a chance at redemption.Pale Rider is Clint Eastwood's homage to Shane redone to fit his style of western hero. Definitely not your parent's Shane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a Californian town miners and their wealthy boss Coy LaHood (Richard Dysart) are harassing gold prospectors and their families. Coy LaHood wants them to give up their land to him. Then there helped out by a mysteriously hardened preacher (Clint Eastwood) who rides into town and unites the dejected prospectors and causes havoc for Coy LaHood and his men. So, LaHood hires a group of corrupt sheriffs to finish off his dirty work. This is when the town learns that there is an other side to this actual preacher.Clint Eastwood's film might be a lesser western that doesn't reach the great heights of his previous efforts and it does falls into the same old formula, but otherwise it's still a gripping and exciting tale for most part, even if it does lack its own style and grace in execution. Though, what didn't lack grace was the top-notch location photography of the beautiful mountain scenery. The screen's background was filled with a rich and stunning colour scheme. The premise is interesting, but it does have that been-there-done-that feel and it does skim some plot details. Though, it does capture in detail the relationship and emotions of these characters superbly. The routine plot does very much draw from such films like "Shane" and "The High Plains Drifter". There's religious imagery abound and even a supernatural hint to Eastwood's character, but we don't really learn anything about it. Especially, with the confrontation between the Preacher and the Sheriff. The script was a bit uneven (rather stilted) and actually there's a lot of dialogue. Long speeches and conversations fill the film, but they're hardly tedious. There is also some nice added wit evident and that goes well as most of the tone is rather depressing in nature.Eastwood's direction convincingly adds suspense and creates some well-staged sequences of nasty violence (terrific opening and the riveting finale showdown). The entertaining last half an hour shows how dynamic it actually could've been. He generates some surprises throughout, but mostly it's predictable. The pace of the film does fill drawn out, by taking its time to build up the action, but it's worthwhile waiting for. A good job was done on the flowing and natural cinematography. It captured the vivid backdrop beautifully and also with the shadow and lighting. A slowly paced and effective layered music score sooths with such force and mystique. A good cast is on show and they give strong performances. The chemistry between the leads is solid. Eastwood as the Preacher has such a great presence and adds to the viewing. The likes of Michael Moriarty and Chris Penn actually surprised me with such absorbing performances. Carrie Snodgress was tremendous and Richard Dysart made the most of his standard character. Sydney Penny gave a delightful performance and there's an amusing small cameo from Richard Kiel.It maybe isn't that original, but it's a decent waste of time and actually better than some other westerns. It's mainly for fans of the genre or Eastwood only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Who are you? Really" This question asked by Sarah (Carrie Snodgrass) to Clint Eastwood's unnamed character is really the overarching question of the movie. Who was this mysterious preacher/gunfighter who showed up (apparently in answer to a prayer for a miracle from young Megan) after a group of toughs from a mining company had showed up in an attempt to terrify a group of local prospectors off their land? There's a lot of typical western-style action in this movie, leading up to the final climactic gunfight, but I didn't see this really as a western. It was more of a spiritual fantasy set in the context of the old west, with an interesting albeit fairly characteristic performance by Eastwood, and a supporting cast that tended to fade into the background in comparison. Some of them were just not that interesting (Michael Moriarty generally does little for me) and some were just plain silly (Richard Kiel was playing another Richard Kiel-type character - the big, scary almost voiceless guy with bad teeth.) It was that spiritual component that caught and held my interest, though, and it all revolves around that question; "Who are you? Really?"Clearly, the movie is a classic good vs. evil battle. Eastwood and the prospectors are the good guys, while LaHood and his hydraulic miners are the bad guys. That's clear-cut. The spiritual component is brought out by Eastwood being an answer to prayer, by his character being somewhat loosely based on the pale horse and its rider Death from the Book of Revelation, by the beautiful and serene mountains which were often the backdrop to the movie, and by Megan's description of LaHood's mine - it looks like "hell." But who are the combatants representing? Is Eastwood an angel, with Marshall Stockburn (who's brought in by LaHood to fight it out with him) being a demon? Or - thinking about LaHood's reaction to Eastwood coming calmly out of the diner after doing in several of his boys single-handedly ("Jesus!") - is this a Christ (Eastwood) vs. Satan (Stockburn) portrayal? If this is really being based on the Revelation passage, the latter would seem unlikely, since "Death" in the Book of Revelation is not Christ - Christ is the "Lamb" opening the seals that release death and his pale horse. So, ultimately, the actual identity of Eastwood's character is something of a mystery - which is appropriate, since his appearance, victory and disappearance is left as a mystery to the prospectors who are left in his debt.This is a decent enough movie with some content that's a bit silly. The good vs. evil issue is perhaps a bit too clear-cut, the characters on either side being perhaps a bit too extreme, but Eastwood certainly makes it fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pale Rider (1985) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A prospector village is being harassed and killed by an evil group of miners but a mysterious preacher (Clint Eastwood) comes to their aid. Eastwood's return to the genre that made him a star keeps getting better with each new viewing as the director has so many unanswered questions that you can't help but think and feel different things each time you view it. The secrets to the preacher are never fully answered so it's up to the viewer to come up with whatever they feel is best and its this mystery that makes this film seem so fresh and original. We've certainly seen movies where the mysterious man must save a group of people but this one here is so surreal and full of atmosphere you can't help but feel the material is original in its own right. I think visually speaking this was the director's most interesting film to date. I loved out the indoor scenes are so dark and moody that they built a certain loneliness to the characters. This is especially true of the mother (Carrie Snodgress) and her daughter (Sydney Penny), both of whom begin to have feelings for the preacher. I think their relationship or feelings for the preacher could have been expanded or explained somewhat more than they are but that's just a minor issue. Eastwood was already a legend by the time he made this film but I think he uses that to his benefit and that of the character's. I love the way we never really see his character but instead just witness bits and pieces of him. We'll see his eyes, his mouth or his whole figure but only in ways, which just add to the mystery. The supporting cast is equally good with Penny nearly stealing the film for me. Michael Moriarty, Chris Penn and Richard Keil are all very good in their supporting roles. There's plenty of excellent shoot outs and other violent scenes but the greatest sequence in the movie is a quiet one. The best scene happens when the town must decide if they should sell off their land or stay there so that they can go for their dreams. This discussion is the quietest moment in the film but it's also the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood directs and stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>like many of his western character,Eastwood starts in this film as a quiet mysterious loner.he ends up helping people out,and ends up on someones else's' bad side as a result.his character is known as Preacher in the movie,but he's not you typical preacher,and he's much more than that.Eastwood also directed and produced this film.this isn't an action packed western.it's more drama than anything,but the dialogue is good,as is the acting.John Russel is particularly impressive,who plays a lawman of sorts.even though he has a pretty small role,he has great screen presence and charisma.as far as western go,this one sticks to most of the tried and true conventions,but the characters are interesting.not one of the best westerns ever made,nor one of Eastwood's best as either director or actor.still,it is a decent 115 minutes or so.my vote for Pale Rider:7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PALE RIDER (1985) ***1/2 Clint Eastwood, Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress, Richard Dysart, Christopher Penn, Sydney Penny, Richard Kiel. Symbolism runs rampant in Eastwood's paean Western casting himself as a variation on "The Man With No Name", Preacher, who helps a gold-mining family against a land baron cartel. Lean direction by Clint and some handsomely shot sequences mixes well with his laconic stoicism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but no Leone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pale Rider is great, has a nice story and a rather open end (to me). If you love westerns, it's a must. However, being a Leone fan, I can't help comparing Westerns to Leone's spaghetti westerns. IMHO, Pale Rider is not as good as those classics, probably caused by the lack of tense-building music scores and the brilliant Leone camera movements, which i really love. Nevertheless, it's fun to watch and has some really nice scenes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Shane, no, er, Josey, I mean, ah, Man-With-No-Name guy, oh, shoot, eh, Preacher!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For folks who want to watch good actors struggle through a ridiculous mish-mash of about four or maybe fourteen other westerns, their Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider, an embarrassingly bad movie that doesn't pay tribute to, but rips off everything from High Plains Drifter to Josey Wales to Shane (with enough people from John Carpenter's The Thing to have you looking for the morphing monster popping up somewhere).Clint looks catatonic, but you're rooting for him to take care of Richard Dysart as a predatory mine owner and all the lackey scumsuckers on his payroll that he uses to drive out the meadow-muffin villagers (under the command of Michael Moriarty, a very tall man who looks like a dwarf here to avoid upstaging Clint). Dysart even uses hydraulic mining, which is supposed to offend the environmentalists in the audience--Egads, they are despoiling Mother Earth so they must pay! By the end of the movie, the Preacher (Clint in a clerical collar--maybe the same one he wore in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot) has methodically greased the baddies (one of them takes a forty-four round in the forehead and, I swear, crosses his eyes as he collapses; there were people giggling in the audience, which is never a good sign for a movie), saved the villagers, chopped the wood, milked the cows, and given a teenage girl a tremendous case of the hormonal vapors.As Clint rides off into the sunset, the kid stands there crying out for him, "Preacher! Come back, Preacher!" Some smart aleck behind me couldn't help but shout, "Forget the preacher--get Shane in here!" Not a good sign for a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Questioning unanswered questions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really must admit that while the movie, as a whole, made sense from start to finish, it left me with more questions than when I started. Now I haven't seen this film in a while, so excuse me for working off memory, but this film seems to be a sequel to a film that doesn't exist. This film that was never made i will, for the purposes of this exercise, refer to as "The Gun-Slingin' Preacher Stranger." In the GSPS I am sure that we, the viewing public, would have been made aware of who the hell Clint Eastwood is and how and why he knows the guy who says, "It's you" right before Clint Eastwood shoots him in Pale Rider. Of course, because that man is now dead, and Clint Eastwood says 28 words for the entire film, our chances of understanding any history of the film and its characters have been snuffed out like Bruce Samazan's career. I also assume that the GSPS would inform us as to why it is that Clint Eastwood is on the road in the first place; in fact, it might explain why Clint Eastwood is a preacher who shoots his gun more than he opens his Bible. Possibly it is all a con, giving Clint Eastwood the means to fraternise with 14 year old cowgirls. Armed with what little knowledge this film gave me of the wild west, if I was in that era I would, without a doubt, wear a black shirt and a white band about my neck to gain easy access to people's homes. The point I'm trying hopelessly to make, is that it would be very easy to pose as a preacher in that time, because I don't believe at any stage Mr Eastwood did any preaching. And if he did and I was getting a cup of tea at that time and missed it, well it was probably as short as "amen". I digress, the GSPS would, I am certain, have given us adequate information about how and why The Gun-Slinging Preacher Stranger got access to enough steroids to break apart that enormous boulder with his bare hands. Surely they didn't have the scientific means at this time to accomplish such feats of strength. I'm not sure the Green Goblin would have been able to pull that one off; regardless, it was impressive. I enjoyed this movie, it is one of my favourite westerns and I've seen 4 (that includes Back to the Future 3 and Blazing saddles). I enjoyed it so much, I really wish they had made "The Gun-Slinging Preacher Stranger". This, however, does not change the fact that none of the questions that would obviously be asked by the viewer watching the movie were answered. Enough hooks were placed throughout the film to get you interested and want to find out what was happening and who he was, yet, as I said, none of them were answered. I know that many people would read this and say, "Well that's what the ever so clever director wanted, you *@#&amp;$# ^%*#@( ignoramus (#*$#&amp;$* unhealthy loins *($&amp;#^#@&amp;!@!!!!!!!!" And fair enough, he's allowed to want that and not every film has to answer all the question, or, in this case, any of them. At the same time, I don't have to like it. It annoyed me. Righto, good movie, see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film but a shameless "remake" of Shane</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the beginning, with the stranger riding into a family's life and helping them and their friends hold on to their land, until the final scene when the young daughter of the family he helped runs after the stranger shouting "We love you........ I love you" when he's leaving forever, the film has most of the better scenes and the general plot of the classic Western "Shane". Other films which are shameless ripoffs of earlier and often better f films would be "Fatal Attraction" copying the plot of "Play Misty for Me" and "Sharky's Machine" copying the plot of"Laura". Are we running out of ideas for movie plots? It's also happening in the recording industry. When Johnny Cash records a poor version of "I've Been Everywhere", the great country song written and recorded by Hank Snow; "Turn around Bright Eyes", Bonnie Tyler's great recording (and even greater video) recently redone by I don't know who; and, when a country pair performs a lousy duet of Elvis's great - and my Elvis favorite - "We're Caught in a Trap", there is a major fault here. There are some original movies and recordings that can never be improved on and should never be copied.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare 1980's Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to give Clint Eastwood some credit here for even making a Western in the 1980's. Along with the 2000's, it was the worst decade ever for Westerns. This is a good movie. It is a conscious remake of "Shane" and "High Plains Drifter".I gave it five stars out of 10 in IMDb, which is average for me. It scored 13 points in my ranking system, way ahead of "Shane" and one point ahead of "High Plains Drifter".Here's what I liked:- Mysterious stranger?.Clint Eastwood. 'Nuff said. I'm in.- This movie improved on "Shane" in just about every respect, not just getting rid of Alan Ladd's $1,000 Hollywood hairdo and ridiculous yellow buckskins. What I liked best, though, was that Clint set things right in terms of the stranger's relationship with the child. Shane had no interest in the mom, Jean Arthur, and director George Stevens focused on a creepy homo erotic relationship with a young boy. The Preacher, on the other hand, rejects an understandable crush by a pubescent girl and sleeps with her mom instead. - Nice "Shane" copycat location shoot. The Idaho mountains in the movie look eerily like the Grand Tetons from "Shane".- The central henchman, John Russell, is very effective, along with his six deputies. Again note the similarity between the murder of the miner in the street and the murder of Elisha Cook by Jack Palance in "Shane".Now here's what kept the movie from being better: - I liked the idea of remaking "Shane". It really needed to be remade. But "High Plains Drifter"? OK, movie, but I think one was enough.- I didn't get Michael Moriarty and Carrie Snodgrass in this. Poor casting.- The mining valley sets were claustrophobic. Getting stuck in one place is always a hazard in "small settler vs. land baron" Westerns. Eastwood solved this beautifully in "High Plains Drifter" by building a set on the shore of Mono Lake in California.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pale Rider</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Produced by, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, this film doesn't exactly jump out at you, so no wonder I didn't pay full attention. Basically a gold mine camp is being invaded by the nasty landowner intent on stealing what they find, and he has support from the sheriff. Young girl Sarah Wheeler (Carrie Snodgress) prayed to the lord for deliverance to stop the violence, and along comes the mysterious Preacher (Clint Eastwood), and is sticking around to fend off the villains. There's some rock bashing with sledge hammers, finding gold (twice), a bit of bickering, and a final shoot-out at the end, that's really all there is to it. Also starring Michael Moriarty as Hull Barret, Chris Penn as Josh LaHood, Richard Dysart as Coy LaHood, Sydney Penny as Megan Wheeler, The Spy Who Loved Me's Richard Kiel as Club, Doug McGrath as Spider Conway, John Russell as Stockburn, Charles Hallahan as McGill, Marvin J. McIntyre as Jagou and Fran Ryan as Ma Blankenship. This film didn't really excite me much, and the small moments that did stick out really were small, so all in all, an alright film, but not one I can see myself watching again. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So-so Eastwood Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I expected too much seeing how this is a Clint Eastwood film, directed and produced by Clint Eastwood. The story is solid enough, peace loving "tin panners" in a mining settlement are harassed by the greedy big corporate miner. Along comes a mysterious stranger who will work to save these innocent hard working folk. Sounds like a great plot doesn't it? Unfortunately, that is all this movie really offers, a good plot. The entire production seemed to have a "made for TV" feel. The music used seemed really generic. There were no stunning revelations or major plot twists offered. The shootout scenes were only that, shoot out scenes. Eastwood's character seems to have no rival, wherever he is, he takes care of business. It would've been nice to have a little more background revelations about this "stranger in town". Worth a look, but not the classic I expecting.</fullReview>
