		<shortDescription>Do you Mind if I Call you Chico?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two dysfunctional brothers (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) get tired of competing for who is the bigger f***-up and who Daddy (Albert Finney) loves more, so they hatch a hair-brained scheme to rob Mommy and Daddy's jewelry store so that they can clear their debts and start fresh. Sounds like a great plan except that this is a suspenseful 1970's style melodrama about a heist gone wrong, and boy, do things really go wrong here for our hapless duo and everyone involved. Lasciviously concocted by screenwriter Kelly Masterson and classically executed by director Sidney Lumet, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" uses the heist as its McGuffin to delve deep into family drama.Contrary to popular belief, Sidney Lumet is not dead. At age 83, he has apparently made a deal with the Devil to deliver one last great film. Lumet was at his zenith in the 1970's with films like "Dog Day Afternoon," "Serpico," and one of my favorite films of all time, "Network". He has somehow managed to make a film that bears all the hallmarks of his classics while intertwining some more modern elements (graphic sexuality, violence, and playing with time-frames and POV's) into a crackling, vibrant, lean, mean, and provocative melodrama. One can only hope that some of the modern greats (like Scorsese or Spielberg) who emerged during the same decade Lumet was at the top of his game will have this much chutzpah left when they reach that age.Lumet is a master at directing people walking through spaces to create tension and develop characters. As the cast waltzes through finely appointed Manhattan offices and apartments his slowly moving camera creates a palpable sense of anxiety as we never know who might be around the next corner or what this person might do in the next room. Also amazing is how Lumet utilizes the multiple POV and shifting time-frame approach. The coherent and classical presentation he uses makes the similarly structured films of wunderkinds Christopher Nolan and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu seem like amateur hour.Of course, what Lumet is best at is directing amazing ensemble casts and tricking them into acting within an inch of their lives. Philip Seymour Hoffman has never been, and most likely never will be, better than he is here. Albert Finney's quietly searing portrayal of a father betrayed and at the end of his rope is a masterpiece to watch unfold. Ethan Hawke, normally a nondescript pretty boy, is perfect as the emotionally crippled younger brother who has skated by far too long on his charms and looks. The coup-de-grace, however, is the series of scenes between Hoffman and Marisa Tomei, eerily on point as his flighty trophy wife. Lumet runs them through the gamut of emotions that culminate in a scene that is the best of its kind since William Holden taunted Beatrice Straight right into a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in "Network." The Devil of any great film is in the details, from Albert Finney's tap of his car's trunk that won't close due to a fender bender, to the look Amy Ryan (fresh off her amazing turn in "Gone Baby Gone") gives her ex-husband Ethan Hawke at his mawkish promise to his little girl all three of them knows he won't keep, to the systematic unraveling of a family on the skids, to the dialog begging for cultists to quote it (my favorite line being the hilariously threatening "Do you mind if I call you Chico?") to the excellent Carter Burwell score. "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is the film of the year. If something emerges to best it, then we know a few other deals must've been brokered with Old Scratch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Sidney Lumet Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an extraordinary crime thriller!! My wife and I saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival. It's already my second favourite film of all-time after DR. STRANGELOVE and I was definitely on an emotional high as I walked home and discussed the film with my wife.I don't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this calibre are best enjoyed without preconceptions. A synopsis that I'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke, are planning to rob a jewellery store in Westchester, New York. The film bounces back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time (before, during and after the robbery), and one key scene is repeated at least three times. Ordinarily, that could disrupt the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece. The excitement, the tension, and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed. By the end, I was on the edge of my seat breathlessly waiting to see how it would all wrap up. I know that I've used a few clichés in this post, but I literally was on the edge of my seat. I should mention that the non-linear storyline is quite easy to follow. This isn't the sort of movie where you'll overhear audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie.The acting is absolutely brilliant all-around, and I doubt I would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn't been so perfect. A tiny complaint is that Hoffman and Hawke don't look like brothers, but that's a minor quibble that I can easily overlook. Hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with Hawke were positively electric. Marisa Tomei (as Hoffman's wife) and Albert Finney (as the father of Hoffman &amp; Hawke) are also very good in supporting roles. Even some cameo performances were so impressive that I can still remember every remark, gesture and facial expression by Brian O'Byrne and Michael Shannon ? absolute perfection. The robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene I've ever watched, and I had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes, especially the ones with Hoffman. The music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie, often the same notes played over very effectively. I had the music playing in my head the following day, even as I sat through other films. In addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph, there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable (major spoiler, so I can't describe the scene). Otherwise, this film is pretty darn close to perfect.There were about a dozen great films at the festival that I would enjoy watching a second time but BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD stands in a league of its own. As an aside, the director Sidney Lumet spoke before the film and he introduced Marisa Tomei and Ethan Hawke onto the stage. Tomei didn't speak and she acted a bit shy so Lumet asked "Can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera-shy?" That comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than the sum of its parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Says Andy: "Nobody gets hurt, everybody wins." Before he says it, we know the opposite is true: Everybody gets hurt, nobody wins. This is a new strand in American movies, or perhaps an old strand brought back at long last. Think "Eastern Promises", "There Will Be Blood", "No Country for Old Men". These movies are dark, serious, extremely well made, and don't care about happy endings. I love them. "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" fits the general description, but creates an atmosphere all its own. Kelly Masterson's debut script is as close as a Hollywood movie will ever get to a Greek tragedy. Paying tribute to fellow veteran director Stanley Donen, Sidney Lumet expertly and soberly turns the sombre story into an outstanding, old school character drama. The opening shots, although of an obese accountant doggy-styling his trophy wife, have the look and feel of a Dutch master's painting. By contrast, the drug dealer's condo looks more like a string of Mondrians. Great performances all around. Only Albert Finney's character Charles feels a little over-acted, eyes wide and mouth agape almost all the time. But then he is in trouble deep, deeper than any of the troubles most of us will ever know. For compensation, Marisa Tomei is super hot. But of course you don't need me to tell you that. Why her character Gina would want to be with a guy like Andy, we're never told, but that's okay. Action is character, after all. The unique and magic touch of Carter Burwell's music makes this fine movie a masterpiece. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet does Tolstoy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sydney Lumet hasn't had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at 83 has managed to churn out a tight, well-cast, suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground, New York City. (How he got insurance, let alone the budget after all those flops, is a mystery also). The story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene.Two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents. The only victim is going to be the insurance company. The robbery goes awry and two people die. Most of the film is concerned with the aftermath. The action is non-linear and seen from the main character's differing points of view, but it is not difficult to follow. What is not so easy to work out is the back story ? how did the brothers get into such a mess? There are clues ? the younger brother being the baby of the family is his fathers' favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of baggage about his relationship with his father, and vice versa, but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin-using murdering embezzler.As the scheming older brother, a corpulent Philip Seymour Hoffman dominates the film, but he is well supported by Ethan Hawke as his bullied, inadequate younger brother. Albert Finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that. Marisa Tomei as the older brother's cheating wife at the age of 42 puts in the sexiest performance I've seen in many a year. The film literally starts with a bang, but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly.I don't know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter Kelly Masterton but I suspect that like Lumet's great 70's film "Dog Day Afternoon" it is based on fact ? it's too silly to be untrue. Lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old-time craftsman studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them. Some great films were produced that way as well as some classic turkeys. This isn't a classic of either sort ? it's a well-crafted piece of downbeat entertainment. It will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one, but still wondering as to how they got that way. We do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys. (There is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant). Well, like Tolstoy, we have to conclude that "each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Not a Feel-Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit that this is the type of film that I would normally eschew, but I rented it basically because of the stars. I certainly was not sorry. In fact, as you see, I rated it five stars. This film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting.Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents' jewelry store. The crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the Hanson family. Through a series of flashbacks, we get to know Charles Hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons.Younger brother, Hank is basically a screw-up. He has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind. Hank is insecure, cowardly, and very much under the influence of his big brother. Ethan Hawke has the character of Hank "nailed to a T" and gives what is probably his best performance thus far. He shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task.Andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman, but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit. It is Andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents' store, and he gets weak-willed Hank to commit the act. Philip Seymour Hoffman - surely one of the finest actors of our time - plays Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who, on the surface, is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath. He is absolutely perfect for the part of Andy or it might be said that he, through his superior acting skills, made Andy the perfect part.Albert Finney plays a father common to his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man, but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself. He has always been too quick to criticize and admonish. He always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and Andy. As we get to know Charles and Andy, the thought of Andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable.On a personal note, I cannot believe how much Charles Hanson reminded me of my own father, and how much Andy and Hank reminded me of my own brother and myself. Perhaps this may be one of the reasons that I enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant, critical father, a more successful older brother, and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home. Fortunately, my brother and I never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents- guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff.This complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director, Sidney Lumet. At eighty-three, he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge-of-seat action that hypnotizes. 12 Angry Men was his first film made fifty years prior to Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered.The events and characters in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead are harsh and unattractive, and this is definitely not a feel-good movie. However, it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which I thoroughly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treads familiar ground but does it with grand, depressing intensity and fantastic style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of 2007's films. If 2004 was the year of the biographies and 2005 was the year of the political films, 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide plethora of morality tales, films that portray, test, challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things. Although this identification is rather broad, I think that there are a handful of films released this year, such as 3:10 To Yuma, Eastern Promises, American Gangster, No Country for Old Men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or treachery. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a deviously stylish morality tale, and quite a dark, bleak and depressing one at that. And even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time, the legendary Sidney Lumet, who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this viciously rich crime thriller.It's one of those films whose plots are so thick, that one is very reluctant to go into details. It is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold, as there are twists and turns. But the thick and richly wrought plot is not at all at the center of this film; the true focus is, as I mentioned, the morality tale; the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film. In a plot structured like a combination between the filmographies of both The Coen Brothers (namely Blood Simple and Fargo) and Quentin Tarantino, we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly, ridiculously wrong, and reciprocates with full force and inevitable tragedy. And to make it all the more interesting, the film is told in a fragmented chronology that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time. Sizzling, sharp, thick and precariously depressing, Kelly Masterson's screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded, in particular because it is a debut screenplay.But the film has much more going for it than just it's delectably sinister and quite depressing plot. First and foremost, the picture looks and feels outstandingly well. Sidney Lumet has, throughout his career, consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting: naturalistic and yet stylish at the same time. The film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class, with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great. Editing is top-notch; combining the sizzling drama-thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action accordingly. And vivid, dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style. The film is also backed by a fantastically succulent musical score by Carter Burwell.The screenplay does its part, and of course Lumet does his part, but at the film's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances. First and foremost, there are the two leads. Leading the pack is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon newfound leading-man status after his unnaturally fantastic Oscar-winning performance in Capote. His turn in this film is fascinating: severely flawed, broken, manic. Hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out, and not just his subtlety and wit. At his side is Ethan Hawke, who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater, grander actors. Here, he bounces off Hoffman and complements him so incredibly well; in all, the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing, the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it's watching actors. And then there's Albert Finney. Such a supple, opulent supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here Finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the tragically obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime. I love how the dynamics between the three of them play out. I love how Hoffman is clearly the dominant brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they're middle-aged men; and yet despite this, it is clear how Finney's father favours Hawke's younger, weaker brother. Also on the topic of the cast, the two supporting female characters ? wives of the brothers ? also feature fantastic performances from Amy Ryan and Marisa Tomei, whose looks just get better and better as the years go by.This film isn't revolutionary. These themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of The Coen Brothers, and it's very easy to imagine them directing this film. But for a film that treads familiar ground, it simply excels. Lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to Masterson's brilliantly vivid, intense, and morbidly depressing first-time screenplay. The lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from Hoffman, Hawke and Finney; but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a Lifetime Achievement Oscar, much revered as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business, Sidney Lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful, resonant, intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet brings another masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sidney Lumet has made some masterpieces,like Network,Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico.But,he was not having too much luck on his most recent works.Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting,but failed experiment.Now,Lumet brings his best film in decades and,by my point of view,a true masterpiece:Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.I think this film is like a rebirth for Lumet.This movie has an excellent story which,deeply,has many layers.Also,I think the ending of the movie is perfect.The performances are brilliant.Philip Seymour Hoffman brings,as usual,a magnificent performance and he's,no doubt,one of the best actors of our days.Ethan Hawke is also an excellent actor but he's underrated by my point of view.His performance in here is great.The rest of the cast is also excellent(specially,the great Albert Finney) but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic Oscars.The film has a good level of intensity,in part thanks to the performances and,in part,thanks to the brilliant screenplay.Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction,a great screenplay and excellent performances.We need more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Family Implosion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The full title of this film is 'May you be in heaven a half hour before the devil knows you're dead', a rewording of the old Irish toast 'May you have food and raiment, a soft pillow for your head; may you be 40 years in heaven, before the devil knows you're dead.' First time screenwriter Kelly Masterson (with some modifications by director Sidney Lumet) has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes. In this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but, here, very sensible manipulation of the flashback/flash forward technique of storytelling. By repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale, we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong. Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a wealthy executive, married to an emotionally needy Gina (Marisa Tomei), and addicted to an expensive drug habit. His life is beginning to crumble and he needs money. Andy's ne're-do well younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife Martha (Amy Ryan), is behind in alimony and child support, and has borrowed all he can from his friends, and he needs money. Andy proposes a low-key robbery of a small Mall mom-and-pop jewelry store that promises safe, quick cash for both. The glitch is that the jewelry story belongs to the men's parents - Charles (Albert Finney) and Nanette (Rosemary Harris). Andy advances Hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that Hank will do the actual robbery, but though Hank agrees to the 'fail-safe' plan, he hires a friend to take on the actual job while Hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car. The robbery is horribly botched when Nanette, filing in for the regular clerk, shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess. The disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when Nanette dies, Charles and Andy and Hank (and their respective partners) are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn. Each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances, and while we have come to expect that from Hoffman, Hawke, Tomei, Finney, Ryan, and Harris, it is the wise hand of direction from Sidney Lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is a film that allows some bravura performances that demand our respect, a film that reminds us how fragile many families can be. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil will have his due.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet knows the wages of sin. Dog Day Afternoon was a classic of the heist that went wrong with a performance by Al Pacino that went right. His newest crime in the city is Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, from an Irish toast, "May you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows you're dead." The brothers who rob their parents' Westchester jewelry store, Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawke) will surely be having a dialogue with the Hot One when their lives are through, and they have suffered through the Lumet circle of Hell-on-earth reserved for those not talented enough to avoid Nemesis even in this life.Lumet quietly builds the cascade of troubles from a couple of simple mistakes in the crime's execution. Each moment is fraught with punishing possibilities, some just dumb luck, others straight out of existential responsibility. But each of those moments is bearable because Lumet has ascribed the fault to the right places. We may squirm at each turn of bad luck, but we are confident the forces of righteousness will prevail.Like Orson Welles, Lumet isn't much interested in linear narrative as he cuts in and out of the four days before the heist and the week after. That non-linear presentation allows the audience to verify the early character-consistency estimates now played out at random times.Befitting Lumet's seminal study of directing, Making Movies (1995), the shots are composed to show the growing alienation of the brothers from their father and each other. For example, a long shot of the two brothers assessing the damage has them placed like bookends, far apart but linked by the fate they are working out at that moment.Their Greek tragic-like lives are exemplified before the robbery in the petty adultery and embezzling that already corrode all their relationships. Andy's Wife, Gina (Marisa Tomei), who is sleeping with Hank, fulfills the requirements of a Siren who may have no idea how dangerous she is.The Devil will have his due.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So much talent gone to waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet is one of those name directors who, when critics find his name associated with a film, tend to genuflect in reverence. As such, it's no great surprise to see the outpouring of praise given to Before The Devil Knows You're Dead (it scored an 88% Fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes), however viewing it left me feeling as empty as a Biafran famine victim.With an impressive cast comprised of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei, coupled with Lumet's directorial prowess and a smart story by Kelly Masterson, one could be forgiven for thinking things would be a slam-dunk, but they aren't.Telling the story of two brothers (Hoffman and Hawke), each with their own set of financial troubles, who opt to rob their parent's jewelry store only to have the heist go south on them, "Dead" strikes an ambitious if well-worn tack of jumping back in forth in time akin to the TV show Lost, showing the evolution, execution and aftermath of the crime from various stages and perspectives. There's much that's interesting and compelling here, except that at the end of the journey I found myself detached from the characters and thinking that more might have been accomplished if a more conventional sequencing of the narrative had been chosen, instead of the bouncing to the various characters points of view.This isn't to say that there aren't some terrific performances going on here. Finney, in his 70th decade, is still a powerful screen presence, and Hoffman is an unquestionable talent portraying the heroin-addicted corporate financial wonk Charles Hanson to perfection. In fact, I can't find a single flaw with the performances in this picture. Even Tomei ? who, at age 43, has a body I would crawl a mile over broken glass for, and flaunts it in the raw copiously ? is compellingly believable as the torn mistress boinking both Hanson brothers (Hoffman and Hawke) and who is emotionally split between the two.The problem is that for all the acting, directorial and cinematic firepower behind this movie, it never once sucked me in emotionally or believably. Many of the plot's twists are telegraphed and easily foreseen, right from the very beginning. With all the surprise removed from the journey, it becomes akin to little more than an exercise in watching a bunch of veterans from an acting studio go through their lines.Such a waste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A multi-perspective heist movie that turns into so much more?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD starts off promisingly, setting up a simple heist that goes awry, told from varying perspectives (in RASHOMON style). At around the hour mark, Sidney Lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts; it eventually morphs into a multi-faceted family drama, exploring the full realm of human emotions/relations, as the story comes to its chilling climax.As is the case with Lumet, he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star-studded cast, without any notion of over-acting or hyperbole. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious, and interesting character, and oftentimes dwarfs Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother, Hank. That's not to say that Hawke is not bad; in fact he is quite above adequate, in a troubled role that suits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this). Albert Finney's character (Andy and Hank's father) is the most intriguing, and in my opinion, he deserved a bit more screen-time. Amy Ryan also performs her job adequately.BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is not an exceptional movie, but it proves that Lumet is still near the top of his game at the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career. Many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here, not least of which involves the use of his characters. Infused with a killer script (no pun intended), smart dialogue and pacing, and a decent score, BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is a must-see. A truly underrated gem. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should just enter my Top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first movie rated above 7.0 on IMDb I did not like.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I go out to the video store to rent a flick I usually trust IMDb's views on a film and, until this one, had never seen a flick rated 7.0 or above on the site I did not enjoy.Sidney Lumet, a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century, really misstepped here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can: filling a film's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever.I like films with flawed characters, but no matter how dark someone's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too, we're all shades of gray with some darker or brighter than others. Mr. Lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost masochistic pitch-black characters.Ethan Hawke's Hank is a 30-something whining, immature, irresponsible man-child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser, which he very much is. His indecisiveness and willingness to let others do the dirty work for him because he's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed. By the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film, it's more pathetic than uplifting. Ethan Hawke plays his character well, but isn't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot perpetually stamped on their face and he doesn't' particularly care that it's there.Speaking of which his character's wife is equally as bad. Just about every single shot of the film she's in is her verbally berating him for rent and child support money and further grinding in his already non-existent self-esteem with insults. Seriously, that's just about all the character does. Her harpy-like behavior borders on malevolent.Albert Finney plays their father Charles, and while Mr. Finney has been a great actor for many decades, he spends about 90% of this film with the same mouth open half-grimace on his face like he's suffering from the world's worst bout of constipation. For someone who's been an actor as long as Mr. Finney, you think he'd be more apt at emoting. Even though he doesn't show it much, his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger-filled. And when he smothers Andy at the film's conclusion it's akin to Dr. Frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it's own misery.Marisa Tomei isn't given much to do with her character. Stuck in an unhappy marriage with Andy and having an affair with his brother for some unfathomable reason. When Andy's world begins to spiral out of control she logically jumps ship, but it really doesn't make her any less selfish or self-serving than any other character in the film, but probably the one with the most common sense at least.And finally we come to Andy, played by the always good Philip Seymour Hoffman, is the only reason I rated this film a 3 instead of a 1. His performance of the heroin-addicted, embezzling financial executive who's "perfect crime" of robbing his parent's insured jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing. His descent from calm master planner of a flawed scheme to unstable, deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic. Hoffman's character ends up being the film's chief villain, but it's hard to root against him given the alternatives are an emotionally castrated little brother and a father who's self-admitted poor early parenting led to his son's eventual psychosis and indirect, unintentional murder of his mother.Ultimately this film is really only worth watching for PSH's great performance and it's family train wreck nature. Just don't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for, because there really aren't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The world is an evil place Charlie. Some of us make money off that and others get destroyed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is directed by Sidney Lumet and written by Kelly Masterson. It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei, Albert Finney, Rosemary Harris and Amy Ryan. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Ron Fortunato.Two brothers with differing financial problems plan to rob their parents' jewellery store. But when all does not go to plan and tragedy strikes, it sends them, and those close to them, into a world of fear, shame and violence.....It opens with a raunchy sex scene, man and wife in the throes of committed passion, for these brief moments there is pleasure. Once over, though, it proves to be a false dawn, the last time anyone on screen will taste pleasure in Lumet's biting morality tale. From here on in the film unfolds in a dizzying array of multi-perspectives and over lapping of narrative structure, a three pronged assault on the senses as a family implodes in a haze of greed, lies and inadequacies. A botched robbery underpins the plotting, the aftermath of which is what is most cutting, we zip around learning the wherewithal and whys of the key players, learning exactly what we need to know to fully immerse in this bleak world. This is a world populated by love cheats, drug abuse, embezzling, bad parenting and blackmail, a world where the brothers Hanson (Hoffman &amp; Hawke) now dwell, either ill equipped (Hawke's Hank) or stuck between idiocy and smug evil (Hoffman's Andy). Their folly, their greed, impacting with a juddering severity on the family circle.My life, it doesn't add up. Nothing connects to anything else. I'm not the sum of my parts. All my parts don't add up to one...me.It would be Lumet's last film (he passed away in 2011), thankfully it is a fitting final offering from the talented Philadelphian. He's aided considerably, mind, by a razor sharp script from debut screenplay writer Masterton. It's full of nastiness and tension, but still observational as a family tragedy, with major bonus' being that it never resorts to stereotypes or cops out come the crushing denouement. Where Lumet excels is in drawing near faultless performances from his cast. Youthful and downtrodden haplessness portrayed by Hawke, Hoffman's powerhouse manipulator with emotional issues, Tomei proving that over 40 is still sexy while dialling into a very touching performance. Finney, a cracker-jack of grief from the wily old fox, Ryan's hard edged ex-wife and Michael Shannon strolling into the picture late in the day exuding notable menace. All splendidly guided by the great director who asks them to portray characters convincing in going deeper for motivations and means.Bleak, brutal and near brilliant across the board. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The World Is an Evil Place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an addicted executive of a real estate office that has embezzled a large amount for his addiction and expensive way of life with his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei). When an audit is scheduled in his department, he becomes desperate for money. His baby brother Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke) is a complete loser that owes three months of child support to his daughter, and is having a love affair with Gina every Thursday afternoon. Andy plots a heist of the jewelry of their parent in a Saturday morning without the use of guns, expecting to find an old employee working and without financial damage to his parents, since the insurance company would reimburse the loss. On Monday morning, we would raise the necessary money he needs to cover his embezzlement. He invites Hank to participate, since he is very well known in the mall where the jewelry is located and could be recognized. However, Hank yellows and invites the thief Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. O'Byrne) to steal the store, but things go wrong when their mother Nanette (Rosemary Harris) comes to work as the substitute for the clerk and Bobby brings a hidden gun. Nanette reacts and kills Bobby but she is also lethally shot. After the death of Nanette, their father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney) decides to investigate the robbery with tragic consequences."Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a comedy of errors, disclosing a good story. The originality and the difference are in the screenplay, with a non-linear narrative ? la "Pulp Fiction". The eighty-three year-old Sidney Lumet has another great work and it is impressive the longevity of this director. Philip Seymour Hoffman is awesome in the role of a dysfunctional man with traumatic relationship with his father that feels the world falling apart mostly because of his insecure and clumsy brother. Marisa Tomei is still impressively gorgeous and sexy, showing a magnificent body. The violent conclusion shows that the world is indeed an evil place. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Antes Que o Diabo Saiba Que Voc? Está Morto" ("Before the Devil Knows You're Dead")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet scores a big one again with a work of melodrama, at its best on par with Greek tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called Backstreet that "tragedy is like another character" in the film. The same could be said- and not withstanding bringing up Tarantino- for Sidney Lumet's best work in years, a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of what's at stake with the cast involved. Kelly Masterson doesn't have a masterpiece of a script here (it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end, and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount), but her script does convey character before plot, and in a story where the actions surround a heist it's crucial to know who these people are beat by beat. It's bleak as hell, unforgiving as Satan, but also absolutely riveting 90% of the time.Chalk it up not just because Lumet knows how to handle a non-linear script where we see the day-to-day actions of character to character before during, and mostly after the botched 'mom-&amp;-pop' jewelry store robbery occurs, but because of the formidable cast assembled (which, I might add, is Lumet's specialty). Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f***-ups, and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool-proof heist: looting their own mother and father's jewelry store in Westchester. Hawke's Hank involves another shady character though, murders occur, and suddenly it's tragedy on a Greek scale affecting the brothers and their father, played by a perfect Albert Finney. It's the kind of material that most actors love- characters who, like in Dog Day Afternoon, are painfully human, flawed to the bone but only wanting love &amp;/or things to be set right, and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs.In this case though Hoffman and Hawke are matched splendidly; Hoffman has, until the aforementioned last ten minutes, a super-calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation, but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally (i.e. with Finney or the car scene with Tomei) push his talents to the limit; Hawke, meanwhile, is called a loser by his ex-wife and daughter, can't pay any debts at all, and is called a baby by his own father, and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter- he's not quite as flawed as his older brother, but who wants to pick a straw for that title? And Finney, as mentioned, is spot-on all the way through, making his turn in Big Fish look like child's play (the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic, his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second half).Also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely two-timing Marisa Tomei, Bug's Michael Shannon as bad-ass white trash, and Amy Ryan, Brian F. O'Byrne and Rosemary Harris making brief, exact impressions, this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart- but not a forgiving heart- with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a family's perpetual downward spiral. If it's not as mind-blowing as Serpico or Network or the Pawnbroker or 12 Angry Men it comes as close as anything Lumet's done since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot holes and other NYC devices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say first off that the performances by Hawke, Hoffmann and Tomei were excellent. Secondly, this could have been a 90 minute movie and lastly severe plot holes exist in a pretty good story.That being said, the only way to elaborate on the movie length and plot holes is to ---spoil--- the movie.OK, first off the movie length. Lumet's flashback device, which I normally liked in movies like "Memento", is not necessary here. In fact, it actually added 30 minutes to the movie by constantly reverting to scenes that we had already scene and showing them from the view point of other characters. This style is very reminiscent of the film "Go", which I liked very much, by the way. A linear structure would have worked quite well here and I think would have told the story a little better and in 90 minutes. Usually, a flashback is used to show us something that the we don't know at a later point of the movie, because letting us know it at an earlier point would give us too much information about a character or an event. In this movie there is no information in the form of a flashback that is given to the audience, which would fail in a linear style of storytelling. As a matter of fact, showing us the jewelry store being robbed and the two people being killed would have been better if it was shown in chronological order as opposed to the second scene in the movie. Alright, you might say, the fact that it was the brother's mother would have been revealed. OK, fine, just get rid of the scene about the father going to the DMV and the mother having to open up the store. The father would show up to the store and say "my wife works here" and the audience would still have thought, "That poor man's wife...oh wait, it's Andy's mom." Now for plot holes. OK. If there's a guy that's been shot and he's got a gun and the bullets match the ones that are in my wife's chest and he's laying at the scene of the crime, my guess is that's the guy who shot my wife. Now, why is the husband of the deceased bothering the cops to find the killer. I would think that was the guy. So, we go on a journey to find the "real" killer. Much like OJ did with Nicole Simpson's killer. OK, granted, the husband was 100% correct in thinking he was not the only one involved, but in reality, I think most grieving husbands would have stopped right there. OK, next plot hole. So, the father goes to a jewelry store to the one crooked diamond dealer on 47th street and asks him if the guy knew anything about his dead wife's murder. So, the audience is to believe that the killer was going to go to this one guy and pawn all of his wears from the heist. Oh, and Andy's going to leave his card to incriminate himself. So, if the dealer decides to call the police he can say I didn't get a good look at him, but here's his card. Again, the father was dead on, but come on. That's a bit of a stretch. Also, he's going to ram his car into a police car (at the police station) and no one is going to arrest him. There are other minor plot holes (like the safe being open at the transvestite drug dealers. "How convenient" - ala the Church Lady) Great performances, but a script full of holes. I think if they would have filled those holes and told a linear story it would have been better. P.S. I have heard that a user has tried to put holes in my criticism by stating that Finney is looking for the accomplice because no getaway car was found. This is logical, however not enough to warrant an all out search for an accomplice. Many crimes have been committed or have been attempted to be committed by one person. In my opinion, Finney's character would be more focused on the burglar that was killed and getting the closure a grieving husband would need from finding him dead on the floor. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills! (Will Ferrell - Zoolander)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top notch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest active directors, still got game! A few years ago he shot "Find me guilty", a proof to everyone that Vin Diesel can actually act, if he gets the opportunity and the right director. If he had retired after this movie (a true masterpiece in my eyes), no one could have blamed him. But he's still going strong, his next movie already announced for 2009.But let's stay with this movie right here. The cast list is incredible, their performance top notch. The little nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogue and/or situations that evolve throughout the movie are just amazing. The (time) structure of the movie, that keeps your toes the whole time, blending time-lines so seamlessly, that the editing seems natural/flawless. The story is heightened by that, although even in a "normal" time structure, it would've been at least a good movie (Drama/Thriller). I can only highly recommend it, the rest is up to you! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite as interesting as it proclaims</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Veteran director Sydney Lumet's thriller, 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead', is not one of his finest efforts. The story of a robbery gone wrong in a very dysfunctional family, one problem is the sheer unlikeability of the characters: if they don't exactly ask for what they get, there's a kind of (admitedly grotesque) judgement in their fates. And the tricksy storytelling, following the same events from different angles, doesn't quite work either. This is a good trick when each perspective is natural, and brings one different information; but when we see the story replayed here, most of what we learn is either what we had expected, or material that seems to have been unfairly withheld from the first viewpoint. The way the film starts with a gratuitously explicit sexual scene also grated with me. I've seen plenty of films that are less well put together; but there's an element of originality (along with a degree of underlying motive) that's definitely lacking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Love of Money Is the Root of All Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the root of all evil. The love of money leads to greed which can lead to pride and eventually to destruction. Two brothers, Andy and Hank, will discover how far the love of money will cost them and those they love the most.Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) couldn't be more different. Andy is seemingly enjoying the success of working in New York's real estate market and is married to his beautiful wife Gina (Marisa Tomei) who is the idea of a trophy wife if one ever existed. Hank, however, is divorcée who finds himself at the mercy of his ex-wife, his daughter's expensive school bills, and endless amount of child support payments. A man who means well and has good intentions, Hank none the less cannot escape the water that his slowly raising above his head no matter how hard he swims to stay above it.However, Andy has his own problems with the only difference between him and his brother being that he hides them better. He has committed fraud against his company and is heavily involved in drug use in order to escape his fears. The pressure of his life, and the lies he needs to keep his appearances up, have now caused him to think about fleeing the country with Gina in order to start over again. Of course, like Hank, he needs money to do this and believes he knows how to get it. How? By robbing the jewelery store that their parents own and run. This act of betrayal is where the Hanson brothers, their families, and several other lives, will be destroyed because of greed, pride, and fear. The uniqueness of Before The Devil Knows You're Dead is the manner in which the story is told. After the robbery goes wrong, and Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris) who is the mother of both Andy and Hank is killed, the story is told from a variety of different points of view from various days before and after the robbery attempt. We learn more about the motivations of not only Andy and Hank but also the reaction to their father Charles (Albert Finney) to the death of his wife. The relationship between Charles and his two sons, especially to Andy, is also explored and another possible motivation of sorts is discovered after it is revealed that there is little love between the two men. Nanette may have been dearly loved by her sons but their father is a different story.Philip Seymour Hoffman proves once more why he is one of the most impressive actors in Hollywood today by portraying Andy as not only a greedy criminal with lack of morality but also, in contradictory way, as a man we can sympathize with. Ethan Hawke also brings Hank alive not just as a loser but really as a man just desperate to hang on to what little he has left. Andy and Hank are thus brought to life in such a realistic way that it is easy to think of them as not just characters but the very real images of lost and confused men who now find themselves facing the consequence of their actions.Before The Devil Knows You're Dead is a moral tale about how our actions lead to consequences that we otherwise might not expect to face. More than that, our choices also can affect those around us in ways we never expected. In what should have been best picture of the year, we see how lives are easily broken when the love of money becomes the ultimate pursuit in order to ease our troubled lives. In other words, there are no easy fixes or answers to our problems and trying to find them can only make things worse.10/10</fullReview>

Don't believe me? Think of the toilet scene in Pulp Fiction.The sound mixer should have been shot. The music was way too loud, dramatic and repetitive, and it muddied the dialogue a bit.Okay yes you get to see Marissa Tomei naked and that's very nice and a great bunch of actors (Amy Ryan! Albert Finney!) ...but I had the sensation of being in a car with a bunch of people where I'm the only one who sees the imminent car crash and keep shouting and nobody's listening.

Why don't they just show us a regular movie from beginning to the end? Start from the end and go back to the beginning if you want. Just don't start in the middle, go to the beginning, then back to the end, then to the middle, then to the beginning, it ruins the entire movie.I will give one thing to this movie - great (I mean great) acting And not just Philip Seymour Hoffman (most people only talk about him when talking about this movie), I think all main characters had great acting from Marisa Tomei to Albert Finney to Ethan Hawke, etc etcAnd that's the only reason I give it a 6, otherwise it would be a flat 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Except for the shocking opening image (something Sidney Lumet's been offering up every once in a while for his entire career) this isn't a return to form, unless you mean the form of GUILTY AS SIN or STRANGER AMONG US. Actually it's better than those. But not much better, and no thanks to Lumet, who has indeed directed many fine films. This ain't one of 'em.This is a marginally watchable crime drama; that's all. The department heads all slept through this one - the bar looks like a bar set. The apartments look like apartment sets. The characters feel more like ideas on paper than like actual people. The script veers from merely okay to pretty much incompetent, and the performances are nobody's best, though Marisa Tomei is reason enough to watch the movie on a couple of levels: she is, as ever, intensely real in every single moment. And she is naked much of the time.The film's direction is no less aimless than its script, a hallmark of Lumet films from day one. The fragmented narrative does nothing to help the story, or to heighten the drama; it's just a gimmick. We learn nothing extra in our endless flashes to and fro, except how to be frustrated with every scene Marisa Tomei's not in. The violence of the final act makes sense, I guess, in terms of character, but not in terms of drama, or story, or even shock value. There's no tragedy here. There's just a bunch of people crying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sidney Lumet's film didn't deliver on its star cast or eye-catching title, and ends up being a clotted mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No movie title has created more tension and anticipation in me more than Before The Devil Knows You're Dead. What a colossal disappointment then that Sidney Lumet's film ended up being a muddled, needlessly convoluted mess that dawdles towards an inevitable conclusion. Too often a film director decides that lurching around a timeline makes for a more compelling story, but this is not such a film that benefits from the structure. Flashbacks rarely act with the game-changing feel that Predestination or the TV show Lost did. During one flashback, all that is revealed is that Albert Finney's character had a driving test and his wife opened a shop (both of which were revealed through exposition before and after the flashback anyway). Rather than creating mystery, it simply creates frustration and confusion. The conclusion leaves a number of plot points unresolved - namely, Ethan Hawke's Hank - which is inconceivable considering the film's length vis a vis simple plot.The acting here is pretty terrific - Hoffman is at his dramatic high, Hawke turns out one of his best, and Finney does wonders with a character whose development beings and ends with "mad, sad, bad dad". Sadly, Marisa Tomei stares blearily into the camera during her entire nothing role. It is surprising that in a film containing three of my favourite actors, the film's highlight is a scene stealing Michael Shannon, who commanded my attention with supreme skill. The film's screenplay is cluttered, self-indulgent and largely boring. Plot points weave in and out of relevance, such as the IRS audit and Tomei's entire plot. Many characters, Hoffman especially, indulge in self-important monologues. It then glosses over important deductions, by having characters make wild assumptions that are conveniently correct. Real people don't talk or act like many of the characters in this film.Sidney Lumet's film didn't deliver on its star cast or eye-catching title, and ends up being a clotted mess around the bottom of the filmographies of those involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immense potential</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, there's a decent little sub-genre of films about crimes gone wrong in which the protagonists attempt to evade the law and clear up after their mess. RESERVOIR DOGS could be classed as such, but the real classics of the genre for me are the snow-bound classics FARGO and A SIMPLE PLAN. BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is another entry in this sub-genre with much in common with the previous movies, but unfortunately it lacks the same kind of power.While I enjoy the narrative of the story, I have to say that this movie's style is all wrong. The jumping back and forth in time structure makes it feel all over the place and, indeed, that it's a mess. It would have been much better if it had played out completely linear. The look is cold, the style holds you back from the action. The direction is one of my least favourite things about the film, which is a real surprise given that the director is Sidney Lumet, purveyor of such classics as SERPICO and DOG DAY AFTERNOON. Sorry, Sidney; you just haven't got it anymore.Still, there are reasons to watch here, not least Philip Seymour Hoffman's sleazy, drug-addled businessman who finds his life spiralling out of control. Ethan Hawke is effective as his waster brother, and Albert Finney reliably solid as the siblings' father. Watch out for the lovely Marisa Tomei as Hoffman's girlfriend and the excellent Michael Shannon in a minor role as a bad guy. Lashings of violence and some shocking twists help propel the plot along, but in the end this was a bit of a disappointment and a case of wasted potential as it could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting narrative...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 11/19/2011 ? 6 out of 10(Dir-Sidney Lumet): Interesting narrative about what turns out to be a mixed up family who's brothers' scheme to rob their parents' jewelry store to get money to reverse their individual bad situations. One brother, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is working a job making six figures but spends it all on drugs and the younger brother, played by Ethan Hawke, is an under-achiever who can't handle his responsibilities(which is primarily his ex-wife and kids). The story is told with each segment being a different timeframe where the filmmaker, the talented Sidney Lumet, moves back-and-forth in time to show us bits and pieces of the story in each segment. It starts with Hoffman's character doing the nastie with (who we find out later) his wife, played by Marisa Tomei, and we also find out later that this is a rare occurrence. We then are brought to the day of the robbery and we see the act take place. You have to pay attention every step of the way to piece together this big puzzle that Lumet lays before us. You may have to watch it a second time to understand all the details(I had to because I misunderstood the important and timing of the initial scene). This is the kind of movie that keeps your interest but will not be fodder for hi-def(visually or surround sound-wise) but tells a good story. The movie is definitely darker than prior Lumet films but you become absorbed with the story and characters and that's what makes the movie work. It's not his best but a good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic tale without heroic characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the central characters of this movie were 'worthy', you could describe this movie as a tragedy. In other words, it's a tragedy without heroic characters. The plot concerns two brothers' attempt to get some money quick by robbing a 'mom and pop' jewellery store. Murphy's Law is then invoked.Told through flashbacks and from multiple perspectives, you finally realise how horribly wrong the attempted heist went. If that mode of story-telling is not your cup of tea, you might want to stay away from this movie. Personally I found this method worked well. It's not in any way incoherent.With tongue in cheek here, didn't you just love the view from the high rise apartment? Ah, the mist of L.A.! (cough, cough!).Lastly, I have to mention that for all those people clamouring to see Philip Seymour Hoffman in the nude, getting it on with a beautiful woman, your prayers have been answered! Dennis Franz used to know what that kind of audience expectation felt like...and he gave the people what they wanted!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BTDKYD, the last movie of the late lamented Sidney Lumet, is a very effective and captivating, dark, cynical tragedy.The script is well written and the editing based on flashbacks creates goods twists and allows the viewer to understand what is at stake from each point of view. The movie is very dynamic with no overlong passages whatsoever.The cast is excellent and the Hawke-Hoffman duo shows a good chemistry, the latter delivering an outstanding, nuanced performance.As for the direction, it is relatively successful with striking shots; some render cheaper but it is minimal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philip Seymour Hoffman is Andy, a real estate exec with serious financial problems who is about to be in deep trouble for embezzling thousands of dollars to support a drug habit. He plans to escape to Brazil, but needs sufficient cash to do so. His brother Hank is having child support issues and also needs money. Hank is messing around with Andy's wife, Gina(Marisa Tomei-good nude scene). Andy is jealous of his brother from childhood, but he convinces him to rob their parent's jewelry store. His plan is to use a toy gun, and he justifies his idea because he says that the insurance company will reimburse his family's loss. Hank recruits a real criminal, Bobby, who has no qualms about using a real weapon to commit the heist. Bobby proceeds with the robbery and becomes involved in a shootout with Andy's mother, who was filling in for the regular clerk. She is wounded, and winds up in a coma, while her husband does a little detective work on his own. Tragedy follows the family right to the bitter end, which is believable, and makes Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, one of Sidney Lumet's better dramas, and Hoffman is great, as usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are from time to time successful presentations in the sense that the characters work. You understand them well enough to have some genuine acceptance of their reality as humans, but that means you realize that there are things going on that do not have straightline causal mechanics. This inscrutable humanness gets you past the limits of cartoonishness where you are told everything and why.Sometimes those characters weave narratives that are rich and engaging. Because you invest but cannot anticipate, each unfolding of consequence tumbles you further into the story if it is rich. If you have several such characters and you are lucky enough that they ALL are weaving this reality, you get an environment of interaction rather than an object of one man's life thread.Few, very few films get past this threshold. Lumet's gift is that he understands this woven environment in terms of space. When he tells us a story, the narrative cues come verbally as usual; the story proper is advanced through facts and sequence this way. This gives the actors something to do, some opportunity to contribute. Since Lumet often chooses well, this pumps juice into the structure. But his talent is in how he architects the space. The man is an architect of woven, partially discovered causal space. One of his tools is the eye. Is there anyone else who drives the camera with such an ability to discover a path of comprehension just a fraction of a moment before we need it but after we have anticipated where he might go? Is there anyone else who can make the camera a first class character, equal in the dramatic action to the characters who thread their tragedy in fine, sculpted tangles? You knew this was the man's talent from the very first in "Angry Men," where he had the discipline to keep the characters stationary while he wove his spatial discovery with the eye.The camera, even the camera of "Wiz," is his narrative caress that incidentally perceives.The other tool is time. Usually he works with an unrelenting rolling of time. Time factors as an external force, an ocean that he and characters surf. I still get narratively aroused recalling the steamed beginning of the locomotive in "Orient Express," and the avalanche of threading it drove.Thank god creative souls are motivated to keep working beyond what ordinary drudges believe is the age of rest. Thank god the man still has the balls to take risks and grow. Here he decides to not allow time to be merely an external flow within which the characters braid, but as a designed skein in the knot itself. The time is sculpted in just the same way as the space. It is so well integrated a vision that I am sure he designed the non-linearity and not the writer, who would not have known the shapes he would have seen.Noir is a matter of this relationship: the external cosmos as an unfortunate artifact of our status as voyeurs, imposed on characters who have little scope. The noir tragedy is the shape the characters make within these constraints, driven by the dynamics of folding. What Lumet has done here is dissolve that by making the river go away to be replaced by hoses that are not external, but in the thing. Genius.There is a scene, pointed out to me by someone that matters, that crystallizes this. Hoffman's character is at the point where his control over the environment has just been lost. Afterwards he will be in the knots, not tying them. He takes a bowl of polished stones and slowly pours them on a glass table. They fall in a complex, beautiful, exhaustingly sad way. Lovely, chaotic, seen from the same set of camera angles Lumet has used until that moment. Afterward in the film, he would use a different set, regardless of whether past or future. (The bedclothes have just been removed as well.) The man's instincts are good, artistic, nourishing. But he still takes the annoying dive into the vulgar pool of image tropes. The last scene here with Albert Finney's character, walking into a whiteout is so out of place, so hackneyed that I wanted to shake the filmmaker. This is right after the complex, delicate, perfect scene where the father's heart is presented in the place of his doomed son.This is important filmmaking, important stuff, life. Sydney, keep sleeping with the muse. Keep waking her up. Again.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two brothers plan to rob their parents' jewelry store, counting on insurance to pay and everybody ending up happy. Lumet, who is to be applauded for continuing to augment his notable resume despite being north of 80, does his usual solid job, but the screenplay is lacking. The narrative structure is needlessly complicated by presenting the events from different points of view, but all this does is make the film overlong and repetitive. The ending, meant to be shocking, is predictable and unsatisfying instead. The cast is fine, including Hoffman and Hawke as the brothers, Finney as their father, and very hot and mostly undressed Tomei as Hoffman's wife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The true concern...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intense ride this one. Sidney Lumet's "Before the Devil knows you're dead" is one of those films that are as difficult to classify as they are to watch. Films like this one can't be perfect because of the big challenge they assume from the beginning; and this one in particular doesn't even have a complicated storyline. Kelly Masterson's first script tells the story of Andy (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawke), two brothers that, because of how life is, decide to rob their parents' jewelry store. As I said, the difficulty in 'Devil' doesn't come from its storyline; it comes, put it simply, from the way you may want to take its story. This said, you may get into a difficult experience if you think of the film as an action piece, or even if you decide to see it merely as a crime tale. The fact is that the movie is neither and, if it is something in particular, it's a drama; a character piece of the most disturbing nature. I don't know if it's because of Masterson's focused script or Lumet's stylish and fresh direction, but the main thing worth mentioning about 'Devil', at the end of the day, are its characters, all ordinary human beings living crumbling lives; and getting involved in situations that accentuate this characteristic. This whole movie is like an abyss where people fall and the viewer never knows if they'll reach the bottom. But do we want them to reach the bottom? Do they want to reach the bottom? Do they or we care if they reach the bottom? If there's something we know for sure, it's that the movie is very concerned for us to differentiate the characters; the two brothers and their father (Albert Finney), and how each of them live their days before and after the robbery in question. Hank, for example, has an ex-wife and a daughter to maintain; Andy has a tough relationship with his wife (a wonderful Marisa Tomei, as beautiful as ever) and disenchantment with his life in general; and the father who didn't have a good relationship with the brothers as kids and for the rest of their lives. One of the film's wisest decisions is not to put everything on the table. There are secrets among the characters; we can feel it and everything revolves around them but we don't find out everything. There's a room for thought and the possibility of drawing personal conclusions in relation to certain aspects.Taking this latest thing into account, the movie acquired a more important value for me. Today we waste to much time expecting to be surprised by films (though I can't deny it's a lovely thing) that when it doesn't happen the disappointment comes in big proportions. When you watch 'Devil', try to forget about those things for a couple of hours, and try to think about the characters and their story. Lumet's concern (contained in Masterson's script) for the characters can be seen in the different angles from where he shows us a particular moment that's repeated twice (in case we missed any detail), and in the performances by the great Hoffman and that powerful actor that Ethan Hawke is, and the rest of the fantastic ensemble. Just this time, if you can, stick to the characters and you'll be fine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet is back with a solid film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great thing is longevity. We had and still have the chance to be contemporary with some of the great directors from the mid 20th century and it's really thrilling to see that some of these guys are still doing movies that we can really enjoy. Sidney Lumet had a great although uneven career but had he done only '12 Angry Men' he would still have his place in the gallery of the greatest directors of the century. And when 50 years later he is doing such an intense and vibrating film as 'Before the Devil' it's a reason to enjoy.Lumet's film reminded me technically, but also as a subject one of the best French movies of the last decade, 'Irrevesible' by Gaspar Noe. There, as in Christopher Nolan's 'Mememto' the story is told in reverse chronology. The film started in a nightmare atmosphere of violence and as we progress withe the viewing the tension decreases, so that in the final we are in the real normal world. We cannot forget however that this is the PAST, and the present is actually the whirlwind of horror. Lumet's movies seems to start in a similar technique of story telling but abandons it soon and broadens the perspective building the story of small puzzles that make sense not as a chronology but in the logic of the story. The story is of two brothers (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethen Hawke) who try to get out of financial trouble by organizing a robbery of their parents jewelry store. But this is no usual gangster story or family drama. Lumet takes us by hand and drives accurately in the story of the robbery going very bad and the lives of the two characters descending into chaos. The final scene has a religious connotation which I could pass, but cannot spoil the rest of the show.Philip Seymour Hoffman is in my opinion one of the more complete and complex actors in Hollywood today. It's amazing to watch him building his character under our eyes with precision and attention to every detail. Lumet always was and remains a master in working with actors, each of them seems to be well cast and builds his relationship with the other perfectly. All is filmed with good pace and good taste. This script had change to fall under Lumet's hands, he made out of it more than most of the directors could have done.</fullReview>

On the plus side, we get to witness Ms. Tomei's awesome bodaciousness, and that itself is worth the rental.We must credit the acting skills of the cast. Ethan Hawke is excellent as wimpy younger brother, Hank, propelled onto the path to disaster by Andy, who is played to the hilt by Mr. Hoffman. Neither brother is doing very well in managing his life. Hank is behind on child-support payments, but that's nothing compared to Andy's problems. He's been embezzling from his real estate firm in order to support his drug habits. And oh yes, the IRS is coming n for an audit. And so it goes.Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney are fine in their roles, but their characters are not so well written. At the end, there is still no final resolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy But Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Before The Devil Knows You're Dead is certainly a catchy title, it's doubtful any of the players of this movie would make it through the pearly gates. They all seem to be sinners to varying degrees. Unfolding by moving back and forth in time and presenting different viewpoints, the movie begins with a catastrophically fouled up robbery that continues the downward spiral of Philip Seymour Hoffman's character Andy Hanson. Andy drags along into the abyss his hapless brother Hank and anyone else he comes in contact with.Legendary octogenarian director Sidney Lumet can still shoot with filmmakers half his age, employing modern techniques and the cutting edge technology of HD video while drawing on his years of experience. Lumet gets strong performances from the cast and impressively forges a flashy, non-linear film that could have easily turned into a confusing mess. It all seems to make sense, just don't think about this movie too much. There are elements that don't ring true and plot devices that don't make sense. With no criminal background, Hank decides to take part in a robbery? The robbery scene verges on the ridiculous if examined. A jewelry store employee feels so safe she does not lock the door but does keep a gun in the till? Most of the jewelry was in the vault, but some was left in the showcase so that the robber could get distracted? There are numerous examples of these cheap devices in this scene and others.BTDKYD seems to be a modern film but ultimately it is a traditional story of a man undone by his own character. Lumet has always been interested in what he calls melodrama, wherein the story determines the characters rather than the characters determining the story. He refers to both BTDKTD as a melodrama and also his 1986 The Morning After, of which I am in the minority of those who enjoyed it. In The Morning After, starring Jane Fonda as an alcoholic, washed up actress, the question is what will she do when she thinks she's murdered someone. The viewer also has the mystery of "Did she actually kill the guy?" In BTDKYD there is no question of Andy's guilt, just of what he will end up being guilty. How far will this guy go? But actually that would not seem to be in question either. He is a severely flawed person who can only go in one direction. He's been treading water for a long time and things have finally come to a head. The question Lumet hints at but never satisfactorily resolves is, "Why is Andy such a disaster of a human being?" Because his Daddy didn't give him enough love?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misery for misery's sake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no problem with films which some might say are downers. I like films in which there is not a happy ending, in which the prom queen doesn't go home with the star football player, in which consequences are a hazy shade of gray and in which outcomes are an unpredictable melange of desirable and unwanted. I think both of these are aspects of all of us and they are also aspects of any story. No one thing is solely evil or wholly good. Life is not one or the other. I thought that this movie adjudged everything to be too dour and that is why I must negatively rate the film. In it, two brothers conspire to rob from their parents in order to settle some financial accounts which have gotten away from them. However, the robbery goes bad, opening a Pandora's box of horrid consequences which constitute the remainder of the movie.Director Sidney Lumet does a good job eliciting wonderful performances from a very talented cast (more on them later) and in ensuring a smooth progression of the action and mastery over the different areas over which he is in control. My main problem is that the plot of the film seems gratuitously dour. I have no problem with dour movies if there seems some good reason why the characters are dour, but I did not see that here. These seemed to be professionally and personally rather regular and fortunate people for whom such dysfunction seems ridiculous. I think the blame for this shortcoming should go to writer Kelly Masterson who has created too Manichaeistic a worldview. I found too much misery among characters where such didn't seem warranted. I found some major logical flaws in this film. Why were the two brothers in such financial dire straits? Yes, Hank Hanson (Ethan Hawke) has child support to pay and he obviously is a bit of a good-for-nothing who is obviously living beyond his means and relying on his charm and hangdog, boy-next-door charms. It would seem that simply working a bit harder would be a good idea. Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a high-flying real-estate executive. Why would he need money? We are told he earns six figures. Yes, he uses drugs, but not excessive, and certainly not to the extent that he would be in dire financial straits. Given this, the major grounds for the raison d'etre of the movie disappears. How would two relatively intelligent people conclude that robbing their parents' store would be recommended in the slightest? It is the most ridiculous premise for a movie crime I have ever seen. If one thought even a little bit and had a mind bent toward criminality, surely one could think of a better location to rob.Why is Hank given an affair with Andy's wife Gina (Marisa Tomei)? This affair seems to serve no purpose in the film other than as gratuitous grounds for heartache. The scene in which Andy and his father Charles (Albert Finney) cut to the chase of their relationship also comes out of left field. There is no hint before of such great fissure between the two and so the sudden division seems a bit gratuitous. One final scene with which I take issue is the relationship between Hank and his daughter. She is depicted as about 12 and she tells him at one point that he is a loser. Generally 12-year-olds don't make such rational, fact-based, logical arguments culminating in such damning insults.I also found the way in which Charles Hanson's character goes from so calm to psychopathic to be a bit implausible. I just don't think that if one was going to kill someone that only a moment before that one could be as tender as Hanson was. It is as though the writer threw any number of serious personal and professional problems against the wall, hoping that they would congeal into coherent grounds for dysfunctionality. For me, this did not work. The redeeming feature of this film is the acting, most notably from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Marisa Tomei, and Amy Ryan. Seymour is undoubtedly one of the best, if not the best, actor working in movies these days. His range and imagination are almost unparalleled and in this film, he teases out all the colors of a character who has a very broad range of emotions. Ethan Hawke does a good job depicting ne'er-do-well brother Hank although the part written for him is rather one note. Hank is a rather pathetic character and there is (natch) not a lot of depth to his character. Similarly, Amy Ryan is great in her part as Hank's ex-wife with whom she has a very hostile relationship. She and Hawke are both fantastic, but again, there is not a lot of depth in the roles for either one and that seems a shame. Marisa Tomei is fantastic as a rather ditsy wife. Again though, her character seems rather one-note...and why she should be so much a trophy wife I found a bit odd and perhaps even borderline sexist. I found Finney's performance a bit mystifying. He didn't show a lot of emotion, as if sullen were in and of itself a sufficient palette of emotions. I found this a bit surprising given Finney's ability.I have no problem with a dour film like "No Country For Old Men" or "Fargo" or any other film if the circumstances seem to warrant it, but this film doesn't seem to warrant such dysfunction, at least given what we know about the characters as Masterson has written them. I wanted to like this film because of the talent involved, the eminent director, and the possibility that such talent might make for a treat of a film, but ultimately, I found that the script did not facilitate such greatness from the performers.</fullReview>

This is not just a dysfunctional family; it's hateful, evil--and for no apparent reason. The movie's premise was intriguing but the time jumping and extreme behaviour just wasn't believable. I didn't like one character in the movie, except maybe the mother who played a very small part, and the time jumping from "different perspectives" wasn't artsy or informative in any way--it was annoying. There were inconsistencies and confusion and just plain idiocy. Who would rob a store for $600,000 of merchandise for 10% return if in really serious "trouble"? The payoff is not worth the risk, especially since the trouble they are in can't be solved with money. The only reason I gave it a 3 rather than a 1 was because Philliip Seymour Hoffman delivered a pretty good performance given the circumstances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few directors have had the longevity of Sidney Lumet. Though I'm only moderately familiar with his directorial work, I know enough to declare that he has produced two of the most riveting films in cinema history, 'Fail-Safe (1964)' and '12 Angry Men (1957),' the latter being a strong candidate for the greatest directorial debut of all-time. Half a century later, at age 83, Lumet is still making movies, and it seems his ability to thrill audiences has diminished little. 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (2007)' is his latest effort, and perhaps his first film in quite a few years to make a genuine splash in critical circles. An outstanding cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke and a scene-stealing Albert Finney, headline this grim and intense testament to the corrupting and destructive power of money.Andy and Hank Hanson (Seymour Hoffman and Hawke, respectively) are about as different as two brothers can possibly be, but their relationship is never unconvincing; the two men are connected by an unspoken mutual understanding that could only have arisen as a result of growing up together. Andy is wealthy, polished and independent, his hair always slicked back with styling gel, and he is permanently dressed in expensive suits. There's something that rings true in his interactions with deadbeat younger brother Hank, and, being a younger brother myself, I can relate to the way in which Andy talks down to his younger sibling, feigning equality and exploiting a common bondage in order to bully and manipulate Hank into committing the robbery on his behalf {which is to say nothing negative about my own older brother, who's a nice enough chap when it comes down to it}.The heist film, to the best of my knowledge, was born with John Huston's 'The Asphalt Jungle (1950).' In the years since then, most subsequent heist films have dutifully followed the three-act narrative format that proves commonplace for films of its sort ? the preparation, the heist and the aftermath. What I loved about 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' is how Lumet gradually deconstructs and reconstructs, piece by piece, the typical heist flick formula, exploring from differing perspectives how the crime went horribly wrong, and the severe repercussions of their failure. It's a telling sign than Andy and Hank almost completely omit the preparation phase, emphasising that the robbery was poorly thought-out, and, not only was their plan doomed to fail from the very beginning, but that both should shoulder the blame for the events that would transpire as a result of their actions.Lumet had already tried his hands at the heist sub-genre with 'Dog Day Afternoon (1975),' and, as was the case there, he presents us with a version of events that strays significantly from the typical mould. For this film, he was almost certainly influenced by Quentin Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs (1992)' ? which dissects the heist film formula to such a level that the crime itself is never shown ? though you could easily cast your mind back to Stanley Kubrick's 'The Killing (1956)' for its non-linear narrative. 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' is less concerned with the heist itself than with the consequences of its failure, and both Andy and Hank are forced to experience overwhelming guilt and grief, amplified tenfold by the fact that they are wholly responsible for the tragedies they have brought down upon themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's most recent picture, Before The Devil Knows You're Dead opens up with Marissa Tomei and P.S.H. having sex...probably the most promising opening of any film...ever. It then leads into the quote ''May you spend at least a half an hour in heaven before the devil knows that you're dead.'' The film goes downhill from here, besides tour de force performances from PSH and Albert Finney (who deserved an Oscar nomination). The script is very lame and predictable, the motives are completely illogical, there are plenty of plot holes, during the flashbacks, the character says one thing during the first version of a scene and a different line in the second version (Memento did it right, Lumet failed). It has potential to be a good film, but it tries to be as dark as Se7en with..well..a funny (not comical) script. It seems like during every dramatic moment, you're waiting for Borat to pop out from somewhere or for Nicholson to bust down a door with an ax. I started laughing at some scenes that were obviously designed to be dramatic. Also, the editing is pathetic...its really repetitive and obnoxious. Although the acting was very good, if you have crappy direction and a bad script...the film isn't going to be very good. That said, I would recommend that you see the movie, just for Finney's incendiary performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A botched robbery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet, one of the best directors working today, has come out with one of the best films of his career. This crime movie, written by Kelly Masterson, packs a lot of action in its 123 minutes of running time. Mr. Lumet who hasn't had a big success with any of his movies lately, vindicates himself with this tale of murder in suburbia. The story is being told from different angles and perspectives giving another layer of texture to the film.Andy, who we first meet having sex with his wife in a Brazilian hotel, is a man of huge appetites. He has an expensive drug habit which he subsidizes with moneys from the company in which he is an executive of sorts. Andy finds himself in a position which doesn't let him a lot of leeway if he is to keep his love for drugs, and to keep his cheating wife. His brother, Hank, is quite the opposite of Andy, a born loser. Andy has plans to involve his sibling in his get rich scheme.That's why Andy devises a plot to hold up a store in a suburban mall. He enlists Hank to execute the operation. The only trouble is that the jewelry store they plan to hit belongs to his and Hank's own parents. Bobby, a hit man, is enlisted to help Hank do the robbery, but things do not go according to plan. As the pair proceeds to the store, Hank is to stay outside as Bobby scares the salesman. The only problem is that Hank's own mother Nanette, is the one that has come to the store and she is not afraid using a gun, killing Bobby, but she is wounded in action.This duo's father, Charles, is besides himself when he learns about the botched robbery and his own wife's being badly hurt. After she dies, Charles decides to look himself into the case. He is appalled when he realizes the truth; he wants to get to the bottom of it, no matter who it hurts. Little does he realize the gravity of what has been perpetrated against him by his own sons.Philip Seymour Hoffman is Andy, the heartless man whose mind is dominated by the drugs he consumes. This actor is a joy to watch. He never repeats himself from film to film. He is worth the price of admission. Equally effective is Ethan Hawke, the brother that didn't amount to much and whose own life is in turmoil after the messy divorce to Martha. He can't even give his own daughter money for a school outing to see a play! Making another great appearance, Albert Finney is excellent as a father that is horrified by the actions of his sons. It's no wonder Mr. Finney has lasted as long as he has because of his intelligence and his honesty in giving always his best. Marisa Tomei also makes a great Gina, the wife that is cheating her own husband with his own brother! Amy Wright impresses in a minor role and so does Bryan O'Byrne with the small pivotal part as Bobby. Rosemary Harris has nothing to do, unfortunately.The film is a treat for all the fans of Mr. Lumet who shows once again why he has remain one of the most interesting men in the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Be-"Devil"ed: Lumet, Hoffman &amp; Hawke at the top of their game ; one of the year's very best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD (2007) **** Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney, Marisa Tomei, Rosemary Harris, Aleksa Palladino, Michael Shannon, Amy Ryan, Brian F. O'Byrne. Filmmaker Sidney Lumet's pitch- perfect drama of errors about two seriously f@cked up brothers (Hoffman and Hawke, both at the top of their game) who conspire to rob their parents' jewelry store find themselves in a downward spiral when things go horribly awry. Novice scribe Kelly Masterson's screenplay is a wonderful conceit on an old chestnut with sharp dialogue and seriously flawed characters that is equally absorbing and repelling. One of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film ruined my day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film because I'm a huge Pacino fan and thought Lumet did a great job in 'Dog day afternoon' and 'Serpico'; I don't have any further experience in Lumet's filmography, but thought I'd give it a try.Well it turns out the entire thing is a huge mistake. Not only is it pretentious, but the film is actually appalling in many moments. I was pretty surprised to find that it has such positive reviews in IMDb.'Before the devil knows you're dead' is about two brothers who in the need of money decide to rob their parent's business, a small, suburban jeweller's. The heist goes wrong when their own mother is in the store in the morning of the robbery and accidentally gets shot. The brothers then try to get away with the crime and move on with their lives, but things start to fall apart.First of all, what's up with the opening scene? An awkwardly explicit sex scene between Philip Seymour Hoffman and Marisa Tomei that has no connection whatsoever with the rest of the movie. To say the least it's unnecessary.After the viewer gets to watch the actual heist going on, the film starts to lose it's pace and gets completely uninteresting. The fact that it was chosen for the story not be told in a chronological way, but following the characters point of view, making everything even more repetitive, doesn't help much either. But it was Lumet's fault ? other directors, such as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, do it wonderfully. The film is just way too long, tiring, could've been edited better. Other than that there are the ridiculous passages from one scene to another, the pictures popping in the screen with a noise on the background, remembering usual TV series effects.As pointless as the sex scene in the beginning of the film are the many nude Marisa Tomei shots, the scene where Andy (Hoffman) gets heroin injected into his arm, the scenes in the end when he's lost it and starts shooting everyone and last, but not least, the scene when the father smothers his own son (I can't believe he actually went there).The ONLY good thing about this movie is Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting. The way he changes from a person who's got her act together to a complete psycho is amazing. Ethan Hawke is shallow and unconvincing. Marisa Tomei makes no difference. Albert Finney is well, but isn't really helped by his character, which makes him look almost caricatural.Overall the film was a huge waste of time. There isn't even one likable character, the film is pretentious and at times so bad it almost made me laugh. On the same line of subject, I'd recommend Woody Allen's 'Cassandra's dream' ? that shows the anguish and guilt of two brothers who committed a crime, and this time actually builds up some tension ? any day over 'Before the devil knows you're dead'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From unlikely to just plain silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the acting talent on display and director Lumet's smooth narrative style, this one just doesn't work. In this plot line, contrivance is added to contrivance and piled on a coincidence. Just for starters: A drug dealer takes his clients' money and then, as the client watches, adds the bills to a huge pile in an unlocked safe. Naturally, you want your junkie customers to know where you keep your dough. How else could they come back later in the movie and steal it? Only if you have a very high tolerance for this sort of hokum should you spend your hard-earned mite on this. Why did the NY Film Festival make such a big deal of it? A member of the audience suggested it was because Lumet has been making movies in N.Y. for so long they feel like they owe him a thank you. That seems as good an explanation as any. Or maybe they were just star-struck by the list of actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember William H. Macy in FARGO, how things just got progressively worse for the guy after the crime was committed? BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is a lot like that, just without the black humor, and every character pays a price. The outlook is bleak for everyone involved - and while that's not normally a selling point for me, I couldn't look away. This is a two hour stretch of top-shelf talent, and the acting is what drew me in. The sublime Marisa Tomei didn't hurt either, but I'm trying to be mature about this. This isn't light-n-fluffy material in the least, but it's a good story with great performances.And Marisa Tomei's also in it. Lumet knew what he was doing.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed it more the second time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm writing this review after my second viewing of 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.' I watched it on DVD when it first came out and, to be honest, it didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. If you asked me to describe it, I'd probably say something like, 'Oh, it was about a heist... or something.' To be fair, that is part of the film. I don't know what I started thinking about it years later, but I decided to give it another go. And I'm glad I did. Yes, it's about a heist. Although, the main ingredient in this film is about moral dilemmas. Two brothers (Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke), both with financial problems, decide to rob their parents' jewellery store as a way of making a fast buck (while not admitting that they're heavily in debt ? and why).Naturally, things don't go their way and both of them find themselves stuck in an ever deceasing spiral as more and more things get out of control. I won't go into the actual plot in too much detail, as anything I say will probably spoilt the film of you. However, what is nice is that you can see things from their points of view. Both men have problems. Yes, there may be easier (legal?!) ways of getting cash, but both have already gone too far to be able to turn around and utilise legitimate money-making means. Then, when things start to go wrong, everything happens logically. You'll feel for the two men (even if you don't always like them). Albert Finney is on the cast list and he does a good job, too. Although his part is decidedly smaller than his two on-screen sons, but what he does he does well.'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' is a slow film. Maybe when I watched it before I was expecting some sort of 'action-orientated' gangster film where people are shooting each other and delivering a witty quip here and there. It's nothing like that. If you're looking for that sort of experience, look somewhere else. This film is quieter, subtle and sadder in tone. It's also nearly two hours long, but, despite being slow, that's not a bad thing.If you're in the mood for 'thoughtful' over 'thrilling' give this one a go. I'm definitely going to watch it again ? probably in a few years, but definitely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>MY REVIEW: The Devil's Drama!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. Two brothers plan to rob their own parents' jewelery store but things go horribly wrong. The plot seems apt for a thriller or for a crime comedy filled with black humor but director Sydney Lumet takes the difficult path of making it a dark emotional drama. Sydney uses the non-linear narration and unpredictability of events that keeps you interested. Philip Seymour Hoffman playing the no nonsense elder brother shows some solid acting. He uses his body language to express his pain and anger. Ethan Hawke playing the younger brother also does not disappoint. Albert Finney playing the role of father leaves a lasting impression in his short but important role. Movie loses some brownie points by getting too slow at times and too dark to enjoy. However, if you are still interested in going through a dark emotional crime drama then this one is a perfect fit. I am going with 7 out of 10 for Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. It's a nice old school dark drama worth trying once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Victimless Crime" Gone Wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's 2007 film "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a drama/crime thriller about two brothers who decide to solve their money problems by robbing a jewelry store, and not just any jewelry store. It's a "victimless crime" argues the older brother and mastermind (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). The younger brother (Ethan Hawke) is hoodwinked into the harebrained scheme, but makes the mistake of adding a third person to the mix. From there it's a steady downward spiral.Marisa Tomei plays Seymour's wife and, although her character is shallow, materialistic and immoral, Marisa never looked better (at 42). She appears in a couple of very adult-oriented scenes, so stay away if that deters you.Albert Finney plays the grieving and vengeful father.The story is akin to 1998's "A Simple Plan" in regards to a money-making scheme gone awry. The difference is that the loot in "A Simple Plan" was drug money from a crashed plane and was basically up for grabs. Consequently, the characters are never viewed as criminals by viewers; they're just regular folks taking advantage of a pot of gold thrown into their laps. It's their lust for filthy lucre that is their downfall.By contrast, the scheme in "Before the Devil" is a clear-cut crime right out of the gate, even though Hoffman justifies it as victimless. With the possible exception of the whimpering Hawke character none of the people win the viewer's sympathy. They're getting exactly what they deserve.Another problem is the ending. The scenario in the hospital room is unrealistic. A 3/5 Star review by a physician gives the details of why this entire scene is implausible. Check it out (Amazon reviewer Judith S. Inouye, June 2, 2008).That said, the film is expertly made. Roger Ebert gave it a perfect score. Some complain about the mixing of chronology, but I found the story structure well done, interesting and easy-to-follow.The main problem is that the film revels in the worst in humanity. Take, for instance, Hawke's ex-wife who can't say one word to him without cussing and sheer antagonism. Or how about a peripheral character's brother who seeks to extort money from Hawke, an obnoxious tough guy who evidently thinks he's immortal (Michael Shannon)? Or what about the father, Albert Finney: Can the tragic events in the story be an opportunity for him to search his own heart and work toward positive changes, investigate the "sins of the fathers", discuss things, etc.? Forget it. With the possible exception of one character these people are too far gone.So what's the point? Don't commit crimes to make fast cash? Don't develop an expensive drug habit? Don't marry a selfish, unfaithful, materialistic woman? Don't marry a witch with a capital 'B'? The sins of the father will pass on and multiply? Arrogant tough guys must die? Some people live off the evil of others? Perhaps all the above."Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a hard film to rate. It's well made and maintains your interest. Most importantly, it lingers with you, which is the main reason I recommend it. It offers wisdom to stay on the straight and narrow. But, come on, can't we have ONE person with redeemable qualities, even if it's an enlightened change of heart? Thankfully, one person might fit this description at the end. I give it a B+ but I can understand why some rate it lower and others higher.The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Queens, Manhattan and White Plains, NY.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had potential, but don't grows up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had the potential to be one of the very best of 2007, due to the script, but it was wasted. The direction kinda ruined the film. The non-linear narrative chosen was a mess: there was no need for it. Gratuitous, i must say. Some point of views in the story are pointless and don't add nothing to it, much the opposite. It also killed some twists in it that would be work perfectly fine. Also, i felt that the script lacked a bit of humor and dread. It's too dread in all aspects of filmmaking. The cinematography, or better, the art design, was very bad. The generic and bright gray was all over the place, and this is really a common aspect in the low budget Hollywood films that i strongly dislike. Because after all, it kills the colors of the film. Colors are essential.The soundtrack was as well generic. Just a tongue in the cheek score which plays like thrice in the entire film. Could've done a lot better. The performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman was great tough. He really did well portraying the disturbed predicted future psycho man.Anyways, this film could've done a lot better, but unfortunately it is that way and i don't recommend. 6.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Deep in the hole in money matters, he's been embezzling his firm for months, Andy Hanson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, has come up with a fool proof plan to not only cover his stealing but also get his equally dead beat brother Hank, Eathan Hawke, out of the mess that he now finds himself in. Hank is behind in his child support payments as well as his rent and is in danger of being evicted from his flea bag and roach infested studio apartment!The plan that Andy came up with is in knocking off the family jewelry store at the Westchester Shoping Mall of $600,000.00 in cash &amp; jewelry and then fence it at .20 on the dollar, $120,000.00, with the help of 47th Street diamond &amp; jewelry crook William payed by the barley alive 90 year old Leonardo Cimino in his last movie role. As fool proof as Andy's plan is it has a few flaws in it one being his not so on the ball brother Hank. Hank not having the stomach to rob the place, even with him wearing a disguised, get's this two bit drug addicted hood from Red Hook Brooklyn Bobby, Brian O'Byrne, to pull off the job with him just being the getaway driver. Things completely backfire on both Hank &amp; Bobby with Hank's mom Annette, Rosemary Harris, instead of store clerk Gloria being in the store at the time of the robbery. Annette after getting shot by a hooded Bobby ends up blasting him away and thus killing Bobby in the return fire! With Annette now on life support Hank as well as Andy together with their father Annette's husband Charles Hanson, Albert Finney, have to make the dreadful decision to pull the plug on her in that she's been declared brain dead by the physicians attending to her in the hospital emergency ward!Things go from bad to worse for the brothers with Bobby's brother in law Dex, Michael Sannon, showing up at the bar where Hank works at, as a bus boy and part-time bartender. Dex attempts to blackmail Hank for 10 G's in order to keep his mouth shut about what he knows in Hank being the getaway driver in the failed jewelry store, where Hank's mom was shot,robbery! Now really behind the eight ball Andy the brains of this failed robbery starts to lose it in trying to both have Dex keep his mouth shut as well as get the money to pay him off. This leads to a shoot out and robbery at Andy's, who's addicted to drugs, drug supplier Justin's, Brain Horton, upper East Side luxury apartment where both he and an Innocent bystander, a customer of his zonked out on heroin, gets killed! ***SPOILERS*** It's old man Hanson who finally finds out what his sons, or in the case of Andy, or son is up to. Never having had any use for Andy in the first place Charles soon finds out in him tracking down leads from diamond and jewelry fencer William that it was Andy,by leaving his business card with him, who was the person behind the knocking off his jewelry store that ended up with his wife and Andy &amp; Hank's mom Annette, who had since died, getting shot! Charles follows Andy as well as Hank to Red Hook Brooklyn where they went to meet Dex to pay him off. It's in Dex's apartment where Andy decides to double-crosses Dex by instead of giving him the 10 G's,that he and Hank stole from Justin, and blows him away with him, as he has his back turned, in turn gets blown away by Dex's sister and Bobby's widow Chris, Aleksa Palladino.***MAJOR MAJOR SPOILER*** Alive but barley and on life support Andy ends up in the Long Island Collage Hospital emergency ward on life support just like his mom was earlier in the film. Charles pays his cheating and rotten to the core son Andy one last visit and pulls off the prefect crime that both Andy &amp; Hank failed at. And he pulled it off at his son Andy Hanson's expense!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Part low-key heist movie, part family drama in the Shakespearean sense, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is an engrossing tale of the implosion of one family centering around a failed jewelry store robbery.Hoffman as Andy Hanson inhabits a multi-faceted role, a charismatic payroll officer who has married out of his league. He procures money by shady means to feed his heroin addiction, and an upcoming IRS audit forces him to desperate measures - an armed robbery on his own parents' business.That is intriguing enough, but the script hints at deeper issues for this rebellion. Hoffman at one point asks his father if he really is his biological offspring. Is this childhood frailty rearing its head - or a hint at possible infidelity on the part of the recently deceased mother? Andy's sexual impotence seems to mirror an impotence in his character - he can't carry out the robbery himself, he can't give up drugs, and he can't admit he wants his father dead. There is a wonderful scene where his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei) is leaving him, having admitted cheating with Andy's younger brother. Instead of the histrionics a lesser dramatist might have performed, we see Andy limply hand over cab money to Gina.Ethan Hawke as troubled younger brother Hank oozes indecision and weakness. Andy bullies him, but Hank is having his own revenge through Gina. Hank escapes, leaving Andy and their father to resolve the family crisis in the only way a revenge drama could be resolved. The relationship between Andy and his father drives the story, and provides its resolution. The film's main weakness is that this relationship could be foregrounded more. Albert Finney has too little screen time to merit the weight of his actions in the film's climax.The film plays with time structure, jumping back and ahead around the day of the heist. It is a decorative and self-conscious trope that is ultimately superfluous - it detracts from rather than enhances the drama. I suspect a chronological representation of events would have had more impact. Ditto the four-flash lightening style transitions that quickly become annoying.However, the acting and writing (aided by an evocative score) overcome these stylistic flaws. Patricide, filicide, jealousy, betrayal, lust and inadequacy are just some of the elements explored in this very satisfying drama, the usual mix of conflict and high emotion that we have come to expect from Lumet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't review without going into SPOILERS so beware. Don't read if you don't want it all spoilt for you.I'm undecided on this one. It has some interesting plot twists that are created by the disjointed telling of the story. If they just told the story in linear fashion you wouldn't have been mislead into thinking the robber who was shot was the older brother. But in other instances the disjointed time line just served to needlessly confuse the storyline. So I'm not sure if I liked that. It worked for me in Pulp Fiction but not so much here.The acting was superb. Hawke was brilliant after things started to go awry. I know people like that who start transforming physically when things go wrong. He was a nervous wreck and had it down to a T. Hoffman had a tougher role to play as a guy giving off the appearance of being in charge while all around him is falling to pieces. Unlike others, I don't think Marisa Tomei was given much to do in this film other than look absolutely stunning with her top off. Even the funeral scene where she wears the black dress with the plunging neckline - that's a surefire way to cure a man's grief right there.The filming was OK. Overall I'll give it a 7. It's worth a watch. Interesting idea, some interesting plot twists, great performances, and a topless Marisa Tomei.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of the movie is taken from an Irish toast: "May you have food and raiment, a soft pillow for your head; may you be 40 years in heaven, before the devil knows you're dead." An interesting insight when you consider that the film starts with the melancholy of a Yeats and gets more ominous by the film's end. More ominous still is despite being one of director Sidney Lumet's strongest films, it was also his last. Lumet died of Cancer April 9, 2011 leaving behind a legacy of marvelous films including 12 Angry Men (1957), Network (1976), Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and The Verdict (1982).Before the Devil Knows You're Dead seemingly came out of nowhere. Lumet's last feature was the little seen Vin Diesel vehicle Find Me Guilty (2006), which while being criminally underrated, is far from a masterpiece. While a confectioner of New York grit and a worthy contributor to the post-studio era of American films, even devotees like myself have to admit Lumet was a bit of a has been by the year 2000. He limped along making mediocre fare suitable for TV as opposed to large movie screens. Even during his heyday Critic Pauline Kael called his films counterfeit and Lumet himself a poor craftsman, "prodigal with bad ideas?" If Kael were alive today she may have to eat crow given the directorial mastery present in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. Everything from the acting to the editing to the cinematography is just a joy to watch and the results are so emotionally shocking that it's hard not to appreciate the man and his "poor craftsmanship". Lumet put his all into making Before the Devil Knows You're Dead and it shows. It brings to mind some of his non-flagship films like Long Day's Journey into Night (1962) and Prince of the City (1981) only with the added bonus of digital film techniques.But what exactly is this film about? I hear you cry. Well the storyline is relatively simple; two brothers (Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman) are in need of some quick cash for various reasons and decide to rob a strip mall jewelry store. It's supposed to be a bloodless, victimless crime but things never go the way they should in films like these. Both Hawke and Hoffman do excellent jobs and are further bolstered by the likes of Marisa Tomei, Michael Shannon and an unforgettable performance by Albert Finney, the twos' father.The editing cuts back and forth between the past and present to design a collage of violence, affecting drama and grief. While jarring at first, the back and forth creates a fractured dialogue in your head. As soon as things start to settle, we are taken to another part of the journey and forced to piece things together. It's a movie that took thought and therefore requires you to put thought into your viewing. Even if the story was told straight from beginning to end, it would still be devastating to watch; it'd just seem longer to get to the story's jarring climax.The less I say about Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, the better. I implore you, beseech you, dare you to just see this film. The movie may sound bleak but in a story where no one seems to come up on top, the audience certainly benefits. That and the esteemed Sidney Lumet who gets one last gem past the critics.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

Its like Fargo sans the dark humor. There are a few problems along the way, some dialog seems a bit out of character and Ethan Hawks story seems unresolved. I found the opening was a bit gratuitous, and an off note to the rest of the film. It does makes sense later but just a oddly out of character way to begin. The story is told out of sequence, ala Pulp Fiction, and that technique can easily fall apart or become too gimmicky. But it was executed masterfully in this case. Great script and performances.

		<fullReview>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead appears to be the result of the late Sidney Lumet getting in on a proverbial act; a post-Pulp Fiction addition to that canon of multi-stranded crime movies for a post-Pulp Fiction generation, most of whom are still sitting there to this day stunned that a certain character in Tarantino's 1994 opus can be killed off about half way through before reappearing again for an extended time later on. Breaking somewhat of a mould for an audience at that time, the film's legacy brought to fruition a number of pieces along varying lines of decency, some of which were Liman's 1999 film "Go" and Britain's own Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the year previously. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead feels like the result of a director of such esteemed reputation taking a step back; observing and then advancing so as to try it out for himself, having long since been there already and most likely with the ability to remember the days when all this kid's stuff of telling stories out of sync and aiming for naturalistic dialogue of the time was popular with those youngsters over in France.The film reminded me of Clint Eastwood's 2003 piece Mystic River, as a film about this really close knit group of men suffering from the fallout of a tragic occurrence - a death in both cases, as well as either film's depiction of each of them heading off into pits of anguish wherein which they must confront their lifestyles and morality. Said sentence will make the film sound grisly or "difficult"; not so, for it has this filed off and raw edge to it that sees it get by on a number of affecting sequences involving action and consequence, but, crucially, are backed up in its depiction of the sorts of anguish and fallout involving the perpetrators. Much like Mystic River, through its Brian Helegland penned screenplay, there is enough of a mainstream appeal to the project without it at all feeling like a dumbed down series of chases and shootouts.The film covers several people, mostly male and mostly all of whom are related to one another, over the space of several days. They range from Ethan Hawke's Hank, to Albert Finney's elderly jewelry store owner Charles; in the middle being Hank's elder brother Andy (Hoffman), a drug addict and financial executive whose habits are so affecting that he must absorb some cocaine before an important board meeting, but someone with some serious financial problems and thus desperate enough to put into action what he does. Andy's flimsy wife, Marisa Tomei's Gina, is a further complication to an already simple enough family set up about to go drastically wrong as all of grief; frayed morals and the need for revenge take centre stage. Unfolding in near enough reverse order, with a number of scenes depicted more than once from varying perspectives, a robbery of his own family's store is organised by Andy with the intent to place the blame onto someone else ? unfortunately, things go wrong; bullets fly and those whom were not supposed to be anywhere near injury are indeed put in a place wherein such things are the least of one's worries.Lumet directs each strand superbly, with the additional sense of the film's ability to keep action flowing and things consistently happening without necessarily revealing the bigger picture prominent; a bizarre little sensation keeping with us this distinct feeling of everything always on the move and with everything persistently advancing although doing so with the withholding of certain details still prominent. Observe the impeccable build up to the robbery itself: Hank has called on a friend named Bobby to do the robbing whilst Hank does the driving. En route, Bobby listens to loud and scattered grunge music as he drives by himself to the destination; something juxtaposed with the elegant, non-diegetic instrumental music playing over his arrival. One could say the instrumental music epitomises the delicacy of the task at hand, with Bobby's thundering; clumsy and cocksure attitudes exuded through his own physicality and choice of song summing up just how far away he is from what's required.To speak of it as a causality thriller does not do it justice; this is a cutting, rounded film depicting several people of varying sorts and places in life thrust into a melting pot of strife and bother. Through certain eyes, this may strike people as being akin to a veteran player of snooker, or some other 'longer' format of a sport, taking hold of their trusty cue for a one-off brash, and populist, 9-ball pool tournament which mostly everyone is presently going mad for. In filmmaking terms, the man here is Lumet making a damn good fist of things and, we might hope, making a few new fans along the way whom may very well feel inspired to check out some of what got him to this point in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No interesting characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A complete waste of talent. Solid performances from Hoffman and Tomei(who looks gorgeous for any age) can't save this predictable over-edited nightmare. Firstly, it abuses my least favorite narrative device where it starts at the climax and then keeps jumping around (2 days earlier, one week later, 4 days earlier) the story. Unless there's a very clever reveal a la Usual Suspects the only point seems to be to distract from a weak plot. The characters are all petty, whiny users and I honestly didn't care what happened to any of them. When things do unravel in fairly predictable ways you will find yourself wanting people to get killed just so you don't have to endure any more screen time from them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The depths of human behaviour</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to watch this film because of Sidney Lumet, a director who has left a legacy of original and provocative films. I was not disappointed because this movie packs a tremendous punch; the story is a shocker that shows the depths of human behaviour.The leading characters are brothers, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke. Their lives unwind when they consciously decide to commit a robbery, an act that is the first step down a slippery slope to hell on earth. Everyone in their family is implicated, particularly their parents, played by Rosemary Harris and Albert Finney. Albert Finney is excellent in his role as a bereaved husband. Rosemary Harris is an actor I like very much. Her role was short but well delivered. Her death unleashes the hellish sequence of events, displayed in a series of flashbacks that knit the characters together in this tense drama.Hoffman and Hawke are both excellent. Hawke is the erratic younger brother who is manipulated by Hoffman, who is almost totally without any sense of morality. Marisa Tomei (as Hoffman's wife) is very convincing as the neglected wife who leads her own double life as sexual partner. Brian O'Byrne and Michael Shannon, as blackmailer and stool pigeon, are both outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoffman shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet, director of 12 Angry Men (10/10), Deathtrap (9/10), and Network (8/10), died today at 86. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a solid film to end six decades of work. I'm sure Hawke, Hoffman, and Tomei are happy to have added to their respectable filmographies under Lumet's direction. After some consideration, I prefer it as it is to a linear format.Ethan Hawke's Hank understandably takes on a straightforward plan and screws up in an idiotic, albeit believable way, essentially destroying his family. It raises the question of how many people would go along with such a crime under similar circumstances.Philip Seymour Hoffman is outstanding, as he was in Doubt (9/10). Intense and funny, I'm tremendously impressed by him. There isn't a better actor working today in terms of ability and promise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unpleasant Subject Matter and "Twist"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We've seen types of movies like "Before the Devil Knows Your Dead" before. And this particular film adds a nasty twist to the genre. (spoilers)The pacing of the movie is slow especially in the first third of the movie, and there's the in vogue cutting of time sequences so that the narrative is not linear, but sort of overlapping. The effect is mostly neutral though. Acting is very good for most of the support and lead characters, but the subject matter is quite unpalatable and base. Towards the end of the movie social fabric of characters lives has disintegrated into wanton crime and despicable gratuitous violence. At one point a shopkeeper in the movie remarks "the World is an Evil Place" - ironic for such a movie to state such like the pot and the kettle black.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unhappy brothers try an unsuccessful heist with grave consequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the Devil Knows you're dead is a dark and rather cold film about actions with far-reaching consequences. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke play a couple of brothers with completely differing lifestyles. Philip plays Andy Hansen, a senior real estate manager with a lovely but disillusioned wife and an expensive drug addiction. Ethan plays his brother who doesn't have much of a clue at all, being an absent father owing a lot of child support and not a happy man. Andy enlists his brother in a jewellery store heist with a difference: one which allegedly carries no risks. The jewellery store in question is owned by Andy and Hank's parents and so both brothers know the layout of the place. Hank reluctantly goes through with it and enlists the help of a colleague to do the dirty work whilst he drives. Yet the heist goes horribly wrong. The brothers' mother is seriously harmed in the movie and eventually dies from her injuries. The film takes its time then establishing through a series of disjointed connections how Andy and Hank's father discovers that Andy is the man responsible for organising the whole sorry affair in the first place.The rest of the film is merely exposition. Andy and Hank's father Charles slowly discovers his son's involvement, not realising that Hank, too, was involved albeit from a distance. As everything for Hank and Andy starts to fall apart, the film piles on the pressure.This film is a well meaning attempt to tell an established story of botched heist which is the subject of many such films, including Reservoir Dogs. The difference being, that it is not as flashy as Tarantino's earlier effort and has the benefit of less rather unnecessary violence until the last few moments. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a fantastic job of giving us a character dealing with a messy marriage to a wife he obviously has such difficulty connecting with that she has an affair with his brother, a job which drives him to cocaine and heroin and unrealistic lifestyle choices with a desire to escape. Ethan Hawke is brilliant as the spineless loser of a brother who can't even pull off a robbery on property he knows very well and Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei are very good at their slightly under-developed characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quality crime thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most films that start with a bang find it difficult to keep up the pace, but this one grows deeper as it goes along thanks largely to a narrative that jumps around chronologically ? frequently at first, but less so as the various strands and character motives are gradually pulled together ? and a patience that allows it to get under the skin of its two principal characters.The cast is first class and the principal players all give creditable performances, although it's Philip Seymour Hoffman who carries the picture as a smarmy but quietly desperate businessman whose financial worries prompt him to hatch the kind of plan that looks foolproof on paper but which you know is destined to unravel the moment it is set in motion. Hawke's character is nowhere near as multi-dimensional as Hoffman's: his Hank is a dim-witted loser, providing the weakest link in both the robbery and the storyline. It takes a certain amount of suspension of disbelief to accept his brother Andy selecting him as an accomplice. Anyone spending more than five minutes in the same room with the guy would know instinctively that he would find a way to screw up the most airtight of plots ? but his brother doesn't? I don't think so, somehow, no matter how desperate he was.The film contains a few plot holes like this, and they do tend to niggle as you watch. I think some of them ? such as Hank renting the getaway car in his own name thereby practically guaranteeing his eventual capture ? are probably deliberate to enhance the foreshadowing of doom that surrounds the film (and the sense of a net slowly but inexorably closing in around the two brothers is superbly captured) but, for some reason, they just don't sit right. We don't really need the signposts to be written that large, especially as the plot leaves Hank's fate open (although entirely predictable).Sidney Lumet was 83-years-old when he directed this, and the film stands as a testament to his continuing ability to deliver quality, character-driven entertainment laced with a dark edge. The storyline is both compelling and enjoyable, despite its minor inconsistencies, and is worth a couple of hours of most people's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another version of "A Simple Plan."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Both this movie and the earlier "A Simple Plan" share a theme in the corrupting power of money, or the desire to get it, to the point that it destroys relationships that normally would be sacred. BDKYD is not an easy movie to watch, especially during its last acts. The acting is superb.Philip Seymour Hoffman is Andy, a New Yorker who seems to have it together. But he has a secret that no one else knows. He has been spending money on himself, satisfying a bad habit, and needs money desperately.Ethan Hawke is Hank, Andy's younger brother. Hank is divorced with a young son and seems to be always behind in his support payments. Hank too needs money desperately.When Hank goes to Andy for help, the older brother has a very simple plan, they will rob a mom and pop jewelry store, expecting a cash and jewel take of around $600,000 and no one gets hurt because the insurance will cover it. Hank and Andy are very familiar with the store's operation. They both worked there at one time. In fact it is owned by their own parents! Albert Finney is Charles, the father of the two young men. Marisa Tomei is Gina, married to Andy.Suffice to say not all goes as hoped, the robbers get into hot water and the rest of the movie is to see if they can extricate themselves agreeably. They cannot! Excellent movie, but one that is hard to watch at times.MAJOR SPOILERS: Andy was "too busy", so talked Hank into pulling of the robbery for both of them. He was to use a plastic gun. But Hank enlisted the services of an ex-con, who chose to carry a real gun that morning. Instead of the woman who normally opens the store, it was Andy and Hank's mom. When the robber was distracted she got to the hidden pistol and shot him, and he in turn shot her. She managed to get off another shot and killed the intruder, whose friends eventually traced his death back to Hank. Hank and Andy got no money, and mom soon died in the hospital. Later Andy was hospitalized, and when dad found out what all happened after tailing them and speaking to an old jewelry "fence", he used a pillow to smother and kill his own evil son, for having killed his wife, their mother. Only Hank appeared to come out of everything in good shape. And by the way, he had been having an ongoing sexual relationship with Gina, Andy's wife.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two no-good brothers plot the robbery of their parents' jewellery shop. It goes all wrong. The father (Finney) forgives his hospitalised son, then kills him. Marisa Tomei shows all. Reasonable premise, badly executed.I couldn't watch any more of this than to work out why it was boring and ultimately unwatchable. In spite of Lumet's slick direction (an obvious time-jump attempt at a Reservoir Dogs tribute), the naturalistic photography of suburban white America, the cool music, Marisa Tomei's bumps, etc, the problem is with the main characters.You know how in a movie, you get a character who you're meant to hate from the minute he appears? He's ugly but thinks he's good looking, he's a nerd but thinks he's cool, you just wish the hero/antihero would push him under a bus asap? He's often not even the main villain. Both the Hanson brothers are just this type of movie trope. In HAHBYD, there is no hero or antihero, no focus for your loyalty or identification, just a focus for your dislike. It's like a film full of (Fargo's) Jerry Lundegaards, the chiselling, conniving, corrupt used-car salesman, except that these Lundegaards have no self-loathing, which is what made the original character pitiable. The Hansons are too smug and pleased with themselves - after all, one (the late, unappetising, Philip Seymour Hoffman) gets to have sex with Marisa Tomei in the opening scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy, but wonderfully done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before The Devil Knows You're Dead is a wonderfully done, but definitely heavy film where one bad decision leads to mayhem and tragedy. The plot sounds familiar, and in many ways this reminds me of both A Simple Plan and Fargo, but without any humor. By the end, it definitely feels heavy but also worth it. The cast is fantastic here though, most notably Finney and Hoffman, the latter of whom I think is one of the best actors working today, if not the best when it comes to complete filmography and how consistent his performances are. The only one who comes off too cartoonish here is Marisa Tomei. I thought she was great in some scenes, sort of over-doing it in others. Overall, this is fantastic, one of the best of 2007 and I cannot believe it took me this long to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know where this story of family dysfunctions and crime came from. It's all hatred and intrigue and betrayal and weakness and ruthlessness. Substitute swords for the guns and it could have been Aeschylus.God, what a depressing movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman -- and, Phil, please, let's knock off the middle names? -- Philip Seymour Hoffman is the self-indulgent, wicked son of jewelry-store owner Albert Finney. Hoffman is married to the sexual Spatlese Marisa Tomei but, what with all his drug use and obsession with self, he can't satisfy her. He can't even TALK to her about anything much. Hoffman works at a real estate office where he has become a master of the universe by embezzlement and is about to be undone by an IRS audit. He needs the dough badly. Although he lives well enough by the standards of New York City, he wants still more, so that he can whisk himself and his wife away to an eternal vacation in Rio de Janeiro. In order to get the money, he enlists the help of his weakling younger brother, Ethan Hawke, in a crazy scheme to rob their parents jewelry store in Westchester at a time when nobody is behind the counter except an old lady who is deaf and blind.Are you following all this? Good, because there will be a quiz. And don't bother trying to find this in Cliff's Notes either.I'm going to skip the rest of the plot details because by now you must have the general picture. Man, is this a Sidney Lumet film. Everybody is helpless in the grip of the tentacular city. The angel of principle is perched on one shoulder and the devil of solipsism on the other. Nobody truly loves anybody else. And in the end, Hoffman is responsible for the deaths of his mother and, far worse, his drug supplier. Hawke is responsible for the death of a louche friend. Finney is responsible for the death of Hoffman. And -- I forget.The direction by Lumet is okay, except for a few jarring cuts between scenes that come across like a sudden burst of static on FM radio during Easy Listening Hour. That's unlike Lumet, whose transitions are usually nicely linear. Ditto for the story itself, which switches back and forth within the time frame, along with subtitles like "Charlie: The Day of the Robbery." I don't know what prompted the use of this slightly dizzying structure but it, too, is unusual for Lumet.The performances are all up to par, what you'd expect from such a seasoned cast. Hoffman is, as we've come to expect, sublimely competent in his role. He's an easy-going gent who is a seething, neural shambles inside. When he's making his pitch to Hawke, he makes robbing your mother's and father's store sound like a slam dunk, and an amusingly ironic one at that. And when he's got a gun aimed at someone, he trembles all over, a Vesuvius about to pop.But -- I don't know. The whole thing, as nicely done as it is, is such a downer that I don't think I'd want to watch it again. Definitely worth seeing once, though, if for nothing other than Philip S. Hoffman's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Brilliant Acting Makes an Unpleasant Story Watchable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sidney Lumet (NETWORK; SERPICO; 12 ANGRY MEN)has managed the impossible and has mounted a surprisingly riveting drama thanks to superior acting from a hand-picked cast and Lumet's solid directorial hand. BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is a rather mean-spirited story that is made watchable because of its professional polish and the talent in front of and behind the camera. This intense family drama is the story of Andy and Hank Hanson, two brothers in deep financial trouble, who hatch a plan to rob their parents' jewelry story, a plan that goes horribly awry, resulting in the death of two people. What these brothers plan to do is completely vile and reprehensible; however, thanks to an intricate screenplay by Kelly Masterson, which requires close attention, as it flashes forward and backward to explain what drove these brothers to do what they do and the harrowing consequences of their actions, you understand how the Hanson brothers are driven to do what they do but you can't help but accept the eventual consequences of their actions. Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman is brilliantly unhinged as Andy, the unconscionable mastermind behind this scheme, with major father issues, whose embezzling at work and drug addiction have driven him to this desperate point. Ethan Hawke delivers the performance of his career as Hank, the high-strung younger brother, three months behind in his child support and labeled a loser by his own daughter, desperate to regain his daughter's respect. Albert Finney is rock solid, as always, as the father, bitter and unapologetic about the kind of father he was, frustrated with the police's lack of interest in nailing the culprit of this horrific crime. Marisa Tomei delivers one of her stronger turns as Andy's empty-headed wife, who is having an affair with Hank and the legendary Rosemary Harris shines briefly in the role of the mother. Brian F. O'Byrne is also memorable in a brief role as Bobby, Hank's partner in executing the robbery. These are unpleasant people wrapped up in an ugly story which you actually find yourself questioning the fact that it is actually unfolding before your eyes, but the actors and director so completely commit to the misery that is this story, that it envelops you and stays with you long after the credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tragic crime drama presented with considerable flair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the title "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" comes from an Irish proverb the film plays out like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with a botched robbery and continues to spiral out of control as two brothers attempt to escape the mess they've gotten themselves into.The cast is well-assembled with Philip Seymour Hoffman &amp; Ethan Hawke playing the aforementioned brothers. Notable support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and lover of the other. Beyond these principals the acting is unremarkable.The story is compelling and is told with a certain degree of verve. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different points of view and frequent time shifts. That being said, the film's unpredictability is somewhat muted since it becomes apparent early on that this story is a tragedy, through and through. All in all, a pretty impressive debut for first-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson.Sidney Lumet's direction is well handled but I'm more impressed by the fact that he's still directing at over eighty years old. I was less impressed by the score by Carter Burwell but it isn't a major distraction.In the end, the film proves to be compelling viewing and while the story &amp; presentation may have superficial similarities to other films this one remains a unique experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Family's Final Stand.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To watch Philip Seymour Hoffmann, Ethan Hawke and Albert Finney play together sent shivers down my spine; I think that they got the best out in each other. Especially Philip made the best of his part and he was so intense and "naked" that it at certain points actually made me uneasy. He felt so vulnerable and desperate that I felt like a voyeur that had no right to be "staring". He could really act as if you were watching a mans most inner and private moments and I think that is a rare gift to have as an actor. Then again I might be biased as I am a huge fan of him ever since I first saw him in "Happiness". Ethan Hawke did a remarkable job too as the kid brother who never got to be anything but a weak and easily manipulated guy with a very soft spot for his daughter. And I don't think that his part was easy to play as it involved displaying contradicting feelings a lot of the time. The story is up to a certain point simple and has been given a good synopsis of this in other reviews. There are some points that wasn't all to clear for me and one of them were the reference to "Rio". We weren't told what had happened there so anybodies guess is as good as mine. The progression in the story felt a little slow at times and it felt a little unnecessary to watch some of the scenes twice although new material appeared. This is about the only critical remark that I can come up with. If you want to watch a movie with realism, spiced up with interpersonal estrangement and if you can bear to follow through to a very dark and sinister ending this is just what you should go see.Regards Simon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irony and Fate are the true, de facto stars of "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," an ingeniously constructed and beautifully crafted tale of an attempted robbery - one that goes awry in ways that the participants could never possibly imagine or foresee.Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke play two brothers who have recently fallen on hard times. Andy (Hoffmann) is a real estate accountant who needs money to feed his secret heroin addiction, while Hank (Hawke) is a doting, divorced father who is already three months behind on his alimony and child payments. Hank, the "weakling," is initially reluctant to turn to a life of crime to solve his problems, but desperation and the persuasive powers of his domineering older sibling finally convince him to do it."Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is the latest work by veteran director Sidney Lumet, who in his prime gave us "Twelve Angry Men," "The Pawnbroker," "Dog Day Afternoon," "Network," and "The Verdict," and who here demonstrates that, even in this his sixth decade of movie-making, he is still at the top of his game. In his most famous - invariably urban-based - dramas, Lumet has always been far more concerned with character study than with plot mechanics per se - even when, as is certainly the case here, the film boasts one of the most purely fascinating story lines of any movie in recent memory. For, indeed, with every twist and turn of the narrative, Lumet and screenwriter Kelly Masterson reveal new and fascinating aspects of the characters, as we watch the brothers becoming ever more entangled in a web of their own making, till, finally, no good options are left. To draw us deeper into the plight of the characters and the world they have created for themselves, the filmmakers have come up with a demanding and complex - but always comprehensible - multi-level time structure through which to tell their story, creating a fascinating puzzle for the audience to solve.Thanks to brilliant performances by Hoffmann, Hawke and Albert Finney as the boys' father, the movie evolves into a gripping family drama in which feelings and resentments, simmering just beneath the surface for decades, are suddenly brought to the fore by the heavy-handed machinations of Fate."Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" has all the earmarks of a classic tragedy, with one glaring exception: Andy and Hank demonstrate little of the potential nobility whose fall we would normally be called upon to mourn. This makes the movie a true product and reflection of the times in which we live. First-rate on every level, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" stands as one of the top movie releases of 2007.</fullReview>

The scenes took toooo long to get to the point, other scenes were beaten to death with over acting, and worst of all, it looked as though the actors were asleep at the wheel. You have to wonder sometimes if the editing process kills a movie, this is one I suspect is the case, with some more editing, like taking out the long silences, would give the movie a pulse. Some movies are over cut, this one could use more. Aside from Michael Shannon, every other actor was wasted in this movie, which considering the cast, is the most annoying, and unforgivable, aspect of this movie.

		<fullReview>I know "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a film, and quite likely the last film, by noted filmmaker Sidney Lumet, and may therefore cause folks to review it highly. I almost fell into that trap myself. I was going to give it 7 out of 10, but now that I sit down to write the actual review, I find a lower score is more appropriate.This is a film with an old plot told in other feature films. It's about two brothers -- a smart one and a dumb one -- who plan a "victimless" robbery on their own family business. This crime goes wrong, murder and darkness ensues as everything falls apart.Unfortunately, this film also tends to fall apart. There are some inherent weaknesses that signify lack of effort on the part of the cast and crew.Philip Seymour Hoffman doesn't seem to try to make the cookie-cutter character of the "evil smart brother" interesting. He's too polished, too obviously slimy, too uninteresting to be a good villain. Good villains require something to connect them to the audience, and Hoffman's character fails to do so. A good portion of the blame rests with the script: the character doesn't have any motivation for his ill deeds for half the movie, and even when we see the ill-contrived embezzlement, it seems like a total afterthought. True, his dealings with the heroin spa (run by a creepy Blaine Horton) add to the character, but in the end he comes across as just rotten, and not rotten WITH A PURPOSE. He's just a jerk, and no one likes a jerk. So the primary villain is not particularly interesting, one of the many flaws with the film.Ethan Hawke is a bit better as the "subjugated dumb brother". He's so good you actually forget you're watching Ethan Hawke. He's more pitiable: he has a miserable ex-wife, a failed connection to his own daughter, and plenty of financial troubles exacerbated by alcohol and bad friends. But some of his facets are thrown on without any real purpose. There is really no reason for his affair with his brother's wife, it's basically a throw-away, even at the end when it's revealed to the evil brother. Then, to add insult to injury, Hawke's character gets no closure at all in the film. He just runs off screen. He was 1/2 (or 1/3) of the film, and he gets no payoff at all. Terrible decision by the director.Albert Finney plays the dad of the two creeps. Unfortunately, he spends much of the film walking around in an addled daze, and Finney plays it like the character has a form of dementia instead of grief over his wife's murder. There's some goofy stuff where he badgers the cops (we've seen all of that before), and then he becomes detective, only to be sidelined during the exciting climax of the film. (His role during the big shootout? Parallel parking). He later gets some sort of payoff in a ponderous hospital scene, a scene that seems to be added simply because Lumet realized he missed the potentially bigger payoff during the climactic shoot-out.I guess that's the real summation of this review: Lumet simply adds on elements because there are elements to add on. There's a blackmail plot, some erectile dysfunction, bar scenes that may or may not be relevant, an "old friend" who pops in for a three-minute scene and solves everything, the stupidest car rental company known to man, and some "you always loved the dumb brother more" stuff we've seen thousands of times.And to make matters worse, Lumet tells the whole story in time-jump format. "Two days before the robbery" moves on to "three weeks after the robbery" and then back to "four days before the robbery". It's almost as if he threw the script into the Memento Blender to stir things up, and it doesn't work AT ALL. There are very few reasons NOT to tell this story linearly, or perhaps with just one break. Having the robbery-turned-bad open the film is a good choice, but there was no real need to skip back and forth over and over and over. It adds very little to the story.I guess I was originally going to give this film a high mark because it has a stellar cast and a noted director. But now that I've taken time to write this review, there's no way I can give it a good score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-told, engaging and effective tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andy and Hank Hanson are brothers who find themselves in need of a quick income for different reasons. The plan they come up with is simple ? their parents own a small jewellery store that both Andy and Hank are familiar with, from the amount of money on any given day to the various alarm triggers round the store; seems simple. However the robbery does not go that way and ends in tragedy. From here the viewer jumps back several days before the robbery to see the conception of the plan through to the aftermath, where the ramifications are felt throughout the whole family.The world is an evil place and it all starts with superficially simple evil deeds, or at least it does here as the time-honoured "botched robbery" (are there any other kinds) leads to secrets, death and increasingly desperate acts from all involved. The result is not a cheerful film but rather a depressingly grim story that is a tragedy much more than it is the crime thriller that IMDb places it as. As bleak as it is, the film is quite compelling as I was caught up in the characters actions, interested to see where they went and how they got out from under. Although it is not the most complex of pieces, it does benefit from well drawn characters who have a bit of story about them allowing the actors to expand what they are doing and have something that injects desperation into their actions before things start going wrong.The manner of delivery aids this as we jump into the job going wrong with very little introduction. So, as we discover the reasons for the crime, we are already aware of the things that have gone wrong. It doesn't feel like a gimmick at any point and only serves to make the telling of the story more engaging. As director Lumet does a great job of delivering some great shots and frames but does best to get his cast to all perform. Hoffman does misery like nobody else and is great here as the film goes on. Hawke has his moments but is not quite as good. Tomei doesn't have much time but is good when she has the chance although with this and The Wrestler I'm beginning to wonder if she isn't rubbing it in about how good her body is. Finney and Ryan both do well with smaller but important characters in terms of running time.Before the Devil is not a cheerful or "exciting" film but it is a gripping tragedy that unfolds in a way that makes it more engaging than it would have been played straight. The cast all deliver on their material and it does make for a professional and effective film that is worth seeing for the story it tells.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No that good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not that good.The time shifts are actually annoying and every time another begins I become more and more frustrated. Take an OK movie and try to make it better with a Tarantino rip-off. Scene/time shifts make a good movie when the timing is right and the movie is superb. Thats the trick. It has to be a great movie to keep doing it over and over. And you have to have great timing. This movie has none of those two things mentioned.I don't care about the main characters and I am sucked in to feeling horrible for the family which these two morons have greatly harmed. This is not reality. No one does this to their family for any reason whatsoever unless they are antisocial or psychopathic. And the two main characters are not these types of people which throws the premise out the door for me.It would have been a better movie without the shooting. Let them get the loot and then show them living with the pain of robbing their family and then having to tell them through guilt what they did and the consequences of those actions. The premise would still be messed-up but would make for a more interesting movie.The time shift takes away from character development and any closeness you feel for the characters which is needed to really show the pain brought onto these people.This is a movie to entertain the lowest common denominator of movie goers. Ones who will think the time shifts are kool so this must be a good movie. I mean comeon what old lady shoots a robber. Man! The more I think about this movie the worse it gets for me.Seems like the trend nowadays is to show horrible situations for people despite the unreality of the premise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thrilling, expertly-crafted melodrama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shaun Munro's Film Reviews (www.shaunmunro.co.uk): Sidney Lumet returns to top form in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead - a devilishly tense (pun intended), sprawling, melodramatic puzzle of a film. The film's title comes from a famous Irish blessing, which declares, "And may you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows you're dead", verbiage very much apt for protagonist brothers Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawke).In short, Andy and Hank, both short of money for various reasons, are looking to rob a "mom and pop" jewellery store, yet the sting in the tail lies in the fact that this store is owned by their parents. The focal point of the film is this robbery's result, which leaves various individuals dead or near death, and Andy and Hank must attempt a clean getaway as their father, Charles (Albert Finney), seeks to get revenge on the perpetrators. Embroiled in the turmoil is Andy's wife Gina (Marisa Tomei), who is torn between the two brothers in a very twisted love triangle.Lumet enjoys utilising non-linear narrative to great effect in this film ? we open on the day of the robbery, and subsequently dart around various days before and after it, which reveals to us a wealth of important and, at times, shocking information. The initial robbery is an intense, gripping scene of intrigue, ending in a violent eruption, yet soon enough, we are sent plunging backwards to three days prior to this. Such flashbacks are often disorientating and ancillary to the plot, yet in this instance, they are satisfying, and moreover, necessary ? they work quickly in familiarising us with the two brothers and their various motivations (monetary, sexual, and familial) to rob the store.The wildly slick robbery plan is orchestrated largely by Andy, who plays things extremely cool, whilst Hank initially balks at the idea, yet, with various large and looming debts, he ultimately decides to ride shotgun. In moments such as these, as Andy sits behind his desk, almost pontificating the need to pull this scam off, smoking a cigarette, he himself assumes a rather Faustian, devil's advocate-like persona, and it's wonderful to watch.These flashback interludes, even in their effectiveness, fortunately do not last for the rest of the picture, and soon enough, we are thrown back into the intense robbery scenario, yet this time, thanks to said flashbacks, we now have context established. Lumet does decide to dip the viewer in and out of Andy and Hank's lives from days before the robbery, yet rather than suffocate the film, the puzzle-esquire format exists to suture together the various plot strands, endowing the viewer with essential information and character development.Following the botched robbery, Hank states to Andy that "it's all come apart", and this is truer than the brothers know. The fallout of the robbery has greater ramifications than either could have ever expected. With the introduction of their father, the flashbacks begin to encapsulate his life also, introducing a more sinister, foreboding, and dangerous element into the narrative.Hank in particular seems to become more and more neck-deep in trouble (mostly monetary) as the film progresses, yet Andy is hardly keeping himself above water either. Their own tribulations, combined with the emergence of their disaffected, enraged father, causes the tension to ratchet up to highly unnerving levels, setting up for what is one of the most thrilling, and shocking finales of the year. If anything, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a film about downfall ? the death of a very twisted American dream, if you will. There certainly are cathartic moments before the fall, in that these are, to a degree, sympathetic characters, although aside from Finney's tragedy-imbued person, you have to wonder if they're worthy of such sentiment. Andy, in particular, is of dubious moral character, and Hank, driven by a need to stay afloat, is dragged down into the abyss with him.It is a massive credit to the picture to be endowed with such acting powerhouses as Hoffman and Finney, that one is able to find all of the film's familial issues to be convincing precursors to their present problems, without at all seeming forced. The finale is almost unbearably tense, serving up its fair share of surprises, and whilst one may declare that it "descends" into melodrama, I attest that it shamelessly (and rightly so) does so, with no descent or decline in the film's integrity or quality. The final twenty minutes is so chock full of unpredictability (yet still manages to be tangible), and so masterfully acted, that even if you find the melodrama to be several steps too far, there is nevertheless an assortment of reasons to both watch and revel in this electrifying, dramatic character study.Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is packed with Oscar-worthy material ? the tragic, spiralling plot is unflinching in its portrayal of man's desperation, thanks to Kelly Masterson's sharp and inventive script. However, what without question raises this film above similar pictures is its acting ? Albert Finney is perfectly smouldering as a vengeful man thrown into an impossible situation, Philip Seymour Hoffman is spot-on as the unquestionably slimy sibling, and Marisa Tomei does an appropriately ditzy job. One mustn't forget Ethan Hawke either, whose role is not as meaty as Hoffman's, yet he still brings a flare to the role of an unspeakably desperate individual. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a winning, daring concoction of skillful writing, deft performances, and schooled direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, I Just Don't Get It........... Possible Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the newspaper reviews, I was I must confess thoroughly disappointed. Philip Seymour Hoffman is really the only saving grace in this picture, aside from the very, shall we say, watchable Marisa Tomei. Ethan Hawke plays Hoffman's emotionally crippled younger brother.The story revolves around two brothers. They plot to rob their parent's jewelery store and the heist goes very wrong.We never really find out why Hoffman hates his father,played by Albert Finney, other than what we all know, that being sons and fathers have issues. Finney, looking every day his age, puts on yet another wide mouthed painful to watch performance. Time to call it a career.We learn nothing of the mother. Nor what drove the brothers to their expensive drug and alcohol habits. We don't even know what Hawke does for a living, although he works in the same office as his brother. He is painted as the clichéd terrible father, behind on alimony, yet dutifully attending sports &amp; school events and shelling out money.The film is depicted in a series of flashbacks. This is a technique far better used in other films, most notably in my opinion the 1983 film version of Harold Pinter's " Betrayal" with Ben Kingsley. And for that matter, the Seinfeld Indian wedding episode.There are sequences, such as when something is left in the getaway car, frantic efforts to recover it due to finger prints, it is eventually discovered &amp; thus ends that storyline. Predictable, yet in the end goes nowhere. Designed to throw us a curve? I think not.Throughout the movie in what I sensed were supposed to be quite serious scenes, there was laughter from the audience. Upon exiting and stating to my wife I felt it was an awful movie, I overhead another couple in the lobby. Their comments were to the effect "that this film would have been a good double feature with "No Country For Old Men" as they were both crap." I haven't seen the latter flick yet and may this coming week. I quite like Tommy Lee Jones. I hope he doesn't need the money that bad to knowingly make bad movies at this stage of his career.Maybe I have to watch it a 2nd time. Not everyone likes every movie and perhaps it may well be that I just missed something here. But I do not think say. I'd save your $12 and wait for the DVD release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the script caves in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to be more enthusiastic about this movie. For me, it doesn't add up to more than the sum of its parts. Although some of those parts are good, some are less so. The good parts come mostly before the third act throws credibility out the window, not least in the way that one of the characters finds it easy to keep his car kerbside in mid-town Manhattan without causing at least a discussion with a traffic cop.By that time the movie feels as though it wants to soar way above such trivia, but for me it stayed earthbound, in spite of the formidable talents involved. There are pluses: for example, a set of excellent two-hander scenes between Finney and Hoffmann, and also Tomei and Hoffmann. Veteran director Lumet shows a master's command of story-telling pace. It's just that the script caves in under a two-ton-weight of melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great performances in a great director's finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) plan to rob their parent (Albert Finney, Rosemary Harris)'s jewelry store. Hank owes alimony to his ex-wife Martha (Amy Ryan) to pay for his daughter's expensive school. Andy is facing an audit at work where he's been embezzling. Andy is the mastermind expecting to clear $120k. Hank is having an affair with Andy's wife Gina (Marisa Tomei).This is a reminder of the greatness of director Sidney Lumet. The movie is anchored by terrific performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke. I also remember being shocked at not only a naked Marisa Tomei but the great shape she's in. She's over 40. That woman has taken some kind of magic potion. The disjointed story telling method is a bit confusing in the first viewing. It wraps up in a terrific ending. PSH is disturbing and a real eye-opener.</fullReview>

The writing, direction, and the acting by all make this an amazing movie to watch. Ethan Hawke reveals himself as a great actor -- I could identify most with him and what he was going through. Albert Finney is also great as usual. It goes without saying that the late Philip Seymour Hoffman is great in this too. This is an amazing final feat of Sydney Lumet, who will be sorely missed -- as Sean Connery said, he had that "vision thing". I find it very sad when movies this good go unrecognized and unwatched -- please watch this and give your opinion!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hoffman and Lumet's Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great cast. Sidney Lumet truly did an astounding job with this film. Lumet shared with us one of his best films and it is a shame he and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died just last year, are no longer here to share anymore profound masterpieces.I saw this a few years back and what I can say is it was an amazing film. The acting was well constructed as it would be expected of Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman. But not one in the film captivated the debilitating affects of tension and concern as well as Hoffman himself. The film had its share of humor and the supporting roles were brilliant and authentic. It seemed as though as the film had progressed, the intense suspense in the film as well as the sharp acting seemed to just envelop you even more. The entire atmosphere just impacts the audience deeply and leaves a thrill of excitement that is still felt after the film. A film close to perfection and one I will see again any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maudlin film, I won't bother spoiling it for you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was reading a review of another film recently that referred to this film and decided to give the IMDb page a look. I was surprised to see it got such high reviews. I'm no sloucher when it comes to appreciating obtuse, crafted films so I don't think I'm being hard on it here.This is a film about a robbery gone wrong, the messed up lives of the people involved, and the miserable aftermath. We've seen this type of film a hundred times before and I didn't see anything new. OK, I saw Marisa Tomei in a nude cameo but that was it (and she's getting old so that kind of ruined it for me after seeing her at her best in My Cousin Vinny). Of COURSE criminals are sad mess ups. I can tune to COPS to see losers get busted without their shirt on. I may have missed something, but the characters were one dimensional: The weak brother, the successful psycho brother, the uncaring working class father, and the pretty, aging girlfriend. Great. Held my interest for about 10 seconds.This film reminds me of Sideways which was far better at developing depth for their stereotypical characters: The pretty boy on a fling, the likable loser, the aspiring divorcée, the struggling single mother. Those characters had depth and you remembered them long after the film ended and they were mostly character actors. This film had big names and I knew what would happen about 5 minutes in. In case you don't, don't worry, they'll throw you the same obvious hints about 3 times in flashbacks.Doing a gangster film takes skill, creativity, and daring because the genre has been so well covered. Tarantino did this masterfully by portraying criminals as something they rarely are: thoughtful, tasteful, and articulate (most are losers which is why they are criminals.) This gangster film failed (for me) perhaps because it featured seemingly actual criminals who, apart from a few seconds getting shoved into a police car without a shirt on, are not that interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney, Marisa Tomei, and Rosemary Harris star in "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," directed in 2007 by 82-year-old Sidney Luumet.Hoffman and Hawke play two completely messed-up brothers - Hoffman is Andy, the older one, who is a drug addict and apparently has been embezzling for the real estate company where he works. Hawke plays Hank, a complete screw-up and deadbeat who owes his wife money for child support, tuition, and everything else. On top of that, he's sleeping with Andy's wife (Marisa Tomei), and Andy has no idea.Since Andy is in need of cash, and quick, due to an audit about to take place at his firm, he coerces the easily-manipulated Hank into agreeing to a robbery -- of their parents' jewelry store in the suburbs. Hank is to go early, put the old lady who watches the shop on Saturdays in the back room, empty the trays, and get out. Hank doesn't think he can do it, so he hires his friend Bobby (Brian F. O'Byrne) to do it for him, and he'll drive the getaway rental car. The robbery does not go as planned, and the brothers soon find themselves up to their gatkas in trouble of all sorts.What happened in this family can only be guessed at. The father (Albert Finney) is distant from Andy, and Andy hates him, having always felt left out; Hank was evidently spoiled. They're both losers.This is a devastating film, made all the more devastating by acting of the highest caliber by Hoffman, Hawke, and Finney. Lumet creates a suspenseful, at some points edge-of-your-seat drama, but leaves the ending ambiguous in one respect. Hoffman is a powerhouse as a man who, despite looking like he's leading an upper middle class life, is actually one foot from the gutter with visits to his drug dealer, awful sex with his wife, and money problems. His troubles only exacerbate thanks to his own stupidity.Hawke is brilliant as a man with the mind of a teenager who lives in frustration and terror, always trying to borrow money, always screwing things up, suffering at the hands of an angry ex-wife and disappointed daughter, and finally, after his last screw-up, having Andy berate him as well.Finney, who has enjoyed a 56-year career, has come a long way from being a British James Dean type. As the father of these two, he gives another great performance, half-crazed from grief, finally going over the line. One can only guess at his motives in the final scene - was he being loving, or was he acting out of hate? Lumet leaves that ambiguous too.A fantastic film, though one you'll probably only want to view one time.If you want to see acting in its absolute highest form, and a master director at work, see this film immediately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there has to be a darkest movie which i have ever seen in my life, it has to be this. Hard to believe, that someone could come up with such an amazingly dark story and such a great direction. A great performance by the lead actors too.The story begins with two brothers in need of money to shore up their respective lives. The elder brother, Andy hatches a devious but yet a simple burglarry. He convinces his brother Hank to come on-board to pull of this who in-turn takes the help of a side-kick. Now, the side-kick messes up the whole affair and what they have in hand, is a shattering truth which they can't live with. You better watch it from here, to realize it yourself. It will never get worse than this in anyone's life like it does in the movie.In the past, i never knew about this great director Sidney Lumet. He is certainly a classic director and this movie was another classic from his stable. We miss you and your great movies, SIDNEY LUMET. RIP.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Queintin Tarantino once said he would not make a film past 60 because no director does their best work that late in life. Well Sidney Lumet who directed this near perfect film was 83 when he directed it. I am not going to say squat about this film, if any one does read this someday, and decides to watch this movie I want everything to unfold for you. It is one of those movies that is like a roller coaster ride, and is best when you don't know what is coming around the bend. This is the second movie I have reviewed this week that has Philip Seymour Hoffman, and he is at his best. The casting in general which includes, Marisa Tomei, Ethan Hawke, and Albert Finney are all played wonderfully. The way the story unfolds is remarkable, the plot exceptional. There is not a single thing I did not love about this movie. If I do find any followers, and they watch please comment on what you thought, I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The world is an evil place?some of us make money off of that, and others get destroyed"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet, I certainly know pretty well the name and the name of those of his important films. I own some of his films, 4 to be exact, 4 before Before the Devil Knows You're Dead that was just my third experience with a Lumet film. Many claim that this 2007 film is one of the very best Lumet films, I only can say it is a really terrific picture. So this film has a conventional premise, two men who are not criminals will steal a jewelry store and everything will went wrong. So it begins, we see the robbery and we will see what happened to the involved persons before, during and after the day of the robbery. We have those two men as our main characters certainly, these men need money, I think Lumet made a great move when he decided that these two men, Andy and Hank, would be not friends but brothers (the original screenplay was written by Kelly Masterson). The film is extremely engaging, the structure is perfect to make this even more interesting and engaging, it is actually a quite complex film. All will be in family, Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the older brother Andy and Ethan Hawke plays Hank. For Hank is quite a surprise that Andy is planning a robbery to the jewelry store of their parents for obvious reasons but also because Andy is the brother with a good job, good pay and who apparently is okay. Andy comes with the plan and he needs someone, actually he will not go to the store, and he knows that basically his brother is easy to convince, Hank is the one divorced, with a daughter, child support, the school, the rent, a lover. Sexy Marisa Tomei is Gina, the wife of Andy, apparently just a minor character, well she is since not in most of the film we see her yet she is an important character who will lead us to a tense scene between the brothers but also who is there all the time when you think in the stuff that could happened. Hank wants that Gina become his wife, he loves her. Marisa Tomei gives an extraordinary performance (Lumet reveals in the 20+ minutes documentary from the DVD that he considers the acting of the scene in which both Andy and Gina are inside their parked car, after Andy talked with his father, as one of the very best he has been ever involved and certainly he remarks that he has been involved in some pretty good ones) and very sexy. So as I said this is all in family, I think was better that Nanette (Rosemary Harris), mother of Andy and Hank, passed away without knowing the fact that her two kids were the ones behind the robbery in which she was shoot. Certainly both Andy and Hank were thinking that the robbery was going to be a victimless one, the secure help their parents, no one of their parents was going to be working at the time of the robbery, everything is just fine and they end with some dollars in their pockets. At one point we will follow Andy and Hank's father, Charles (played by Albert Finney ? since Big Fish I never saw him again until here and he simply gives another very remarkable work). We certainly could imagine how the relation between both Andy and Hank and Charles may be and certainly we would not be far from the truth, after all Chico and Groucho (Oscar-nominated, for the film Revolutionary Road, Michael Shannon is Dex who will call Hank Chico and Andy Groucho and who confirms that in this film everything is in family. I saw Shannon twice in a couple of days) did what they did. I will stop here, just add this: watch this film, see how great Hoffman and Hawke can be (masterful performances), enjoy yourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film in a very strange way -- I had put it on my Netflix list and couldn't remember why (other than that I knew Philip Seymour Hoffman was in it). Since the film has no opening credits, I couldn't even remember who had directed it.As my wife and I watched it, I turned to her about 45 minutes in and said, "You know, I keep wanting to decide that I hate this film, but something about it just won't let me stop watching it." Then there's a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that are truly electrifying in the actors' performances.It was only as the end credits rolled that I realized it was a Sidney Lumet film. And I thought -- wow. I'm surprised that Lumet took on what was really a dirty, petty little story about really mean, broken people. But it's a testament to his talent that I was so taken in when I didn't even realize it was him.Philip Seymour Hoffman is really, really good in this movie. Like scary good. Put this up against Capote and I would argue the Oscar should have been for this film instead.I also highly recommend the narrative special feature with Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman talking about making the movie -- it's entertaining and educational, with Hawke playing the student eager to learn at the master's feet. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule of working with actors -- kiss their asses constantly!!There are a lot of violent, melodramatic movies out there that are empty ciphers when all is said and done. And there is an element of that in this film -- that the actors fill the air with sulphurous blasts of emotion, and when the smoke clears there's nothing left. Nothing resonates on a deeper level.But Lumet has given us Network and Twelve Angry Men -- films that, each in their own ways, have been elevated into the highest echelons of cinema.This movie isn't at that level. But there's something about it that lingers. And maybe that's enough.My final comment is about the comments -- if you look at the number of comments about this little movie here on IMDb -- and the depth and intelligence of the comments, pro and con -- it's a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indulgent acting mars what might have been a hard-edged story. At least we can see Rosemary Harris show us the real goods</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The contradictions, and especially the indulgences, in Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows Your Dead are queasily evident in the first and last scenes. In the first, which pops up as soon as the lights dim, we have a nude, pale, flabbily fat actor doing Pin the Tail on the Donkey with a nude actress on her knees, hips high, in front of him. The only image that came to mind was of a quivering Moby Dick throwing the harpoon at Mrs. Ahab. The last scene -- spoilers alert! -- gives us an old man who had to study like a son of a gun just to pass his written driver's test suddenly smart and clever enough to know how to fake out a heart monitor machine in a busy hospital so he could smother to death a gunshot victim and not be caught. In between these two points are the bones of a hard-edged story of unlikable people that could have been a classic. Instead, we admire the potential but are bored by a lot of the show-off flash. Lumet has always had the reputation of an actors' director, a man who can pull great performances from a cast. Actors, in turn, have always been eager to work with Lumet. At least in part, now we know why. Frequently with this movie, the story, the tension and our interest come to a screeching halt when Lumet permits Philip Seymore Hoffman as Andy to plunge headfirst into "acting"...or to permit Ethan Hawke as Hank to plunge headfirst into "acting"...or to permit the two of them to share intense scenes of "acting," all the while with the camera respectfully observing the performances. Only a disciplined director able to impose his will on actors will be able to convince most actors that less is more. It seldom happens here, and the movie -- despite the potential for classic unhappiness and despite scenes of real tension -- winds up as self-conscious melodrama. This is a frustrating situation because Hoffman is riveting at times as a slick, sick manipulator whose life for quite a while has been on the down escalator. Hawke as Andy's shlumpf of a younger brother is stuck in a losing role as an unsympathetic weakling. Albert Finney as their father, who, with his adored wife, owns a small jewelry store, does Albert Finney again. To give him credit, he picks up steam when his character decides to be the avenging angel. It's Andy's plan to rob his parents' store that goes bad, but it's Hoffman's indulged acting, approved by Lumet, that's the real crime. Even some of the secondary actors, particularly Michael Shannon as Dex, over emote...and actors playing secondary characters wouldn't do that without the specific encouragement of the director. Rosemary Harris, as the two brothers' mother and Finney's wife, does the real acting. Harris is one of the great actresses of the American and British stage (and the mother of Jennifer Ehle). Her role is brief, just two real scenes. One shows her affection for her aging husband and the other as the frightened victim of the robbery who decides to resist. Harris knows the value of less is more. She gives to a small part real strength and motivation, and makes Finney's motivation for revenge believable. The irony is that while many movie fans will be thrilled by Hoffman's performance, most probably won't even notice how good Harris is or even recognize her name. Lumet must have been aiming for tragic drama but he wound up with the Hollywood version. This was a real disappoint for me because I have a lot of respect for Lumet and for a number of his actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done--but two protagonist's that are hard root for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" - the title is based on an old Irish toast - does not reside in the far reaches of high art. It's just a caper melodrama. Still, it's an invigorating, refreshing, and unusual thing to see one done so expertly. Both siblings have money problems and their neat solution is to plan a heist on a 'mom and pop' jewelry store. The sting is that the mom and pop in question are their own. In the grand tradition of heist movies, their plan unravels quickly because clearly no one knows what their really doing. Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) subcontracts the job of the heist itself to Hank (Ethan Hawke) who, unable to face it, subcontracts it to an even more inept work colleague. The results are predictably violent and chaotic. With the burden waving on their consciences, the two embark on an ever more desperate endeavor. A well-made suspense thriller, a devastating story with exceptional direction and first-rate acting. No question about it. But at the end of the day, the severity of the impact of this tragic conclusion is not nearly as poignant due to an inadequate attachment to the brothers. Two protagonists who are self-centered individuals who are going to get theirs no matter the cost or consequence. Ethan Hawke deftly sketches Hank, the nearest thing to a likable character, as a terrified idiot who might be lovable, if it wasn't for his willingness to be talked into armed robbery. Screenwriter Kelly Masterson structures the story with a series of flashbacks, which follow individual characters in the days leading up to the robbery. Each segment advances the action a little past the crime, and then, once the audience has caught up with the colorful back story, he discards the flashbacks and pushes the narrative forward. This is not classic Sidney Lumet, but it's ample evidence that after more than 40 years working in this business, the director is still capable of crafting an entertaining and thought provoking motion picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a masterful film that should be in any ones library if you consider yourself a collector of best films. It's incredible that the script was this well written by a, basically, beginner. The directing was just about perfect and easily concludes Lumet as one of the top 10 directors of all time, if you also consider his other work. The acting was really good and the only weakness may have been Finney, who walked around with his mouth open a little too much. I assume he must do that in real life also. It wasn't his best roll, but not bad. I'm trying to think of other negative things to say about the film but honestly can't think of any. I think this should have at least been nominated for a Best Director Oscar or Golden Globe. Another positive to some of us men was the well shown nudity of Tomei. There is no doubt something about her that goes beyond words. Her acting was dead on as usual too. I don't recall ever seeing her do a bad acting job. In all, you should see this film if you want to see one of the best films around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deal With The Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's 'Before The Devil Knows You're Dead' is an intricate and intriguing psychological drama that looks at the fragile relationship between two brothers, between a husband and wife and between a father and his son. It starts off as a heist movie but gradually leads to much more. The relationships are severely dysfunctional yet the characters are recognizable. It is the fragility of the relationships that has lead to the broken lives lived by Hank, Andy, his wife and eventually their father. The story really appealed to me because of its depth, layers, innovation in style and idea and consistency. Told in a uniquely tricky non-chronological order, 'Before The Devil Knows You're Dead' is a character-driven piece as the characters 'determine' the story and we see everything from their point of view.The movie is full of surprises and the twists are cleverly written. The dialogues are both amusing and inventive. Lumet and his actors do an excellent job in creating tension and there is an air of unpredictability as the viewer is in constant suspense about the characters' next move. He also gives great attention to detail right from the subtle dialogues to the performance of the extras. In addition, the first rate cinematography effectively alters between long shots and short cuts, at times static and at times in motion. Lumet assembles a stellar cast that includes a wonderfully greedy Philip Seymour Hoffman, a superbly vulnerable and emotionally crippled Ethan Hawke, a stunning and conflicted Marisa Tomei and a terrific Albert Finney. I also loved Rosemary Harris in the tiny but significant role. The rest of the cast do a notable job too. Lumet clearly knows how to interact with his actors because he has extracted superb performances from each and every one of them. 'Before The Devil Knows You're Dead' is among the most impressive psychological thrillers of recent times. There are plenty of noteworthy scenes that stay in mind long after the film has ended. After the final credits have rolled, the viewer is left to wonder and what a great movie it is to discuss with friends. Lumet definitely has another winner at hand. As a final note, the commentary on the DVD is worth listening to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good psychological crime thriller that is well crafted and well scripted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a psychological crime thriller about a crime that goes wrong. 2 brothers Andy Hanson(Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Ethan Hawke(Hank Hanson) are in some economic situations, Andy is a drug addict who steals from his job to keep up with his addiction while Hank is a very big loser who is sleeping with his own brother's girlfriend Gina(Marisa Tomei). And as big of a loser Hank is, he is irritatingly stupid to the point even the audience will feel like punching him in the face and can tell why Andy gets so upset with him when he screws up a robbery where they tried to rob there own parent's jewelry store that Hank has carefully planned. Philip Seymour Hoffman was top notch with his performance and doesn't seem over the top with the situation he is in and Ethan Hawke did a good job playing the role of a idiotic loser that you actually get irritated by him, cause of his stupidity. This film is like a puzzle where it switches between different times from before, after and during the robbery to get all the pieces together and when it ends it's haunting and shocking although before the movie ends it's clear the Hank family has the loser gene running through them, even the brother's mother which you will find out as the story progresses. The music was good at building tension even if it can get a bit repetitive, it most definitely isn't a feel good movie or pleasant. I also thought after a while the film started to get a bit tiresome and tedious, but despite that this is a well crafted and well scripted psychological crime thriller.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet was a master director of mainstream films. "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" was his last. There is enough destruction here for a Jacobean revenge drama, but the film also works as a family psychodrama, like Jane Austen on steroids transposed to New York City. The City is gritty and gorgeous. Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a mesmerizing performance, supported well by Albert Finney, Marisa Tomei, and Ethan Hawke. The critics may call this a "melodrama," but little that Hoffman's character says or does in it fails to spring naturally from the circumstances he sets in motion. The cinematography and music are understated and first-rate. This one will hold your attention for the full 1:56.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Knockout - One of Sidney Lumet's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching it three times in a row, I honestly recommend this movie as one of Sidney Lumet's best work. Some people may not like its bleak theme or dismiss it as a overdone crime thriller. But I feel it's better summarized as a first-rate character study and mesmerizing melodrama.Directing-wise, it's tight, smooth and well-paced. I couldn't find one awkwardly placed or acted scene in the entire film. The rhythm and energy just felt so right that you miss this feeling immediately after you finish it.Acting-wise, it's honest, intense and impeccable. From the entire cast and especially from the two leading actors - Philip Hoffman and Ethan Hawke. I've considered Hoffman one of the best actors of all time ever since I saw Capote. Then he appeared in Doubt, The Savages and this film around the same time, and I gotta say I admire his performance as Andy here the most. Oftentimes when you watch an explosive performance on screen, you get the feeling that the actor is either faking it or over the top. But not from Hoffman and not on this one. He truly is the finest actor of his generation. As for Ethan Hawke, I was simply amazed. I've never seen such a strong performance for such a weak character before. No wonder Mr. Lumet called him a "GIANT talent" on the Charlie Rose show. I haven't seen his work since the admirable Before Sunset, and now with a performance like this, I can't wait to see what the actor has to offer next.BTW, a gem like this didn't get any Oscar nomination is another reminder that we're living in a commercial age indeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brothers Andy (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawke) are in desperate need of money and come up with a fool-proof way to get it: They'll rob a small jewelry store. The catch: It's their parents' store.Wow. I'll say it again: Wow. This movie is the most powerful and exciting film I've seen in a long time. The acting is outstanding, the script is clever and full of surprises, and the direction by Sidney Lumet is superb. Supporting the two stars are Albert Finney as their father and Marissa Tomei as Andy's wife. They are both excellent. The story reminded me a lot of "A Simple Plan" which also had two greedy brothers with a can't-miss scheme that quickly and tragically becomes a nightmare. This movie is so intense, I was often saying, "Yikes!" to myself and holding my breath a lot. It's that good.The only thing I didn't like is the way the story constantly goes back and forth in flashbacks; I don't think that added anything and was a bit frustrating for me. But still, if you like emotional crime dramas, you'll love this movie. Explicit sexuality and non-stop profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"May you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows you're dead."That old Irish saying warns that you can fool yourself into believing you're in gravy, until Reality mops the floor with you.Walking a fine line between pulp noir and terrifying reality, BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD succeeds on its tortured performances, each character in this quirky crime drama harboring a soul-crushing burden, each actor sweating that burden into the fabric of their performance.Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a mediocre businessman, tiring of wife Gina (Marisa Tomei, who spends more time smokin'-naked than my pudding hand would dare to admit), looking for a way out of financial mess. Hank (Ethan Hawke) is Hoffman's shiftless brother, also in dire need of money. Andy cooks up a plan to knock off a mom-and-pop jewelry store, selling the scheme to his brother as a victimless crime: the store owners reap the insurance and the brothers walk away in gravy. Trouble is: the mom-and-pop store is owned by - their actual Mom and Pop! (Rosemary Harris and Albert Finney.) It would be cloyingly cliché if it weren't for Hoffman and Hawke acting the snot out of this beargarden.I'm not giving away any twists that the DVD box doesn't. The body of the movie concerns itself with how everything gets pear-shaped once the robbery is botched by Hank.To make matters steamier, Gina is nutcracking Hank with her whip-tight bod, behind Andy's back. In a movie about betrayal, this comes as no surprise - except to Andy when she confesses.Legendary director, Sidney Lumet, and first-time writer, Kelly Masterson, weave this desperate tale out of chronological order, but in a creative way: two characters would play out a scene in a kitchen, while we see glances of two other characters outside the window. Later in the film, we would be privy to the scene outside the window, while glances of the two characters in the kitchen tells us we are back at the same moment from another point of view.Lumet is a legend for classics like 12 ANGRY MEN (1957) and SERPICO (1973), but his post-90s output is shaky (A STRANGER AMONG US, 1992, and GLORIA, 1999 - yeccch!). This is one of his good ones. At 83 - he's back! Hawke eventually slides into that space he finds so comfortable - the flustered sidekick - while Hoffman's acting skyrockets into nuanced madness. Albert Finney effectively simulates a man whose brain explodes when he discovers what his two sons have done to the family; while Marisa Tomei walks around naked for the benefit of pudding hands everywhere.When the world crumbles for all these characters, it proves the veracity of another old Irish saying, "Never sh*t in your own backyard."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet: Still A Master Filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard aging director Sidney Lumet was attached to BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD, I was dubious about its success. Not because Lumet has any stains on his record! Quite the contrary. With films like 12 ANGRY MEN, SERPICO, and FAILSAFE to his astounding credit, he is well-known as a vintage director of classic melodramas. But his age (83 at the time this film was made) could've been a factor; old-style filmmaker does old-style job again. But any fears were quickly whisked away once I started watching his latest film.Not surprisingly, when Hollywood heard the name "Lumet" and that it was involved with a new movie, several bigshots jumped at the chance to be in it. And this was a very good thing. Philip Seymour Hoffman (CAPOTE) heads this all-star melodrama (yes, it's still a melodrama and that's a VERY good thing) alongside Ethan Hawke (LORD OF WAR) and the incredibly sexy Marisa Tomei (WILD HOGS). Forming a kind of triumvirate of misfits, Lumet takes the audience on a wild ride both in terms of how the timing of the film is laid out (jumping from date to date and perspective to perspective) and what each of them is up to. Hoffman turns in another excellent performance as Andy, a man with financial and drug issues and married to the beautiful Gina (Tomei). Gina is lost amidst her husband's distant actions and shut-in existence and finds solace with his brother Hank (Hawke).Hank is also having financial woes and isn't the brightest bulb in the package. And when his brother Andy (Hoffman) comes to him with a plan to hold up a jewelry store in order to solve their problems, Andy is hesitantly for it ...until he learns Andy's plan is to rob their own parents' store. Store owner and parents Charles (Albert Finney, CORPSE BRIDE) and Nanette (Rosemary Harris, SPIDERMAN 3) are completely oblivious to their son's plan and when Hank hires a man to help him rob the store, things go horribly wrong.It is to Lumet's credit that he spearheads the issues each character deals with and does so without extending it/them into boredom; an area that has plagued many past melodramas. Sexy, dangerous, and frighteningly realistic, Lumet delivers a film that picks up tension as the characters spiral out of control. Even Charles (Finney) isn't immune to the pressures of these horrific events, finding himself making a decision no father should ever be in the position of making.Again, it is to Lumet's credit that he's not afraid to move with the times and show us he knows what works for audiences. The opening sex sequence will certainly grab many viewers. Lumet also isn't afraid to use new technology in his filming; he's all digital. This speaks to his understanding of how well he sees film-making as an art, which includes how light falls onto film versus into the digital 1s and 0s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>of endomorph Phillip Seymour "Boogie Nights" Hoffman taking Marisa "My Cousin Vinny" Tomei from the rear, but despite this in-your-face declaration of adult theme and content, Sidney "12 Angry Men" Lumet's latest film remains a mostly satisfying psychodrama in the finest Grecian tradition. With a screenplay from tyro Kelly Masterson that deftly skirts Coen Brothers/Tarantino territory, and the consummate directorial skills of Lumet, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" traces the genesis and ultimate ramifications of a bungled internecine robbery attempt. Yuppie junkie businessman Andy Hanson (Hoffman) inveigles his equally financially desperate brother Hank (Ethan "Dead Poets Society" Hawke in a solid performance) into ripping off their parents' jewelry store. Hank foolishly brings in an accomplice and ironic tragedy ensues. Told in a multi-perspective fractured timeline, the story limns the old truth about "the best laid plans of mice and men." Accidental matricide, deliberate filicide, and plain ol' spur of the moment homicide all make an appearance, along with a generous dollop of Tomei nudity.Superb ensemble support by the likes of Tomei as Andy's trophy wife, Albert "Tom Jones" Finney as the vengeful father, Brian F. "Bug" O'Byrne as the overzealous accomplice and Aleksa "Find Me Guilty" Palladino as his aggrieved wife, Michael "Bug" Shannon as an opportunistic bystander, Amy "Gone Baby Gone" Ryan as Hank's vituperative ex, Rosemary "Spider-Man" Harris as the unfortunate mother, and newcomer Tilda Swinton look-alike Blaine Horton as Andy's fey dealer; all play their role in the operatic plot. The score by Carter "No Country For Old Men" Burwell is perfect, Ron "Basquiat" Fortunato's DP work is as precise and revealing as Tom "Find Me Guilty" Swartwout's edits. Excellent costume and set design, art direction, and all the other tangibles of top-notch film production are evident throughout, but the thread that really ties everything together is Hoffman's outstanding performance as Andy, another gem in a growing résumé of repulsively fascinating characters. Make no mistake, Hawke is quite good, but Hoffman has the juicier role, and goes the distance enjoying it. Finney seems to rely somewhat on shtick as the third leg of the tragic pyramid, mouth perpetually agape, but still acquits himself with authority as the agent of final justice. Everyone pretty much gets what they deserve, including the audience--a well-told tale of human fallibility. Crime does not pay, only the guilty, or so they say.Recommended to all Hoffman and/or Hawke fans, and appreciators of Lumet, it goes without saying. "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is prime film-making, well-crafted storytelling, and well worth a few hours of your entertainment time. If he kicks tomorrow, Lumet will know he's gone out on a high note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense, and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children. With an A-list cast headed by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has captured not just elements of botched crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Ordinary People.Many viewers might be confused and feel underwhelmed at the construction of the plot Lumet has gone with here. Instead of showing it in a linear manner, he has gone the Tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order. I personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next. The script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally engaging to watch and Lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in. Plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time, this is a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for one moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the very first scene of Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, you know this won't be a typical caper thriller: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, playing older brother Andy, is in bed with his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei). And when I say they're in bed together, I mean they are engaging in coitus together. And graphically so. This might throw you if you were expecting a musky, dark-hued film noir about a heist gone wrong, especially when you see the position the lovely Tomei and the obese Hoffman are in.But don't get your hopes up, nerdy horny males, because that's about all the titillation you'll get from this movie. Not that the rest of it is all unicorns and EZ Bake Ovens; there's drug use, there's profanity, there's blood, there's murder. Fun stuff for the entire family, really. People talk and act in disgusting, depraved manners; there are no heroes, no good guys in this movie.You see, Andy, despite having a high-paying job, is in some financial straits (something he'd rather Gina not know), so he cooks up a scheme: He and ne'er-do-well brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) will rob their parents' small jewelry store and fence the stones for the needed cash. The store's insured, Andy reasons, so mom and dad will be fine, and the only person in the store in the mornings is an older woman. In an homage to Rashomon, we get to see the attempted heist as it plays out, and then we see the circumstances leading up to the failure.Things don't so much spiral out of control for Hank and Andy as simply collapse around them. No matter what machinations Andy employs to alleviate the consequences of their misdeeds, the brothers - and the rest of the family - are inextricably intertwined, both with themselves and with each other. Their dilemmas are a veritable Chinese Finger Trap, or maybe a roach motel. There's nothing they can do but bind themselves tighter than ever.The movie is brilliantly told, which isn't easy when you're dealing with a lot of plot. There are threads begetting threads and so forth, and everything comes back to everything else, which is sweet and sour at the same time. The trouble with plot is simply that the onus is on the script to make things work - you can't have holes, because everyone will notice them. You can have holes in a Die Hard plot, because no one cares about them. See how it works? So it's crucial that the plot is sensible, exciting, and unpredictable, and writer Kelly Masterson succeeds on all three plots. (Can you believe this was a debut screenplay?) Adding to the intrigue was the pitch-perfect score, by Carter Burwell (No Country for Old Men).This is one of those movies where you already know the bad guys from the get go. What you don't know is why they're bad guys. What drove them to do this? How did their plan fail? And what will happen to them in the end? In the old days, the bad guys never even got away - sometimes they gave the money back, or went to jail, anything upbeat. Then came Bonnie and Clyde, which ended in blood. But will the bad guys here simply escape on a plane to Brazil? Will they be mowed down in a majestic blaze of glory? Will they turn themselves in? Now, the possibilities seem infinite.The cast is superlative, and I can't think of good reasons why the movie wasn't Oscar nominated. Hoffman is treacherous and vulnerable as the wily Andy; Hawke is a whiny, mewling nebbish by contrast. So both actors played against type, really. Albert Finney plays the boys' father Charles, and he's as good as Albert Finney usually is. (Although would someone please tell Mr. Finney to close his mouth on occasion? He's gonna catch flies that way.) But to me, the best performance was in one of the lesser roles: Tomei. Say what you will about Tomei's Oscar for My Cousin Vinny, the lady is extremely talented. She's as beautiful and alluring as she was in 1992 (Vinny) and 2001 (In the Bedroom, another nomination), and her Gina is terrified and strong to a fault, cowed by the riches her husband's job has afforded them and pining for happier times, trapped in a moribund marriage.And do you know who directed this masterpiece? Sidney Lumet. Sidney Lumet's so old, he directed 12 Angry Men fifty years ago. And now look at him! This movie feels like it was directed by a young, hungry director with a lot to prove. It's snappy, it's growly, it wants you to look at the protagonists and see not how wretched they become as a result of this robbery but how wretched they were all along. These are the people in your neighborhood, says Lumet's masterful work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was quite excited to watch this movie, especially after reading some reviews on IMDb. However, I was utterly disappointed and I found the whole movie a weak attempt at using the Reservoir Dogs technique to piece the puzzles together.The main plot was rather interesting but after hitting the 45 minute mark or so, the whole film crumbled and just felt like it was a big mismatched puzzle.The two leading actors both played out their roles pretty well but not well enough to save the film. I felt that a film like this should be thoroughly engaging as the audience gets to see all sides of the story, but this just didn't happen.A film which had so much promise, but could not deliver.</fullReview>

Two great actors Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke combined with the nice body of Marisa Tomei should make up a very well balanced after dinner cocktail. But there's too much of a twist in it. For my part the movie makes use of the first-persons perspective which is alright in the first 30 minutes or so. But then you simply get feed up with being dragged back in time to see the same scene with different eyes. We've seen this many times before with far better success.

		<fullReview>Tense and at times a little slow, but subplots bust in. Two very different brothers have a similar problem...their finances. Andy(Philip Seymour Hoffman)and Hank(Ethan Hawk)find themselves struggling and life bearing down on them. Andy is an overextended payroll executive juggling books and cashing the paychecks of two dead employees...just to try and keep his trophy wife(Marisa Torme)happy. Hank is more or less a deadbeat dad and screw-up. He's behind on support payments with a demanding ex-wife(Amy Ryan)and a daughter who expects her heart desires met. Andy hatches up a plan to rob their parents jewelry store. Hank is nervous and unsure when Andy fears himself being recognized. Needless to say the robbery that was not planned to hurt anyone goes very bad. Getting out of trouble only leads to more trouble. The climax is abrupt and unpredictable leaving questions to ponder. Also in the cast: Albert Finney, Aleska Palladino, Arija Barekis and Brian F. O'Bryne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One more of 1007's bleak but near-great films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has been a year of very bleak and tragic morality tales. I do find it hard to believe that this film was so completely snubbed by Oscar, although it did have very high powered competition.Actually, I could call this film "nasty", but in a nice way if that makes sense. The highly erotic opening scene certainly works to catch a person's attention. Then comes the robbery scene which is wrenching even before you realize just who is involved.The time and perspective switching is expertly crafted by the writer and by Sidney Lumet. I at first groaned at the idea of the third sequence starting earlier than the second, but soon got involved as more details are brought out. I groaned later at the blackmail addition, but quickly again accepted it as a logical plot complication.Add to this superlative acting for all involved. I thought Hoffman quite deserving of his Oscar for CAPOTE, but this role topped that one. And no longer will Ethan Hawke be just another "pretty boy". Albert Finney also gave the performance of his life. And Marisa Tomei was far more than just eye candy (although eye candy, she certainly was).If you haven't seen this, do so. And if you are one of the bashers, see it again and you might be surprised at how good it actually is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title of the movie is engaging, and that was the first and only reason that attracted me to go and see this movie.Two rogue brothers, Andrew Hanson (Philip Hoffman) and Henry Hanson (Ethan Hawke) plan to rob their own parent's jewelry shop. Andrew plans the robbery and Henry hires an unknown waiter to carry out the robbery for him. Things go wrong, and the mother is shot dead. Because the police are ineffective, the father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney) tries to investigate the crime himself. Henry is blackmailed by the waiter's wife Chris (Aleksa Palladino) and her brother Dex (Michael Shannon) to give a bounty of US $ 10,000 in return of keeping his name away from police. Andrew draws a plan to rob a drug trafficker and ends up killing him, and then also kills Dex, but gets shot himself. The father Charles realizes the motives of his sons, and ends up murdering hospitalized Andrew by suffocating-throat-hold.What could one say of a director with more than 65 years of movie making experience? Sidney Lumet gives another movie ? the number count ? 70 production as director! Amazing! I found his direction something between Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese and Coen brothers, leaving out the awe feeling we get after seeing the movies of the former list. The silences Sidney poses in between scenes to juxtapose events is a style in itself, I think much of Sidney's maturity as director.The plot reminded me a lot of Fargo, just the locale is more urbane. A similar plot with twists in the tale, with less humor, more darkness, and less developed characters. I found it totally unnecessary, the forward and backward time frames leading to the same event. Sometimes directors think that juggling the linearity of a plot is really intelligent, I do not think so?! The movie is good. It has perfect performances from its lead role. Philip was outstanding as a con man with evil thinking. Ethan Hawke and Albert Finney are other characters that stand out as outstanding. Surely does Signey Lumet take the best out of his characters. There are a few scenes and sub-plots that could have been avoided, or situation of that plot leading to an event could have been different. But I respect Sidney as a director and his prerogative to choose what he feels suits his cinema. Anyways, it does not bother utterly to the flow of the movie.The title is taken from Irish prase, and that is interesting, I would not write it here, but leave it on you to google it.(Stars 7.75 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's depressing tale of 2 dysfunctional brother's attempt at crime down spiraling into the black hole of desperation and disaster, send your emotion from shock, disgust, bewilderment all the way to utter resentment and disbelief.Impeccably played by Philip Seymour Huffman and Ethan Hawk, the on screen duo immediately drew you into the bizarre and surreal world of trouble. From then on, you got to witness the two weeks worth of life events unfolding in front of you, told not by chronological order, rather layer by layer in order of emotional intensity. You were often presented with the most explosive segment of a key event, followed by back tracking of what led up to that moment. It's a great way to get audience's attention and keep them alert and thinking.The subject matter is harsh and rather difficult to deal with. It is this level of discomfort that challenges you to relate your own life to that of on the screen. Though I believe not that many people could have had such dramatic event in their life (hopefully not!), nevertheless, you can still find yourself relate to the state of minds of the characters.I have to warn you though, this is a movie that nobody in it wins, it is depressing to the core. But as a movie, it is masterfully shot and perfectly casted. The characters are so believable, that there are times the sense of tension and despair just overwhelms you. For those who smokes (though I don't), you may find yourself compelled to take couple of cigarette breaks during the whole viewing. It is almost too emotionally draining to watch the whole thing in one sitting.The music use is kept to a minimum, and it remains to be very effective in building up intensity in key moments. I noticed the kind of music style is very old school, using repetition of simple tune with increasing tempo. It serves well to aggravates you and draw out the sense of panic and disorder.I do have a couple of minor complaints in terms of obvious plot hole in ending and overall tune of the movie. I won't comment much on the plot hole as it will spoil the plot. The overall tune of the movie is overly dark with little to no sense of redeeming value to be ever found in any of the characters. As I commented earlier, in this movie, nobody wins. It pits the audience against the great odds of involuntary evil, men of great weaknesses that do stupid things. It like looking at a masterfully painted picture depicting something truly ugly and pathetic. A fine piece of movie art it is, but offers very little enjoyment. I found certain imagery to be very disturbing and distasteful, especially the ones depicting Huffman's naked body and prolonged shots that followed him in the den of a drug dealer. A fine actor he is, I just can't stand his mannerism. I guess he's still somehow trapped in Capote's ghost, or maybe that's just how he is.</fullReview>

I didn't take it literally, more a tale of how greed leads to a situation that just spins totally out of control. It's almost like French cinema ? where the character starts off relatively comfortable and you just know that whatever he does, whatever he tries, he is destined to enter a world of chaos and confusion. Like trying to untangle a bad knot, the more you pull and tug, the worse the knot becomes until eventually ? all hope is lost.One scene in particular blew me away. I can see it as clear as if I were watching it right now. Something goes wrong ? and the panic stricken terrified face of a desperate man ? driving frantically through a desolate car park to some weird off kilter music. I actually felt the horror myself.Amazing film, amazing story and although at the time, I recall thinking (toward the end) ? this is all getting a little far-fetched now (though never feeling let down or disappointed) ? in hindsight I can now see how perfect it all was. Like tracing a terrible accident backwards in time ? the inevitable and chaotic mess is always caused by a series of (at the time) unlikely and improbably events.This really is a powerhouse of a film and contains two of the best performances I have ever seen.9/10.FM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic tragedy that's directed masterfully but poorly constructed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet is one of my favorite directors and to see him put out a film like "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" at age 82 is fascinating. But even the master himself can only do so much with a film. Though it's proof he's not even a drop less sharp with a camera than he was 50 years ago, this film doesn't deliver all you would hope and all that he puts into it. Though it's premise is classic tragedy--small time people getting caught in over their heads--it doesn't provide the catharsis of a tragedy. As good as this terrific cast is too, there is little connection with the characters and thus we feel little when tragedy befalls them.First-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson tells his original story about two brothers, Andy and Hank Hanson (Hoffman and Hawke respectively) who are strapped for cash and decide robbing their parents' jewelry store will get the job done without hurting anyone (since the shop is insured). Of course it all goes south quickly when Hank brings in an outside man with a gun to do the job and it turns out their mother is in the store at the time. During the robbery both are fatally wounded and the brothers can't seem to rid their hands of the mistake.Masterson tells his story using character flashback. Throughout the movie we go back in time to see snippets of both brothers from their perspective and what happened to led to the tragedy and eventually of the consequences they endure. Later on their enraged father (Finney) is also part of the perspectives. It's not confusing, but it doesn't leave time to establish the family at all. We see very clearly how troubled the characters are in their own ways and how it affects their actions, but we don't have a clear understanding of why and without the why we don't have our emotional connection to them. The closest we get to identifying with the story is with Hoffman's character. We see his poor relationship with his wife (Tomei), who is actually cheating on him (a role Tomei's quite used to) with his brother, we see his struggles at work despite his six-figure paycheck, and his life-consuming drug addiction. Lumet portrays him from high, distant angles and slow pans toward his face to create a pervasive feeling of loneliness and depression. We get him almost perfectly, but there isn't enough time for the other characters plus how they relate to each other. For example, because the father is introduced so late, we have no visual proof other than a conversation of Andy's poor relationship with his father, which ends up pivotal to the film's tragic end.Lumet does nothing but great work with this film, bringing as much insight into the struggles of these characters to make ends meet and feel good about themselves as he can, but there's something inherent in the story that prevents you from getting on board with it. Even this incredible ensemble cast can only do so much. There's great dialog and some good potential from Masterson as he continues to write, but this story makes for just a good/fair film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poor writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet is a name that i recognize instantly. So, a classic director. But then i start to wonder which of his movies i've seen. When i look here at IMDb i find that most of what i've seen and liked was made in the 1960's or 1970's. And after seeing this movie it certainly seems that Lumet has lost some of his touch. Although the writing department is perhaps even more to blame for this mess.First off i called the movie a mess in the paragraph above. I can start here by saying that it's not half as bad as most other movies that i call a mess. This movie is just too messy for it's own good. There is one thing they just like too much, and that is to skip back and forth in time. It seems every time a scene in this movie starts to become interesting they freeze the frame and suddenly we jump three days back, or forward, in time. I can tell you that this didn't work for me. It's very seldom that this actually works, and it demands good writing. And good writing is seriously lacking here.Bad scripts usually have a few things in common. First of all, a story that doesn't get you interested (check!), characters that are caricatures or paper-thin (check!), dialog that doesn't work (check! saying the f-word a thousand times is not a substitute for good dialog). And then of course we have the chopped-up time-line. Mostly though that is a symptom of bad writing rather than a major problem in itself. If the rest of the movie had been engaging, interesting and tight i could have accepted it.Philip Seymour-Hoffman is a great actor. His character also has some potential although he never gets to realize it. Ethan Hawke is not an awful actor, but i still have serious dislike for him. And he (as usual) looks fifteen years old and completely lost. Albert Finney has perhaps the most thankless part of all, having a very emotional character that doesn't really get to develop at all.I have complained a lot in this review, and for the most part i think it's well deserved. This is just not good workmanship. The movie is confused, poorly written and has characters that for the most part deserve a bullet in the face and are hard to sympathize with (Albert Finney's father is an exception). Mostly though this is a very bland movie which is also overly long. It could easily have been fifteen minutes shorter without detracting anything from the story or experience. This might work as light entertainment, although there are literally dozens of thrillers i would recommend over this one.4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet has one more great film before he left us. He took Kelly Masterson's first screenplay and gave it to Albert Finney, Rosemary Harris, Ethan Hawke, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Brian F. O'Byrne, Amy Ryan, Michael Shannon, and Marisa Tomei. They performed magnificently and he directed flawlessly in a caper classic that is more than a caper.I will never get tired of looking at Marissa's perky Tomeis, and I fail to see why Philip Seymour Hoffman wanted anything more. Just being with her should be enough to satisfy anyone. You landed the perfect trophy wife, not enjoy your good fortune.But, he wants a do-over, and plans a caper with his loser brother, Ethan Hawke. Why would anything go right? he is suddenly going to grow a brain? In fact, watching Hawke play this character was really painful.The world is an evil place. Some make money and some get destroyed, often while some are making money. The family of Albert Finney is a picture of the world, and it is not a pretty picture to see as it unravels.I am sure that many will see themselves or people they know in this film, as it is so real it is scary.</fullReview>

Well shot and well acted aren't enough - there needs to be a character the audience cares about and a story that engages, and they're just not here. I really wanted this to be good, but simply could not find any satisfaction here. Boring, pointless characters doing stupid, foredoomed things for reasons that just weren't that compelling.The staggered time-line can work well - if there's a surprising insight or important clues are revealed when the viewer sees the scene the second time from another viewpoint. Watching the breakdown of a family can be compelling, if the viewer has been given a reason to care about at least one of the members. Watching this, I recommend early judgment - if you're still waiting for it to start being good after 10 minutes, you may as well quit - it just doesn't improve.</fullReview>

Ethan Hawk is just okay as the brother who knows its wrong but goes with it anyway (Hawks problem is that its too mannered. or affected.

An excellent movie filled with darkness that maybe a bit too intense and too dark for some viewers (and even reviewers who rated it highly but left it off the best of the year lists). I'm finding it rattling around in my head, its bleak look making me admire it more than I like it. Liking it to me somehow meaning that I'd actually want to see this again, which I'm not sure I'd want to do (and not wanting to dwell on the details is keeping me from discussing the film the way it should be discussed).

		<shortDescription>Gripping from beginning to end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no easing into this story. As the movie begins the first thing we see, and see rather explicitly, is Philip Seymour Hoffman having aggressive, passionate sex with Marisa Tomei. Well, that'll get your attention. And so off we go. Hoffman plays Andy Hanson, a payroll executive who outwardly appears to be reasonably successful in the game of life. He certainly appears to have done well in the marriage department. Andy thoroughly enjoys his opening tryst with wife Gina and why wouldn't he? Tomei continues to defy the aging process, stunning as ever in the role of Andy's wife. Unfortunately for our characters the exhilaration of this opening scene won't last. As our story unfolds moments of happiness will be in rather short supply for Andy, Gina and all those who surround them.We will soon learn that in actuality things are not going well at all for Andy Hanson. He needs money. Desperately. And immediately. Conveniently he has a younger brother, Hank, who also finds himself in rather dire financial straits. Andy has the solution. He has planned a robbery of a small jewelry store. It should be a rather simple operation. No fuss, no muss, no unnecessary complications. An easy score. Andy did the planning, Hank will actually do the deed. Unfortunately Hank is not up to the task. On the day things go horribly, impossibly wrong. And the consequences for the brothers will be almost too much to bear.Beyond that it is probably best to say little more about the plot. What this movie does best is reveal its story in an ingenious way. The story is constantly flashing forward and back in time. Not a new plot device in films to be sure but one which can be hit or miss. Here it works very well. This film's story has many layers to it and the way the story is presented makes it all the more compelling. Key sequences we may see multiple times, from the differing perspectives of multiple characters. The story never fails to be gripping and despite all the jumping around in time it is always easy enough to follow what is going on. Presented in a traditional, linear fashion this would still have been a very interesting story. But the spin writer Kelly Masterson and director Sidney Lumet have put on things makes it ultimately much more rewarding for the audience. In watching the film we're unraveling the story in our own heads just as the key characters often are and it's a great viewing experience.The story is a terrific one, and the way in which it unfolds makes it that much better. It's not a perfect movie however. The story being told here is a very emotional one and at times the movie is almost overwhelmed with emotion. There are moments where there's some serious over-acting going on, most notably from Hoffman. He's certainly very good in the role but there are those moments where the emotion is so raw, so violent that it appears he's gone a little too far. There's a line of believability and he occasionally goes careening over that line. Lumet apparently encouraged Hoffman to go for broke and the effect is occasionally unsettling. At times Hoffman really overwhelms Ethan Hawke, who plays Hank. Hoffman's Andy is certainly meant to be the stronger of the two brothers but the contrast between the two is at times so great that Hawke's Hank comes across as laughably timid, almost pathetic. And that's a problem because Hank has a big part to play in all that goes on and it's hard to take him seriously as his brother verbally bludgeons him into submission. A little more subtlety probably could have gone a long way.Yes there are some minor quibbles but Hoffman and Hawke for the most part do a fine job in carrying the film. Tomei is certainly easy on the eyes but she has some serious acting to do in her role as well and proves more than capable. And Albert Finney is certainly memorable as Andy and Hank's father. Much of the emotion of the film comes from his performance. It's a story in which hearts are destined to be broken. Things will never be as good, for anyone, as they were in the film's opening scene. These characters may prove to be hard to embrace. Nobody really has the moral high ground here. But while you may not fall in love with these characters you can certainly appreciate their journey. There's a fascinating story to be told here and the way that story is told makes for a memorable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underwhelming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone who knows anything about films knows who Sidney Lumet is. "12 Angry Men." "Serpico." "Dog Day Afternoon." Those are just a few of the cinematic classics that Lumet can boast are under his name. While he can do the same about "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," I wouldn't quite recommend it.I don't want to give anything away, but here goes. Two brothers are in need of money, so one of them concocts a "foolproof" plan to rob their parents jewelry store, which would make them rich and do nothing to their parents, since the insurance will back them up. Of course, things don't go as planned, and everything goes to hell.By any standards this should be a great movie. It's got a great director, five skilled actors, and a good premise. The result, however, does not live up to its potential. Instead, it's a rather forgettable hour and a half.The real problem is that it's just not compelling. The film has the materials, but Lumet just can't rack up the intensity like he should. It's engaging, but not very.The actors are great, but it's not surprising that this was ignored at Oscar time. Ethan Hawke is terrific as a guilt-ridden and a completely stressed out man down on his luck. It's one of the best performances he's given. I never really liked Phillip Seymour Hoffman; I always found him really weird and bizarre. But he's good here, and he more than holds his own as the central character. Albert Finney is good as well, showing his dramatic range from something by the likes of "Erin Brockovich" or "Traffic," where he uses his deep voice as a source of power. Here he's toned down, and does a complete character change from his usual roles. He's a grieving, wounded man who over the course of the film completely loses it. Marisa Tomei is criminally underused, especially since she got top billing. I can't judge her performance because her part is so small. She really only has one brief scene where she can spread her wings, which she does well, but it's not enough. Same goes for Rosemary Harris and Amy Ryan, though their characters are only on screen when it's necessary. The most surprising performance is by Michael Shannon, who's used to playing guys who are pretty unstable (like a soldier suffering from shell shock or something). Here he's cool, calm, and actually quite menacing. Here he proves he's one to watch.This is the first film by Sidney Lumet that I've seen, so I can't say whether putting him in the director's chair was a poor choice. However, I will say that this film was mismarketed by astronomical proportions. Everything about this movie's advertising makes it out to be an intense, gripping heist-thriller, but it's more of a family melodrama. It could be gripping and intense, if it could make me actually care. To be fair, the film looks great. It has a dark, grainy tint that just oozes in freshness and professionalism. Plus, Lumet has great control of his actors, and brings out the best in all of them. Sadly, the film doesn't hold up.The title comes from an Irish funerary toast, which is kind of ironic, since there's not much life to this movie to start with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When giants fall, they go down hard don't they? Our love for cinema had been shaped, molded and preserved eons ago by a few of cinema's illuminating lighthouses. Kurosawa, Coppola, Lumet and Orson Welles were part of our formative influences culminating in our collective tastes in movies now. Thus, as one of the directors whom we look up to, Lumet was untouchable and beyond reproach. Sadly, with this latest offering, Lumet seems to be saying, "My game's up. I've no more tricks up my sleeve. It was a pleasure to enthrall you all but now I must leave the hall." What started out like a smart thriller/whodunit took a very wrong turn instead and ended up disastrously farcical. Come back to us, old friend.

		<fullReview>Far be it from me to try to change the minds of those who loved this movie, but I feel compelled to add my opinion.I found the whole thing a complete and utter waste of my time. Where do I start? The redundant 'let's go back in time' structure - what was the point of that? It never revealed anything to us that changed the way we viewed the movie. I kept thinking... 'aha, now we'll see something that will be a twist - something to really shock us and make us realise that what we've been watching isn't as obvious as we think it has'. But no... just a device that (to me) smacks of urgent re-editing when the producers realised they had a conventionally narratived disappointment on their hands.The acting was so over the top as to be unbelievable. Finney and Ethan Hawke, the latter of whom is a favourite player of mine, seemed to be auditioning for the world gurning championships and Seymour Hoffman was little better. The script was unbalanced, with the entire Seymour Hoffman/Finney subplot being slapped on the end rather than evenly distributed throughout (maybe a result of the re-editing process). In short, a great disappointment (for me) from such a group of talented people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I try. Sometimes you visit a movie and there is no reason that you criticize this movie, because it's good. But on this one i have to give my personal feeling. I give the film a 7 because from a film point of view I can't find any negative comment. The film is well made, with an eye for detail, with fantastic actors, a fantastic script and surprising twists. Ethan Hawke plays an amazing loser. PS Hofmann is good as always, and plays in the most annoying sex scene ever and the rest of the cast is brilliant as well. So far so good, but if i mean the most annoying sex scene ever, than we are talking about the red line of my overall feeling about this movie. It's a very negative movie, with irritating characters, nothing positive about it and i was glad that it was finished after 122 minutes of having a difficult time after an heavy day at the office.So from a film point of view i can't find any critic, even the flash backs in time are, although irritating, well done and at the end a surplus to the movie, from a personal point of view i really hate this kind of negative movies. The world is difficult enough, please give me some positivism I think a lot of people will agree with this point of view. There is no way that you come happy out of this movie, but if you think this is a bad movie than you are not objective at all I won't watch it a second time, thats for sure</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the pit of a dysfunctional dream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really excellent dysfunctional family film posing as a heist thriller, the robbery being the Mcguffin which exposes the desperate fault lines in the all-American family at the centre of the film. Harrowing performances take us on a journey to expose the ways in which neglect by a parent of the feelings and needs of their offspring, fatally married to a relentless and vain pursuit of the American dream, can lead to a downward spiral all the way to the pit.At the centre of the film, a wizened old man tells the patriarch that "the world is an evil place" - and rarely does cinema show evil playing itself out as relentlessly and with as much emotional truth as this. As a coldly rational study of people caught in a tangled web of bad fate and even badder crime gone wrong, the film almost rises to the heights of Kubrick's The Killing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the start, its easy to figure out that these two characters, played by Ethan Hawkin and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, are going to be the guys that do it! But what keeps you spellbound through this entire movie is the "why are they doing this" part that kept me intrigued at every passing minute of this movie. Clearly, the best of this genre that I've seen this year! You see the absolute meltdown of two otherwise ordinary guys that are desperate to change their lives by pulling off an improbable robbery. It goes from bad to worse and that's where the plot thickens. Albert Finney, in the role of father to these two, deserves much mention, as he pieces together all the clues in "what happened." Phillip Seymour Hoffman is incredible in this character role of a person simply caught up in the under-draft of desperation, with Ethan Hawk cast in the perfect role of younger brother trusting his older brother that, somehow, everything was going to workout just right....and it doesn't.Don't miss this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a train wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie directed by the 83-year-old Lumet brings to mind Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs.' Depending on how you look at it, Tarantino is the master, or the infamous originator, of the scrambled time-line. That film begins after a disastrous failed jewelry story robbery and follows, with overlapping chronologies, the subsequent behavior of various participants who wind up in a warehouse. The title of this new botched jewelry story heist picture comes from an Irish toast: May you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows you're dead. According to Lumet at the NYFF press screening, the screenplay came in over the transom from one Kelly Masterson. Lumet wasn't sure, at the Q&amp;A, if Masterson was a man or a woman, so they don't seem to be close. Lumet did the rewriting. This included making the primary characters behind the robbery not just friends but brothers. This is an important touch, since this is, or became, a story of total family meltdown?one whose intensity and fatality is such that links with Greek tragedy have been mentioned. Things are not going very well for either older brother Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) or baby brother Hank (Ethan Hawke). Andy is embezzling his company to pay for his expensive drug habit. Things aren't clicking between him and his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei)?and unbeknownst to him she's sleeping with Hank. Hank, who's not doing well financially and is behind in his child-support, is a lovable loser?which makes you wonder why Andy should talk him into carrying out a robbery. He seems incapable of so much as delivering a pizza. What Andy doesn't own up to at first is that the place to be robbed is their own parents "mom and pop" strip mall jewelry store. Hank knows he can't do a robbery himself. He secretly enlists a seedy character he knows named Bobby (Brian F. O'Byrne) to enter the store while he waits in a rental car.Bobby's a tough guy all right, but hey, none of these boys is the sharpest knife in the drawer, and Bobby makes a hash of it, and in the process of getting himself killed shoots Hank and Andy's own mother (Rosemary Harris), who just happens to be minding the shop that day because an employee couldn't make it.'Reservoir Dogs' skips the actual robbery scene. It's reconstructed in subsequent dialogue. Masterson/Lumet's screenplay includes the scene of the robbery, then goes back and forth over the four days prior to it and the week following it in chronologically scrambled segments. These are a problem. Lumet had to add labels giving date and point of view for these out-of-sequence segments, because he himself couldn't follow where they were meant to fit on the first reading. What you can't tell on viewing the film is why these sequences need to be so scrambled other than to conceal, for a while anyway, how dumb this robbery scheme is. What they clearly show is what a lot of trouble the brothers are in, before they make things much worse.Lumet knew this plot-based movie would need great acting to put across the characters and screw the emotions up to a fever itch. He began with Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was given choice of which brother to play. Hawke was called in: and he gives a surprisingly strong performance as a weak man. Albert Finney as Charles, the father, naturally maintains the intensity level. And Tomei fits. The cops aren't helpful, so Charles decides to find out on his own who staged this robbery, and he seems to know where to look. Bobby had a kid, and the brother of the kid's mother, Dex (Michael Shannon), who's no more fun to be with than Bobby, comes looking for Hank, and finds him.Before the Devil excels in its powerful evocation of total meltdown. It reads as something that goes too slow at first, than rushes too much at the end. Lumet, who's astonishingly vigorous at 83 and is said to work incredibly fast still, calls this story "melodrama," and thus defines it as working by certain rules, among them suspension of disbelief where a lot of stuff happens with shocking speed. Arguably too much happens and though by intention not everything is explained about how the characters end up, the ending provides not the catharsis of Greek tragedy but the sensation of having witnessed a train wreck. The element of Tarantino that you most miss is the good dialogue. But you also miss the well placed dramatic pause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was a disappointment. **Spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. I can't believe it was on so many critics best list. First, the totally unrealistic robbery. The robber just walks in. When they had the Hank flashback I thought it would be explained Bobby had gotten the jewelry store front door key from Hank. Didn't happen. You always leave the front door open while you have the safe open and fill the display cases in a jewelry store.When the old lady fires the gun, there is no kick back and it makes an a-team like sound. Bobby/the robber can't smash the case top open, yet when he is shot the second times he is lifted off his feet and flies THROUGH the front door. Most jewelry shops have very shoddy front doors. And they have no video cameras unlike a car rental place's front desk.Nobody recognizes the dad's late model car he has probably had for years. Even if he drives it 2 feet from you.Every woman in this movie is a whore except for saint mom and her virgin daughter. I like seeing Marissa Tomei naked as much as the next guy, but Sidney Lumet must have been really happy her career was on the down slope until the Wrestler. To quote Tarantino she's a "regular screwing machine." Then you are supposed to feel really bad for her when she leaves her cold husband who won't even screw her when they are not on vacation. Marissa -- why are you dressed? You have a scene to film.Some of you might say there are other women in the film. Don't forget the ex-wife who is always yelling for money or calling her ex a loser. And we can't forget Bobby's wife who is mad because her sleep is being interrupted after her late night drunk screw session. I know she has a kid, but she sleeps all day when not screwing. She is upset Bobby is leaving to earn money although she spends the rest of movie upset because now she doesn't have a husband who earns money..Even in the post wake scene Tomei is dressed provocatively and has her hair done up. She got her hair done for the funeral. Some might say Tomei isn't dressed provocatively because she is wearing an apron over her dress small black dress like the virginal sister in law.Emoting. I can hear Lumet's direction in many scenes. I'm never going to turn off the camera. Emote. Wait, the dialog is over. Just keep going. Make faces -- it means you FEEL things. See the end of the Tomei leaving scene and any scene with Ethan Hawke.Pacing. I'm not one of those MTV generation cut cut cut people but I was so glad I had a remote to fast forward parts of this movie. When I get the mail filming it would be boring. When Albert Finney does it he is isolated. When I have 2 minutes of nothing at the start of every scene it is genius. Get it. They are lonely even when there are other people around."Sidney? What are you doing?" "We are going to film you loading this camera then pan to Ethan who will walk around doing nothing for 2 minutes. We want to let them know you are lonely. Then we'll have Phil come in and walk around for 5 minutes. And then he'll scream at you and hit you with a board. Then they will KNOW you FEEL pain." The cops. There are 20 cops at the scene but 2 days later they don't give a crap and old lady was murdered in their suburb. "Don't ask me about your dead wife's murder, I'm getting coffee here." I have such a loving relationship with my wife that my heart rate won't go up when I murder my own son.The whole movie everyone rips on Hank(including Hank) for not being able to face things, yet Andy thinks he is the perfect guy for the robbery.</fullReview>

Lumet has obviously given his fine (male) cast plenty of room in which to do the piece justice. He just fails to fill in the gaps and tighten it all up.As for that cast, Ethan Hawke is a real chameleon - compare this wuss with the principled rookie of Training Day or the hard nut of the Precinct 13 remake. Albert Finney's fine, if a bit doddery; Philip Seymour Hoffman is the real martyr to the cause, selflessly putting both body and soul in the lens' way throughout. I also thought highly of Michael Shannon's grievous brother-in-law.We didn't need the subtitles helping with the flashbacks, not in the post-Pulp Fiction/Momento 21st century. It's also a mite unrelentingly downbeat - the comedy to offset the tension is invariably ignored. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Director Sidney Lumet's incredible film career span 60 years and includes some of Hollywood's best ever. Sadly, his last really good film was "The Verdict" in 1982. What prevents 'Devil' from being really good is a pathetically weak script penned by Kelly Masterson. This is listed as Masterson's first credit, and what a shame Lumet and a terrific cast were wasted on this unworthy material.Suspension of disbelief doesn't begin to justify the plot holes and ridiculous moments, but what proves truly fascinating is that Lumet and the cast still deliver a watchable film. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke and Albert Finney are all outstanding in creating one of the most dysfunctional families you will find outside of a Wes Anderson film. Watching Finney once he starts solving the crime is downright frightening. Hoffman and Hawke both capture desperation is much different but effective ways. Hoffman and Hawke's scenes together are the film's best.Much ado about Marisa Tomei's nude scenes and though not distracting to the story (mostly because the story is stupid), certainly nothing to the script depends on her flashing so much skin. She is a fine actress who needs more roles like "In the Bedroom" and less that require lip biting and breast exposure.Watching Lumet deftly handle the non-linear story line and the panic of Hoffman and Hawke make us realize just how good he is as a director. The best is his following of Hoffman through the apartment during his "quiet" tantrum after Tomei leaves him.So this one is worth seeing to see real film pros like Lumet, Hoffman and Finney; but also a great exercise in mentally re-writing a script on the fly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May you be in heaven half an hour?Before the Devil Knows You're Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The often-used phrase about how it was too bad such great acting was wasted on an inferior film has always intrigued me. The last time I felt it was with The Last King of Scotland. There, however, its top-notch performances vaulted its above average story into a pretty enjoyable experience. That is how these instances usually go for me. I don't mind if the movie is on the simple side if the acting is worth the price of admission. A great movie does not need to fire on all cylinders to make me praise it, the acting can always make up for whatever else is lacking. With that said, Sidney Lumet's highly praised new film, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, brings out some electric turns from its cast. Everyone seems to have sunk their teeth in the roles they were given and they knock them out of the park. In that regard I agree whole-heartedly with critics that we have a return to form for Lumet, better known for his gritty character pieces from the 70's. Unfortunately, while last year's Find Me Guilty, his first major film in seven years, was pretty cookie-cutter, it was highly entertaining. I cannot say the same about his new work. Despite its acting clinic, the story is overall boring, contrived, and at times annoying with its gimmick of using multiple story lines to catch what each character was doing before, after, and during the robbery.Robbery-gone-wrong plots are pretty commonplace. It takes some ingenuity or enjoyable supporting stories to carry an entry in the genre. What was so refreshing for a film like Inside Man is that it was about a robbery gone well. The downfall there was that its periphery Nazi plot was so specific and tacked on, it took away from what worked, the bank heist. Straight from the trailer here, we are told that our leads, Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman, have hatched a plan to rob their parents' jewelry store. Knowing all the angles, it would be an in-and-out job with no casualties. We all know that something will be going wrong and that the family will be faced with challenges to recuperate from it, but it doesn't have to be so generic and obvious. Even the other plot threads are unoriginal. For instance, what is thought to be a look inside Hoffman's psyche with drug abuse in a hotel room eventually turns out to have only been introduced so the locale could be used later on?just because we saw it before doesn't let it make sense, it becomes unnatural due to how contrived it is.Lumet and first-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson know that it is all in the details and they show every one of them. We are blatantly shown events and tiny missteps continuously, knowing that they will be coming back into play. The story was so worn that my boredom began manifesting things and scenarios, hoping that the stale events would pick up somehow. Having to see a truck pull into the mall's parking lot, obstructing the view of the brother's parents' car, stuck out so much I started to think that whoever drove it was part of a twist yet to come. Don't bother with any conspiracy theories; it was just a prop to block the parents' identities. It is all so fine-tuned and orchestrated that the story just drags along, culminating in a mixed bag conclusion.The final half hour or so is pretty good, though. The acting steps up drastically, and that says something since it had been in top form throughout, and the stakes finally get raised to the level of me being truly in the dark to what could happen. Only when every character has their back to the wall does the spontaneity and inventiveness finally come out. Too bad it took three quarters of a bloated two-hour runtime to get there. Not only that, but at the very end, it reverts back into blandness. The ending works, don't get me wrong, it's just that it is what we thought would play out from the start of the final transition?those epileptic screen flashes to let us know we were moving in time to a different character were laughably annoying?to the last main point of view change, while also allowing the results of a major character's arc to be left untouched.Again, though, despite all that is wrong and unoriginal about the story, the performances are fantastic. Ethan Hawke is his generally spot-on self as the "baby" of the family, literally and figurative. He is roped into the theft by his older brother's smarts and conniving ability to get his sibling to do whatever he wants. As that man, Hoffman is at his best. The salesman smile, the internalizing of his lack of a loving childhood, and the scary rage when the bottom finally falls out, all shape this character to be the most interesting and complex of the bunch. If only Lumet would have honed the film to focus on this role, without all the repetition of getting everyone's viewpoint, Hoffman could have easily carried the story to greatness. All the supporting players are brilliant too. Even Marisa Tomei, in a role that is completely a prop used to connect the brothers and their emotional problems and I guess as eye-candy since she is topless for most of the movie, is wonderful. It's just a shame that the acting couldn't have been the focal point. The mediocre story pushed through too much, instilling boredom on top of the performances that truly captivated my attention.</fullReview>

This movie, on its surface, is about a heist gone wrong and that story is enough to warrant high praise, but the underlying tale about corrosive family relationships that lead to tragedy and destruction is Shakespearian in nature.Everything from the screenplay, the pacing, the editing, to the acting is superb. Philip Hoffman is brilliant, but I must say that I was surprised at being, at least, equally impressed with Ethan Hawke. The rest of the cast, which includes the very talented, Marisa Tomei and the legendary Albert Finney, down to smallest of roles are as perfect an ensemble as you'll ever see in in film.If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and go as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective story that should have been more simply told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film combines a fairly gripping crime story with a family drama of alienation and grotesque betrayal, but it indulges in a little too much non-linear storytelling for its own good.Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawk) are brothers who look nothing alike and are almost just as different as individuals. Andy's got himself a beautiful wife and a seemingly great job at an investment firm. Hank's got an ex-wife who constantly bitches about child support and lives in a crappy apartment. Andy seems like he has everything in control, including holding his emotions in a tight, icy grip. Hank is a fidgety loser who's always promising more than he can deliver. But they've come to a point where both of them need a lot of money very quickly, so Andy hatches a robbery scheme and ropes his little brother into the deal. That's when we discover that both brothers share one thing in common. They're both weak. Andy needs drugs to get through his life and Hank needs another guy to help him pull off the robbery. Then two people end up dead and while Andy and Hank never really have to worry about the cops uncovering their guilt, the slow and relentless hand of fate slowly chokes hope and life out of them.There are some very nice performances in this movie. Hoffman and Hawk do not just create memorable individual characters but they make you both understand and believe the relationship between these brothers. Hank is clearly the lesser partner in this duo, yet you can tell it wasn't always that way. You can see in how they relate to each other that there was a time when Hank was the fair-haired boy of the family and it was the elder Andy who played second-fiddle. But while those childhood roles have reversed, both Hoffman and Hawk make you feel that old dynamic filtering the brothers' interaction as adults. Hoffman has the showier role as a man cut off from his own emotions, unable to process them. Hawk, though, doesn't let the simpler role of Hank slip into two dimension.Albert Finney plays Andy and Hank's father and strongly captures the spoiled nature of the relationship with Andy. Marisa Tomei plays Andy's wife Gina, who also having an affair with Hank, but the character never gets any of the depth of the leading men. She does get naked quite often, which is certainly a plus. That is, however, balanced out by images of a naked Philip Seymour Hoffman, which are not things to which women or children should ever be exposed.The story is told in a non-linear fashion. For the first ?'s of the movie, it focuses on one of the characters and flashes back so many days before or after the botched robbery. We then stay with that character for an extended period of time, seeing their part of the overall story, and then repeating the same thing with different characters. There's some good things that come out of that approach. It gives the actors a chance to be the star of their own little part of the story. It also gives the audience a chance to really immerse themselves in these people and their lives and then step back and connect it all together.The non-linear stuff does get to be a bit much after a while, though. There comes a point where the reaction to another flashback is "not this again". The other problem is that the story starts out by focusing on Hank and because of the non-linear thing, stays with him for a while before shifting to Andy. But as the film progresses, Andy becomes more and more the main character and it's a little awkward to switch your emotional focus to him from Hank. It's also not clear that the non-linear stuff really adds anything to the movie, other than allowing them to space out the plot twists.Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a strong and compelling enough tale that it could have done without the non-linear storytelling. It's a relatively minor flaw and doesn't detract much from an otherwise fine film. Naked Philip Seymour Hoffman, though, might be a bit tougher to swallow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chock full of intensely unlikeable characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie chock full of intensely unlikeable characters. But that's okay. Every film doesn't have to be a syrupy rom-com, or a good-guys-always-win-car-chase-extravaganza. In fact, that's one of the things that stand out about this film, the way it is sort of the anti-Hollywood. Killer character work by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke, who I've not much cared for before. I certainly didn't like his character, but then I wasn't supposed to. Surprisingly, there really wasn't enough exposition of the strained Hanson family relationships, other than the one hugely significant conversation. Oh, and Marissa Tomei looked awesome, even playing a fairly despicable character. She nailed it, just like everyone else. Yes, there may be a few plot holes, and the non-linear time-frame device was a bit irritating, but not nearly as much as in some other films. Definitely worth checking out if you can stand a non-feel-good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't expect to see a happy movie, as this is one of the most depressing, and pervasive movies of the decade (and that says a lot). I shall not reveal any details from the film, as that will diminish the overall experience of the motion picture, but let's just say that the title has a meaning. As far as the technical details go, acting is spot on (Phillipe Seymore Hoffman gives the standout performance of the film), as is the directing and the cinematography of the movie. Once again, don't expect a feel good movie, because this is the exact opposite of that. Overall, this film is a shattering portrayal of what evil can do. One of the best films of 2007, and a perfect 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently has his act together) and Hank (clearly doesn't have his act together) need money. Andy comes up with a scheme to get some dough that will have consequences for the whole Hanson family.This film delivers. This is a layered, full-blooded roller coaster ride that knows exactly what it is doing. As a crime drama / thriller I would happily compare it to 'No Country For Old Men.' While both films have have an ample supply of character drama and thrills, 'Devil' is more on the thriller side because of its fast pace. 'No Country' is a colder and bleaker film that you can really admire, while 'Devil' is a bit more enjoyable. There is definitely less violence in 'Devil' than 'No Country.' The acting delivers as well. Ethan Hawke, sometimes wooden in the past, brings the jitters, sweating and the deer-in-the-headlights-look to the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Andy, has the film's hardest scenes and is fast becoming the actor, who you believe can do anything.There's really not much wrong with this film. It jumps back and forth without being confusing. Events spiral out of control, but the film never does - the writing (from first timer Kelly Masterson), directing (veteran Sidney Lumet) and the editing stay as tight as a drum. In many categories, this is award caliber stuff, though maybe films like 'The Departed' and 'No Country' squeezed this one out of the limelight. If you liked those, you'll like this.</fullReview>

It throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end. Trust me, this movie will keep you guessing the entire way through.The story is very well crafted and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino type story. The acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts, excellent cast. I also loved the cinematography, it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film.

The concept is compelling, with interesting devices utilized to tell the overall story. There are fine performances all around, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman's being the best of the cast-no surprise there. Ethan Hawke also deserves credit for a very strong performance as well. The Direction by Mr. Lumet is outstanding. The film has a Seventies feel in the respect that risks are taken in the telling of this story, but unlike the majority of trite films that populate the landscape today, this is a thriller that is sincerely based upon relationships rather than special effects or product plugs.

		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This is a thoroughly diabolical tale of just how bad things can go wrong. A simple robbery. Pick up some serious change. Get our finances together and everything will be hunky-dory. But?mom and pop's jewelry store? No problem. Insurance pays for it all. No guns. Nobody gets hurt. Easy money.Older, more successful (it would appear) brother Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) has a few minor problems. Heroin addiction, cocaine habituation. A wife (Marisa Tomei) that?well, he can't seem to perform for. His flat belly days long gone. Younger, sweet, slightly dim-witted younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke) with a few dinero problems of his own. Behind in child support payments for his daughter, in debt to friends and relatives, not exactly wowing them in the work of work, etc.Sydney Lumet, in this performance at the age of 82 (!), directs and gets it 99.99 percent right, which is hard to do in a thriller. I have seen more thrillers than I can remember and most of the time the director gets the movie printed and lives with the plot holes, the improbabilities, the cheesy scenes, and the hurry-up ending. Here Lumet makes a thriller like it's a work of art. Every detail is perfect. The acting is superb. The plot has no holes. The story rings true and clear and represents a tale about human frailty that would honor the greatest filmmakers and even the Bard himself.Hoffman of course is excellent. When you don't have marquee, leading man presence, you have to get by on talent, workmanship and pure concentration. Ethan Hawke, who is no stranger to the sweet, little guy role, adds a layer of desperation and all too human incompetence to the part so that we don't know whether to pity him or trash him. Albert Finney plays the father of the wayward sons with a kind of steely intensity that belies his age. And Marisa Tomei, who has magical qualities of sexiness to go along with her unique creativity, manages to be both vulnerable and hard as nails as Andy's two timing wife. (But who could blame her?) It's almost a movie reviewer's sacrilege to give a commercial thriller five or ten stars, but if you study this film, as all aspiring film makers would be well advised to do, you will notice the kind of excessive (according to most Hollywood producers) attention to detail that makes for real art--the sort of thing that only great artists can do, and indeed cannot help but do. (By the way, I think there were twenty producers on this film?well, maybe a dozen; check the credits.) All I can say in summation is, Way to go Sydney Lumet, author of a slew of excellent films, and to show such fidelity to your craft and your art at such an advanced age?kudos. May we all do half so well.Okay, the 00.01 percent. It was unlikely that the father (Albert Finney) could have followed the cabs that Andy took around New York without somehow losing the tail. This is minor, and I wish all thrillers could have so small a blip. Also one wonders why Lumet decided not to tell us about the fate of Hank at the end. We can guess and guess. Perhaps his fate fell onto the cutting room floor. Perhaps Lumet was not satisfied with what was filmed and time ran out, and he just said, "Leave it like that. It really doesn't matter." And I think it doesn't. What happens to Hank is not going to be good. He isn't the kind of guy who manages to run off to Mexico and is able to start a new life. He is the kind of guy who gets a "light" sentence of 10 to 20 and serves it and comes out a kind of shrunken human being who knows he wasn't really a man when he should have been.See this for Sidney Lumet, one of Hollywood's best, director of The Pawnbroker (1964), The Group (1966), Serpico (1973), Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Network (1976), and many more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sharp Cast Led by a Brilliant Hoffman Ignites Lumet's Fever-Pitch Suspense Melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This intensely involving 2007 character-driven suspense drama is like a big, juicy piece of Shakespearean-level steak from a master filmmaker who knows how to draw out uncommonly ferocious, to-the-edge performances from his actors. Consider for starters - Henry Fonda's lone dissenting juror in "Twelve Angry Men", Katharine Hepburn's delusional Mary Tyrone in "Long Day's Journey Into Night", Rod Steiger's conflicted concentration camp survivor in "The Pawnbroker", William Holden's wintry lion in "Network", and Paul Newman's alcoholic lawyer in "The Verdict". The list encompasses some of the finest screen work of the past half-century, and you can safely add Philip Seymour Hoffman's desperately controlling Andy Hanson to the ranks. At 83, director Sidney Lumet shows no signs of octogenarian fatigue, and in fact, he revels in the melodramatic turns of first-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson's thickly plotted script.The scale of the story is deceptively small as it focuses on the moral compromises that unravel in a family where two brothers have become desperate for immediate cash. Woody Allen followed a similar fraternal dynamic in his last film, the oddly pinched "Cassandra's Dream", but Lumet is neither pinched nor cautious in his fierce approach to this inescapable tale of ambiguity and deception. The plot revolves around a crime that was meant to be victimless. Embezzling funds from his real estate company's payroll to keep his neglected wife Gina happy and to satisfy an expensive drug habit, smooth-talking Andy is about to be exposed in an IRS audit. Meanwhile, his younger brother Hank is a mass of post-divorce, codependent insecurities falling way behind in his alimony and child support payments.Andy concocts a supposedly foolproof plan to rob their parents' suburban jewelry store while neither of them is supposed to be there. The goal was for the brothers to collect the haul, and the parents to claim the insurance. Murphy's Law intervenes in every possible way starting with Andy pressuring Hank to do the job himself. After some brotherly cajoling, Hank agrees to it, but too scared to do it alone, he recruits a reckless, gun-toting busboy to handle the robbery. By fate, the heist occurs on the one day that Andy and Hank's mother is opening the shop, and things quickly spiral out of control from there. Although the back-and-forth storytelling technique is not new (for example, Alejandro González I?árritu's "21 Grams"), Masterson's approach works effectively in delineating certain events from multiple perspectives so that you understand how each character is led to the repercussions of the unfortunate event.The acting is pitch-perfect starting with Hoffman's riveting performance as Andy, a Machiavellian reptile whose cool exterior and innate amorality mask layers of resentment toward his family. I thought he was great in Tamara Jenkins' "The Savages", but he is even better here. Lumet even draws a solid performance from the usually insufferable Ethan Hawke as Hank, imbuing him with the emasculated weakness that informs his every ill-planned move. As their embattled father, Albert Finney acts with his typical late-career bluster, but he provides the necessary foundation for the Oedipal-level complexities. Marisa Tomei is a smart choice to play Gina, as the actress economically keys in on the responsive, watchful nature of a small but pivotal role. The estimable theater veteran Rosemary Harris (now better known as Peter Parker's aunt in the "Spider-Man" trilogy) has precious little time as the mother, as does Amy Ryan as Hank's bitter ex-wife.There are scenes that border on excessive, especially as the situation becomes increasingly desperate for the brothers, but the principals inject such energetic brio to them that the flourishes become forgivable. After the disappointment of the cartoonish "Find Me Guilty", it is refreshing to see Lumet in peak form here. The 2008 DVD offers terrifically informative commentary from Lumet, Hoffman and Hawke, all of whom converse with ease and insight throughout. Along with the original theatrical trailer, there is also a better-than-average 24-minute featurette, "Directed by Sidney Lumet: How the Devil Was Made", which features on-set footage and snippets of interviews with Lumet, two of the producers and the principal actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet goes Tararntino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet goes Tarrantino and falls short. It's still worthwhile for fans of Phil Hoffman, Ethan Hawke or Albert Finney, since they do make a real effort. It doesn't work as a thriller as it was pitched to Lumet, not as a Melodrama as Lumet continues to call it, nor as the tragedy that it really is.This story should have been told in a linear fashion, like Allen did with Cassandra's Dream and the whole malaise would have been more obvious. Who really wants to watch a tragedy these days where fates runs it's cause like a clockwork? Pretty much everybody is dead at the end, or blind or in a madhouse. Undressing Marisa Tomei the way it was done also doesn't speak in favor of this movie. It's not uncommon for old directors, though.Unfortunately there was little information about what was cut or never filmed. Interestingly, in the script Phil and Marisa's characters had a child. In a tragedy, that's where the real suspense could be coming form.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching Before The Devil counts as one of my all time best experiences at the cinema. I have been intrigued my the mixed response to the film - and for me, the extremes of opinion indicate the film touched on something either embraced or disavowed by the general audience. It is one of those films that has stayed with me, and I continue to ponder and think about it.Surely the DVD would illuminate some more of the themes and the film-making elements? Which include: Sidney Lumet's comeback movie, the time-shifting technique deployed in the storytelling, the superb combination of Lumet and Masterson and why it works so well, the masterly direction, the relatively rare focus Hollywood movies give to male characters and their largely doomed struggle to become an open cheque book for their women, the under-presented, but nevertheless resonant Marisa Tomei's performance, and, of course, the superb Hoffman with that central monologue about the sum of his parts - for me the heart of the movie.Phew! Surely a masterful film. So imagine my disappointment watching the eagerly anticipated DVD - only to find no commentary, no behind-the-scenes, no interviews, no extras.Hey - distributors - sort it out!</fullReview>

This is also like The River's Edge and several other films. There's a crime something goes wrong they should stop but keep going forward and they dig a bigger hole and a bigger hole until it all falls apart.

Populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds, Before The Devil is a mesmerizing, jaw-dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable (and sometimes is, even with - or perhaps because of - the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) if it weren't carried out with such magnificent, overwhelming conviction by its stars. The excellent script by Kelly Masterson and superb direction by none other than Sidney Lumet doesn't hurt either.The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two majorly screwed up brothers (brilliant portrayals from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store, an attempt that goes pathetically awry.The story is told with time-shifts (which are noted on screen, such as: "Charlie: Two Days Before The Robbery", so no one should be confused); some people have said they didn't like this device but I thought it worked perfectly, adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair, considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks - between them you couldn't make a decent poker hand to save your life. Throw in these cheesy extra tidbits: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who is having an affair with the other brother, toss in some monumental sibling rivalry, along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father (a wrenching performance from Albert Finney), who has apparently caused him serious past pain, and you've got a Shakespearean/Greek tragedy on your hands.

Hoffman is superb, as usual, and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself. Hawke might have been a little out of his element, but he played the part well enough. Add into this mix Andy's wife, played perfectly by Marisa Tomei, cheating with Hank; Andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery.

		<fullReview>The main problems of this movie are (at least): Unbelievable story, depressing, pointless.I love Lumet's "Network" and I like Ethan Hawke, but in this movie his character is unbearably annoying. He is such a loser and by the middle of the movie he had already got so much on my nerves with his whining that I hoped he would get killed.BTW, not one single character is likable, so there is no one to sympathize with, not even with the father, who at the end kills his own son. I mean, how probable is that? Possible, yes, but extremely improbable, in my opinion! Especially when the son would anyway go to prison for the rest of his life, which would be a much worse punishment.Some of the improbable points: 1. Brothers are desperately in need of money, nobody knows why and yet they have good jobs.2. They work at the same company, but when they first meet in the movie, it seems they haven't seen each other in ages.3. Parents live too modestly for jewelry shop owners and don't help out (at least a bit) their sons, who need some money.4. Sons decide to rob their own parent's shop. (Being their own parents, couldn't they try to scam their jewelry?) 5. Mother is alone in the shop with all the jewelry and leaves door unlocked.6. Robber is a complete moron and acts like a teenager. Instead of avoiding getting heard by someone, he is all the time screaming on the top of his lungs.7. Son visits a pawnbroker before (!) the coup and gives his card to him, leaving a trace.8. Drug dealer leaves safe door always open with a lot of money in it.9. Wife practically hates her husband for having no money, yet she sleeps frequently with his brother, who has even less money (and is a loser).10. Wife leaves her husband, but has not a single penny, not even to buy a mere bus ticket or pay a taxi.11. Brother of the widow meets the guy he is blackmailing at his own sister's apartment, where she is with her child, exposing them to a dangerous situation.12. Hoffman goes with Hawke to the blackmailer to kill him, instead of keeping all the money for himself and fleeing the country, since he didn't care much for his brother and was very angry with him anyway.13. Father tells the nurse, there is a problem with the heart machine and she doesn't come to check, telling him to switch the machine off and on again, like this happens all the time.14. Son is killed by the father (who just hours before asked him for forgiveness) and can be seeing leaving the room, yet nobody runs after him.And many more.Still watchable (for being a Lumet and because of Hoffman), but bad nevertheless.</fullReview>

It creates an extraordinary degree of tension, even though we know its two unsavoury anti-heroes - Hoffman in his usual imperious form, and Hawke, who has never been better - will screw up their master plan. A jewel of a script from debutant Kelly Masterson, and a terrific achievement for Lumet; one needs to go back to Dog Day Afternoon (1975) to find a film by this veteran that felt so accomplished.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a strange film, not in the way that Donnie Darko is strange, far from it in fact. This is a thriller with a fantastic cast and an equally brilliant and experienced director. However it seems to go from a small, almost cult classic in the vein of films like 21 grams to a mediocre crime film turn by turn, and unfortunately sometimes even in the same scene.The film begins with the introduction of two brothers Andy (Philip Seymour-Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawke) who are both having financial difficulties. Andy's problems are initially less clear, although it quickly becomes apparent that his marriage to Gina (Marisa Tomei) is not as healthy as is suggested in the opening scene. Meanwhile Hank is clearly struggling, having split from his wife Martha (Amy Ryan) he is way behind on school fees for their daughter and can't even stump up the $150 needed for her to go and see the Lion King.Whilst the brothers sit in a bar Andy hints that he has a solution to their mutual difficulties, the perfect crime, that can land them $600,000 worth of jewellery. Hank is initially reluctant but predictably comes round to the idea and that's when Andy reveals that they're going to rob their parents' jewellery store outside of the city. Of course it seems the perfect crime, victimless, Andy insists as no one will be hurt and their parents can claim all their losses on their insurance. As predictably as Hank agreeing to commit the crime when it comes to committing it things go disastrously wrong, someone dies and they come away with none of the money.Whilst all of this is pretty routine it is well directed by Lumet and well acted, especially by Hoffman. Despite this until the climax there is very little that happens that can't be predicted in advance. Even though it is well acted the fact that Lumet has made the whole thing low key and restricted in order to concentrate on the two brothers and their relationship much of the middle section is underwhelming after a good opening half hour. To make matters worse Lumet has implied a mixed up chronology which often does not work. Just as one character's storyline is becoming engrossing he'll suddenly stop and jump back to a day or two in time with another character. This results in a loss of momentum on many occasions that only hurts the film . There are times when the technique does work, mostly when it reveals interesting facets of Andy's character in a way that explains some of his behaviour that we've already seen.Thankfully the film picks up as Lumet guides us towards the climax of the story with some unexpected twists and turns and a haunting, powerful final scene. It's just a shame that the whole film does not live up to the early promise. I will return to it for a second time though and hope to see what so many people and critics have obviously adored about this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*added the spoiler thing just in case* Okay, just watched this movie and actually there was just one reason why i even started watching it: Philip Seymour Hoffman.The story ain't that bad, it's just annoying that it has so many flashbacks that are quite unnecessary if anyone asks my opinion, but then again, those keep the viewer in tension. Is it a good or bad thing, i dunno.One thing is for sure: The movie is depressing. I wasn't sure would i start crying or just be numb in the end of the movie, because i really didn't believe that this whole thing would end badly (okay, sure, why not...) And the ending itself just stopped right on the wall, and i sat a long moment waiting for something more, but it never came.Great actors, that's the main reason why anyone should watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If anyone is ever contemplating committing a crime,then before doing so take a look at this film as it could lead to a change of mind!The plot: "When two brothers organize the robbery of their parents' jewelery store the job goes horribly wrong, triggering a series of events that sends them, their father and one brother's wife hurtling towards a shattering climax."It is in my opinion difficult to name any movie that so dramatically illustrates what can go wrong when people decide to break the law and the dire consequences such a breach can create.This picture is super from start to finish.The movie is engrossing and compelling throughout.Top class script, direction and production design.

		<fullReview>Not being the Action Thriller I was expecting (by the cover of the DVD and the plot resume I was thinking it was an Action Thriller) this movie still intense but by other reasons. Instead of a fast paced thriller movie about a bank assault where the main topic is the robbery and how the thieves escape from the police... this film portrays a story of an intense family drama with the bank assault as plot's background.In fact the robbery is just the way we find out how are the personalities and character (in a moral way) of all these people. No one is safe! In a certain way everyone is guilty of something and shows very little (or none at all!) remorse. It makes me remind a classic line from Lynch's TWIN PEAKS: "In a town like Twin Peaks no one is innocent". Here, it's just the same. No one in this movie is innocent. I guess it's the most valuable feature in a movie like this that portrays greed, betrayal and vengeance with such intensity as this one does.I enjoyed the non-linear plot and the way it is "fragmented", showing us the individual perspective of each character before and after the assault. However, at parts, it turns a bit confusing and repetitive because it's always showing the same scenes but in different perspectives. But in general it's fine as a concept and in its final result.The ending is excellent because it gives even more intensity and drama to the plot and even being the most logical and expected ending it is merciless and cold like the sharpened knife of revenge...The acting is good, especially by Philip Seymour who does the main and a very intense character. Ethan Hawke and Albert Finney also do good jobs.I appreciated this film and the strong drama it is and I just don't score it higher than 7/10 because I think it's too slow paced. I understand that a slow pace helps to increase drama tension, but in this particular case, at parts, I think the pace should have been faster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent crime thriller with a cracking, intelligent script that's only slightly marred by wildly uneven performances and an implausible final act.The fractured narrative works incredibly well. Vast amounts of information are withheld to great effect as the revelations - small and large - come thick and fast. Telling Hank and Andy's stories pretty much separately means that it feels almost like a competition to see who's in worse trouble. Just when we think one of them has hit rock bottom, it's revealed that the other learnt even more bad news that will impact both of them - and it all comes from credible sources. There's no broken down cars or flat cell phone batteries here; everything that befalls them feels realistic yet almost fated.The tension is palpable in just about every scene, helped along by a truly fantastic, immediate score.Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke are either excellent or terrible depending on the scene they're in. both of them vacillate wildly between impressive naturalistic moments and ridiculously affected overacting which at times makes some scenes inadvertently comic. I have no idea what Albert Finney was thinking - he's usually a great actor - but he's horrible here. Marisa Tomei does her usual great work and the quality of her performance is sustained throughout. What's puzzling though is why the script calls for her to be so comic. She feels at times like a character who's wandered in from a different movie. Still, the role is more complex than any of the others and she handles it brilliantly.The final act goes too far over the top and doesn't feel true to the rest of the story, which is a shame. All the other faults are minor but this one really takes the film down a notch or two.Nevertheless this remains a near-great film, and on the occasions when everything is pulling in the same direction it works astonishingly well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not your typical heist movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, there is a heist that occurs very early in this movie, but the perpetrators and victims are not what you have come to expect from other heist movies. The crime precipitates intense personal turmoil among the members of a family.For me the story stayed just this side of being over the top, but many seem to be on the other side of that divide. There are plot holes, but they did not occur to me while watching.Everyone in the cast gives a top-notch performance. To put in the effort they did indicates that they were committed to the script.Director Lumet uses a technique that I found effective and do not recall seeing in any other film. That is to play flashbacks more than once, but from different viewpoints. Often the second time a flashback is played, not only is it seen from a different viewpoint, but it also extends into new material.The score by Carter Burwell adds, but is never intrusive.If this movie catches you the right way, it will emotionally drain you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the Coen Brothers. This movie is not a Coen Brothers Movie.It could have been.It has the dark farce of the Coen Brothers -- the dark farce that spoils one for light farce. It reminded me of "A Simple Plan", too (another excellent -- and more satisfying -- movie).As in "A Simple Plan", and all of the Coen Brothers' movies, the cast is perfectly . . . cast and has all the art and craft which breathes life into the movie. You know -- such that you forget you are not seeing real people behaving as they are inclined, as their personalities lead them to behave, in situations which they created but cannot control. That is where we feel their pain and sometimes see ourselves. These characters are ambitious and hopeful, opportunistic and optimistic, but the world is always crushing them unfairly -- yet with perfect justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sidney Lumet's latter day effort should blow your mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead", the audience gets treated to a conversation between Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei). Despite their chit chat, it's so far not clear what's going on. But during the next few minutes, we learn the plot. A man carrying a gun bursts into a jewelry store. The woman running the store shoots the intruder but also gets shot.So far, this sounds pretty routine. But it turns out that what the audience has witnessed is not routine. You see, the robbery was orchestrated by Andy and his brother Hank (Ethan Hawke). Andy's drug addiction has left him in dire straits financially, while Hank has his own trouble. Hank had worried that people would recognize him if he attempted to rob the store on his own, so he had hired a fried (Brian F. O'Byrne) to do the job. They had hoped that the store's owner would be inside, but by chance it was their mother Nanette (Rosemary Harris). From here, not only does their father Charles (Albert Finney) this point on, there can be no pleasant outcomes for anyone in this splintered family of f***-ups.I would say that the movie's main strength is the acting. Every character just makes you feel like what they are: wretched, pathetic losers whose lives are crashing down and leading to irrevocable consequences. But another thing is that the movie shows that Sidney Lumet, now in his 80s, still has what it takes to be a director (what was his last movie of note?). If this is his final film, then it will be a triumph for him that his departure recalled his mid-1970s string of greats consisting of "Serpico", "Murder on the Orient Express", "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Network". Definitely one that I recommend. Also starring Aleksa Palladino, Amy Ryan and Michael Shannon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As good as anything Lumet has done in six decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet may be 84 years old but he directs with the brio of a man half his age, or indeed a quarter of his age. "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" could be the work of a young turk or of a seasoned director in his prime with 20 years experience behind him. But Lumet has been making films through six decades. You could say it shows; perhaps only someone with Lumet's years of experience behind them could have fashioned so lean and iconoclastic a film as this, an elemental jigsaw of a picture put together seamlessly by a very old sage. It's clever in a fundamental way but it isn't 'showy'. It's fastidiously and magnificently directed but you aren't aware of 'technique'. (For the first half it isn't told chronologically but that seems incidental to the film's development rather than the raison d'etre for it).It's a tragedy of epic proportions built out of a single act of folly. Two brothers, down on their luck, decide to rob the jewelery store owned by their parents. It's a victimless crime, explains the older whose idea it is; their parents are insured and no-one will get hurt. But as we know there is no such thing as a victimless crime. It goes wrong from the outset and the film becomes a family tragedy as distinct as Lumet's screen version of "Long Day's Journey into Night".Skipping back and forth in time it pictures the events through the eyes of the three dominant family members, the two brothers and their father, and in these roles Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke and Albert Finney are magnificent. Hoffman, by now, seems incapable of putting a foot wrong; he could turn out to be the greatest character actor the movies has given us. (Witness his slow, unfocused disintegration as the events of his life spiral out of control). As his younger brother, Ethan Hawkes has probably never been better. This is an edgy, volatile performance quite unlike anything I've seen him do before. As the father, Albert Finney has his best role in years and he makes the most of it. In many respects he mirrors Hoffman and they build a beautifully credible father/son relationship. Marisa Tomei, too, is quietly outstanding as the woman both brothers share. But then Lumet has always been one of, if not, the greatest of all actor's directors so we hardly expect anything less. With a wonderful script by Kelly Masterson, this is a triumph for all concerned. It's as good as anything Lumet has done in those six decades and is absolutely essential viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel bad movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie explores the essence of evil in human character. It is not the megalomaniac type of evil but rather real life common evil, that is pessimistically possible but probably doubtful, in ordinary people's hearts.The probably doubtfulness is the weakness of the movie because the actions taken by the characters were a little too far fetched and over the top.The mood is grim and dark (not interestingly or cool dark, but repulsively so). As the movie progresses and the characters spiral down towards insanity the mood gets grimmer and darker. All the characters emanate this nastiness of moral fiber, especially Hoffman. Hoffman's acting was very good. This meditation on the lowness of human beings climaxes with one of the worst acts of moral degradation.There is a quality of realism reminiscent of the gritty 70s movies, however, belief is suspended by what these people, family members if you will, do to each other. It is the feel bad movie of the year but a decent movie nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant and established Director Sidney Lumet (Serpico, The Hill, Dogday Afternoon, Failsafe and Network) produces an intriguing film about two brothers who decide to burgle their parents Jewelry store in Quiet upstate New York. The older brother Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an obese frustrated business executive with a frustrated and unfaithful wife who is having a secret affair with his younger brother Hank Anderson( Ethan Hawke). Andy has a serious cocaine addiction and Hank is just a plain unemployed bum but they both have very serious financial problems. Andy persuades Hank to carry out the robbery when the manager not the parents are in the shop. Desperate but foolish Hank contracts a seedy character Bobby to carry out the robbery without telling his brother. Everything goes wrong as their mother is the shop on the day of the robbery when Bobby arrives fully armed. The mother manages to shoot Bobby and he returns fire hitting her but she manages one last fatal shot at Bobby and they both subsequently die.The Andy and Hank's father Charles Hanson (Albert Finney) sets out to find out who murdered his wife and finds out its his own son Andy who is responsible. By this stage both Andy and Hank are in all sorts of trouble.The film ends dreadfully for the Hanson family and the build up to this depressing ending is fairly predictable and frustrating. A combination of great acting and directing fail to save this film from being a forgettable drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellence all around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminds me, strangely, of "Islands in the stream" (1977) which was adopted from Hemmingway's novel and stars George C. Scott playing the father of two sons, the older of which he loves, and the younger he loves just a little more. When the older son, understanding and not bearing any ill feelings, comments that his knows how deeply his father loves his young brother, Scott's wise and heart-warming reply is "But I have loved you longer". If the father and sons in "Before the Devil?." (Albert Finney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke) are like that, there would be no story.While the story takes place roughly during the weeks before and after a jewelry store robbery, the real story had taken place about 3 decades ago. This is a familiar story which we have seen in literature, drama and real life many times: a father playing favourite between two sons (usually, but not always, favouring the younger) sows seeds for tragedy.I tend to agree with Ebert that this movie is best left with its plot unrevealed, for the audience to enjoy through discovery. The plot is in no way convoluted. Quite on the contrary, it is straightforward. The interesting thing is the temporal mix-and-match. Some people compare it to "Memento" or "21 grams" but such a comparison is misguided. For one thing, every scene here is clearly labeled upfront - "one day before the robbery", "one week after the robbery" etc.What is really done in this movie is the trick of pulling out the middle section of a scene, and then putting it back into the movie some time later. The intention, I think, is to underscore the more important scenes, for example when the deep-rooted animosity between father and older son is revealed. We first see, through the eyes of the wife of the older son, the two men going into the back yard and sitting at a picnic table. The next thing we see is husband and wife leaving the house, getting to their car and driving away. Only some time later are we given the full scene, when we see the beginning and the end again, but also the most important middle: the explosive exchange between father and son in the backyard.Fifty years after directing "12 angry men", 83-year-old Sydney Lumet is still going strong, telling the story in a way that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The camera work is also fascinating. What I like best is a slow zooming in to Finney's face as he makes that agonizing decision "Let her go", followed immediately by the funeral scene doing the reverse, zooming away from the crowd in front of the coffin.The cast is just superb ? Finney as the father consumed in his own passion, Hoffman as the older son with an inner devil that drive him into a desperate road of no return and Hawke as the "baby" that his own pre-teen daughter calls a loser.An excellent movie all around, not to be missed.</fullReview>

It makes me wonder what price people are willing to pay to get the justice they want."Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is a powerful and yet disturbing film. It is well executed, told and acted.

It has no discernible point, except that crime doesn't pay if you're stupid. The director tries to make the story watchable by scrambling its chronology, but this is merely a gimmick. His efforts to deepen the material by adding a father-son conflict are equally unavailing. Philip Seymour Hoffman, physically gross as ever, relies a bit too much upon chuckling bonhomie; Marisa Tomei plays his upper-middle-class wife like a gangster's moll; and Ethan Hawke's acting is as shallow as his character. No one is likable, and it's impossible to care about their self-immolation. A depressing movie about scumbags who get what they deserve and deserve what they get.</fullReview>

However, being the smarter one, he comes up with a plan: rob the jewellery store their mother used to work at. All goes well, until not so bright Hank breaks two of the rules, he brings someone else along and brings someone else who takes a gun. But there's one thing neither of them reckoned on: their mother still works there and when the robbery goes wrong, she ends up getting shot and killed. With their father Charles (Albert Finney) seeking revenge, it's only a matter of time before everything builds up to end in disaster.Old school director Sidney Lumet has skillfully updated his style to more modern times with a cleverly written story with a cool, funky use of style and decent performances from his lead stars, who, while playing characters I found unlikeable, play them very well. It's weird, I was sure that both Lumet and his star Finney had died some time ago but according to their IMDb homepages, neither of their clogs have popped just yet. If they had, they could have left far worse swansongs than this.I'm not trying to be lazy here, but I really cannot think of anything more to say other than if you like smart, sharp, well written thrillers that require you to pay attention and take everything in, this is one you will like. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good, though it started to lose me as it neared the conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent addition to the crime-gone-wrong genre, directed by the 83 year old legend Sidney Lumet. Lumet's career has varied a lot, but this is certainly one of the better films he has made. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke play brothers who are both down on their luck, and in desperate need of money. They devise a supposedly fool proof plan to rob their parents' jewelry store. Unfortunately, Hawke's character is a pretty big fool, and fumbles the plan. Most of the movie takes place after the crime. The chronology is split up, showing different events from the perspectives of different characters. The split chronology gimmick has been done to death in recent years, but Lumet and screenwriter Kelly Masterson (whose first script this is, quite impressively) make it feel logical and necessary, slowly revealing the characters' differing motives. Thankfully, it's not just done to amp up the style. They don't I?árritu it. Lumet's style is more in the vein of indie film-making than the classic style. A lot of long takes, very efficient and slow. There are a couple of brilliant long takes, especially one where Hoffman enters the apartment of a skinny gay man for unknown reasons (great character, by the way, whose face is almost invisible but whose shape and body language are unforgettable). And unlike many movies, these takes aren't at all showy. They're calculated to have a specific effect, and they succeed. The acting is very good. Hoffman takes top honors. His range has grown nicely since the days of the stammering shy-guys of Boogie Nights and Happiness. Here he plays a shrewd, calculating man whose downfall is perfectly pronounced because of his character. Hawke, also playing against type, is a total nebbishy loser. At first, I thought he was overplaying it, but as the film progressed, I recognized how well he was reflecting similar people I've known. Marisa Tomei, playing Hoffman's wife and Hawke's lover, is as good as always. I would complain that Lumet is really exploiting her in the movie, though. The movie starts off with she and Hoffman vigorously screwing (who ever could have guessed that any movie would open with Philip Seymour Hoffman getting his groove on?), and she appears naked in two more scenes later on. I'm not complaining too much. Tomei is a rare actress who looks better and better with age. The brothers' father is played by Albert Finney. For a while I wasn't sure whether he was just playing a doddering old man, or he really was one. Unfortunately, his final scene reveals the truth of that matter. The fact was, I was really loving this movie for a long time. In my mind, though, Masterson's script stumbles as it arrives at its inevitably violent conclusion. The film veers into the melodramatic, almost to the point of Greek tragedy. I can't see any other way out, either, but the predictability element made me stop caring by the very end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the credits rolled a woman in front of me said "it wasn't what I expected". I swear she took the words right out of my mouth. Not sure exactly what I WAS expecting but it wasn't that.That being said; although I did not love this film, it was very well done and a good story. Without spoiling too much; it was about two brothers who are both having financial problems and pretty unhappy with their lives so the older brother (the "brains" of the operation) has an idea that they will rob a jewelry store, but the jewelry store just happens to belong to their parents. While it seems like a brilliant plan (they both know the layout of the store and where everything is)and a "victimless crime" since the store is insured; what could possibly go wrong? Of course mayhem ensues; after all what kind of complete piece of garbage would even THINK of robbing his own parents. That being said; it reminded me a lot of the movie "very bad things" in that when you do something wretched and reprehensible you then are faced with the repercussions of this one action which you then have to systematically cover up in the most unholly of ways and watch your life unravel in the process. Hope I haven't said "too much".I always love Philip Semour Hoffman. No one plays "smarmy" as well as he does. The rest of the cast was very good as well. The story was told in flashbacks and I felt this was an effective way of telling this rather disturbing tale.I think if there had to be a tagline for this movie; it would have been said best by the elderly jewler who said something like "you can never be surprised when you see how far someone will go for money". Paraphrasing aside; I think that line captures the essence of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I assume Sidney Lumet can have his pick of projects, and I assume he picked this one as a kind of last word on the human race. He gave that word to Leonardo Cimino, who plays the ancient, wizened diamond dealer who fences stolen gems from his walk-up shop on 47th Street. The world is indeed an evil place, if all you knew about it was this grim story about two sons, one a worthless deadbeat dad and the other a self-pitying heroin addict, who who try to pull off the perfect robbery and instead land themselves in the worst trouble imaginable.It's almost too horrible. The tragedy is Jacobean in its working out, as if John Webster or Thomas Middleton had come back. Lumet spits on the character's hopes at every turn, and in the end even spits on the audience's hopes. I don't know why, but there is something exhilarating about these dramas. Maybe they appeal to the sadist in all of us; maybe they confirm our most secret cynical thoughts about the damned human race; and maybe we leave the theater feeling not quite so depressed about our own troubles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old ,venerated film directors shouldn't be allowed to direct movies like "Before The Devil Knows You're Dead". Old, venerated film directors should know their place.Old, venerated film directors should see their old movies released on budget priced DVD or broadcast on television channels such Turner Classic Movies or Sky Movies Classic. If they are especially venerated, they should be happy to be invited to the Baftas or to the Oscars, be wheeled out to pick up a lifetime achievement award and be applauded by writers, directors and actors without a smidgen of the talent that they had at their peak.Old, venerated film directors shouldn't be directing one of the best films of this year or any year. They shouldn't be overseeing astonishing powerhouse acting performances by talents such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke and Albert Finney, or film Marisa Tomei in such a way that she looks sexy and totally smoking hot. They shouldn't be so still at the top of their game that they can handle a complex script, with a fractured time line, detailing the events leading up to a robbery, the robbery itself and the aftermath of the robbery. They shouldn't be able to turn what could have been a good, if straightforward crime thriller into a seriously good piece of drama about relationships, stress, secrets and family.Good job that nobody told Sidney Lumet that, isn't it?</fullReview>

Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman have chemistry together, Marisa Tomei as well seems sincere and believable, the father's expertly played by Albert Finney (really a strong character)."The Devil Knows You're Dead" has a special narrative structure, moving smartly back and forth in time and showing perspectives and characters from very different angles. We see Hawke's and Hoffmann's inability to face the disaster and things getting worse and worse. and worse. On the whole everything appears tasty and works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very hard story to watch, but powerful and engrossing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found my self not criticizing this film story as much as most, so that was a sign that it was good. Early on, I had a bit of a problem with some of the logic, or illogic shown and used in the storyline but all of it was very human, thus possible if not probable, and necessary to the story as it turned out. Out of financial desperation, one very screwed up brother convinces his more screwed up and also financially desperate brother to rob their own parent's store which results in their mother's murder, and then everything and everyone went downhill from there. That's enough of the plot as others have hashed it to death here. It was the details that made this story great.First, acting.....Philip Seymour Hoffman as brother Andy was just terrific as a barely under control, complete ass of a husband, son and brother, and Ethan Hawke was nearly as good as Hank the other brother, the champ dipstick doofus of all time. He was so consumed by stammers, tics and nutcase facial expressions throughout I thought a mental meltdown was always about a film frame away. Marisa Tomei(what a Total babe!)was at her best as the very needy and airheaded, so-hot dish of a wife to Andy. So unhappy with her husband's lack of attention(huh?), she sexually used his doofus brother Hank to eventually slam out her hands-off and totally distracted husband. Albert Finney is showing the harsh effects of advancing old age, but his great talent overcame that and he shined as brilliantly as ever as the sons' grieving and distraught father who got his so-sweet revenge in the end for his beloved wife's murder. What a brilliant cast! Bravo!Theirs was for sure a cast-in-stone dysfunctional family, but as most, they did care for each other in the strange ways of families in pain, ways that damage and hurt and are the polar opposite of what they all want to do but can never seem to do for each other. The film's flashbacks and forwards technique was well done and very effective in detailing the unfolding events as they spiraled downward, and it was easily followed. The two main issues I had with the story cannot be stated here, but they were very possible in human behavior but just so dumb even in bacteria-brain terms. This much can be told....among the biggest errors in judgment ever made in a film story has to be that Andy would ever think or trust that his emotionally destroyed, basket-case brother Hank could carry out the robbery without messing it up in the worst possible way, which he did of course. Incredibly dumb judgment, yes, but very human and made out of abject desperation, just as many catastrophic real human decisions are made.Displaying damaging human flaws in all their ugliness, shame and pain is a Sidney Lumet specialty(like Arthur Miller plays), and Lumet has always done it the best of any director. Also, that Lumet could have the energy, passion and awareness nearing his mid-eighties to make a film this powerful, with all human character deficiencies displayed in full damage mode, is a wonder to behold. He has made many great films such as Serpico and Network over many decades, and this one has to rank near the top, and right up there with the best of Arthur Miller. Bravo, once again.Readers: don't see this film if you want/need a feel-good ending as it certainly does not have one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent, but why the back &amp; forth ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess linear storytelling has gone out of style. This is one corker of a gripping crime/suspense flick, but I question the rationale behind the constant shifting back and forth in time (Day of the Robbery; 4 Days before the robbery; a week after the robbery; the afternoon of the robbery; &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c) We are seeing this more and more in movies nowadays, and I guess even the venerable Sidney Lumet is not immune to fashion. Myself, I do not see what is gained by all this; a straightforward telling of the tale, from beginning to end would have seemed to me an improvement.Having said that, the story itself - of a robbery gone horribly wrong and the devastating consequences - is fascinating and gripping. The central characters of the brothers, though repellent, are very well drawn. We watch fascinated - sort of like watching a train wreck - as the awful consequences of the robbery unwind in terrifying complexity. The acting is very good, although in my view Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a very distinctive style of acting that I'm not sure is to my taste. And in addition to the sheer crime elements, there is plenty of family drama as well.</fullReview>

The use of flashbacks was used as a tool which...(read more)h didn't really improve anything. However the acting in the movie was really good especially from Hoffman and Finney, one of whom may be nominated in the supporting actor category. A few scenes towards the end are intense, involving the two names mentioned, but it's the lack of this intensity in the beginning and middle of the film that hurts it and eliminates any chance of recovery.</fullReview>

With a predominantly blue tone and the background disappearing (overexposed and drifting into Nothingness))a nihilistic feeling of extreme hopelessness is established. The music is suitably low key and the editing just jarring enough to establish a feeling of angst. All of the actors are at their absolute best,especially Hoffman,who can convey an inner turmoil with the slightest tug of his tie or shift of his eyebrows. The opening scene is a stunner,with his sideways glance at his own performance. I was spellbound from beginning to end. I found the ending to be suitably opaque.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The previews were promising, the reviews were even more promising, and the fact that Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in it is reason enough to see a movie. Now I'm not saying the movie is not good, because it is fairly good, but given the actors, and old timer Sidney Lumet, and given the kind of script that I love, i would have expected much more. The movie bothered me from the beginning. I hated how it showed the robbery first, and then went back in time in each characters life at the moment or time before the robbery. It took away the suspense for me because we already know how it pretty much ends, and the rest was way to predictable. I will say though, the acting is very good, especially the scenes with Michael Shannon. He added some humor to pretty much a dry movie with characters that are not likable. The movie is worth seeing, but wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie very much. Although the film was not perfect, sometimes the musical score seemed out of place for the conversation, and the story that has been told many times before, seemed to meander in parts. But the movie was not boring. Far from it, the superb acting kept me completely entertained throughout the whole film. This was possible because of great directing on the part of Sidney Lumet. I don't know if I was biased on the part of the 83 year old Hollywood genius, but every actor in this film seemed completely brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman was at his best as the older brother with a chip on his shoulder, who started with nothing and worked his way up to a corner office in Manhattan, but he had human frailties and still managed to make a complete mess of his life. Ethan Hawke gave his best performance yet as the younger brother that has never learned how to grow up. Albert Finney gave a powerful performance as the over bearing father whose affections both brothers were vying for. Marisa Tomei finally put in a great acting job and was not just walking around like eye candy (Although she did look really good). And it went on and on, Rosemary Harris and Amy Ryan very good, and even Michael Shannon and Leonardo Cimino were great in small roles. All this great acting could not be a coincidence; it is a testament to how Sidney Lumet, after all these years, can still make a human crime drama.</fullReview>

Hoffman--he goes from a sweating pigish lout and loser to a terifying out of control killer. Albert Finney just almost steals the film with his acting--this is a family tragedy beyond compare, It is a sombre film with no humor to relieve one of the overwhelming sorrow felt by everyone in the family. This a story of tragic human beings and New York is not filmed in its glory, the cops are not part of the story. Marisa Tomei is just great as a sexy yet realistic character and does much with her small part. There isn't a bad actor in the film. See this film as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sydney Lumet treads on a path already well broken by the Coen Brother in their classic Fargo - crooked middle class people who commit crimes of violence against their own family to cover up their earlier crimes of deceit. However, while Fargo was cleverly plotted and darkly humorous, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is not only deadly serious, but so predictable as to be tedious. It was obvious from early on in the film that the protagonists were damned, and so each further step they take into debauchery is almost wearisome. Further, the drama was aided not one wit by the annoying use of non-chronological story telling. Mr. Lumet seems to have forgotten the basics of drama in his anxiousness to tell the world just how despicably money hungry and self-indulgent the American middle class is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, Manipulative, False, Dishonest Ending (SPOILER)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know we all hate bogus "Hollywood" happy endings, but this movie had the opposite: a contrived and very ugly and dark ending.Those of you who do not think so probably do not have children. But the scene in the hospital where Andy tells his father that he was sorry and Charles tells him it's okay and touches his head - that was plausible and real, and extremely moving and suddenly gave all the horror that had proceeded much weight ... the sorrow and pain that actually can happen in a person's life. As implausible as the rest of the movie was, carried by the great acting, his forgiving there, for the moment, was an amazing turn, and brought tears to my eyes.However, to have him then so calculatedly and coldly (putting the monitors on his own chest, etc.) KILL his own son conveyed an anger and a hatred which would have, in real life, masked all grief. And up to that time, he had been simply grief-stricken. It would be nearly impossible for a man to kill his own son, no matter what he did. I know it could happen, but the forgiving, no matter how painful, was much more real.So the ending was a lie, calculated to shock. It diminished everything, including the audience. I saw it in Berkeley, with an older sophisticated audience, and I don't think people liked it. I kept apologizing to my friends for suggesting the movie. They both agreed the ending was gratuitous and false.Avoid this movie forever. I don't care how good the acting is.(Added June 28, 2008): I see that only 13 out of 28 people have found my comment of use. I guess the production company has a bunch of paid trolls to come and down-rate honest comments from non-shill movie viewers. I have found over time that my distaste for this abomination has grown. Not only that, I was reading Andy Warhol's Diaries the other day and he made a crack about Lumet back in the eighties ... Andy could always see through no- talent bullshit (at least I agree with him nearly 100% of the time).I repeat my original comment: this movie is one of the most dishonest pieces of cr*p ever released. How the people praising this movie can overlook the fact the the father drives right in front of the Ethan Hawke character in the parking lot in front of the jewelry store and Hawke doesn't notice it is beyond me: they are demonstrating the kind of intelligence Hollywood relies upon when creating movies with plot holes/contradictions you could drive a truck through: in other words, total stupidity. And that is just the beginning of this travesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is absurdly mean and cruel. It's basically about two brothers that plan to rob their parents jewelry and the one who they paid to do the rob ended up killing their mother. Can we imagine how it feels like? I can't. It's immeasurable.The movie unfortunately runs slowly, although entertaining the spectator. The story is quite original, so I guess it deserves some good reviews. Also there are some idiocracies that we have to close our eyes to not notice; such as the fact the old woman simply SHOT the bandit, when she could just let him steal everything since their insurance would pay for everything. But no, the very smart madam decided to shot the bandit IN THE CHEST and ONLY ONCE and not even hiding behind the desk to protect herself; she stays still and waits for him to shoot her back. Isn't that absurd?The only character that didn't seem to be a murder was Hank Hanson; he was irresponsible for doing what he did, I agree, but he never meant to hurt or kill anyone. All the other family members did.But this is the deal: the family is insane and kill each other very easily. Sons kill mother, brother (tries to) kill brother, father kills son and you see just a few tears droppin. They're the most cruel and heartless people ever. And take this: apparently, everyone gets away with murder.</fullReview>

Of course, there is the fact that through their carelessness, they've gotten their own mother killed. It's the very apotheosis of a snowball rolling out of control, picking up speed. The two principle characters are outstanding. After Capote, I began to notice the work of Philip Seymour Hoffman. He has never disappointed. I only remember Ethan Hawke from his Jack London role in White Fang. He is excellent in this film as the tightly wound brother playing the neurotic foil to Hoffman's overconfident character (he is just as big a mess, but covers it up quite well). We also have Albert Finney who overacts his way through the film as the grieving father. Still, the focus is on the two young men who must face their own guilt and an unanticipated blackmailer. This film had me from beginning to end, and though there is an element of sickness to it, it works extremely well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sydney Lomet was over 80 years old when he directed this masterpiece. At this age, most people are lucky if they can menage to do their shopping by themselves and remember where they put their glasses, but the man is just a genius. The movie to me, is perfect. The story is thrilling, with a lot of surprising twists, it keeps you on the edge all throughout the movie. The dialogs were realistic and top notch, just like the acting. Philip Hoffman shows once again why he's one of the best actors of out generation, and this might've been his best acting ever (yes, even better than Capote!), he deserved an Oscar nomination for that one (AT LEAST). The film shows that underneath the calm suburban surface, there are a lot of secrets, and people have their dark sides. Hank (Ethen Hawke, who was casted perfectly as the insecure loser) might be broke, divorced from his wife, and fails to pay for his daughter's school yet he has an affair with his brother Andy's incredibly sexy wife (Marrissa Tomei - wow, she still looks amazing , and we get to see her perfect body naked quite a few times!). His big brother Andy (Hoffman) is a successful mid level executive, yet his marriage is a total mess (and he doesn't care about it), he's stealing money from his place of work and he has quite a heroin addiction. You know what the story is all about. The way the film was edited was great, and the movie would've been just as effective even if the time-line was chronological. But the way it was edited (you go back and forth all trhoughout the film) adds a lot, and to me, this might've been the best movie edited this way since Acadamy Award winning "Crash". All the supporting cast do a superior job as well, especially Alber Finny (who plays the boys' father). To me, it's a perfect movie, everything about it was flawless, a definite must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead: A Film of Considerable Appeal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With films the like of Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon under his belt, and a life spanning career now boasting 50+ films, we have only the best to assume from director Sidney Lumet. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is his latest offering, and one which boasts an excellent cast.Partly a heist film, partly a moral puzzler, largely a family drama, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead combines many elements. Told in a non-linear multi-perspective manner, it details the robbery of a jewellery store by two money hungry brothers, Andy and Hank. Things quickly develop and thicken into a far deeper plot, spiralling the characters and consequences out of hand.The shifts of perspective in the film give it an immediate edge, their significances often obscure until later in the unfolding of the plot. We meet the characters gradually, slowly building a picture of their lives and, in the case of Andy and Hank, their motives for robbery. The film's footing is firmly established by the cast, a fantastic mix of talent which interact believably and realistically as a family pushed to their limits and beyond. As well as the enticing twists of the entertaining plot, the serious issues of familial communication, morality, and responsibility are tackled. Hoffman and Hawke work well as the brothers thrust together, but Finney's patriarch steals the show with his steely determination and heartbreaking sombreness.The extraordinary plot aside, the film's strength lies in the combination of its well performed characters with each other. The end result is a film of considerable appeal, as an unpredictable thriller and as an exploration of human relationships. A hugely entertaining pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So many films have begun with the set-up of the "perfect crime", it's hardly worth trying to count or list them all. The crime that two brothers plan in this film, which includes robbing their parents' suburban jewelry store, never was and never could be perfect. But the unintended consequences of their actions are even far in advance of what you would expect.The film is anchored by a strong performance from character star Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the older brother who plans the robbery. Younger brother is played by a weaker actor, Ethan Hawke, and his wife is played by the very talented and lovely Marisa Tomei.This is a very cool little film, but I felt it was pretty predictable. It tried to, but didn't succeed in, taking us into the depth of hidden pains in a family the way a better modern noir, Sam Raimi's "Simple Plan", managed to do. It's very easy to disassociate ourselves from these characters very early on because their plan is so ridiculous, and then the fallout from the plan hardly feels like any kind of surprise. It seems like the film sets up a situation and simply follows it to rather natural and logical conclusions. But it's a high quality film with solid direction from the veteran Sidney Lumet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Slumet's moralistic thriller starts out promisingly enough, with pasty, fat Philip Seymour Hoffman pounding totally hot (and 15 years younger-looking) Marisa Tomei from behind. They talk about how great things are on vacation -- and we get a sense that they aren't so great "back home." Soon, that's where we are, watching a very intense jewelry store robbery that, it turns out, is masterminded by Hoffman's character. The older woman who ends up shooting the robber, and getting shot herself, turns out to be his mother, and the driver of the getaway car, his younger brother. Hoffman and his kid brother (Ethan Hawke) are both in deep financial trouble, and figure an easy, painless way to get out of it is to rob their parents' store. It's insured, it'll be easy, no cameras, etc etc. But it doesn't work out that way.This heads out on a good track, the performances are all solid, but somewhere along the line the structure (overlapping flashbacks) starts to betray some thinness; Tomei's character for example is crucial to the plot, but never really developed at all. Albert Finney, playing the father of the two sons, spends the movie trying to find out what happened; when he does we come to the very downbeat conclusion, which the film tries to prepare us for but ultimately, for me, fails to do convincingly. Still, it's solidly crafted for the most part and never boring.</fullReview>

She's not known for doing it but decides at over 40 is a good time to show it all off for a small time movie. I don't even remember this movie even being in theaters. The opening scene with her and Hoffman isn't a good memory; his body is totally out of shape compared to hers.Now on to the story. Hoffman plays, Andy, a suit in a high paying job with a high priced drug habit who still can't pay his bills. Ethan Hawke plays his brother Hank, a loser who can't pay child support and is sleeping with Andy's wife. Andy recruits Hank to rob their parents jewelry store. He says it's an easy score. The stones are insured, an old woman employee will be there, and they know how the store is laid out. Hank gets a friend to do the robbery while he is the driver and it goes so wrong. The friend is shot and the Hank's mom is the one at the store and suffers grave injury. The latter part of the movie shows how it all plays out between the brothers and their dad and how their sinister plot begins to unravel.The movie uses a lot of time jumps, which normally I don't like, but here I thought it worked. It didn't make the movie to confusing.FINAL VERDICT: An entertaining film about greed. I recommend it.</fullReview>

But even a seasoned CEO would have difficulty managing these crises. Throwing dice is far more unpredictable than flipping a coin; when people are involved, the list of possible outcomes becomes even longer than the long list of unforgettable Sidney Lumet films. Until now, Hawke may not have been an unforgettable actor but here perhaps had an eye toward earning billing among other Lumet All Stars like Steiger and Pacino.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best movies I've seen in this past year. A thriller full of action, suspense, mystery and drama. A film that will keep you on the edge of your seat with the increasing tension that this movie produces. The story about two brothers conspire to pull off the perfect, victimless crime. No guns, no violence, no problem. But when an accomplice ignores the rules and crosses the line, his actions trigger a series of events in which no one is left unscathed was original and interesting and with a very well developed plot. It has an all - star cast, Philip Seymour Hoffman gives us a powerful and flawless performance, the acting job of Ethan Hawke is maybe his best since Training Day, the great actor Albert Finney in its role of Charles Hanson was awesome and Marisa Tomei was so convincing and looks so great at 43 y.o. The conclusion is that this movie exceed my expectations and I highly recommended it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i give this movie an 8. i really enjoyed this movie as i watched it not knowing the full cast or storyline . So the film took me by surprise as i thought it was amazing ,really well put together (showing the story from different characters situation) .The two performances from Hoffman and hawke were superb i wouldn't be surprised if there are Oscar nominations for either or both, albert finneys small role was perfect as well . This movie was really well directed too even being in his 80 s he has made a very cool movie even to todays standards . I have read people complaining about mistakes in the story like a shop door being open when it should be locked , so they switched it off, thats just stupid and its there loss they missed the rest of a quality movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>when I saw Lumet's name as director I knew I was in for a treat. Especially with Philip Seymour Hoffman in a starring role too.wasn't disappointed and although it is a violent film, it should be made compulsory viewing for all the punks considering a career as a drug addled jewelry store heist operator.excellent ensemble 'indie' type flavor to it, very harsh and graphic but all considered, realistic in the story line. read the newspapers about women who drown their kids and then go bale waling to the media.this is a fast paced film, the time line stops, fast rewinds and resumes up to the point where the last time slice started and then fast rewinds even more, but curiously it all works.Hoffman is still batting 1,000 on my scorecard with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sidney Lumet -- Alive and Kickin' at 83!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More full of life and authenticity than the film of most younger directors in 2007, this film is NOT just another robbery movie.Every player in the film, every scene, every plot turn, is not just on target but engrossing to a degree we seldom see anymore. They say you cant teach an old dog new tricks, but old dog Sidney Lumet teaches the young coke-sniffers in Hollywood how to put a movie together without any of the cheap tricks which are the mainstay in 2007 and which ruin almost all current year films.Just one little nit-pick: With all their alleged glamorous lives, why can't filmmakers ever get the sex scenes right? In the very opening scene we have Philip Seymore Hoffman having sex with Marisa Tomei (It's OK, they're man and wife), BUT... but why is having sex such a pain-in-the-neck? So much huffing, puffing, groaning; worse than lifting weights at the gym. If I ever had the opportunity to have sex with Marisa Tomei you can bet 100 to 1 both of us had pleasure and neither one would be crying in pain. Not much of a brag, it doesn't take much; just a real man.The remaining 2 hours and 4 minutes are pure excellence; one of 2007's best films. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing so much positive about this movie I was fully expecting something great when I sat down to watch it. What I got instead was a bloated, dragging, fairly predictable film that offered very little actual quality.While the structure of the movie is interesting and it is well-edited, the story itself is simply not as engaging as it should be. The idea of two brothers holding up a store owned by their own family should provide much more entertaining drama and conflict amongst the family members than what this film provided. The conflict came more from bit characters that we meet halfway through the movie than the main characters with whom we're supposed to connect. To me this fact, coupled with an ending that you could see coming with an hour left in the film, cripples something that had great potential.Most people will sit and wait for a big payoff in the end, thinking that the methodical pacing and multiple characters introduced along the way are fixing to provide something great. In actuality, you'll be getting nothing more than a run-of-the-mill flick that fails to live up to the vast majority of others in the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of this year's BEST !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An outstanding movie, a drama, a comedy &amp; action as well as a touch to the dramatic social problems of our world are all packed in a movie. Sydney Lumet, not yet receiving an Oscar ( but nominated several times ) this time is on the edge too. I don't think they will grant him one with this movie, but actually they must. It would be much better to honor him with a movie like this rather than a lifetime appreciation award since he's been "online" since 1957.The cast is also superb, every main character just fits in and does a premium job, so you can watch the movie in a breath, guess the end, but never actually be sure.Philip Seymour Hoffman is at his best, so is his father Albert Finney. Ethan Hawke is totally in a different role which will break hearts of many girls, Marisa Tomei is a brave one on some scenes too.A clever story always takes a credit if it is somehow different than the classic scenarios, and works fine in everybody's mind.My last words will be about the reality the movie presents. It is dramatic, but yes, in the 21st century, people are totally addicted to money and nothing else in the so called "developed world countries". People are unhappy, are all in a struggle and doesn't even live a moment of their lives in taste. Will this be over ? Watch it &amp; you'll see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw it! After weeks or months of prodding from friends, I caught this at a 4th-run theater for three bucks. And while I don't think it's the best movie of the year like some others do, I was very impressed with this movie. It's about two brothers who are in dire need of money who plot to rob a jewelry store, but don't expect a heist movie. We aren't here to see the crime, we're here to see why the crime is being committed, how horribly it is executed, and how its aftermath affects all those involved. This is what any character-based crime story tries to do, but mostly fails at. Sidney Lumet's expertise as a director helps this one out a lot, as do fearless performances from the entire cast and an incredible script by newcomer Kelly Masterson.The story is told in a back-and-forth style, so that we can see the jewelry store being robbed before we know who is robbing it. Many scenes overlap as we see key moments from different characters' perspectives again and again. This isn't gimmicky like it is in Memento or Pulp Fiction (both great movies, don't get me wrong, but they are gimmicky). Every time we see another point of view of an event or a conversation, it's like wiping fog off the windshield and everything becomes clearer. Without this peculiar structure, the movie would feel too generic. A good story still, but not as well told. If told in a linear fashion, it would be too easy to take sides against certain characters. What Masterson has done by giving each character large chunks of the movie is allow us to live in their shoes for a few moments. Who needs the money more, for instance - the one in an unhappy marriage and a drug problem (Philip Seymour Hoffman) or the divorced one who needs to pay child support (Hawke)? Presented like that, you could easily say the child support guy can justify his actions, and I could easily agree with you. But after seeing the other one's predicament, I can't say his actions are unjustifiable. There are three main characters in this movie - the other is the owner of the jewelry store - and all three of them are heroes in their own minds. And all three do evil things.I don't want to tell you too much about the details because any spoilers could lessen the impact of the drama, and therefore the entertainment. So don't look up a plot synopsis or even a two line description.

		<fullReview>Quasi-thrilling black caper film manages to provide enough depth, articulation, and powerful acting to stand out as one of the year's stronger movies but does suffer a few missteps which keep it from becoming one of 2007's best. People are right to be praising a some-kind-of-return to form for Sidney Lumet, but the director's old age is starting to show. Beginning with the shamelessly exploitive opening scene, Lumet and screenwriter Kelly Masterson immediately start associating excess for edginess, at times not being able to back up some of the "shock" with substantial characterizations.Nevertheless as viewers continue down this unnecessarily out-of-order robbery mishap, it remains mighty hard not to get wrapped up in these two brother's mostly riveting chemistry. Philip Seymour Hoffman pretty much accounts for quality work simply by showing up, while Ethan Hawke clearly became inspired working around Hoffman and displays some of his most perceptive acting yet. As for Marisa Tomei's constant eye-candy superficiality: what could have been another fascinating angle in the story merely feels stuck in for sex appeal in an underdeveloped role. Flaws and all, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is still a tightly wound robbery flick with commanding performances and occasional excellent direction, which clearly makes the sum of it's parts add up to something special.</fullReview>

The performances were so subtle and layered and brilliant and you just get sucked in. The camera work and director stuff was so edgy and incredible, I didn't know it had been directed by Lumet until the end. It inspired me, I'll tell you, to know that at 83 this man still has every ounce of creative vision that he must have had at 33. Just awe inspiring. The script is so good that you don;t notice it. You don't notice that what the people on screen are saying was written. Just wonderful film-making. Dammit. this always happens to me, I have to have ten lines of text and I never do.

		<shortDescription>It's a devilish boring film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was drawn to watch this movie because of the somewhat amusing title and I noted it was a film by Sidney Lumet. Will I never learn? I have always said that you can't judge a book by its cover and you can put movie titles into the same category. I was hoping for a gripping thriller. No such luck. While I can't fault the acting, the characters they played were rather boring and I found it quite an effort to stay awake. I would have appreciated some sub-titles as my hearing is not the best, but if I understood every word, it would still not be a major film for me. I cannot understand why any reviewer would give this film 10/10. That indicates a perfect score; and in no way is this film a piece of perfect entertainment. I liked the robbery in the jeweller's shop. It was tense and believable. The best part of a very ordinary film. The double shoot out was great. Pity the film did not end there. Sorry Mr. Lumet, but that's how it is with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The quick and dirty version of whether or not you should spend your time with this movie... I don't include spoilers, so this is limited to what you could get from a preview. Firstly, any POV (point of view) movie needs to be damn good in my opinion to keep you interested. Basic fact: movies like this show the SAME thing over and over again, just from a different perspective - how exciting is that? Granted, the cast was good, but does that make for a good plot? A suspenseful storyline? Clearly not. I'd describe this as somewhat dark, even morose. Going off the average of around 7.4, I was expecting a drama with human interest mixed with a crime/drama motif, and all I got out of it was the anticipation of something happening without the payoff. Amusing? somewhat. Worth the time? Not so much.</fullReview>

This is truly a brilliant film in every respect. The taut story-telling is enhanced by brilliant acting. This Greek tragedy, albeit of the Loman style advocated by Arthur Miller rather than the high Aristotelian, absorbs us and in the end offers catharsis. Whereas "Blood" was on the whole laughable in its pretentiousness and logically deficient, this film proceeds in stately fashion to a conclusion satisfactory to the audience. The two hours traffic of the film moves effortlessly and we feel no guilt as the horror passes before our eyes.</fullReview>

It is entertaining to watch this film to see what happens next but then you are left wondering why they bothered with such a linear tale- so linear they had to play memento with the editing to give it some semblance of a plot twist that you didn't see coming from three thousand miles away.I can't recommend this movie, it is just bearable and that's it- no great plot twists or anything much to speak of- just enough to keep your attention till the next scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting --- BUT---To ridiculous and unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was for me one of the slowest, ponderous,ridiculous,convoluted,badly photographed,badly designed major films in recent memory. There were far too many things within the screenplay that removed me from the reality that this film so strived for. First off the opening scene alone almost made me puke.As much as I admire Philip Seymour Hoffman as an actor, to have to be submitted to watching his flabby,fat,pink flesh,pounding,sodomizing his wife,in one long static shot,hearing his fat flesh banging Marisa Tomei's ass should have been enough to send me running for the exit. Being with friends I stayed.What was with the gay drug dealer, with an open safe in his closet? Unbelievable to say the least.Also from the look of his flat this was a upper class apartment building with a Door Man and probably surveillance cameras, but that did not stop the brothers from murdering and robbing. Ethan Hawke was terrific here,the bestperformance I have seen from him, but as he goes through hell cleaning any prints left from the rented car, we then see him return the car, opening the door and closing the door with his bare hands,leaving prints. Wardrobe: Tomei's character wears a black cocktail dress to her mother in laws funeral with a plunging neckline, tits, beautiful tits, far too exposed. As an actress she should have known better or perhaps it was her demands wanting to look sexy.When Albert Finney tries to leave a lower east side street after a murder has been reported he drives off coming head on with the police.He then backs up to find the police behind him.I would think any police would find these actions very suspicious to say the least. Also his crashing his car into a Police Vehicle outside the station would also cause some alarm within the station only a few feet away from the sound of the crash. Now forthe biggest plot flaw of all. For any audience to believe that Andy would leave his business card with this crooked diamond dealer really needs to question their personal logic. There are so many more stupid things happening in this film, far too many to consider this film anyhing near great.</fullReview>

It could have been a good movie if not for all of the repeating. Do yourself a favor and go rent fried green tomatoes or some other lame flick. It will cost less and is just as boring.

		<shortDescription>The best of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2007 was a great year for film, and it's damn shame that one of the finest movies of the year has already been forgotten (not a Golden Globe nomination, and the Oscars don't look generous). Before the Devil Knows Your Dead was the only true edge of your seat film I saw this year (I usually avoid that cliché, but that's how I sat for the last third). You don't know where the story is going to go because it can go anywhere. Any type of summary of the story cannot prepare you for Lumet's best work since Network, because discussing the plot makes it sound like a comedy or farce. And it's not. Oh god, is it not. Any good thriller has a body count, but the best ones rack up characters you would not expect to see in the morgue. Lumet keeps it simple. No grandiose musical score, no crazy over the top messages or subplots. Just cold, hard, unrelenting, mesmerizing narrative. Hoffman and Hawke give some of their best performances (and yes, I'm well aware of Hoffman's resume), as does Finney and Tomei. The script is great, the directing on-point, and maybe only because I didn't have the highest expectations for it that it completely blew me away (the opposite happened to me when I saw There Will Be Blood).Best of 2007, but certainly not by a long shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet's Grim "Devil" is one of 2007's Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there anyone under the age of 80 that can make an American film as well as Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows Your Dead? Lumet puts the A list directors on notice that he can still show them a thing or two with this powerfully presented story about a dysfunctional family in which things get terribly out of hand when brothers decide to rob the family jewelery store. Told in a suspenseful juggled narrative, relentlessly replaying events leading up the to the heist and the aftermath, it keeps you off balance throughout. As he has for decades, actor's director Lumet gets excellent performances from all his leads. Philip Seymour Hoffman is once again nothing short of astounding. Every bit as intense as the performance he gave in Capote, he is a homicidal, drug addicted, impotent, embezzling, lumpen slob of a failure. His wife is also sleeping with his brother. Hoffman is both fascinating and uncomfortable to watch. The unctuous realism he brings to the character is a tragic and unsympathetic study of a man spiraling out of control in the worst way. Ethan Hawke nearly matches Hoffman as the cornered desperate younger brother. Another failure, his reaction to the botched robbery is entirely different but every bit as intense in response. Old pro Finney as the cold unaffectionate father left to mourn and get answers on his own displays an old codger feistiness determined to resolve matters. Maris Tomei is solid in every way as the scheming wife. Lumet directs with an uncompromising hard edge, something sadly missing in this era of the ultra cool indestructible bad guys with redeemable qualities. There is an ugly grittiness to the whole affair that expands as the film progresses and he refuses to let up. With an incredible cast he shows the young Turks (try 60 and under) in the business that the old formula of telling a story through character and avoiding the hackneyed pitfalls of so many other cookie cutter crime gone bad scenarios makes for an unrelenting and absorbing story of a man and his family's deconstruction. It is a cold, brilliant film made with a modest budget that puts larger budgeted, slicker and pretentious films ( In 2007,American Gangster and No Country for Old Men come to mind. ) to shame. It may not be a prettier movie than the glossy surface pap moviegoers are being fed today and that's much to the film's credit. With Devil, Lumet shows he can still make them like he used to. Too bad no one else can.</fullReview>

After a few minutes you're shocked by a terrible revelation and you feel there's no escape to the unhappy ending; an American drama whose story is shaped on ancient Greek tragedies, especially Sophocles' works in my humble opinion.

The acting is great of course, I don't think Hoffman can produce a bad performance, but the violence gets ridiculous and most of it feels like an ultra melodrama with the same craft of bad melodrama. Don't believe the hype! The opening is fine. There is nothing wrong with seeing the beautiful Tomei naked and when she is naked some more it brought some interest.

All four of us came to the same conclusion even though we highly differ when it comes to liking or disliking a film.

No plausible or believable motivations are given for any of the character's actions, scenes are superfluously stretched adding exactly nothing to nought and the 'Pulp Fiction-style' flashbacks with bits being repeated made it painfully obvious that no original thought was ever meant to be put into this astonishingly tired effort at 'clever' film-making. Ebert put this twaddle fourth! on his top10 list of 2007. It must have been a really, really miserable cinematic year (but then again, it truly was..).Only recommended for the repeated showing of Marisa Tomei's incredibly handsome fanny, the most Oscar-worthy display of a rear-end since Portman's lapdance in 'Closer'.Please gentlemen, try a tad harder or don't bother at all...3/10</fullReview>

Philip Seymour Hoffman is 'Andy', an overextended payroll executive who lures his younger brother, 'Hank' (Ethan Hawke), into a larcenous scheme: the pair will rob a suburban mom-and-pop jewelry store that appears to be the quintessential easy target. The problem is, the store owners are Andy and Hank's real mom and pop, and when the seemingly perfect crime goes awry, the damage sends them hurtling toward a shattering climax," according to the DVD sleeve description.Didn't like the opening shtupping (not for the content, but for the placement) and, originally wasn't sure about leaving so many main characters in literal or figurative Hell - but, the ending works well in a very satisfying second viewing; and, that is, after all, where these characters are running. The non-linear, out-of-sequence storytelling is seamless rather than slapdash. The story is shot in stylish high def, and told with plentiful flashbacks and alternating points of view. Herein is a lesson on one way to do this well. Everything unravels in ways to make the story tremendously exciting.Hoffman and Hawke do not seem at all like brothers, which is acknowledged in a scene where father Albert Finney (as Charles Hanson) is asked, "You sure I'm your son?" My guess is that Hawke's 'Henry' is the one with the different dad, though. Hoffman's "Andrew" is the apple falling closest to the dysfunctional family tree. Marisa Tomei (as Gina) is as sexy as they come. The supporting cast is superb. First time scripter Kelly Masterson ranks high. And, Mr. Lumet puts another jewel in his crown; every up-and-coming actor is hoping Lumet has another 50 years in him.********* Before the Devil Knows You're Dead (9/6/07) Sidney Lumet ~ Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney, Marisa Tomei</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Several things can, and have been praised about this film, on different levels. Some are competent, others rather interesting, and another one absolutely remarkable.Here we find a top director at the top of his game in what concerns exploiting actors. He pushes where he knows he can and should push, and he reaches peaks of useful intensity that few other directors are able to reach. Hoffman is a natural choice for the kind of work Lumet does. He is one of the most focused and self-conscious actors these days, and what he does here is as coherent as it is punctuated by eternal moments. One of those moments (the hysterical breakdown in the car, with Tomei) is absolutely on both actors hands, and Lumet only had basically the more expressive moments of each actor. But another scene is a beautiful collaboration between Lumet and Hoffman: the monologue at the drug dealer's home. There we had a transcending actor, and the director of '12 angry men': centered on characters, yet spatial. It is that space awareness that, to me, makes me go to Lumet's films. There is not one single inner set where space isn't taken care of, whether we have camera movement or not. Notice, it is the character, and not the space, that determines the movement, the pace, the ton. But the space is fully exploited to serve it. I think we have that in some moments with Antonioni, but no one does it so consistently as Lumet has done it through all his career.For more than once, i remarked on how i don't like Ethan Hawke. His interview on the making of of this film underlines the reasons why i don't like him. But i admit he fits well in the melodramatic tapestry Lumet created here. Again, like in 'Great Expectations', he is as clueless about anything as his character, but here he understands the pace. I suppose Lumet is to be reckoned for that as well.The other point that interests is how the narrative is shaped. What we have here comes in the line of what I?arritu/Arriaga have done, eventually some Figgis' work. It doesn't advance in anyway anything of what they have done, but it is pretty impressive how Lumet acknowledged the storytelling evolution and merged his cinematic talent with it. What evolution is that? Basically, it is the consideration of a complex world in which we don't follow a single line, instead several of them, which intersect, each one with the potential power to affect all the others. It's a matter of considering the harmony of 3 different melodies juxtaposed, instead of just following one of them. That's what cinema has been doing.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately for me I didn't read the ratings warnings. I knew there would be graphic violence but you see that in cereal commercials these days. The graphic sex was totally gratuitous, however and ruined what should have been a much higher rated movie (for me). Plenty of wonderful acting, suspense, plot twists and nuance. Great writing &amp; directing grabs you from the start though the start for me was about 20 minutes in because of all the needless sex scenes up front. That tarnished an otherwise golden experience. So if you TIVO it, d/l it from Netflix or watch the DVD be prepared to fast forward a lot if the nasty stuff bothers you as it does me. Other than that a riveting &amp; thoughtful (though cheapened) film that will have you wondering &amp; speculating for a long while afterward, hopefully with someone you love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know what? I'm tired of giving movies the "it's so well made" escape clause. Regardless of how well made this film is, it is also a pretty substandard example of story telling. The implausibilities are substantial (the "harrowing" final scene slipped into comedy for me) and the characters are largely unexplored. From this you have to conclude that the point of the exercise was to produce something grim. Well they've certainly done that, it's pointlessly grim alright. The audience goes away with nothing but some loose ends to ponder. In this way it is like too many films that simply want to dazzle audiences with technique while contriving to send them home miserable, as if that's what a 'good' movie should do. This film ? and all films like it - are lazy and empty pieces of story telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hideous story with an equally hideous ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What was the point of this film? It began with a lengthy and gratuitous sex scene which was irrelevant to the rest of the story. We were then led into a story of such cruelty, that only a few minutes passed before everything about this bizarre and twisted story came into question, especially why I was watching it. The robbery scene was beyond credibility. When a person falls against an unlocked glass door, the door will be pushed open, and the glass will not shatter. Later, an extortionist is killed because he knew the identity of his victims, but his wife is spared for an unknown reason. After the murder, the character played by Ethan Hawke suddenly has remorse, and leaves the extortion money with the spared wife. In the end, the father figure (played by Albert Finney) goes to a hospital to see his mortally wounded son, who confesses the story. The father says "It's OK.", and then murders his son. I am sure that someone thought this story was worth watching, but I found it disgusting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feelings of Violation and Anger: All A Part of the Movie Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stupid choices lead to disaster. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is like a Greek tragedy in its relentlessly depressing sadness. It's a chain of terrible, world-shattering events started by one successful enough man's discontent and sorrow for his own life to a point of directionless, reckless motivations. There is not one point in this film where one can say any character is truly content or humor thins the film's brutalization, and there doesn't have to be. A story is a story and if it works, it works.Sidney Lumet made the decision to shoot this film on high-definition video, and it really looks quite good. Many scenes of harrowing sadness are given a very slice-of-life, afterglow-lit complexion. There are a few shots that begin to loosen the seams of the film's successfully gritty look, but mainly, Ron Fortunado's natural long shots, the unassuming familiarity of the images, and the brooding feelings of self-destruction and heart-rending mournfulness portrayed in many dim shots create a grim, more realistic version of what Blue Velvet achieved on a more eccentric level. The film is about a family that lives in nice homes, there are suburban strip malls, an old couple's optometry appointments and jewelry store business, vacations, and their children's activities. But these materialistic settings and occupations, shown through a more nominal, less elegant lens as a direct exposure to these everyday pros in American life, mean nothing but a peaceful, run-of-the-mill disposition for a family of cold-hearted, selfish, and dubious people.Carter Burwell's score is a subtle identification of this. It's a calm clique of strings playing the music of a dramatic thriller with a foreboding doom that one can only sense through it. Burwell, like Howard Shore, is wonderful at creating a completely elusive but powerfully emotional musical adapter in films. Burwell is subtler however, in that you can never hear the powerful emotion in his music. You can only sense it.Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of the most intense actors in American film right now. He can always, even in funnier roles, obscurely bleed a despondent grieving that deepens the unpredictability or audience expectations of his characters. This film is a reminding showcase of how important he is as an actor. He looks like someone you know, he taps into the less glamorous aspects of people that are harder to deal with, and he is always completely becoming. He's fascinating and here, he plays a defensive, secretive, destructively persuasive, emotionally disassembled, and angry man gone horribly wrong.Playing his less capable brother is Ethan Hawke, whom I have never been as thrilled by. Though I would rather see someone else in his role, I found him emitting the right affectations, and he was likable enough, to whatever minimal extent one of these characters can be at all likable.Albert Finney takes on a very gray part as their father, getting very old and getting slower and resenting it, another inherent, under-the-radar emotion that scrambles the outcome of the story. He's always riveting, and so is Marisa Tomei though once again, I found her talent to be wasted as a stock wife who submits to the background of each character's life. She has an inextricable bearing on the plot, but a demanding performance more to her caliber it isn't. However, I will say she has an insatiable body, as always, and is not complying with her age.This film, yes, is a hard hitter, and or but not for very many people. In a way, that's something I like about it. But I believe the majority of filmgoers will ask a perfectly justifiable question upon seeing it, which is "Why put us through all this?" It's a depressing, twisted story of evil, betrayal, the harrowing destruction of family at the center of which is murder, and exploitation of people's weaknesses. There is no clear, tangible message waiting at the end of it all. Viewers may feel looted and ravished rather than satisfied, and only a few will recognize these feelings of violation and anger as all a part of the stimulation of a potent movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 2007, deserved more recognition from the Academy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Oscar season and every year there are a few incredible movies that are snubbed. Zodiac is still my number one pick but right after that comes this incredible film. Phillip Seymour Hoffman delivers a tour de force performance, one of his best ever and that's saying something. Atonement and Juno get a best pic nomination but this doesn't? Very strange, but not untypical for the Academy to pick a diverse group of films (genre), instead of simply the best pictures (however alike they may be.) Only a few movies a year get a 10 from me, and this fully deserves it. The movie starts with an opening reminiscent of one of the scenes of Reservoir Dogs (or any other heist movie for that matter) but the story takes very unconventional turns and therefore the scriptwriter deserves a lot of praise. Never does he fall back on clichés, and he doesn't take the easy way out at the end either. No Hollywood-ending here, but a brutally honest one.Sydney Lumet is the ultimate proof that a truly talented and driven director can make top notch movies for decades, and still be able to reinvent, to innovate and to surprise his audience with a courageous script. Lumet may be a hit and miss kind of director, but when he hits one out of the park it's really something.Easily one of the 10 best movies of 2007, a can't miss for any self-respecting movie buff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that grabs your attention from the very first second. Following a rather explicit opening scene (you'll see) we witness the attempted jewellery-store robbery around which the film is centred. Throughout the two-hour running time the action cuts back and forth in time to paint in events that occur before and after the robbery, which has gone horribly awry. Although one might expect the film to stagnate in the middle section, the unusual structure actually works very well as there is something very compelling about piecing together the grim narrative for yourself. The non-chronological sequencing of events means that new details are always being added or revised.The scene of the robbery which opens the film is astonishingly tense and unravels in a shocking way. Despite the film cutting abruptly back and forth in time to paint in new details the plot does not become blurred and confused. The fortunes of the two brothers, played with great intensity by Hoffman and Hawke, grow ever darker as the film unfolds. Many of the best sections of the film feature both Hoffman and Hawke bantering, plotting, arguing, panicking. The final scenes shared between the two as their lives fall apart are simply explosive. There are some other fine performances in this film, notably involving the father played by Albert Finney, whose wrecked relationship with Andy (the elder son played by Hoffman) is a compelling strand in the plot line. On the other hand, the portrayal of Andy's wife, Gina, is ridiculously one-dimensional. This seems unfortunate in that there are no other female characters afforded the same prominence.This is, however, a minor quibble and does not significantly detract from the appeal of the grimly powerful story, which is frequented by the stirring theme tune and, fittingly, a great deal of lower-register piano notes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complex, but sure to satisfy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead is a crime thriller directed by cinema legend Sidney Lumet. On a basic level, it describes something that we can all relate with: making a stupid decision. The brilliance is that Lumet is able to extract every single nuance to make it a complex picture. The decision in detail is made by Andy Hanson, a strong financial executive of a large company. He desperately needs money, so he hires his brother Hank to rob a jewelry store. But its not just any store; their parents own it. After the robbery, things get out of hand, leading to a crisis in the family. I am purposefully not revealing too much of the plot, but will mention that it definitely satisfies.The style reminded me a lot of Memento, even though the movies themselves are completely different. Both movies are experimental and end up working great. The events are seen from the viewpoints of the three major characters: Andy, Hank, and their father Charles. The segments often overlap in time, adding a neat touch to the pace. The views converge into the conclusion, which is enormously suspenseful.The acting is fine. The definite standouts are Philip Seymour Hoffman as Andy and Ethan Hawke as Hank. The rest of the cast ranges from strictly believable to respectable. The characters themselves are excellently crafted, with each one having a unique personality. Andy is the older brother, thus very capable of making decisions but at the same time being a bully. Hank, on the other hand, is a nervous little brother that depends on others to exist (as is revealed early by his hiring a companion for the robbery). The two brothers vastly different physical appearance helps add to this.An excellent music score tops off this beautiful creation. The rest of the film has its share of problems, but none are significant enough for me to mention in detail. Certainly one of the better movies of the 2007, not one to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of us make money off of that. Others get destroyed." One of the great lines in a great script that kind of sums the whole story up. So well directed, so well acted, so well written, but so unrelentingly grim. Lumet is known for a being a master of very human dramas, but I didn't expect the film to be so incredibly depressing. The cast, the title and the poster led me to believe the film would have a humorous edge to it like "Dog Day Afternoon" perhaps. Was I ever wrong. I admire everyone in the cast. Truth is, I have only seen one Sydney Lumet film that I did not feel was excellent (Family Business kind of stunk). I never saw the Wiz though. I consider Q&amp;A his most underrated film. Lumet is a master at bringing out the best in his actors. The film he did with Vin Diesel is an excellent case in point. He uses a couple weird edit sequences that I felt were not consistent with the character of the rest of the film but otherwise he gets incredible work out of all the actors in the film. This is Ethan Hawke's best role. Hoffman continues to blow me away with his acting chops. All this being said, I would not recommend this film to most of my friends, just to hardcore cinephiles. I just found it too disturbing. The only thing that brought a smile to my face in the entire film was seeing Marisa Tomei's incredible body.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrific casting and ridiculously good acting befitting this insanely twisted story about a heist gone wrong.I watched this as a die-hard Ethan Hawke fan and despite playing such a weak and hateful character in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, I still love him to pieces. He plays Hank, the lovably puppyish but emasculated younger brother of Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman), whom Andy dupes into robbing their own parents' jewelry store. Things don't go as planned, situations spiral out of control and family relationship issues--between the brothers, their father (Albert Finney) and Andy's wife (Marisa Tomei)--that were never addressed threaten everyone's sanity and survival.At 84, director Sidney Lumet still brings out the best in his actors! He affords the audience omniscience in a guilty voyeuristic fashion yet you cannot take your eyes off the screen. Hoffman and Hawke transmit the tension, and Finney imparts his grief and frustration to the audience well.Great story by debuting screenwriter Kelly Masterson, though I found the editing style transitions between the different characters' points of view retelling the story jarring in each segue. Yet, I like how it's retold in a slightly different angle. Also, the relevance of Marisa Tomei's many naked scenes were questionable (KJ, I know, but seriously unnecessary to the plot!). Her muted confrontation scene with Andy felt fake and could've used better editing. The ending also leaves you hanging, and as each character digs themselves into a deeper pit, you can't help but wonder how much you could take if you were in their shoes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet can still cut it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With an air of a grown up 'Reservoir Dogs' about it 'Before the Devil knows you're Dead' tells the story of two brothers who for different reasons need cash fast. Together they hatch a plot that should sort them out financially with no consequences and it is here this morality tale begins. At 84 director Sidney Lumet proves here that he can still cut it with the youngsters as he weaves the three main stories of the two brothers and their father backwards and forwards from start to chilling climax. The way the story unfolds is like going the wrong way up a helter skelter and it constantly keeps you on edge as you wonder how far this will go. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is exceptional as usual as older brother Andy and with three films all out at the same time (this, The Savages and Charlie Wilson's War) proves once again that he can turn in a brilliant performance and create a believable character. Support comes from Hawke as younger brother Hank and Finney as their father Charles and both are great and add to the tension. The music is a little weird at times but it strangely fits as does the bizarre camera flicks that join the scenes. With so many good films out or coming out at the moment it would be easy to let this film pass you by but if you do you will be missing an excellent thriller that doesn't fail to deliver on all levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sympathy for the Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept is as old as cinema itself: characters who are down on their luck, in the doldrums of financial desperation, seize upon an opportunity that sounds like the answer to their problems, only to be met with complications once the heist is carried out. In the '90s, films like "Reservoir Dogs" (1992), "Fargo" (1996), and "A Simple Plan" (1998) evolved the themes of greed, loyalty, and betrayal that are synthesized into a shattering whole in Sidney Lumet's "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead," a fascinating and thoroughly disturbing meditation that uses a jewel heist as a catalyst for deconstructing the dynamic of one damaged family.While much has been made of Lumet's mastery of craft lately, I can't say I've seen many of his films; but I can say that "Devil" captures the layered, character-driven complexities that made "12 Angry Men"?despite its single confined setting?such a gripping drama. In a manner that almost mimics postmodern westerns (the recent remake of "3:10 to Yuma" comes to mind), scripter Kelly Masterson uses the heist itself to set up a fascinating character study. And while the heist is indeed pivotal to the plot, we are shown that the events leading up to?and following?are just as devastating and important.And the characters are some of the most convincing and compelling I've seen in a while: Andy Hanson (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the elder brother who has fallen on some hard times in real estate (including an impending tax audit), wants to give his wife, Gina (Marisa Tomei), the financial escape he thinks they both deserve; one fateful day, Andy coaxes his brother Hank (Ethan Hawke)?an even more downtrodden figure dealt disrespect from every conceivable angle?into knocking off a jewelry store. The catch? The proprietors of the store are the boys' parents (played by Rosemary Harris and Albert Finney). Hank, being an emasculated and panicked wreck, chokes and convinces a scumbag ex-con (Brian F. O'Byrne?"Bug") into playing the stickup man, a move that is met with disastrous result.Structurally, "Devil" operates in the kind of willfully nonlinear style that Tarantino popularized with "Pulp Fiction" (1994), and has since been used and overused by filmmakers looking to enliven otherwise conventional projects ("Babel," anyone?). It speaks well for Lumet's controlled direction that the crisscrossing aspects of Masterson's script don't come off as mere sly gimmickry, and instead operate as missing pieces of a puzzle kept hidden until the moment their impact will be most felt; that's not to say some of the mixed-up chronology doesn't become repetitive, but for the most part, "Devil" flows with fluid confidence.Another aspect that separates "Devil" from the '90s school of heist thrillers is its sense of intimacy?while Tarantino and the Coen brothers frequently distance themselves from characters, thus allowing an ironic humor to bubble, "Devil" is a straight-faced effort that pries?with invasive dread?into the minds of its characters, spinning what could have been a typical tale of destructive greed into a family affair (indeed, even suggesting that the seeds were planted long before the heist ever occurred). And the performances of Hoffman and Hawke are dead on?affecting independent breakdowns that eventually coalesce into one unified entanglement of which there is no easy exit; Finney is effective in the quieter role of Charles, the father who never loses his drive to bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice, no matter what horrible truths it might dredge up. In the end, the notion of redemption has long been soiled by implication and guilt by association.I know it's been said a lot by now, but "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is one of the best films of 2007, and certainly one of the most interesting spins on "crime drama" I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The world is an evil place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's 45th film, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, is a psychological crime thriller that contains some of the best work by Philip Seymour Hoffman and superior performances by Albert Finney, Ethan Hawke, and Rosemary Harris. Unlike Lumet's earlier works of towering humanism, however, his latest film, even if expertly done, is an exercise in thoughtless nihilism that does little if anything to illuminate the human condition. The film takes its title from an old Irish toast, "May you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows you're dead" and shows mankind at its most unenlightened ? scheming, petty, greedy, and without conscience.Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a drug-addicted payroll manager for a New York real estate company who is stealing from his company to pay for his dependency on heroin. He confesses to his opulently dressed pusher, "My life doesn't add up. I'm not the sum of my parts. All my parts don't add up to one me." If Andy is shown enjoying sex in Rio with his wife Gina (Marisa Tomei), it is perhaps the only thing in his life that provides pleasure. In financial trouble, he persuades his brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) to join him in a plan to rob their parent's (Albert Finney and Rosemary Harris) jewelry store. Like many today who have no acquaintance with values other than the accumulation of material possessions, their financial position in life defines who they are.Hank, three months behind on support payments, is reluctant at first to commit but is persuaded by older brother telling him that no one would be hurt and that the insurance would cover his parent's losses. "It's a victimless crime, if your (expletive) little conscience bothers you," he tells Andy assigning conscience to the same scrap heap as a bad character trait that must be overcome. Unwilling and probably unable to commit the crime himself, Hank enlists a petty criminal, his friend Bobby (Brian F. O'Byrne), to commit the robbery. Whatever could go wrong, however, does go wrong, and big brother Andy has to try and pick up the pieces.While much of the film is played out in flashback, we do not learn much about the brothers and their motivations other than the stock explanation that they come from a dysfunctional family with resentment in the bucketful against mom and dad and bitterness against brother Hank for dallying with his wife. The film is perfectly carried out but never rises above the limitation of its characters and shows us no opening to a better place. Its clinical dissection of a family headed for disaster can be riveting but ultimately, leaves us in despair. We know that "The world is an evil place. Some people make money from it, some people are destroyed by it." But do we need to have filmmakers rub our noses in it once again?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best movie Sidney Lumet has directed in 20 years, bar none ("The Verdict" predates this period). Second, some actors, regardless of alleged structural flaws in the film at large, provide such rich performances that any flaws in the film become secondary. Phillip Seymour Hoffman provides just such a performance. Not just during some moments of the film, but all of them. It is far more nuanced and complex than anything he has done previously, and towers over his work in"Capote". Further, and contrary to the above reviewer's sentiments, (ah, the plight of the film student) the film does not suffer from a lack of information, and is in no need of a linear narrative. Indeed, a linear format would have lent much less suspense to the film, and arguably would have made the film far more pedestrian. True psychological drama leaves the most profound aspects of one's past to the imagination of the viewer (and why that must be the case--as opposed to a romantic film--is beyond the scope of this commentary). Thus, there was nothing "cute" about using flashbacks. Unless one wanted to do the film from a narrative that utilized multiple view points--which would have made the film even more ponderous than a linear narrative-this was the best structural avenue one could have taken. Given that the characters paint the picture of the past through the present, there was no need whatsoever to have further explanation about how the father conducted himself as a father. After all, in the end, does it matter? What is clear is that the oldest son experienced (italics) a lack of love and familial subordination of his needs to his brother. This was allegedly engendered by the parents. That perspective forged the son's self-hatred and ultimately, provides the viewer with all the explanation that is needed as to his own motivations. We don't have to have it spoon fed--do we? In sum: SEE THIS FILM</fullReview>

So do your good deeds today because you do not want to head that downward spiral as the main protagonist of legendary Director Sidney Lumet's masterful melodrama "Before The Devil Knows You're Dead". The astounding Phillip Seymour Hoffman stars as Andy, a manipulative &amp; egoistic bookkeeper who bullies his younger brother Hank into committing a jewelry store robbery. The underrated Ethan Hawke co-stars as Hank whose unassertive demeanor has caused him a divorce with a demanding ex-wife and being labeled as a "wussy" by his family. Hank also is a father to a pre-teenage daughter. Albert Finney co-stars as Charles, father to Andy &amp; Hank, who suffers a catastrophic tragedy which I will not criminally reveal or else that would cause me to be charged with "cinematic spoilery". The luscious Marisa Tomei also co-stars as Gina, Andy's materialistic wife who craves to move to Brazil with Andy to keep it Rio, I mean real. The supreme calamity of Andy's hasty heisty plan is that he wants Hanks to knock off their parent's "ma &amp; pa" suburban jewelry store. Let's just say that Raggedy Andy is a redhead with a dumbhead. The ensemble acting of "Before The Devil Knows You're Dead" was a heavenly delight. Hoffman steals all his scenes with his grand acting persona, Hawke's emotional work was filled with his usual "Ethanol" acting gas, and the admirable Finney was no less than "Finenomenal". It would be a devilish highway-robbery act by The Academy if these three are not nominated for Oscar acting awards. Kelly Masterson's screenplay was what else but masterful. However, let us not forget the architect of this devilishly amazing film- the great Sidney Lumet, the 83 year-old undying spectacular director whose undying spectacular direction of "Before The Devil Knows You're Dead" once again proved that he embodies his films with his prototypical intelligible "Luminaries". So I thank heaven and Sidney for bringing us the remarkable "Before The Devil Knows You're Dead". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet Directs a Tremendous Cast in a Slick and Entertaining Crime Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" shares much in common with the recent spate of gloomy fall movies that have depicted the world as a crappy place to live in, where everybody's a foul-mouthed loser, a junkie, a murderer or, in most cases, a combination of all three. I'm thinking of movies like the dreary "We Own the Night" or the hateful "Gone Baby Gone." But what sets this one apart from those is that it's directed by an old pro who knows his way around a story, and is able to get terrific performances from his cast of actors. Therefore, instead of being depressed by the movie's admittedly downbeat screenplay, I was exhilarated by good film making.This crime thriller doesn't have much of anything new to say, or really much of anything at all to say. Two brothers (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) devise a plan to rob their own parents' jewelry store to help get them out of their respective financial quandaries. But things go horribly wrong, and as they spiral more and more out of control, family resentments that were simmering below the surface boil over in a frothing rage. The screenplay dishes out the events in bits and pieces, using a disjointed chronology that makes the whole thing feel more complicated and significant than it is. It's taut and engrossing, though I thought the ending was awfully weak and the character of the father, played by Albert Finney, the most poorly written.But what this movie does offer unequivocally is a feast of good acting, and that's the reason to see it. Hoffman is spectacular as the older brother who cooks up the scheme but wants to keep his hands clean. He's got a decent job, a hot wife (Marisa Tomei, who spends much of her screen time topless) and a cocky, confident attitude. But on some basic level, he's a schlub and knows it. Hawke, as the younger, gentler, and not very bright brother, is also great, though the movie is less about him than it is Hoffman. Finney is good too, though, again, the way the character is written limits the impact of his performance. A couple of actors more known for stage than screen work appear in minor roles: Brian F. O'Byrne, as a thug Hawke's character hires to help out with the robbery; and Amy Ryan, who played a loathsome, vile mother in "Gone Baby Gone," who here plays Hawke's aggressive and unpleasant ex-wife. Typecasting, anyone? "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" isn't an important film, but it's an awfully entertaining one.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best by a master director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that left me speechless and quite shaken by the time it was over, and I was wondering when was the last time a movie had done that. Reading a Greek tragedy provokes a similar reaction, and that's exactly why "Before" manages to leave its audience devastated, because it is powerful drama, written to connect by kicking you in the guts.As we have seen several times, good writing is sometimes not enough for Hollywood. Some amazing literary classics have been ineptly adapted, and here is first-rate work, masterfully directed by one of cinema's most reliable directors, a man who has given us some of the most powerful movies ever made, and this time he has hit the mark dead on, with the help of some of the best acting talent in Hollywood.Beginning with the ever reliable Albert Finney, still giving performances as sensational as those of his early work. In here, his emotionally wounded father becomes another one of the devastated results of a deal gone wrong. His actions are bound to make members of the audience stare with disbelief and wonder how far some men can go when pushed.Next is Phillip Seymour Hoffman, a performer who might never be able to top his work here because it is so raw and as searing as having acid spilled on your soul. His Andy is a man with a soul so corroded that one wonders how anyone can ever be that way. Then we meet the rest of his family, and we might get some answers.Then, we see Ethan Hawke, matching Hoffman every step of the way, with a character that so perfectly embodies every possible pathetic quality we can think of. Through a series of incredibly harrowing incidents, he and his brother manage to sink lower and lower into a mess of their own design, some of which became even more pungent because of a twist of fate.Lumet's direction is tight, so in control that there are no moments left in which to wonder what's is going. This ride is hypnotic, yet as tense as a walk on a mine field, with intensity not seen on the screen in years. This film almost makes recent work by Scorcese and the Coen Brothers seem mild in comparison. Everyone of the people in the film must face the consequences of actions that might have originated way before the tragic event that sets the last tragic act in motion.This film is a good as a movie can be, a work that shows the perfect marriage of talent and the understanding of human imperfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though Fictional It Rings All Too True...Gripping &amp; Horrific!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Condense the horror imbued in all the characters of The Godfather down to an even smaller family, condense it further following them only over the course of several days and, well, you just got to see it to understand. This movie is perhaps the most gripping thriller in at least a decade. It makes one almost physically sick to see a family come completely apart with such a horrific efficiency. Even though it's fictional it all rings true and that drives the whole thing into the stratosphere. Everything serves the story so completely you'll believe it actually happened and that you are looking at the real people it happened to. It's generally excepted Philip Seymour Hoffman is one of, if not the most, talented actors working. This movie will perpetuate that...However...You'll be shocked at Ethan Hawke's performance. He can nail "nervous wreck" so well you will be concerned that he must need help even beyond the camera! While I won't go into the other aspects of the casting, I will say it's perfect as everyone serves the story.Lumet, Masterson, Hoffman, and Hawke deserve academy award consideration for Before The Devil Knows You're Dead. This is the rare fictional crime thriller, such as the Godfather, that wrenches one to the point of relief when the final credits roll. But, you will stay until they roll and you'll likely feel quite queasy in between. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Overrated Film of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I was expecting something else. 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' wasn't as thrilling as I anticipated, but more of a depressing, slow-paced yet painfully realistic kind of a movie. I was surprised to read such rave reviews of this film, seeing as though I didn't find anything particularly outstanding about it. It's a good film, but certainly nothing worthy of an Oscar like some critics seem to believe.The story is about a jewelry store robbery gone awry. Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and his younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) are running low on money, so they decide to rip off their parent's jewelry store. Even though they planned everything out carefully, something terribly wrong goes wrong during the robbery and tragedy ensues.The best part of the film is Philip Seymour Hoffman. Although it isn't one of his best performances, Hoffman owns the role like always and makes 'Andy' a sympathetic character despite the awful things he does. Ethan Hawke, not nearly as good, excels in the role of Hank. Marissa Tomei is great as Andy's wife and even better when she doesn't have any clothes on! Just kidding, but not really, she's a very beautiful girl. Albert Finney is powerful in a kind of nothing role as Andy and Hank's father, and Broadway actor Brian F. Byrne (Doubt) is genuinely creepy in his role.The acting is the high-point of the film. The story is very good, but the screenplay is awful. The dialogue is solid, but Kelly Masterson has some serious problems with pacing. Everything seems to run into together, which result in a film that isn't as compelling as it has the potential to be. The film's editing and cinematography are amateurish and teeter on the point of being annoying, and Sidney Lumet's directing is nothing to shout home about. Lumet, a director I highly admire for his work on such masterpieces as 'Dog Day Afternoon' and 'Network', really phones it in for his latest feature.In conclusion, 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' is a good film with some great performances, an intriguing plot but some serious problems.

		<shortDescription>Loved it. Gritty and satisfying.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of PSH and Ethan Hawke. I enjoyed watching PSH in the 25th Hour (one of my fave films) especially.The film is pretty simple. Ethan and PSH need money. They are brothers. Ethan the less successful who owes his ex wife child support. PSH has a hefty heroin addiction and is clearly lacking in any sort of self esteem. This makes him arrogant, nasty and completely compelling to watch.The brothers decide to rob their parents jewellery store. Simple - no risk, no guns, no harm to anyone and their parents will be protected by the insurers. Unfortunately nothing quite goes to plan. There is tragedy which leads to one miss fortune after another.I don't want to give too much away. Its a great story which unfolds effortlessly. The moral being - if you do bad then it will catch up on you in every way possible.The film is shot slightly differently from others. There is multiple point of view cuts. For instance, you will see PSH's view on things 4 days before the robbery, Ethans point of view 1 day after it etc. I liked this. It lags a tiny bit later on in the film but overall works very well.PSH and Ethan Hawke both turn in excellent performances in this film. I would like to think PSH was at least considered for a nod at the Oscars here. I don't think it is the best lead I have saw this year but he should have been at least considered (Im sure he will get best supporting for Charlie Wilsons War, another excellent film).Overall I loved it. The film has closure too. This is a relief in a world of films where it seems to be trendy to leave you hanging to interpret your own ending. One thing though - the film is about getting your comeuppance. *****SPOILER****** - Ethan Hawke gets away with it in the end. PSH doesn't. I just cant help thinking that if they were both punished then it would have made for an even darker, grittier ending. Maybe Ethan wasn't as responsible for his mothers death though. He was desperate and never planned it I suppose.Anyway, excellent film. Go see it, enjoy it. Tell your friends.8/10 This is surely an Oscar contender this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why I think this film is so overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have rarely disagreed so much with the IMDb average. No.1 Most of the stuff in this film just does not happen. Ever. Even if it does, it doesn't all happen to the same bunch of people. Even if it did happen to the same bunch of people, it would be because of causal links, which were absent or weak here. No.2 There really wasn't much tension here, given it was a thriller format. The cuts back and forward in time meant you knew what was going to happen a lot of the time. Even when you didn't, plot developments were clichéd and predictable. Even when they weren't, they were signalled way ahead of time. No.3 Various specific plot elements didn't go anywhere or were pretty unlikely or happened just too easily No.4 There was far too much use of the phone to make up for a weak structure. And the personal interactions generally weren't convincing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before you Know It, This is the Best Film of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before the Devil Knows You're Dead Veteran and iconic director Sidney Lumet brings the electrifying Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. This may be one of the best, if not the best film of the year. With a star-studded cast who turn in some of the finest performances of the year and their careers, its hard to resist the darkness of the picture. With the Requiem for a Dream meets Closer persona, the film tells the story of Andy and Hank, two brothers who come up with a perfect plan to solve all their financial problems; they will rob their parents jewelry store. All seems well when the plan goes sour which domino-effects a chain of events that will change their lives forever.Lumet directs Philip Seymour Hoffman in his best portrayal in years, definitely topping his award winner Capote. Hoffman plays the hard-nosed Andy, as powerfully disturbing as he is irritating, Hoffman layers Andy emotion on top of emotion never giving the viewer any indication of what he may be feeling next. The character, while well written. doesn't embody any type of redeeming factor to make the audience like him at all. His character might be one of the paramount written character studies of the new millennium.Ethan Hawke in his most daring and striking turn of his career plays Hank, the easily manipulated loser who is easily influenced by his overbearing brother Andy. Hawke has never been more aware, more internalizing, more invigorating in all his years on screen. Hank is your tragedy of the story, a character destined to fail and drowning in his endeavors, or lack there of. This is the performance that is in dyer need of awards consideration as Hawke proves that he can be a leading man, even though his performance is clearly supporting. (as is the entire cast) Albert Finney as the tough and nearly unsentimental father Charles breathes new life into his characterizations that we have never seen from the veteran actor before. As loving and caring as Charles may appear, his feelings for life especially his children run skin deep but with Finney at the helm and bleeding out of the screen with frightening poise, that latter part of the film becomes his show. Along with Hawke, an awards-caliber piece that is worthy of citation.Marisa Tomei, in a role which on the surface seems underdeveloped and unneeded brings forth a brilliant performance that tops her work in In the Bedroom. It's her one-liners and long stares out a car window that fish hook us into her world. Besides her words and expressions being so endearing, we haven't seen her more sexy, more ballsy, more unlike Marisa which we have come to know in her later years of acting in Unhook the Stars and What Women Want.Aleksa Balladino, Michael Shannon, Rosemary Harris and the incomparable Amy Ryan turn in limited but special performances respectively. All adding to what could be a serious threat come SAG awards time for Best Performance by a Cast Ensemble nomination. But I'm afraid in the end it's Kelly Masterson's brilliant, which is an understatement, miraculous screenplay that makes the film work so well. How can this concept be thought of which on paper seems so ordinary but in the end be so original and provocative? You get the legend Sidney Lumet to direct your picture. In his later years, Lumet hasn't stood out (at least in my humble opinion) in his films as he did in his earlier years. With classics like Dog Day Afternoon and The Wiz, Lumet revolutionized film-making and make it more artistic and scenic. I only hope his work here can not go unnoticed because it is a return to form for him indeed.Consequently, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead excels and the most inventive levels. As the characters all inhabit something grotesque and grating about them, the radiance and grandeur of the eccentric type illuminates the screen and sends chills down the viewer's body; creating fury and lack of comfort that follows you home until landing of the cranium on a soft light spread cushion.Grade: ****/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A typical, random clash of bad clichés. Horrible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I have never written an online review and i don't like critics, but I had to vent somewhere. It frightens me that people enjoy movies like this. It's right out of a Hollywood coffee shop (I know, I used to live there). A bunch of bland characters throwing their lives away to get some money. Really, it's Ethan Hawke (in his usual great performance) drowning in boring, bad dialog, and predictable, emotionless scenes. The cinematography (if you want to call it that) reminds me of television. They started out with a pretty cool plot: Two bros rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their parents. Then a bunch of nincompoopish decisions that nobody in the audience would ever make attempt to evolve into a story. This stuff would NEVER make it around a campfire. Not the 9 bar scenes in the lame mod NY bar. Not the frighteningly boring bank robbery scene. None of it. I don't care if this flick won awards - people need to get off the Zanex, the paxil, the coke, and get on a bike. Check out the real world. It's nowhere near this monotonous and predictable. I'm sick to my stomach, really I have to go vomit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Juat watched it on DVD.Starts out promising and gets worse...and worse...and worse. What is clearly intended to be a modern day Greek tragedy ends up tragic-comic and loaded with clichés. And did we really have to see Marisa Tomei being humped doggy style by Seymour Hoffman? Gross. She's wasted in this thankless role.But it's Seymour Hoffman and Hawke who each get an award for Dumbest Brothers and Biggest Screw Ups of All Time". Now, Shakespeare could have done something interesting with that - in a comedy or tragedy. Instead we have a playwright named Masterson who somehow got his first screenplay produced and who is desperately trying to be deep yet ends up embarrassing himself. I actually laughed out loud a few times and didn't care one bit for the characters.Sidney Lumet has made some classic films - he should have passed on this project and so should everyone else.P.S. Finney's open mouth and bulging eyes throughout much of the film was incredibly annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing good user comments and high rating on IMDb, i decided to watch this film yesterday but I am really regretting my decision. The element of thrill and mystery was almost non-existent, the plot was weak and I couldn't empathise with any of the characters - I am not saying that the acting was bad, but the movie simply failed to develop any feelings of sympathy/hate/anger towards any of the characters. I remained indifferent to whatever happened to the characters as I painfully waited for the boring end to eventually dawn upon us - as if it was very difficult to predict it in the first place. The movie has been labelled as thriller/mystery but I failed to see what was so thrilling about it or where was the great mystery - or maybe that in itself was the mystery bit. I am still dazed at how shockingly pathetic the movie was although it has been more than 24 hours since I have watched it. This movie is 123 minutes of mind-numbing boredom and excruciating torture. Avoid it as you would avoid flesh eating zombies.Following are the top 10 reasons why you could still be interested in watching this movie:1. If you are a die hard fan of Sydney Lumet and would love to watch even if he films pooping cows2. If you like dud thrillers and particularly those dud thrillers where the writer goes "Hey I have an awesome idea, lets show the ending right in the beginning and then go through it all over again through a series of highly sedating and annoying flashbacks" 3. If you have a fascination for extremely complicated crime plots that have holes as big as plane hangers and are hatched by characters having IQs between those of rabbit droppings and sleeping toads 4. If you want to experience how does it feel like to watch a 10 minute story line being mercilessly extended into a full length movie 5. If you are fond of unexpected breast flashing and gratuitous sex scenes 6. If you are fond of unexpected breast flashing and gratuitous sex scenes that involve Marisa Tomei 7. If you are either a masochist and take pleasure in self torture or you are a nihilist and want to see how evil mankind actually is 8. If you are both 9. If you have a fetish for gay drug dealers who wear something similar to a kimono and stash their money in open safe boxes 10. All of the above</fullReview>

Because of Ethan Hawke, who seems never to able to let down the audience: he plays a very convincing role, he does it in a very professional manner, too.On the other hand, the drama is there. To be involved in a shooting with your own mother, to see your brother die in front of you, to get involved with his wife etc. are the very themes which make the movie very realistic (Murphy's Law does apply and not at all on the funny side...) and at the same time quite hard on the audience to watch.Why ONLY two stars? To begin with, PS Hoffman does a very good job not convincing in this role. Well, he never does much anyway... Maybe the role is too much for the likes of him, maybe I expected too much of him, maybe Ethan Hawke been in the cast I wanted an Actor being able to cope with the high hopes...I really think with a better casting the film would've been able to make even more waves than it already did...Let's say that the editing wasn't too bad either, but maybe I remain a dedicate fan of "Memento", who absolutely blows you away in this regard.It deserves to be watched, but...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real Hit for the "hit and miss" Lumet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know what you're thinking- Sydney Lumet has made some very good films and some real turds in the last 40 years and now that he approaches his 149th birthday how can he possibly compete with the directors and story tellers of today?? Tha answer is simple he hires real talent over Hollywood hyped stars even using great casting in the smaller roles giving this film a genuine look from suburbs to urban scum. His expertise and experience of a strong script makes Lumet stand out as a still great director. This film though gritty was wonderful. While it is much seedier it none the less in my mind compares to Haggis' Crash of last year.The Story: Two emotionally troubled brothers (each with their own financial troubles) plan to hold up a jewelry store with a toy gun- but when the bullets go off things go from bad to worse to down right gut wrenchingly uncomfortable for the brothers and their families. This is a masterpiece- not that crap from the Cohen brothers released the same month. The performances in this film are spell binding- Hoffman and Finney can do no wrong in my eyes but I haven't enjoyed a performance from Ethan Hawke since Dead Poets Society which makes this almost spiritual in its' resurrection of Ethan Hawke the actor. by the way- I never knew Marissa Tomei had such nice breasts and frankly she was pretty good in her role as conniving yet sad wife of Phillip Seymore Hoffman. There have been only a hand full of films in the last three months worth seeing and by far this is one of the best. It gives the viewer a chance to forget about CGI effects and over the top evil geniuses for characters and returns to movie basics: Story, acting and set design/ lighting. A must see for movie fans!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a buddy who has a friend who knows some guy dating a terrific gal, a transsexual, who grew up with the sister of a guy who knows someone who worked on 'Before the Devil'. I wouldn't otherwise see a film that sounds like it's going to be deep, dark, and disturbing. I try to escape those feelings, not embrace them, but this film is important. It is directed by someone who is obviously a master-craftsman. It feels like the guy who directed it could paint the canvass in any genre he desires, flawlessly, but in the end, his strokes are seamless, simple, and timeless. The script is an enigma - I can't figure out what it wants me to do with its carcass ? find redemption in it? I couldn't see any at first. Is it a character study? Is it illuminating the human condition? I don't know what that condition is or even what that means. Does it give hope ? or just more despair at the people and world we live in? About three-quarters of the way through it I decided that it sucked ? but I went back in ? I had the same feeling I have about the dark sides of my own nature ? I don't want to look at them ? so I don't ? I walk out on life most the time ? but this time ? I faced it. The acting is ? from everyone - in a word - two words - thoroughly breath-taking. Or is that three words? I think the actor, Ethan Hawke, whose work I know little about - is on the brink of iconic artistry - he reminds me of Sandy Dennis (who I would stalk if she were still alive) - he blew me away ? until last night I thought he was just another doped up pretty boy ? kind of like Tom Cruise - OK - I'm jealous - but - in a cast who all deserve critical acclaim - he will get the nod for best supporting actor - you heard it here first - I would see this film just for Ethan Hawke and he isn't even my type. In the end - a good movie is a movie that is discussed afterward - I heard that once, somewhere - and after I ripped this film apart to my friend - I had a conversation with myself - we agreed - something profound this way comes.

		<shortDescription>Almost a Solid Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If it weren't for a weak ending, Sidney Lumet, almost directed a movie that wasn't going anywhere into an almost solid, good movie. Unfortunately, the unnecessary flashback sequences cut out a lot of movie time that could have been much more effectively used for a linear character, plot development that was missing in this movie. HOUSE OF MIRTH (2000) offers an amazing performance by Gillian Anderson (of the X-files) in a historical period piece that provides a compelling look at the rise and fall of this woman. Whereas, Sidney Lumet avoids providing a lot of the emotional bonding, growing up, experiencing the characters in his movie. We don't get to see how Albert Finney's character was like as a father and the close relationship he may have had with his wife, an important element in this movie. The beginning half of this movie is choppy and back and forth editing, flashbacks it appears only for the overly cute twist in discovering the important connections between the jewelry store and the characters in the movie. But this cute ploy isn't worth sacrificing a more convincing and riveting storyline from the beginning. Phillip Seymour Hoffman offers a few brilliant scenes, of emotional catharsis which would have been nice to expand to the rest of the cast. Sidney Lumet in the second half of the movie directs a taut and tension-filled, climatic building movie that explores the impact of betrayal, mistrust, behind the scenes connections that literally explode by the end of the movie. Unfortunately, the climax is too easy a way out in the blinding white light. Too many loose ends, a disappointing experience. Almost but not quite...a final let down at the end that at least could have saved the movie. Nice concept, nice try, good but inconsistent exploration of getting this version of the movie to the screen. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite some problems, it was good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**HUGE Spoilers WITHIN** It is a good movie, practically a great one. There's not a chance in the world I would state anything else. But its also highly improbable. The actors are all really terrific and I didn't think Ethan Hawke could be that good. Hoffman has been great (and will be again) so that was expected. I left the movie feeling the effects of it. I went into a Rite Aid to get a pack of Marlboros and wouldn't have been surprised if the clerk or another customer pulled a gun in the store. The violence in the movie is very realistic and makes you realize its part of the world we live in. I kept thinking that Shakespeare would have liked this movie and it feels like something he might have written. The tragedy of it is real, also.BUT...-Andy and Hank worked in their parents jewelry store, so why didn't they know about the gun? Why does no one exhibit any surprise that their Mother actually used it to kill Bobby? Andy questions why she was working there that Saturday, it seemed to me that someone would have asked a rhetorical question about the gun and its use.-What does Charles hope to find out from the cops? The identity of the robber is known.-Why did Andy admit to Charles that he was responsible for the robbery? Is he covering for Hank? If this is a death-bed confession then I guess I get it.-Why are Andy and Hank surprised that their Mother is in the hospital? I know the UPS truck blocked Hank's view of who went into the store that morning but it seemed conceivable that it was her. Unless they were unaware Charles had his drivers license by that time..-I also have to question Andy leaving his business card w/that old jeweler. It reeks of stupidity, but maybe that's the point. Its not like these were career criminals. Furthermore, why do Andy and then Charles go to the jeweler anyway? No jewels were taken! The robber died in the act!-Bobby's widow would have been contacted once the law identified Bobby as the robber, and she would have given up Hank in a heartbeat. If she hadn't, then her and her brother would have been able to blackmail Hank with the fact that the cops know Bobby did it but did or did not have an accomplice. I had a problem with Gina's departure. Asking Andy for money made me want to laugh. If you're skipping out on your spouse, you should at least have had pocket money for a cab. It also seemed to me that Gina might have suspected that Andy was somehow involved in the robbery. The way she's looking at him when she's doing the dishes as Andy is speaking with Charles in the backyard led me to believe that she thought that this was possible. I might have believed her reasons for leaving him if this was part of what she was hoping to avoid being party to.I also wanted to mention another memorable performance by Michael Shannon. He was the best thing in "World Trade Center" and is quickly becoming an actor whose career may be worth following. He has only two scenes here but I was glad to see him again.In summary, its worth seeing but if you look too deeply into it, it may not all make logical sense. But I did feel as though I had actually seen a movie when it was over, and that's something that does not happen as often as one would hope. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Only Hurt the Ones You Love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The imploding lives of the main characters was good theater. The sons(Philip Seymore Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) need money. They decide to rob their parents' jewelry store. For Hoffman, the money could go maybe to repay embezzlement from his company or the money may (and probably will) be used for his heroin addiction. Ethan Hawke owes back child support and some mean debt collectors.As the plot unwinds, there is a core of malevolence inside each character coming to the surface. The family members are turning on each other with a venom which is intense and without much remorse. Their lives change from a process of dissolution to a process of explosive self-destruction.The acting was terrific. The problem is the script. It is at least somewhat unusual for a family members to turn to each other with murderous rage. The evil at the core of their hatred for each other has an origin, but the script deals only briefly with the origins. Hoffman says a few self-pitying things about how he was treated in his youth, but his complaints are about circumstances common in most families. One would be hard-pressed to count the modest complaints as the cause of dysfunction on this scale. In the end, the horrible spectacle of family killing family is not explained. The father was a little distant. So what? We see the actors' actions, but we have no understanding about why they are driven to madness. The snippets of pycho-babble aren't enough. The actions of the parents are not the kinds of actions which foment such a bitter, ugly harvest from their children.In the end, we see an ugly spectacle unfold without reasons for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with having a very bad title, I was pretty disappointed in this movie. It was beautifully filmed, interesting, and had uniformly great performances, but there just wasn't enough "there" there - when the movie ended, I wondered if that was all the filmmakers had to say: "people suck and then you die." Sheesh! I would have liked, and really expected, more background on the characters, more "back story" as they say, *especially* the women (who were barely more than props), and more interaction among the people. It seemed so sparse, which made it beautiful but unsatisfying.I'm not the sort of person who needs a happy ending, but I expected and wanted more about the life of the family, instead of just watching them all be horrible to each other. I'm not some Pollyanna - I know that people can be evil, and of course dysfunctional people make good drama, but this crowd was a bit much.I don't think it's enough to make a visually appealing movie - the audience needs to be invested in the characters. In this film, the people are kept at a distance - you want to sympathize with them, but your instinct to do so is thwarted by the film's structure.It's just a little too relentlessly dark, almost gratuitously so. It's worth watching because it's a very well made film, but only if you're in a misanthropic mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am even questioning a 6 out of 10 for this but I have to give points for the return to that 70's grit which Lumet had exploited so well, way back when. The cinematography, with all that beautiful available light feel, made this film bearable. I went there with expectations soaring( a definite no-no)but came out feeling that age and Hollywood had finally overwhelmed Lumet's sense of reality. This is not good news for those of us who are aging fast but still want to be artistically relevant. Everything felt too Hyper-real. the drama was too forced with too many neat little packets of despair, from the cry baby, little brother to the predatory like, cocaine addicted older one. And how about the purely pornographic role played by Tomei or the appearance of a cocaine dealing ghost from the Studio 54 days? The final achingly debilitating straw: our beloved Albert Finney walking sloowwly down a looongg corridor. I missed the straight forward feel of Lumet's docu-drama style films: Twelve Angry men, Network, Dog Day Afternoon etc. and went to the theater to mourn that loss, hoping to witness one of the last films of it's kind.I still love Sydney. He is still one of the greatest American Directors; alive or dead.</fullReview>

No likable characters. With all star cast of Oscar award winners. Leave it up to Sidney Lumet.This movie is a f***ing trainwrech that's easy to turn away from and leaves you wondered was there a story or anything substantial learned about these people -- their small town -- who they really are? The movie isn't bad in concept. Two brother devise a plan to rob a jewelry story, but everything goes wrong when their mother is shot.Just executed horribly -- mostly by the director, writer, and editor. Poor performances all around -- even the actors.The dialogue is also incredibly bad and never rewards you for listening to anything any of the character actually say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so unbelievably terrible I just get so infuriated every time someone praises its holy magnificent cinematic glory. From the moment the movie started I didn't have a good feeling about it, which was a damn shame as I was so looking forward to seeing it. The movie opens with Marisa Tomei being anally probed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and the film just goes downhill from there. I can't even go on describing the plot because I may just explode. Never have I cared less about seeing Marisa Tomei's boobs, which seem to make an appearance in every scene she's in. All the actors look dreadful, and I honestly couldn't care less about the characters or plot (Hoffman and his brother, played by Ethan Hawke, plan to rob their parent's jewelry store but LOW AND BEHOLD, the plan goes awry). I can't go on any longer, else I may tear my hair out of my poor head.I would give this 0/10 stars since it doesn't even deserve one, but whatever 1/10 for sheer idiocy and a waste of $10.50</fullReview>

This is a pointless, depressing movie that is difficult to watch (the lighting was poor, no doubt in keeping with the rest of the movie) with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Who cares if the actors can accurately portray selfish, misguided behaviors and judgments? What is anyone to conclude from this movie: Don't have children? Don't steal from and murder your parents or children? It's OK and justifiable to kill your children if they do it to you first? Clearly, movies do not need to be neatly wrapped morality stories, but c'mon give the audience something other that morose depression. Avoid this movie at all cost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The description of this movie, The perfect crime goes horribly wrong for brothers Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Hank (Ethan Hawke) when they botch a robbery of their parents jewelry store in this wrenching drama from legendary filmmaker Sidney Lumet, who was 82 when he directed the film., is accurate in one sense: something does horribly goes wrong as the viewer is forced to watch, in the opening sequence, Phillip Seymour Hoffman perform in a copulation scene. I couldn't finish the scene, therefore I couldn't finish the movie. Call me a prude if you wish but I think it significantly detracts from the dignity of an otherwise fine actor. Why did he stoop to do it? He has fame, presumably money, and the admiration of the public (now sans myself). So presumably he hasn't yet been photographed straddling, walrus-like, some young woman? Im too dull to figure it out and will contentedly remain so. As far as I can tell from the plot description, the scene was entirely gratuitous perhaps satisfying some, as yet, unclassified lust in the aging Sidney Lumet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Masterclass from Hoffman, but otherwise unremarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The octogenarian and legendary Sidney Lumet teams up with the increasingly iconic Philip Seymour Hoffman in this crime thriller centred around one family. Two brothers (Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) find themselves in grave financial difficulty. Hawke's younger brother is a screw-up with an ex-wife and child support payments he can't afford. Hoffman's Andy is unfulfilled and his marriage is slowly falling apart. Andy constructs a plan to rob their parents' jewellery store. As it is insured, he believes it to be a victimless crime. The heist goes dreadfully wrong and the family unravels.The film is told in a non-linear fashion, jumping from character to character and back and forth through time. This is, at first, gripping as the plot is gradually set up but towards the end the audience is well ahead of the narrative and the constant cutting back becomes somewhat infuriating. Despite this, the film remains watchable, principally because of Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance.Comfortably supported by Hawke, Albert Finney and Marisa Tomei, Hoffman is able to take this film by the scruff of the neck. Hoffman has the hardest part in this film. Andy is a thoroughly unattractive character at times, but Hoffman manages to drag a lot of sympathy out of him. It is an intense and gripping performance.However the rest of the film isn't as impressive as the performance. This is a perfectly competent film with a number of positives and it is good way to spend a few hours, but it remains somewhat unremarkable on the whole. However, as with almost all of his films, this is worth seeing for the Hoffman performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On a superficial level this is Fargo without the snow; in both films a protagonist strapped for cash sees a crime against the family as an easy and harmless way out and in both films something that should be relatively straightforward spirals out of control and tragedy ensues. The family here makes The House Of Atreus seem like The Little House On The Prairie with a final scorecard that sees one brother sleeping with the other's wife, the two brothers killing their mother, albeit by default and the father killing his eldest son, with three other killings thrown in for good measure. It's well acted if you don't count Albert Finny who has somehow built a career out of being a so-so actor and well written and Sydney Lumet keeps it flowing albeit non-lineally. Might be a tad overpraised but certainly worth seeing.</fullReview>

It's a painfully dull and evil morass of one dimensional characters. In an unending sequence of sociopathic actions, the viewer is battered and assaulted. In the opening scene, Philip Hoffman is violating Marisa Tomei. For the rest of the film, Lumet violates the audience. What a nasty commentary on an American family. An obvious Irish Catholic,American family ( who own a jewelry store-yeah, right) who are all rotten to the core. Lumet's "message" is that we are ALL evil, some just know how to profit by it. This is just the kind of amoral wasteland he and so many other contemporaries of his love to depict in film. This is not reality, not art, not entertainment. It is nihilism.

		<fullReview>This gem is excellently acted, especially by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and even Ethan Hawke, who is usually a little smarmy for my taste, but not here. But there are two cinematic conceits going on here. The first is minor and forgivable, that Hawke and Hoffman don't look at all like they could be even remotely related. The second conceit is more egregious. Generally, there are three reasons one could be attracted to someone: 1. That person has a wonderful personality, 2. That person is wealthy, or 3. The person is gorgeous. The character that Hoffman plays in this movie is none of the above. He is a white-collar middle-class drone, 2. He is overweight, and 3. He obviously has a horrific personality. To add insult to an already non-credible coupling, we have Marisa Tomei who is obviously drop-dead gorgeous. What was Lumet thinking?</fullReview>

Anticipation that this would be a great film faded from the very beginning to the expected conclusion. The only saving grace was Marisa Tomei. She was a beauty and pulled off a believable character.

		<fullReview>Why do the relentlessly cheerful Prozac idiots who give ten stars to everything get, by default, to the head of the line at IMDb? Because IMDb is about PROMOTING MOVIES, not about the fair, level-headed appraisal of them. (Go ahead, invisible internet Big Brother, banish or censure me, I dare you).And then, of course, there are the endless hipper-than-thou dweebs who begin their reviews with, "I saw this movie at the X$7&amp;^ movie festival," as if they're utterly special, so ahead of the herd.Had to get that off my chest.As for "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead": It's "Fargo" without any of the wit, black humor, or intelligence, without any of the sexy violence: Family turns on itself for direly needed cash, setting loose the latent evil that has been festering below the surface for decades, only to implode, leaving a trail of corpses.Major problem: I for one didn't give a damn about any of the characters. These are snakes, folks, cold phony little bastards who need to be run over by a train ASAP. So what if their lives go down the drain? They didn't have lives to begin with.The movie chops up the time line, butchers continuity. Movies ain't novels. They live in, are prisoners of, The Moment. Flashbacks destroy their momentum, their forward thrust, and have to be used very sparingly, as brief asides. But here, for no real good reason, other than for artsy-fartsy self-conscious self-indulgence, the movie intrusively hops around time, changing POV, from character to character, instead of interweaving their lives with any semblance of skill. We do not need titles that flash on the screen proclaiming "Andy four days earlier." Too bad Marisa Tomei has been reduced to prancing around naked to get a role (nice bod, tho). A dissolute flabby old goat, Albert Finney stumbles about, mouth open as if to catch flies. Amy Ryan, so spot-on perfect in "Gone Baby Gone," is a complete drag, a cut-out stock character, the disgruntled ex, her underutilization an indication of the director's ineptitude. Philip Hoffman is the critics' pet, condemned to the purgatory of minor movies such as this that the majority of Americans will never see.Sidney Lumet must be in his second childhood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why do people enjoy movies that show people's lives that are in complete turmoil? People go to see movies to escape from life's everyday burdens and for a couple of hours step outside of the ordinary to free their minds of whatever the hell they have to worry about once they step back out of the theater. This movie will not provide that service. Instead of freeing your mind from anything, it'll have you pulling the shoelaces out of your shoe so you can hang yourself from something.This movie has me appreciating the stupid feel-good movie a hell of a lot more. I would rather watch a family-oriented "Daddy: Are We Done Yet: Day Care" complete with Ice Cube, Cuba Gooding, Mathew McConnawhatever and Sandra Bullock chick flick than to put myself through this suicide-inducing, "wow-life-can-really-get-that-bad," enjoyable-as-a-rusty-nail-in-your-eye death sentence of a movie.As a college student in the Audio/Video field, I have noticed that to get the hardest critics' attention, you sometimes have to go the "Wow, that it messed up!" route. Creating nice, enjoyable pieces (I create short-films, animations, etc.) are sure to bring a lot more criticism than something with just as much quality but makes the crowd a little squirmish.I viewed this film because I read a great review about it. Sure, it is a great film with tons of emotion and conflict, with a great plot, build-up, climax, so on and so on... But I did not enjoy one single bit of its 'great movie' characteristics. Seriously, someone just stick some heroin in my arm and shoot me in the face already.Let's go see some stoner Apatow humor before we completely hate our lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had to leave the movie theater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie because the timing was right, than Hawke has some good movies on his sleeve the title seem interesting (21 grams like), so I was unbiased because I had not heard any comments, to tell the truth I had seen awful movies before well not the bottom worst however I had never felt the need too leave the movie theater before I avoid the worst part is that it was under rated where I saw it they should have requested ID to get in that awful display of senseless human misery. The first scene is from an x-rated movie and it seems they basically asked Mrs Tomei to participate in a movie where she will be naked or having sex most of the time, and Ethan Hawke they most have told him "act as emo as you can" (they have tainted any good image I had from him forever). I never got to feel any empathy for the characters both of them will be basically white trash one is a white collar junkie that should be charged for embezzlement and the other is an alcoholic moron they both have money problems but seem to finance their vices quite well. So the plan of the day let's steal mom and dad jewelry store and they make a lousy excuse. Everything turns to the worst due to a series of bad choices and their mother ends up dead, that continues the downward spiral they were already in, in which whatever the ending was I do not want to know about and I would rather forget I ever came across about it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Premise, Horrible Screenplay, Worse Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you like to see needless sex scenes, constant use of F**K every other sentence for no other reason than for it to be spoken, plot holes large enough to drive a truck through coupled with endless boredom - then this is the movie for you. The 1st scene should have been the tip off that it wasn't going to get any better, and it didn't. I squirmed in my seat the whole movie wishing it would be over. I haven't walked out on a movie in a long time and if I hadn't been with a group of friends, I would have split within the first 7 minutes. I now wish I had. Please don't waste your money on this train wreck. I honestly can't understand how Hollywood can consistently release turkeys like this movie. Why didn't one single person in a position of authority stand up and say, "I can't release this dog, I am embarrassed to have my name associated with this movie!" But as usual, we got suckered again by waste of time movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey Satan, Sidney Lumet's not dead !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the 90's, Sidnet Lumet's filmography was quite sick, from his forgettable remake of Cassavettes's "Gloria" to his tentative to Rock the trial movie again with "Find me guilty". But no need to bury him so soon, Lumet's come back (at the age of 83, and he's already making a new movie) with a hard boiled "melo/thriler" (the director himself insists on the melodrama part) that certainly has the youth and the strength of his best movies, as "Serpico" or "A Dog Day Afternoon".The movie looks a lot like "A dog day", with it's story of a stupid old-up, where everything goes wrong. But if the masterpiece with Al Paccino mostly deals with the old-up itself, "Before" shows us the premises and the psychological consequences of the crime on a average American family, and goes in logical but unexpected directions. The linear form of the huit-clot classic is now also replaced by a brilliant flash-Back/Forward structure that explore each situations from every point of view.But don't get me wrong, beside the modernity aspect of the narration and the structure, everything in this movie reminds the classical Hollywood's polars of the 70's. The ones of Friedkin, for instance, or...Lumet's. The performances of the actors is admirable (from Ethan Hawke in a surprisingly credible loser part, to the desperate Albert Finney, who's hate is almost palpable on screen), the direction is a mix of fluidity and aridity, the script is rough and serious, and the sobriety of the all thing is really appreciable. I have to admit I haven't seen such an intelligent Hollywood's project since a long time.Another Tagline for this movie could have been : "The best of the 70's cinema on today screens !".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do Not Spend Your Time or Money On This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with, there are no spoilers in this as i didn't see it through to the end and the only reason i have given this a 3 out of 10 is because the acting was really good. The first 10 minutes were good, however, i watched another 50 minutes and by the end of it was bored out of my mind. I had seen the same thing happen (the robbery) through many different people's perspective and it made me angry, never before has a movie made me that angry as i saw absolutely no point in it. I stopped watching it after an hour as i really could not waste another hour of my life watching in. Frankly, the writing was terrible! I beg of you not to waste your money on this film, i've seen so many good reviews of this film, but why!?!?! All i can see is good acting and a horrible story line. I was also left feeling nothing for any of the characters, ***potential Spoilers****it seems bad to think this but i was almost glad the old woman died because it was her own stupid fault for not shootin the guy in the head. As for the brothers, it was their own faults they didn't have any money so how can you feel for them. **End of spoilers***There is one thing this film is good for, and that is to aid in sleep. I couldn't believe how bad the film was, i saw the good reviews and thought that it would be an incredible film, it turns out it was atrocious apart from the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie wasted 2.5 hours of my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe the reviews above praising the movie. Yes, the acting is great - but the story is terrible. It plods on, trying to emulate Tarantino with the switching time sequencing, and remakes Blood Simple which was better, more challenging to watch and more importantly - ORIGINAL. None of the characters are likable or redeem themselves in any way.I am supposed to write 10 lines, but it is not worth adding much more, other than to say I regret wasting my time seeing it when there were so many other more interesting things to do with the short space of time alloted to me (either in this life or tonight because we had a babysitter - depending whether you want to take a macro or micro view of the loss).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sidney could make the best horror film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had me anxious though out the whole duration. Whether it was the incredible acting, captivating plot, or Sidney Lumet's amazing ability to weave the story; I couldn't wait for the film to end. It was like watching a train wreck, god it was unbearable. But the sick thing was I kind of enjoyed it. Will I ever see the movie again? Most likely Ill pass. But there is something to be said about Lumet and the uncomfortable situation. He is a master of this tool.After the unfortunate botch the brothers plans a dark cloud is set over the rest of the film, which we can never seem to escape. All hopes and dreams are lost and the movie becomes one big cluster Puck. Not trying to go to far into details, I find his use of multiple character arcs one of the most successful in the past years. I liked it, but may not see it again...maybe in pieces over a long time.</fullReview>
