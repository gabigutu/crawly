		<shortDescription>A master class in the art of film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films wowed audiences at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival as much as John Crowley's "Boy A." Scipted by Mark O'Rowe from a Jonathan Trigell novel, "Boy A" is a story-driven mystery which is carried on the shoulders of newcomer Andrew Garfield, in a tour de force performance that dominates the film from opening title to closing credits.Jack Burridge is leaving prison after a 14-year sentence for a crime he committed as a child. His mentor Terry has been working to gain his release and help him transition into the new world in which he'll live and work under a new identity. It's up to Jack to determine who he wants to be, but it's up to those around him to determine whether or not he will be allowed to do so. It's that challenge which is at the heart of "Boy A." Andrew Garfield ("Doctor Who," "Lions for Lambs") is frighteningly brilliant as Jack. It's his movie to make or break, and this role is sure to be singled out as the launching pad for what is destined to be a notable career. The viewer sees a sweet, sensitive, puppy dog of a young man while his secret past indicates something completely different. We wrestle with that concept as he does himself, and it's an emotional, moving piece of work. As his counselor Terry, Peter Mullan ("Trainspotting," "Children of Men") is the father figure who provides a foundation for Terry's wandering existence. His attempts to keep Jack alive and well are both heartening and heartbreaking."Boy A" is visually stunning. The interplay of light and shadow through the use of diffusion filters and silhouette gave me chills. The dramatic manipulation of white light is a seemingly simple device but cuts to the bone. Cinematographer Rob Hardy demonstrates true artistry with camera-work that is often a character in itself. A recurring visual theme using tunnels, alleyways, hallways, and bridges stands out even to the untrained eye. Paddy Cunneen's score makes it clear that this is, at its heart, a tale of intrigue.Told in flashback, the secrets of "Boy A" are revealed in bits and pieces. The reality of who Jack is becomes more powerful and painful as the film progresses. Garfield is so charismatic, and his Jack so incredibly sympathetic, that this film easily rises to the top of those screened at this year's festival. John Crowley's "Boy A" is a master class in the art of film-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Emotional Roller-coaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been thinking for a while that after Hollywood stops trying to reinvent itself or more like cannibalizing itself by going back and remaking classics, mostly ruining classics, they should just look at the news, the really news, stop idolizing and picking on their own, and see what tragic or wonderful world, it can be. "Boy A" is a perfect example of what happens when the media gets a hold of a spectacular story, one that might be tragic or devastating, but it still offers enough drama to cast a spell on us. Write a good book about it ("In Cold Blood" comes to mind), adapt it into a couple of decent films, and you can certainly catch fire."Boy A" explores an obscure case in America, but apparently a very famous one in England, telling the story of a released convict who might have more than a few problems adapting back to society. It is essential that his identity remain secret because the consequences can be horrendous for all parties involved.The audience's main concern at first appear to be whether the main character has been rehabilitated and is able to deal with his new freedom. Garfield's performance is so good, it brings to mind the vulnerability shown by Timothy Hutton in "Ordinary People", that of a bruised soul that is very strong but also quite close to an emotional collapse if not nurtured properly. Garfield's character is damaged from his early life to the abuse he suffers at the hand of his childhood friend, the one that eventually gets him in jail. It is not very clear how responsible he is for the crime that eventually incarcerated him, but what is clear is that he needs a lot of support, and any interference will be catastrophic.In the end, we know there has to be some type of revelation, and it is the degree of the pain that the revelation brings that we want to see and we dread all the time. We grow to like this young man. Maybe because he might not be very different from many in our world, maybe because he is another victim of a cold and fractured society. The film will open wounds in many who have been disappointed and hurt, and it will mostly teach a few people a lesson about what we can do to prevent any more tragedies like these from occurring again.It is an admirable achievement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a real gift. It's a gift in the times when Hollywood bombing us with an enormous amount of bad movies,and it's a gift of acting, specially the acting of Andrew Garfield. IMHO,the movie absolutely deserved every award and nomination. So,I give nine stars,not because we have another classic, but because it shows to Hollywood how to make a good movie.P.S.It is not necessary to write a bible about this movie. To much talking about a plot will make it less interesting for the spectator and that no one wants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful and bleak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie hearkens back to the great working class British film dramas of the 1960s. Inspired, I believe, by an actual crime of about a decade ago, in which one child killed another child, the movie provocatively imagines the life of the killer many years afterward. At one point the protagonist is called a monster by a character who has never met him. I was reminded of the cover of a major news magazine at the time of the Columbine massacre, which featured a picture of the adolescent killers with the caption "monsters." I thought to myself that, however disturbed, these are still human beings more like than unlike the rest of us, and what does it say about the rest of us if we deny their humanity and refuse to look at the source of their disturbance? This is the very starting point of "Boy A" and the conclusions it reaches about "the rest of us" are bleak. This is a deeply, disturbingly sad movie. I found it intensely involving, and intensely moving. However, if you watch it, be prepared for a vision of humanity so dark that the most humane character in the story is a murderer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard film to watch that rewards those that do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have all came across the stories and events of young children committing terrible crimes. They must be evil and need to be locked away as they are clearly not the same as you and me are they? Well what if they were the same, only they had a moment of madness, a moment that they did without thinking when they were young enough to know it was wrong but not too fully realise the full extent of their actions? This film does what all great films do, it educates and opens your eyes and mind to new on suggestions, in a sense it widens your experiences. If you really let it this film will get into your head and cause you to fight with your preconceived ideas on punishment for people or whether they deserve forgiveness.This is a great film, I really liked it but I felt uncomfortable during most of it because I knew deep down it was just asking me a question. I know what the lead character did is wrong, I know he was a child when he did it, but now you see him in a new life, touching other people's lives. The film does have an ending for you but this is not the point of the film. The really ending is in your head and it stays with you, "are you are willing to forgive someone like Jack?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made me cry like no other film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this last night on Channel 4 and I honestly cannot believe just how much it has challenged my opinions on this highly emotive subject. I cried very hard for about 20 minutes after the end credits and I still cannot stop thinking about it. I almost wished I hadn't watched it as it has just challenged my way of thinking so much - although I suppose that is what films are supposed to do.The story revolves around Jack - formerly known as Eric - a child murderer released at the age of 24 after serving 14 years in prison for a crime he committed with his accomplice Philip at the age of 10. It follows his re-entry into the world, making friends and finding his way.Suffice to say Eric and Philip were two very neglected souls. Philip, we discover through a series of flashbacks, is suffering very severe sexual abuse at the hands of his older brother (and I just have to say that Taylor Doherty who played him is hopefully set for a very bright future - what an understated and convincing performance). Eric is neglected by his family, friendless, bullied and he clings onto his only friend in Philip - which I believe is probably why he goes along with the crime - for fear of letting down his one and only companion in the world.This has reinforced my opinion that children, including child murderers, are not born evil - they are shaped by their surroundings and their upbringing. It has changed my opinion of how they should be handled - they SHOULD be given a second chance. Jack was a lost soul who had played a part in the most heinous crime but he was desperately trying to turn his life around. It is hammered home that he is not evil when he saves the little girl from the car accident. He is living a haunted half life - 24 with the naivety of someone half his age. I so wanted him to build up a good life which I think was why the ending upset me so much. The whole film leads up to it and Andrew Garfield's superb performance just haunted me afterwards.To be honest - I don't think I will watch this film again as I just find it too upsetting - and that really is not like me (although I am pregnant and a bit hormonal at the moment) - but I think there are some future stars in this film, namely Andrew Garfield who played Jack and Taylor Doherty who played young Philip Craig.You really should watch this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerfully gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Christian author Lewis B. Smedes once said that, "to forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you." John Crowley's Boy A is a powerfully gripping film about what happens when we fail to forgive ourselves for wrongdoing and give society the opening to move in and assuage our guilt. Jack Burridge (Andrew Garfield) has been released from prison after serving fourteen years for a murder that he helped commit when he was ten years old, but the struggle to recover his life has just begun.Adapted by Mark O'Rowe from the novel by Jonathan Trigell, the story is a reminder of the notorious 1993 Jamie Bulger case when two ten-year-olds were convicted of murdering Jamie Bulger, aged two, although Trigell says that his inspiration for the book was a friend of his who served prison time as a juvenile and turned into "a lovely lad." In the Bulger case, the British media portrayed the two boys as evil savages, ignoring circumstances that might have compelled them to commit the act. Sadly, Jack's release is also trumpeted in the media with a scare headline about "evil coming of age" and a drawing of how he might look today.Known at their trial only as Boy A and Boy B, both Jack (whose given name was Eric Wilson) and his friend Phillip (Taylor Doherty) were incarcerated for the brutal murder of a young female classmate, yet the full details of the crime including what may or may not have been Jack's role are never fully explained and the surrounding circumstances revealed only in sporadic flashbacks. We learn that both boys had a childhood of poverty and neglect. Eric had an alcoholic father and a mother stricken with cancer and Philip was sexually abused by an older brother, yet Crowley never uses their circumstances to justify their crime.The film opens with Jack being assisted by his counselor, his uncle Terry (Peter Mullan), on his release from prison. Terry gives him a present of a pair of "Escape" brand sneakers and helps him to find a new job at a delivery service and obtain living accommodations with Kelly (Siobhan Finneran), a kindly woman who agrees to house him temporarily. As a cover, he tells his new boss and co-worker Chris (Shaun Evans) that he did three stints in prison for stealing cars when he was much younger. Jack makes a positive adjustment at work and falls for office secretary Michelle (Katie Lyons), known affectionately by her mates as 'The White Whale". Their relationship at first is awkward, especially when Jack is given Ecstasy at an office party and lets loose in a wild, spasmodic dance, and later, engages in a violent brawl while coming to the aid of a friend.Slowly Jack and Michelle find much in common and one of the loveliest scenes in the film is when they snap photos of each others while taking a bath together. As Jack begins to get his life together, he remains fully aware of the need to guard his secret and his anxiety that others will discover it is always evident. All the while, Jack is supported by Terry, and when the boy rescues the victim of a car accident to become a local hero, Terry calls him his "most successful achievement." Things get complicated, however, when Terry's estranged son (James Young) comes to live with him and begins to show resentment about his father's closeness to Jack. Eventually this entanglement will be the trigger for the realization of Jack's (and our) deepest fears.Boy A is a compassionate and disturbing film that won numerous BAFTA awards for acting, directing, editing, and cinematography, though it started out as a made for TV movie. As Jack, Andrew Garfield turns in a superb performance, allowing his face to reveal his vulnerability and his changing moods to reveal the tightrope on which he is walking. Though the film has moments of pathos, it is not without grace. We cling tenaciously to those moments of transcendence, sensing that they might be fleeting, but knowing that they will never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Since I've watched it I've been madly depressed and I can't stop thinking about it. I wouldn't want this feeling on anyone, not even an enemy. Sign of a wonderful movie yes, that's because every single actor and actress played their part to perfection and that doesn't come knocking on your door everyday.This movie points out a few significant things about jack and his family. Alcohol abuse, family issues, bad influence and the worst friend or enemy in the world.I for one believed the two boys who committed the murder of the toddler (in reality) deserved to spend the rest of their lives behind bars, but this movie is an eye opener. You get to see the other side of the story, it teaches you not to judge so harshly and react in moments of pain.I've seen many movies, real sad stories. I almost become the character when I'm watching particular movies like Boy A to understand them better, I feel every emotion and I've got to say this is one of the best movies of all time, but the feeling doesn't just go away, think it will stay with me for the rest of my life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Living with the Sins of Childhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BOY A is a film that moves the audience in ways few other films do. Part of this is the subject matter, part the solid drama of the novel by Jonathan Trigell on which Mark O'Rowe based his brilliantly understated screenplay, part the sensitive direction by John Crowley, and in large part is the cast of remarkably fine actors who make this impossibly treacherous story credible. 'Boy A' refers to Eric Wilson (Alfie Owen) who was jailed for a crime with his friend with whom he was associated as a youth. He has been released from prison and under the guidance of his 'parole officer/adviser' Terry (Peter Mullan), the now young adult is renamed Jack Burridge (Andrew Garfield) to protect him from the public who still remember the heinous crime of which he was convicted: Terry warns Jack to tell no one his real identity. Jack is assigned a new family and finds new friends in this strange world outside prison walls, but he is still haunted by the crime that changed his life. How Jack relates to his first female relationship and survives the bigotry of his classmates and city folk and finds a way to hold onto life despite his childhood 'sins' forms the development of this story. While the entire cast is excellent, Andrew Garfield's performance as the guilt ridden needy Eric/Jack is exemplary. There are many issues this film deals with in addition to the trauma of starting life over after imprisonment, issues that are universal in nature and that probe our psyches for answers that are never easily resolved here. It is a brilliant little film from Canada. Highly recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging and provocative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its controversial subject matter, Boy A, is likely to be restricted to an art-house release, which is a shame, as it is one of the more challenging and provocative independent British productions of this decade.With his role as the eponymous 'Boy A' ? now known as Jack - Andrew Garfield establishes himself as a star for the future (and as 'Lions for Lambs' is likely to be released before 'Boy A', he may already be by the time it comes out). His subtle and moving role as the child murderer released after a youth spent in institutions, captures both the wide-eyed innocence and the dark and guilty conscience that Jack carries with him.When Jack is released from prison, with a necessary new identity, his counsellor Terry (Peter Mullan as a convincingly flawed mentor), believes so fully in his right to redemption, you can see Jack wanting and willing to believe him. But as the movie unfolds, Jack's doubts continue to arise, as through a series of episodes (drug use, a fight, trespassing) he finds it impossible to escape from his criminal past, despite a heroic rescue of a young girl trapped in a crashed car.This particular contradiction (saving a life, where he once took one) seems to offer salvation, and a relationship with a co-worker Michelle (Katie Lyons in her first film role) teaches him that the world can offer a life of love. But the jealousy of Terry's son for his father's attention eventually pulls Jack's world apart, and as he tried to flee the chasing hounds of the tabloid press, he has to make a choice about his new life.Never judgemental, John Crowley's direction delicately retells the original crime in the form of flashbacks, slowly unveiling how Jack reached this point. Ultimately, this is a film that questions our accepted beliefs about what is good or bad, about crime and punishment, innocence and guilt. 'Boy A' is a fine film that deserves a larger audience than it will probably ever receive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately there have been a lot of movies about real life situations.And most of them were good.But this one definitely jumps out from all the others. First of all,The story is unique.I truly don't think that this kind of story has been used before.It grab your attention from its beginning ti its end.Secondly,while watching this movie I have seen some of the greatest performances lately.Actors aren't well known but I am sure they will become soon if they keep it up like this.At moments I felt as if I were a part of this amazing story,and that is one of the greatest qualities a movie can have. All in all,this is a must see movie.At times it pictures joy,at times it pictures reality,at time it pictures pain but most of the time it pictures human behavior towards someone unusual,someone we aren't used to meeting every day.And finally it shows the great strength from the main character to overcome all the obstacles in his life,he accepts his reality and he learns to deal with it.It pictures human nature. So if you like touching movies,filled with lots of emotions,showing the life as it is,than this is a must see.And trust me - you won't regret it...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young man is released from prison after being incarcerated since he was a child. His attempts to adjust to the outside world aren't always successful.This isn't a feel good movie about a struggle for redemption or the effects of rehabilitation. This is a dark, gritty and realistic view of how things could be for a person newly released after a horrible crime.There isn't a lot of graphic bloodshed; most of that is implied instead of being played for shock value. That's good; this movie doesn't need any more shock value than is already portrayed. You aren't particularly encouraged to sympathize with the ex-con, nor are you encouraged to condemn him. Instead the film makes you an objective observer to his trials and tribulations, his attempts to get into society with as little trouble as possible, the reactions of people who know and work with him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and challenging look at a relevant subject with impressive delivery across the board (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack is a young convict who has finishes his sentence and is being released back into society under the guidance of mentor Terry. Having been in prison since he was a boy, the world of work, women and adult responsibilities are all new to him but Jack has a bigger challenge. His real name is Eric Wilson but he is better known as Boy A ? one of two boys who murdered schoolgirl Angela Milton several years ago. While he tries to move on with his life, his secret both haunts him and sees him at risk of exposure to a public unable to forgive.Although it is increasingly famous for reality shows and trash, Channel 4 do still screen strong films on important or controversial subjects. Recently one such film was Boy A, which takes the fictional tale of a young man released from prison into a new identity to protect him from retribution. It is a delicate subject to say the least and it is certainly not one that we are used to considering from the point of view of the guilty party. So Crowley's film is indeed worth seeing, even if it is only so that the viewer can be forced to view Jack as a person and not as evil incarnate. Having said that though, nobody is saying that the act of murder should be forgiven as a childish mistake and indeed the film doesn't make it easy to accept his actions ? the murder is not graphic but is disturbing and powerfully depicted and I did feel quite ill at it.Channel 4 did a similar (in style) film last year about a paedophile (I forget the name) but they concluded it the same way, with the suicide of the main character. It is a very tidy conclusion perhaps but here it fits as it seems like there is no other answer. The viewer is given the best overview possible but even still I found it challenging. It is clear that Jack is not the monster that he is painted as in the tabloids but then at the same time his actions are hard to take, even if the flashbacks do a good job of providing an understanding of how it occurred. The director and scriptwriter have a difficult job of bring off this complexity and they do well, both providing the tools to the cast to then deliver the goods.In this regard Andrew Garfield does very well with an assured and convincing performance. His hopes are touched with fear and he brings this out really well, fearful of attention and unsure of himself in a world that he has never experienced as an adult. It is a great performance that is a key part of making this material challenging in knowing where "right" is. Mullan provides famous support and he does have an interesting character but he always feels like he is on the sidelines, offering his name as much as his performance to the film. Lyons and Evans are more useful and are convincing as people ? it is only at the very end where the script hands Lyons a rather clumsy final scene where she appears to struggle. Special mention also to the two boys who play Eric and Phillip; both are excellent with difficult dialogue and characters and they both nail it ? which was important for the film.Overall then a suitably dark and challenging film that doesn't give the viewer an easy opinion on anything. The leaning is very much away from the stance of the Daily Mail ("hanging's too good for 'em") but still the film doesn't make it easy to totally forgive Jack. The delivery is strong across the board with particularly important and assured delivery from Garfield and the two boys in the flashback scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenging drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sensitive drama about a young man released from prison after serving time for his part in a brutal crime years earlier must rank as one of the best British films of the year. Boy A follows 'Jack' as he starts his new life, supported by his social worker/mentor (a superb Peter Mullan). His struggle to fit back in to society, whilst still living with the guilt of his unforgivable crime, is beautifully realised by Andrew Garfield, definitely an actor to watch in the future.The film is morally complex and challenges the viewer without being pointlessly provocative (resonances with the Bulger case will still make this painful viewing for many people). The character of Jack is, perhaps, a little too sympathetic; he is portrayed as a very tender, shy and naive man, almost still child-like, despite having spent many years in prison. Only occasionally do we see a violent side to Jack's nature and his part in the pivotal crime is not made explicit (though is all the more chilling because of this).This is a quality film on all counts, with the cast working well with a solid script and sensitive direction; indeed it's hard to see why this didn't get a UK cinema release as it stands head and shoulders above much of the clichéd dross churned out by the British film industry recently. This is a haunting, thought-provoking film that deserves a wide audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just Staggering. When you first watch the trailer of Boy A and read its synopsis, you might expect a kind of sanctimonious movie but once you've seen it all the way through, you realize that beyond this first aspect, it is much more of a wrenching movie that gets under your skin. Andrew Garfield's amazing performance as Jack, the main character, is one of the reasons why this movie is a masterpiece. I think that he really managed to figure out what someone like Jack feels like and to transmit that feeling to the audience. He is just stunning and although I haven't seen the other movies he's played in, I guess we could say that he's at the top of his game in this one since his acting could not have been any better. He successfully tried to express happiness, naivety, love, hope and desperateness without overacting and we all know that in that kind of role, it's really easy to slip to something overplayed that turns the character's truthful sadness into something you make fun of. Here though, he is truly endearing and we are more than just witnesses. We're most likely to put ourselves in Jack's shoes and this way, we get the opportunity to share his feelings and concerns. That is probably why this movie will stay etched in your memory for quite a long time. It really moves you and gets under your skin. I doubt anyone would ever forget about that poor and sympathetic Jack after having seen the movie. Some supporting stories appeared sort of useless to me though. For instance, I didn't really understand why Terry and his son's story was put forward once or twice whereas the link to the main story is too slight to make it truly interesting. It could have been so if it had been put forward more throughout the movie. At the beginning, we expect Jack to be successfully released back into society and we really believe in the kind of fairy tale we think is about to happen. Imagine our astonishment when we find out that his past catches him up through a heroic action and leads him to death! Our belief in the thorny topic of redemption in this world is being challenged and we get a rather negative portrait of society. The notion of Past is also questioned and the movie makes you think about whether we can actually forget our past and move on with our life despite our misdeeds, or if our past and our present are always eventually brought back together and come down to one same thing. Boy A is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen and I will remember Andrew Garfield's for a long time. It definitely is a thoughtful movie so if you do not feel like watching that kind of movie, well don't! It is a must-see to me though, that's for sure.Baptiste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A challenging perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film which forces you to think differently. Boy A completely shifts its focus from the typical media perspective and instead chooses to concentrate on the one(s) being vilified.Before watching Boy A, I reminded myself about the facts of the James Bulger case. It's painfully clear that this film was intended to force viewers to have a new perspective on the case and its perpetrators: Venables and Thompson. In both the film and the case, there are: two schoolboys skipping class and getting up to no good, an unspeakable act of sheer horror, and prosecution by both the judiciary and mainstream media. The most heartbreaking allusion that the film makes to the case, though, is in its use of the train tracks. The train tracks are where James Bulger, at only two years old, was sickeningly abused and ultimately killed by the two boys, depicted by the media at the time as Child A and Child B.Both Eric and Philip have very troubled backgrounds and as a result their morals and values have been entirely skewed. Eric, at least, seemed to lose his sense of knowing right from wrong the longer he was around Philip and subject to his brash, violent nature; the more exposed he was to Philip, the more detached he became from humanity.Was Eric a bad person? From everything we've seen, no: it seems as though an abusive father, a detached mother, an unsupportive and inadequate school system, and bullying all had a detrimental impact on the growth and development of this young boy. Eric did kill (or at least take part in the killing of) a schoolgirl, and took part in some other very violent acts too; however, this only occurred after he had been exposed to and influenced by Philip for some time. Jack, on the other hand, is one of the most friendly, caring, and vulnerable individuals you'll ever see on-screen - he is totally at odds with Eric. This juxtaposition is excellently handled by the director through the use of flashback to simultaneously introduce us to both Eric and Jack whilst distinguishing the two.Additionally, it must be noted that the schoolgirl whom Eric and Philip kill is not revealed to be entirely innocent, kind, or vulnerable. Instead, she's portrayed as an arrogant, rude, distasteful little girl. Her attire and well-spoken nature lead the audience to believe she's from a wealthy background, whereas Eric and Philip are the complete opposite. This makes it even more difficult to watch as we know that the schoolgirl is the victim, but ultimately so are Eric and Philip.A scene which I found especially perplexing was the one in which the pair of them catch a fish and Philip then proceeds to beat the fish within an inch of its life, only to toss it back into the water. He admits that he knows the fish won't survive, yet he's still chosen to release it back into the water rather than show it mercy. This speaks volumes for the way in which young offenders are handled in the justice system. Is rehabilitation truly effective? Can it have a beneficial impact on the offenders? Or by the time they're finally released back into society has the damage already been done too significant?The drawing we see at the end of the film by the little girl indicates that she sees Jack as a hero. This further reinforces the idea that it's all a matter of perspective. In a past life, Eric used his knife to kill a schoolgirl; but to this little girl, Jack is a hero who used his knife to save her. This stark contrast goes to show how much an individual can change, as Jack's mentor, Terry, identifies when he reflects on how far Jack has come since he met him all those years ago. This notion, then, seems to answer the questions raised earlier in the film as to whether or not rehabilitation is actually effective: we can see from Jack's behaviour and his progress that rehabilitation can and does work. Unfortunately, though, once someone has been broken into so many pieces and they've been put back together, it only takes the most gentle upset for it all to come crashing down again.In the end, we're led to believe that he jumped. Jack admits that, as Terry often told him, Eric is dead - in his past. But now that his past has been brought up again, it has consequently resulted in the destruction of Jack: his new identity. This leads him to a sense of hopelessness as he realises he's trapped between two worlds and they're collapsing against one another, pinning him in between until he shatters. This leaves us with a bleak message: we, the public, have ultimately caused Jack to take his own life. What makes this far more serious is that public intervention actually has resulted in the deaths of innocent people, such as Scott Bradley, who was wrongly identified as being Venables. As a result of his misidentification, he was harassed, vilified, and took his own life; an innocent man died at the hands of the public's persecution.If you enjoyed Boy A and the way it encouraged you to see from a different perspective, then I urge you to watch "The Dirties", which deals with bullying in schools and the consequences which can arise from neglecting to address it.All in all, Boy A is a highly thought-provoking and devastating film, which ask us to pause and reflect on our treatment of young offenders and consider that there may - and indeed likely is - more going on than that which is portrayed by the media. Only once we take a step back and contemplate our crucification of these children can we effectively pinpoint what causes such tragedies to occur and prevent them from happening ever again.

		<shortDescription>Evil comes of age ? Boy A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Centered around a young man, just released from prison for killing a young child?when he himself was only ten?the story shows how he deals with the guilt and the scrutiny of that event, attempting to build a new life as far away from the past as he can. With the help of a caseworker who has given him a new identity and history, Jack Burridge does his best to live life for the first time, to experience what it is to be happy. However, no matter how hard he tries to leave that defining moment behind, one can never forget the fact that while he may be able to start over again, the victim of his crime will never get that chance.The team of director John Crowley and writer Mark O'Rowe have adapted a novel into the cinematic world, using visuals to express what words needed to on the printed page. It all starts pretty straightforwardly as we are introduced to the players, and Jack begins his life and new job, meeting friends and learning about new technologies and whatever else he missed while in prison. However, once he sees a computer-generated photo of himself, aged from an old picture as a child, the façade he has tried so hard to build into his reality starts to fall apart. Seeing himself on the news makes it very hard to forget about his true identity, Eric Wilson, and flashes of memory creep into his consciousness. Crowley never hits us over the head with these glimpses into the past, but instead teases us with short cuts, Jack trying to shake the images from his mind, before finally playing the scene out. Even when they are shown in their entirety, one can never know if what's on screen actually happened or whether he has fabricated some of the details. It is an effective way to show the inner turmoil as the life around him falls apart and the one he left behind comes ever closer to the surface.It becomes a case of absolute irony that him saving a little girl from a car crash serves as the final nail in the coffin that is his ultimate discovery. A killer becoming a hero, a publicity photograph for his place of employment puts his image out for anyone to see, including people connected to those trying to help him, people who may feel the need for misguided revenge. Boy A truly comes into its own when Jack's identity is brought out into the open, but the journey to that point is by no means inferior to the frenetic emotional tailspin portrayed in the final half hour. When a friend is sucker-punched at a club, should he look the other way or involve himself in a fight that could only bring memories of the bullying and beatings he received as a child? When a woman opens her heart to love him, should he feel guilty that she is in love with a person that doesn't exist, with a killer? That first date at Michelle's house is a devastating scene, showing Jack naked, literally and figuratively, vulnerable and completely unaccustomed to what love could be.While the storytelling delivers a powerful tale, it is the acting that brings those words and events to light. Andrew Garfield is fantastic as Jack Burridge, awkward and shy, reconciling his past with his future. When you see his childhood in flashbacks and realize the pain and suffering he was put through, it is tough to argue why he would befriend someone as troubled and unpredictable as Philip Craig. Here is someone that finally makes him feel a part of something, wouldn't you do all you could to keep that alive? It's a pretty harrowing scene when we finally are able to see how the murder went down. It doesn't show anything as far as definitive proof that young Eric was an active participant, but you can imagine from what is seen that he didn't stop it. He was a child then, and in many ways a child still, and Garfield portrays that perfectly.I also really liked Katie Lyons' Michelle, a pretty and confident girl that shows Jack what could be in the future, that perhaps he really isn't a monster after all. Shaun Evans was great as Chris too, coworker and friend. He played the role as a fun guy, someone that could cause trouble, but in an innocent way. Not angered when he gives Jack ecstasy to his dismay, forgetting his friend is on parole, and trying to help whenever is possible, Chris is a character that you believe would forgive Jack for his past, if he had the time to do so. It is the always top-notch Peter Mullan that ends up stealing many scenes, though. As Jack's caseworker Terry, he is there at every turn, a surrogate father for the boy and the strongest cheerleader he has. His part in the uncovering of his identity is absolutely tragic, and his final scene in his car all the more heartbreaking as a result.Boy A is a film that will stick with you once it ends. With a conclusion as powerful as any other this year, watching may be tough to endure, but you will understand why it all must end how it does. Jack Burridge was a real person, despite the past he would have to live with. As Terry said at the start, Eric Wilson was dead. That boy who murdered a classmate no longer existed, but was replaced by a young man out of jail for car theft, a man looking to rebuild his life. Orchestrated to perfection, Crowley and O'Rowe conclude the film with the reactions of those who grew to love Jack, whether the goodbyes are real or imagined, they are never false.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Burridge: "I ain't that boy..." Having been institutionalized for most of his life, Jack (Andrew Garfield) is finally released from prison at the age of 24. He and another boy murdered a child when they themselves were children. The film follows Jack's attempts to readjust to the world outside of confinement and restart a life which never really got going.Under the fatherly mentoring of Terry (Peter Mullan), his parole contact and social worker, he experiences a coming of age, which would normally have happened years ago. Forces from the past are constantly upon him. As we learn more about the events leading up to the crime which has ruined so many lives, there is an increasing sense of suspense, intrigue and ultimately doom: the tabloid press and Terry's real son are not going to let things lie.Definitely one of the best films I've seen this year. This came as a shock to me because I have never heard of this film beforehand. But because of the buzz that's been circling around this film I decided to buy me a copy of this one and man, was I surprised. This film tackles the idea of second chances and starting life all over.Boy A is visually stunning. The acting is astounding, credit goes to up and coming talent Andrew Garfield and the raw emotion that he invested in the character. It was very convincing and all the while, heart breaking. He carries the film from start to end and you can't help but notice his presence from the get-go.It just goes to show that you don't need big explosions and loud, noisy scenes to make an excellent movie. With all the rubbish Hollywood's been releasing these days, its nice to see films like these just circling around, silently building its audience fan base and through the word of mouth, it spreads and it spreads. Boy A is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Boy A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess this subject had already been explored a number of times recently - how convicted criminals, upon release from their jail term, attempt to re-integrate themselves back into society. With Little Children and The Woodsman, we essentially have pedophiles who were released and had to deal with deep rooted prejudice and non-forgiveness in the community they reside in. But what if this criminal is a killer? Based on the novel by Jonathan Trigell, "Boy A" refers to the unnamed boy who cannot be positively identified during the trial as he's a minor. After serving significant time behind bars, we see him being released from prison, and working with his counsellor Terry (Peter Mullan), he adopts a new identity as Jack Burridge (Andrew Garfield). This is not only for an opportunity to start life afresh with a totally new and made up background, but to serve as a mask of protection against retributive attacks by the case sympathizers, or by the family members who may be out for their own brand of justice served.But of course this is no action movie, so scrap those thoughts of having a man on the run, with contract killers on the loose. What we have here instead is a touching exploration of a teenager's despair at trying to recalibrate his life after the chilling crime committed at an age where he was influenced by best pal Philip Craig (Taylor Doherty). And here's where Andrew Garfield's ability got tested to the max, where he constantly has to live a lie, and finds it extremely hard to work at, and obtain the trust of others, always having to deal with the niggling feeling that he's not being totally honest, and with romance in the picture with Michelle (Katie Lyons), it just complicates things. Fate allows him to redeem himself, but one wonders if that is enough, and whether one good deed can free oneself from the sins of the past.Garfield's charismatic presence will engage you from the get go as he carries the movie through from start right up until the end, and kudos too to the editing and direction set to weave what's essentially two story arcs seamlessly together, with the current timeline, and one which looked at the mysterious past where events were presented a little bit at a time. We see how the two young boys evolve over time in their spiral downwards in morality, and even so the dastardly crime doesn't get shown verbatim, but only through a fishing reference, which will cause the audience to question how culpable Jack was with his involvement in the crime.Running parallel to Jack's story is that of Terry the counsellor was well, being estranged from his wife, and having to address the disappointment he has with his own son. It's not hard to see how close he is to Jack, and how under his care or lackof, would develop inside each boy as the story went along. And this character study also extended to various supporting characters as well, especially one whose promise to another seem to ring hollow the minute you hear it, which just makes it a little bit more heart-wrenching when you see Jack's nonchalant response, as if pre-emptive, and in the know.So, yellow ribbon project? I suppose the reality of it is that it still boiled down to the crime itself, and just how tolerant society is toward it in a case by case basis. Don't let this gripping drama slip you by, it's powerful stuff that will continue to pose questions for discussion way after the end credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming of age between good and evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andrew Garfield, an English actor born in LA, has the reedy boyish looks of the young Tony Perkins but without Perkins' edge of craziness. He stood out in the otherwise lackluster 'Lions for Lambs.' As the protagonist of this gritty new movie, Garfield plays a tough role compellingly, grabbing our sympathies even though the guy he plays has a terrible past. His character was complicit in the murder of a young girl at the age of eleven, and has just gotten out after many years of detention. In the opening scenes, Terry (the excellent Peter Mullen), his case-worker and mentor, helps him settle in the north of England, in Manchester, with a job and a new name. He was Eric Mullen. He becomes Jack Burridge. Garfield's sudden bashful smiles in the intense early scenes with Mullen make "Jack" appear to be a remarkably innocent young man--eager to make good.These scenes between Garfield and Mullen establish sympathy for Jack as a painfully tentative, sensitive, and threatened young man and set a hushed, serious tone. Jack's overwhelmed by Terry's gift of a new pair of appropriately-named Nike "Escapes," and he doesn't even know how to order a meal at a diner. He's haunted by nightmares and his new room is frighteningly stark. Nonetheless things go unbelievably well for Jack pretty quickly with the job and Michelle. The film puts us in his corner.Finding a roadside accident while making a delivery with a coworker in his new job, Jack rescues a young girl--dramatically showing off his positive side. He's a hero. It's good publicity for the company too.But this good deed is dangerous because it gets Jack's picture in the papers. Even though he was tried for his crime anonymously as "Boy A" and in the eyes of the state has been rehabilitated, there are people out there who know Eric Mullen has been released and want to hunt him down. His boss, who's aware he was in prison but not what for, has assured him on his first day at work that everybody deserves a second chance. But the truth is, for some crimes, people throw that rule away. No second chances for what the tabloids call a "monster." The mainstream media seems to altogether reject this young man's right to a new identity. Not everyone believes in rehabilitation.Besides which Jack must struggle to hide his complete ignorance of non-institutional life. All at once he must learn to work an ordinary job, hang out with coworkers and party with them on the weekend; and hardest of all, when a woman at work called Michelle (Katie Lyons) takes an immediate liking to him, he must handle dating, sex, and a serious relationship.Meanwhile periodic flashbacks pull us back to Eric's dark early years. His abusive father swills whiskey in front of the TV and his mother is withdrawn, dying of breast cancer upstairs. He's shy withdrawn and, seeking comfort from the bullies around school who hound him, he becomes friends with the nasty, more confident Phillip (Taylor Doherty), a kid long sexually abused by his own brother, who teaches Eric petty thievery. While Jack's getting closer to Michelle, we're getting closer to the young Eric, though the actual crime he and Philip committed isn't shown till near the film's end.The scenes with Michelle navigate a nice line between the matter of fact and the achingly sincere as in early encounters Jack goes too far, can't perform, and then is intensely excited. Lyons conveys Michelle's experience along with her appreciation of Jack's naive warmth and sweetness. Again he is overwhelmed when she gives him a nice present. Then when they both declare their love, he aches to tell her the truth about himself. It seems a betrayal not to. But Terry, whom Jack calls whenever he's in need of advice, assures him he cannot.Crowley, who won a Tony for his direction of Martin McDonagh's brilliant play The Pillowman, gets uniformly fine performances from the cast and Rob Hardy does fine, atmospheric camera-work that conveys a sense of the gritty north that may recall Corbijn's 'Control.'The film is well edited but may seem to move too fast. As was true of native Irishman Crowley's Dublin film Intermission, the dialog is hard to follow at times--for an American anyway. Some plot elements, such as the highway rescue, and Terry's no-account son who becomes a contrast to Jack, are a little obvious. 'Boy A' becomes a bit of a thriller at the end and its direction feels rather deterministic. The film isn't meant to be about action but states of mind and degrees of moral certainty. Luckily the acting feels so immediate that we're not left with any sense of being manipulated. Though this hero comes from a darker place, we're firmly in Ken Loach territory, and the able Mullen in fact has worked well for Loach himself.This quietly powerful English film presents serious moral and practical issues. If a criminal has served his time, does he deserve a new life? How can he achieve that anyway? In a small country like England, it's not easy to hide. Distances may not be long enough to outrun one's past. To what emotional lengths must one go to be safe under such circumstances? At 24, is a full life forever to be denied because of an act at the age of 11? Mark O'Rowe's screenplay, adapted from Jonathan Tribell's 2004 novel--itself loosely based on the experiences of Mary Bell and the Bulger killers--can't altogether sidestep the source book's manipulativeness. But what it can do in compensation is present splendid performances and a realistic feel that leave viewers troubled and pensive rather than brainwashing them.Garfield delivers a breakout performance and he's already received a BAFTA award for it. He deserves to be remembered when other awards are given out this year, and we're sure to be seeing more of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An important message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not entirely sure why some have said this film has stayed with them in a depressing way. Perhaps it is easier for some to have cut and dried, black and white views about certain things. Life of course never fits into those type of parameters; which have been paved by a non-thinking 'justice' system and continued by a pack mentality.This film challenges generalisations; keeps you on the edge of your seat with no clue of what will unfold next. It stays away from clichés and works only on allowing us into the depths of this main character's psyche. It is a rare treat to watch a film which neither lies to us, nor makes judgments. We simply see a snapshot of a young man's life, interlaced with his history. There are plenty of disturbing scenes and I did cry a lot watching this film. Mostly the bits which show such severe neglect of the young boys. Unfortunately this kind of neglect IS a reality in our society and that's one of the reasons this film is important. There are very very few human beings who randomly decide to be violent (psychopaths - humans who are unable to experience empathy, being probably the only example of such). Almost ALL violent behaviour stems from abuse and is a learned/copied response.The only antidote is love. I have seen a webpost which may or may not be accurate but it states that there is a tribe in Africa who respond to negative behaviour with love only. This is the only response which could work. Forgiveness IS the only way and I feel this film really conveys that message. It leads us to have compassion for a man who was severely abused as a child and who may or may not have contributed to the murder of another child. We're never actually told if he did hurt the girl but the point isn't whether or not he did the point is that we can see that he never would NOW, that it's not in his nature to inflict pain. Like his social worker says; this young man deserves happiness and anybody watching the film will be compelled to agree.There is no shame in feeling love for a vulnerable, abused human being. We should never be concerned to feel compassion or care for another. An abused dog which bites will be forgiven by most and a human should be given the same chance. A wonderful film. Oh and exemplary acting throughout from all. I particularly loved the social worker and his story also. He was a beautiful, rich character. Bravo to the film makers for championing the underdog and taking on such a sensitive and controversial subject. {from a thinker who loathes the media for the needless negativity it propagates}</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is astounding. I was mesmerized throughout, and the performances are so rich that I'll have to see it again to fully appreciate it.Only the last scene between Jack and his former girlfriend seemed somewhat forced, and perhaps it was added lest the bleakness of the ending be unbearable. But when Jack goes to his favorite Brighton pier to commit suicide after he's been exposed as a child murderer and his new life has disintegrated, it's extremely improbable that on the same pier he'd encounter the girlfriend who dropped him after that exposure, and even more improbable that he'd go ahead and commit suicide after he learned that she still had feelings for him and seemed to be reconsidering their relationship. But I can find no other flaws in this remarkable film, probably the best I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>emotionally dishonest, missed masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story in a few words: 24-years old Eric Wilson gets a second chance (and a new identity as Jack Burridge) after serving 14 years for a crime he committed as a kid. Turns out he's a child-murderer, and that revelation, along with his own sense of guilt, ends up ruining whatever future he might still have had at that point.In my humble opinion this film could have been a masterpiece, maybe a classic even. The actors give some quite damn convincing performances, the imagery and score really help set the right mood, and the narrative flow, although a bit awkward, doesn't really get in the way of enjoying the film for all the good that it has to offer.What absolutely ruins this film for me however, is that it tries way too hard to be an "eye-opener", and knowingly plays with your feelings so as to trick you into believing that *you* are, in fact, the monster. It's like the whole film, from beginning to end, just keeps whispering in your ear "hey, you, remember those two little bastards who abducted, tortured and murdered the 2-year old child? oh, remember that feeling of righteous hatred, the deep repulsion you felt back then? well guess what, you insensitive jerk? you were too quick to judge! see, the kids were actually victims themselves, and with that judgmental attitude of yours you're only helping perpetrate the injustice", all the while presenting you with a protagonist who's surprisingly easy to sympathise with - probably because he's nothing like the actual person that inspired him.It's bad enough when a film tries to spoon-feed you a moral, but "Boy A" takes it a step further, because it does so through means of manipulation and deception, keeping you hostage of that very same conscience you're not supposed to have.</fullReview>

This engrossing film treats you to a wide array of emotions and forces you come to grips with some very serious and highly complex issues?. How should society handle a murder when its perpetrators are only 11 or 12 years old? One of my most cherished and appreciated qualities in any film is just how intensely issues and images from the film continue to ricochet around in your brain? and how prolonged that process ends up being! Primarily based on this key factor, BOY A gets a resounding 10 Stars! What is hardest for me to comprehend, in relation to this film is, that despite having dominated the BAFTA awards not all that many years back and showing an impressive 7.7 IMDb rating, it seems a sure bet that it has found a relatively limited U.S. audience! Soembody explain that to me?"like I were a six-year-old!" This is hard to watch without tearing up at some moments. Yet, I am convinced that Director John Crowley never strived to that end, it is just that the subject matter is such that it provides quite a number of emotional gut punches! Owing to Andrew Garfield's recent turn as SPIDERMAN, hearing his name probably would not illicit a knee-jerk, "Wow! What a great dramatic actor!" But here, in a role relatively near the beginning of his On screen career, his portrayal of a 24 year old who is re-released into society after being institutionalized For half of his life is deliciously nuanced and astoundingly impacting! It's really hard to find anything NOT to like with this British masterpiece! 10*....ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!

		<shortDescription>A powerful film, snubbed by Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes Boy A so compelling is the acting (or perhaps the illusion of NON-acting might be more appropriate). Andrew Garfield, Peter Mullan and Katie Lyons, the three principal characters in the film, are so believable that they become 'invisible' -- they 'disappear' -- as actors. Many directors have said this kind of immersion into a role is the ultimate compliment actors can pay to them.Boy A is an anti-Hollywood film, in that it eschews the usual glamour in favour of REAL people. Garfield is on the wrong side of plain-looking, Mullan is a balding, paternal working-class stiff ridden with familial conflicts, and Lyons is a plump, anti-glamorous non-heroine who is pitch-perfect in her role. Garfield, as the well-meaning young man desperately seeking a second chance in life, offers a towering performance. It's been awhile since I have seen such a powerful film. It asks the central question: is it possible for society to offer redemption to a 24-year-old rehabilitated man who 14 years before -- at the age of 10 --helped to murder a 10-year-old girl? This film examines the question with such a profound depth of feeling that if you let your mind wander a moment, you might think you're in the midst of a documentary. Boy A won a cartload of awards (direction, acting, writing, photography) from BAFTA, BAFTA Scotland, the Berlin International Film Festival, and the Irish Film and TV Awards. Last night (22Feb09), the Academy Awards were announced, with all the usual bumph for movies that were cynically (and deliberately) made for Oscar nominations. If the Academy Awards REALLY considered films for their sheer power, cinematic skill and philosophical point of view, Boy A deserved serious consideration.Director John Crowley, screenwriter Mark O'Rowe, and a terrific ensemble of actors deserve great credit. This is a splendid film.</fullReview>

Andrew Garfield plays the role perfectly and is backed up with a great cast. I don't want to go into details but the whole film captures its viewers and takes them through the highs and lows of the life of Jack. The ending was kinda predictable, but never the less it was fantastic in every way. Parts were hard to grasp but get ever more clear as the film goes on.Apparently this was never released in the UK, such a shame especially has it was based here in Manchester. If you haven't seen it already I would highly recommend it to anyone. It will change your mind on how you see similar people to JackTruly fantastic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>can he be seen without the crime?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So when can an ex convict be forgiven for the committed crimes- if ever? What is the appropriate punishment- Does it depend how severe the crime was, or how young the person is, or a mix of both? And how do we determine if the person in question is really rehabilitated and has fully repented for their crimes and is ready to re-enter the society? And even if the sincerity of the repent is clear, can it ever make up for the pain and suffering caused and especially the life taken away by their actions? Most of all, can this person ever be forgiven and seen apart from the crime they did? "A Boy" makes audience think about all of these questions - but if this wasn't enough, it adds another element to the difficulty: the ex con was a child when he committed the crime, ie killed a girl with his friend. Now the movie is beautifully shot, there's plenty of character development and covers all of the right bases, but it clearly sets of from the pre-established parameter where the character in question (Jack) has clearly repented for his crime - thanks in large to his social worker/mentor. But as we watch this gentle, sincere young man re-enter society, shyly order from a restaurant for the first time, eagerly makes first friends, does noble/heroic deeds, and meets his first gf, we never for once forget that he killed a little girl and the whole time you wonder: how would I react if I knew...People in his life do not know and accept him as a great guy, which I suppose he is, but once the truth comes out will they continue to? Will they be able to see him for the person he's become, will they think it was all an act/ charade, or will they simply not be able to see past his gruesome crime committed despite the new rehabilitated self? Well, suppose you'll have to watch the movie to find out, but best of all, it will also make you wonder and evaluate what you would do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Boy A' is a missed opportunity and that's all there is to say about it. The film has an intriguing beginning but it has no end or meat to this story. It's brave enough to ask questions but it isn't brave enough to really delve into a search for answers. It's brave enough to propose a brilliant character study but it's far too scared to really begin to scratch the surface of the character it proposes.It is no secret that 'Boy A' is inspired by the James Bulger murder case. The horrific story of two ten year olds murdering a 2 year old baby. The film is brave enough to begin to dramatize this but it's far too scared to acknowledge it. Andrew Garfield stars as Jack Burridge who used to be known as Eric Wilson, and he's the most cuddly misunderstood child murderer imaginable. He was led on by the treachery of others and grimaces at the sociopath warning signs of his buddy Phil. We are lead to believe through the flashbacks that little Eric truly wasn't violent and he merely found himself at the wrong place at the wrong time. Phil is so over the top in his sociopath warning signs that we are lead to believe he is a mini-Manson. What does this do? Well for starters it ruins whatever chance this film had at what it seemed to initially wanted to do. Wouldn't this story of guilt, sin, and redemption be so much better if Eric actually was guilty? What if during the murder he actually was complicit in a grave crime? What if he truly was violent? What if in this partnership there actually was a mutual tendency towards violence? Eric Wilson wasn't a bad kid, he merely had a bad friend. I wanted the film to be braver. I wanted Eric to truly have a monster within him that he had to face. Instead he is facing his past rather than his inner demons. This is well and good but it isn't what the film proposes.Garfield's performance lacks any restraint to it and so he engages in excess in a subtle way. His shyness is surprisingly blatant. We look at Garfield as if he is someone shouting out "Look at me but don't acknowledge my presence" I think Garfield is a decent actor but he's been given a weak character. He simply doesn't have anywhere interesting to bring this character. The film spends much of it's time building up to the secrets falling out of the bag. When this happens there isn't any conflict. Eric mainly walks around in a fog and acts on his first horrible impulse. The film doesn't give Eric the moment where he confronts his demons. The film is merely about him avoiding them and that is sufficiently disappointing.The film has some decent performances. I loved Katie Lyons as Michelle but the character is wasted. Above anything else we want Eric to face Michelle and beg her for forgiveness and the film doesn't have the courtesy to give us this moment. Instead we get an idealized fantasy in Eric's mind and so Lyon's brilliant performance is completely wasted. Peter Mullan's Terry is also a good character and has a dilemma. His son Zeb is a horrible drunk and he identifies with Eric as his son. He doesn't make a choice despite Zeb doing something horrible.This film could have been really special but it doesn't have the guts to really delve into it's rich propositions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie goes against the grain in showing that you can actually sympathize, root for, and feel for a murderer.Jack Burridge is not who he says he is. Having murdered a child as...a child, he was sentenced to fourteen years of prison, and was finally released back out into society, trying for forge ahead with a new identity and a new life. The question remains, though: Can someone with a heinous past REALLY move on? Andrew Garfield is absolutely heart-wrenching and spectacular in this movie. Throughout his excitement, fear, happiness and breakdowns, a lot of emotion is felt and portrayed and a connection is made with this character. We feel his pain, we root for him to move on, to grow, to lead a better life - even though he is technically a murderer (although a reformed one). The last twenty minutes were almost unbearable for me in a great way - for one, Andrew's acting was incredible and moving, and secondly, his emotional portrayal hit me hard in the heart and reduced me to a blubbering mess.Other standouts include Peter Mullan as Jack's "watcher" Terry, Terry's Son (i don't remember the actor's name)and Siobhan Finneran as Kelly - while most of the weight of the film was shouldered by Garfield, these three also managed to move the film along and make it even more enjoyable.It is a depressing film. And yes, I admit, the accents threw me off at first (but I love accents, and you will too). Don't give up on the movie just because there are some minuscule, non-comprehensible scenes or words. Don't give up on it because of it's bleakness. It is a true gem of a film in a sea of remakes and prequels and sequels. It's so unfortunate it wasn't publicized more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recap: As a young kid, Eric committed a terrible crime. Now, ten years later, years he spent behind bars, it is time to be released. But Eric has lost his youth, he haven't grown up really, and has lost some touch with the world. The one to guide him becomes Terry, giving him the hints what to do and not to do, in reality becoming the father Eric never really had. In addition, because of Eric's crime, there is a serious threat against his life, and Eric must start over with a complete new identity, he must begin his life as Jack. Nervously he starts to work, tries to get friends and even a girl. But his ultimate test is to forgive himself, build confidence and really believe he can fit into a society that certainly not has forgiven.Comments: A very strong, emotional and catching movie. It's traumatic from beginning to the end, and in some way very discomforting. Despite that it is impossible not to get involved with the movie. The acting is superb, especially Andrew Garfield's depiction of Boy A. It is easy to see how nervous and uncertain and fragile he really is. It is hard not to feel for him, despite his crimes.And therein lies the essence of the movie. Who and when deserves another chance? And who has the right to decide that? When, if ever, should society not forget, never forget, but forgive? In my own opinion, we as a society must forgive when someone, especially a child, has served their time. Vengeance doesn't help anyone, and as I read in some comments, a death can never repay another death. Two wrongs do not make a right. And if we as a society, rational and humane, condemn people to death so easily, what kind of society are we. Shouldn't we be better? Despite that it isn't har to understand the surroundings reactions, and even to some degree sympathize with it.As the movie follows the view of Jack, it takes a stand. But it doesn't give the answers, and that's a real strength. It only raises the questions above. We as viewers must make up our own minds. And despite telling the story from Jack's viewpoint it doesn't leave out much from the crime Jack committed, I can't really say it speaks favorably for him. That's logical, since Jack hasn't really forgiven himself and doubts himself. That's is the real strength of the movie, its honest and very powerful because of it.(Heavy spoiler alert) The end is gruesome and heartwrenching. When Jack's secret everyone fails him, his best friend that promised to be there for him no matter what. Michelle, the girl he has started a relationship with. His let go from work and journalists hunt him. His only fixture, Terry, has gotten his phone stolen and is unreachable. Only one person speaks out in his support, a little girl he saved from a car wreck. But the fragile Jack is thrown into depression and he flees to Blackburn. And this very end is emotionally very strong. At the end of a pier he meets Michelle again (most probably only in his own imagination) and she asks "Going this way?" and heads towards shore. And Jack answers "No".9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie about twenty-four year old Jack Burridge (née Eric Wilson), who has just been released from incarceration after having taken part in the murder of a young girl when he was about ten, is deftly presented. Before you know the true nature of Jack's crime you get to know him as a rather shy but likable fellow who is trying to reengage with society under the guidance of his compassionate rehabilitation mentor Terry (Peter Mullan). After being locked away for most of his youth Jack has to learn how to act as an adult and the movie does a wonderful job of showing his gradual progress from initially having trouble ordering from a menu in a restaurant, to getting a low-level job, forming friends, and ultimately developing an intimate relationship with Michelle, the secretary at his workplace. The development of Jack's relationship with Michelle is lovingly presented.Anticipating a potential public backlash against a child murderer being set free, Jack had been give new identity and resettled in Manchester. Terry warns him *never* to reveal his true identity and Jack obeys this advice, even though he would like to come clean, at least to his lover. In the way the story is presented the audience does not know the details of Jack's crime until it is ultimately revealed to the public in the movie, and this is what makes the film so powerful. We as viewers are put in the same position as the people in the film upon knowing of Jack's crime. How do we feel about him now? Would we tend to isolate ourselves from him? Could we come to accept him as fully rehabilitated? Adding to any possible ambivalence we might have about Jack the film does not let us off the hook easily, since we never know more than that Jack was complicit in the murder perpetrated by him and a bullying, violent friend. Minimally Jack was a willing observer. At trial each boy (known as "Boy A" and "Boy B") blamed the other, and the verdict was to convict them both.It seemed to me that the film encourages us to believe that Jack had served his time, was rehabilitated and deserved a chance to have a new life. But, how would you react if you found out that your best friend or lover had been a child murderer? To what extent should one be held to account for the sins of his youth? Can a child murderer ever hope to escaped being dogged by his past? Peter Mullan is excellent in the role of Terry and there is an interesting subplot that is developed between him and his son. I admit to turning on the English subtitles to decode some of Mullan's Scottish accent.The final improbable scene between Jack and Michelle in Brighton I took to be a meeting as Jack would have imagined it, or how such a meeting would have gone if it were to have taken place.It is hard to find much fault with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent acting, excellent film, beats many American movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brilliant but chilling movie about a 23 year old who is released from jail after spending more than 10 years in prison for a crime he committed as a child. The names and some of the events have been changed but it's a movie about the James Bulger case in England in 1993. James Bulger was a four year old who was murdered by two 10 year old boys and left on railway tracks to make it look like an accident. I was12 when the case happened. I remember it well. We actually talked about it in school. We were all kind of haunted that kids our age could commit murder.The movie itself is very good. Andrew Garfield is excellent as "Jack" who takes on a new identity, a new home and a new job when he relocates to Manchester. He brings a lot of sympathy to the role of a troubled 23 year old who can't forget the boy he once was and what he did.Peter Mullan is also excellent as Terry who becomes Jack's surrogate father and guides him in his new life. Terry himself has troubles with his own son who was estranged from him for many years.The boys who committed the murder are shown in occasional flashbacks. They give quite a performance as troublesome kids. They're rebellious as most boys are at this age. The question I suppose the movie asks is what separates normal, rebellious boys from murderers. In this case it's Phillip who was the true sociopath and Jack/Eric who goes along with him because he doesn't have any other friends at the time.This is definitely a dark movie. The movie is pretty sympathetic to Jack who is supposed to be Jon Venables judging from the mugshots of the two real boys.The British justice system is quite different from the American one which we're continually bombarded with. The movie asks the question whether Jack really gets a second chance. The viewer is constantly reminded about how difficult it is for him to leave his past behind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>UnexpectedOn the one hand, i enjoyed the film Boy A.I found the actor's performance amazing especially Garfield's one which is outstanding.He has captured all Jack's emotions and transfers them to the viewers with sincerity.Besides the drama is very realistic,I am not sure if it is true or not but it might be based on a true-to-life story.Furthermore,the drama is full of suspense and tensions, it tells a wonderful story,strange and sad but very well directed. In short, I liked the way that the director shows that it is hard to begin a new life after that kind of childhood.To my mind this drama gives "food for thought",it makes you think about having a second chance and about giving a second chance to someone too.I have also appreciated the message conveyed by the drama which is that redemption is impossible and that you can not escape from your own misdeeds.On the other hand, some elements of Boy A disappointed me, like the way how flashbacks are integrated to the plot,sometimes it is a bit boring and you feel lost. For instance, the discussion between Jack and Michelle before he commits suicide or the scene when Jack is under the influence of drugs are far-fetched. Moreover, I did not like the stress put on Jack and Michelle's carnal relasionship.To sum up, I think the ending was too predictable, it is not that the story is too sad and that it would be better to make a happy end but just that the end does not square very well with a so original and unusual film.In my opinion,this film is not a phenomenon but it is a great drama which is very realistic and poignant, it is thanks to the very good acting of the cast and the editing. This drama was totally unexpected to me,I would never thought that it would be so dark just by watching the trailers but I was surprised in a very good sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can even the most unspeakable crimes be forgiven? That's the main question posed by "Boy A," a powerful, if slightly flawed, film.With a new name and background, Jack Burridge (Andrew Garfield), is released from prison for committing a murder as a child. With the help of Terry (Peter Mullan), Jack gets a job, makes some friends (including a girlfriend), and has a hopeful outlook on life. But a photograph causes everything to collapse.This is fine film-making. Armed with a powerful story, a cast of fine actors (including a very fine performance by Andrew Garfield), there was little chance that John Crowley could make it any less effective than the material calls for. Sadly, though, Crowley's directing choices are really the only thing that hurts the film. To be sure, the first hour or so is not flawless (the subplot about Terry trying to reconnect with his son is not as compelling as the main story). Additionally the accents are so thick that at times subtitles are almost a necessity. But the ending, while still packing a punch, relies too heavily on coicidence for it to retain its true power (this could be blamed on Jonathan Trigell, who wrote the book that the film is based on, but Crowley could have made it seem less jarring).While the story is powerful in and of itself, it wouldn't be nearly so without an array of sympathetic characters. Jack Burridge is "Boy A." Present in nearly every scene (at one age or another), he holds this film together. Thankfully, he is played by a highly capable actor named Andrew Garfield. Garfield nails the performance; the nervousness, the feeling of being a fish out of water, all that. Garfield gets it all. Some may think that the first hour is too long, but I found Jack to be such an interesting and likable character that I found it a breeze. Peter Mullan gives solid support as Jack's support line. Like Jack, he has his own demons (don't these characters always have them in these movies?). Then again, his aren't as big or as dangerous as Jack's. Katie Lyons makes a nice romantic pairing with Jack, and Shaun Evans is aimiably affable as Chris.The main problem with "Boy A" is that it is rather one-sided. In a case like Jack's, the answer is clear, but director John Crowley presents the character in such a manner that we question whether Jack really had anything to do with the crime at all. SPOILER AHEAD!!! The film would be more interesting and provocative if we actually knew that Jack had committed the murder. Or better yet, the murder could have been committed by Jack/Eric alone. Then again, that probably would have resulted in a different film altogether.Forgive me. I'm running off on a tangent. Make no mistake about it, this is a powerful film, and one that will not be easily forgotten.Note: Do yourself a favor, avoid the trailers. If you see those, you've more or less seen the movie. This film is highly character based, and very little of it is story-oriented. But then again, if you read this review, you've already seen the movie (at least in theory).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Astonishing!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly do not remember having seen such an amazing performance from so many actors in the same film in a very long time. Garfield has probably reached the top of his game with the role of Jack. He has the gift of transferring a huge amount of emotion to spectators. The support cast is, as its name points it out even if it is rarely the case, very supportive and plays a big part in the greatness of this astonishing movie. The only flaw I found is the decision of Jack's psychologist, performed by the talented Peter Mullan, about the life of this "boy" after prison. A psychologist advising to one of his patients to forget about his past to live a better life seems to me to have made a big professional mistake. Though the questions that Boy A raises are very deep and make people think about something they would never have considered differently before being asked to thanks to this film. As someone said it before, "it makes you feel sympathy for the devil". I also think that the surprising ending is what gives a real strength to this story. It happens so fast, you do not even have the time to cry...A film to watch at all costs!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely amazing performance from Andrew Garfield as Jack! One of the most poignant scenes in this movie was Jack looking at a picture of "Eric" that has been aged. The photo shows a nasty, snarling type of person, nothing at all like the person Jack has become. That scene made me cry the first of many tears.Here's a question that hasn't been posed (I don't think). Would Jack be the lovely, shy, thoughtful young man we know in the movie had he not been incarcerated and received the loving guidance and tutelage of Terry? The path his life was on as a young boy looked bleak and doubtless he would have got in with the wrong crowd, maybe in and out of juvenile detention centers. Perhaps he would have spent his life being bullied and marginalized.Really for me this story is about us all. If someone - anyone - had been there emotionally for those two young boys could they have been "saved"? Could the heinous crime have been prevented? Yes, they did something horrible - but does that make them monsters? By denying them their humanity we deny ourselves also.If you get a chance to see this film, take it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You can run away from your past but your past still follows you, it is the idea explored in Boy A. It is a thought-provoking film, I mean the subject is very offensive and Crowley talks about it with talent. Garfield's performance is outstanding, he conveys a big amount of emotion, we feel sympathy for Jack because he feels very bad about what he has done. Personally I think that he paid for that as the saving of the little girl shows. In the same time everybody loves Jack but hates Eric, it is shown by news in the media and these flashbacks which reappear in different parts of the film. Information mostly comes in pieces or in fragments, it is interesting because we discover Jack's life and Eric's life at the same time. Lyons's performance is, in my opinion, not very good though, I mean I am not touched by her actress' game. But the film has an intense and huge emotional impact. The way that Crowley directed the film is exceptional, it looks like a Leigh's film! However I really dislike the scene when Jack is dancing in a schizophrenic way? it is useless. We don't need it to understand that Jack wants to change, to run away from his past. I am also very disappointed by the very end, it is the main weakness of the film. I mean we have been expecting it since the scene when journalists stood in front of his door and this famous reward for finding him again. All in all it is a good film with a fascinating love story between Jack and Michelle and interesting bonds of friendship with Chris. Jack is trying to build up a new life and readjust to society and it is interesting to see how he is doing it. We must not forget that this film is about a true case!! I think that this film is awesome! There are some weaknesses but Jack and Terry convey huge emotion that makes us forgive these weaknesses. The subject is also very good and it denounces some social issues."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy A: a thought-provoking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the very beginning of the movie, I have been touched by Andrew Garfield's actor's game: he performs a very endearing character. In addition to that he is really handsome! His performance touched me deep inside because of the lot of emotion it conveys. This film perfectly shows that it is very difficult to forget our past, especially when our past is a troubled one. The sentence "you can run away from your past but your past can't run away from you" is a very beautiful one and perfectly defines the spirit of this film.From my point of view, this film is perfect; it is one of the best movies I have ever seen! It is flawless in everything: good plot, good actors and actresses, good director, etc. That is why I praised this film to all my family and all my friends. Even if after watching the movie I felt very sad.I hate the part when Jack is dancing in a schizophrenic way. I think it is weird and disappointing to see him like that even if it emphasizes the fact that this boy feels very bad. Personally I think this scene is very thought-provoking, perhaps it is just a way to keep my good opinion about Jack...I like Jack's love story with Michelle: they are so cute. I think there is so much tenderness between them. This love story puts the stress on the fact that Jack really wants to build up a new life and readjust to society. This film deals with the truth too. Are we supposed to say everything to our friends or is sometimes lying good? It is a good question! However, I was very disappointed by the end of the movie. I can't understand why Jack commits suicide because I wanted a good ending for him! I think he has paid enough for his crime. But no one can stop him from feeling guilty all his life... Nonetheless his suicide puts the stress on the fact he has no choice and it makes this film very emotional.All these elements make me think that Boy A is a stunning achievement and a moving gem!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Jack (Andrew Garfield) has just been released from prison, where he has been since the age of 10 after committing an horrific crime. He has been released under a new identity and the only person who knows who he really is is his case worker Terry (Peter Mullan.) He settles into a new job, gets some new friends and even starts a romance with a co-worker. But the threat of being exposed always looms over him and it's only a matter of time before the truth is out.Appearing out of nowhere with no publicity, this new Channel 4 film has an eerie reference to the Jamie Bulger case in the plot line. Needless to say, it's often rather unsettling viewing. But the trouble is, it's not as unsettling as it seems.It opens in a quiet, gentle fashion that plays at odds with the dark and disturbing theme we're exploring. The film can pull this off at times, but it doesn't feel like this enough for the type of film it is.A bad point out the way, lets move onto a good point. Maybe the lack of publicity was a good thing, as we're never quite aware just what the man's horrible crime actually is until at least a quarter of the way through as he's sitting watching the news with his landlord. This builds up a neat air of mystery and tension that serves as a nice side order to the heavy drama already on display. The film also does a good job of portraying the man's life as it is now while showing in flashback the event's leading up to what he did with his mate as a 10 year old as a back story. Sadly, this plays at odds with the actual story itself, which struggles to hold a coherent narrative flow all the time as a result.Ending on some good points, in the main role, Garfield manages to steal the show, as a young man who suffers crippling moments of guilt as he remembers his crime and throws himself into trying to start a new life. The supporting cast all also do a good job, but he's the star. And it ends on a neat bit of mystery, as he stands on the edge of a railing, wanting to throw himself into the sea, and we are left to decide for ourselves whether he goes through with it or not, perfectly rounding off a flawed but highly worthwhile drama about redemption and second chances. ***</fullReview>

They skip school and start doing petty crimes. After murdering a girl, Eric is named Boy A in the trial.His secret identity is revealed midway through the movie. I would have preferred it earlier so that the audience can appreciate Jack's inner conflict. A small part of the brutal attack should be in the opening without revealing the main culpability. It should shock the audience just like it did to Jack. The movie should be more definitive. Andrew Garfield is great. He has the looks of the boy next door but also is able to portray a troubled soul. He shows his great acting potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful drama about a boy that committed a hideous crime when he was a juvenile but he got tried as an adult. We all know stories like that in real life. I had to think about the Jamie Bulger case in England. The question that we are all asking ourselves then is if that kid will grow up as a normal guy once he served his sentence? Can he be rehabilitated? And most of all should people still be pointed at for the crime they commit after serving their sentence or are they allowed to start with a clean sheet? As a kid you should be given that chance once you come out, because their notion of good and evil wasn't formed like an adult yet. Jack Burridge is played beautifully by Andrew Garfield. I thought it was a very touching movie. The story keeps you captivated throughout the whole movie. To me it was a very good movie that I will probably watch again in the future.</fullReview>

He tries to lead a normal life, but his past is hunting him, along with the society. Boy A is a strong movie about how society can doom, someone. Warning, it doesn't have a happy ending, but it makes you think about some things. So there is a lot food for though. The story line is good, not confusing, and the performances are excellent, especially by Garfield. Simple script with depth, neat scenes and great settings are adding to the film a great atmosphere for the massage that it is dealing with.

		<fullReview>Andrew Garfield. WOW. Before the film I had only seen him in Spider-man so seeing him in a truly dramatic role was eye-opening. I'm really excited to see what he does with Scorsese in Silence. Make no mistake Garfield is one of the best young actors working today. This is a really dark film with some really dark themes. It is terrifically written and directed.The Mullan and Garfield dynamic really brings the film the lighter side it needs. There are so many dark scenes and ideas that seeing those two have their pleasant conversations give us a break from all the emotional material. When the synopsis reads: A boy who has a tragic past is released from jail only to find it very difficult to adjust to modern society. You know your getting a dark story, but it's even more depressing. The movie shouts remorse and forgiveness but even in the end there isn't much of it. It's heartbreaking seeing Garfield hang on to the edge of the bridge at the end of the movie, not knowing whether he will go through with committing suicide or not. I mean this whole movie is about a boy who had a rough childhood and more or less got caught hanging with the wrong boy and ended up committing murder, and then being released back into the real world with a new name and life, only to fall victim to being caught with lies. It was bound to happen, but knowing its coming didn't make it any less devastating.Garfield has a serious place among the best in the near future in Hollywood, and this is just one great example of the presence he has on screen. It is one great thrill ride that does leave you thinking for quite a while after, especially with the few unanswered questions.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remembered the first time I've watched this movie several years back. I was too young to appreciate the depth and the moral of the movie. I've watched a quarter of it, decided its boring and I changed the channel..... Man, I wished I have kept on watching. It is such a tragic movie of how it is hard to outrun your past. And I love how the issue of child offenders had been explored in the movie, where they are usually disregarded anywhere in the world, where they will be acquitted for their crime, serve their time, and just got lost in the system. Its hard for them to make a comeback in the normal environment. This story had depth, real issues, and the grief of unspoken sadness portrayed by Andrew Garfield was just so heartfelt for me. Definitely a good drama to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Social Masterpiece; Redemption, Change, Forgiveness; Andrew Garfield's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the perfect example of an underrated hidden gem, Andrew Garfield playing an Oscar-worthy role as a recently released man doing his best to begin a hard-earned, well-deserved new life after serving his sentence for murder committed as a young boy. This film gives a message that very few others even attempt to explore. It is the exception to the rule, a scenario in which an ex-convict can be rehabilitated. As depicted in "The Shawshank Redemption" (Although comparing these two great films would still be comparing apples and oranges), prison has its own subculture often ingrained as "real-life" by the time individuals are released, resulting in a struggle to survive with everyday things we take for granted- adapting to changed customs, technologies, even simple social cues. As if this does not make things difficult enough, the stigma, lack of trust, and overall negative treatment of these individuals is inevitable- regardless, really, of how they actually act. The question is whether it's even possible for them to return to a regular life. As to his actions as a young boy, I ask, What exactly was he guilty of? Misdirected loyalty to his best friend Phillip? Child neglect translated into criminal neglect? Brash disregard for the life of a young girl because of his conflicted ideas about belonging and friendship, right and wrong? That is, irrefutably, all he did- unless the final seconds of the murder (left to the viewers' imagination) were of something dramatically different than what young Eric Wilson's persona had shown so far. During all the other violent incidents with Phillip, Eric stood by with minimal contribution, at first shocked, then conflicted. Each time, you could almost see in his eyes the doubt, the guilt, the questioning of whether he should do something, then the acceptance that his best friend (whom he idolized to some degree) must know best. Eric was loyal until the very end, refusing to talk, although the truth would have reduced his charge significantly. It is never quite spelled out, but enough is shown for us to deduce that Terry was telling the truth when he promised Jack that Phillip committed suicide- albeit utilizing a loose definition of the word. The young men who hung him did so easily, as Phillip had given in and accepted his death; even welcomed it. Eric Wilson/Jack Burridge, undoubtedly the less culpable of the two, was on his way to his deserved new life. Until society ignorantly decided otherwise. More often than not, prisons breed criminals rather than house them. This makes it all the more remarkable when individuals are released as better men than when they entered. Jack is a portrayal of just such a anomaly. Pivotal words by Terry, Jack has "overcome obstacles that many if not most people would have fallen... Phillip had to come to terms with what he did; He took his own life because he was never able to do that. You did. You grew. You changed. You earned the right to be Jack Burridge. Because that's what this is. It's a f*cking right." Yet, as we see by the unfortunate conclusion of the film and as depicted by his courageously initiated (with no hesitation, might I add) rescue of the young Catherine Thompson, society takes that right away from him. And it is a shame. Such a shame. Obviously, a main theme explored here is that of child abuse and/or neglect, alcoholism, bullying, and other related issues. Phillip was abused by his brother, revealing this in quite a poetic way, describing how, in order to get through it, he would imagine a long hallway of many doors, watching each one close one by one, promising himself that if he could hold on until the last door, he would not cry at all. To me, the scale of Phillip's sociopathic tendencies is too great to be mitigated, although he is a victim of the adults in his life neglecting to seek help for him. Eric is also brought up by parents that seem abusive, at least verbally and through neglect. The result of this is him desperately clinging onto Phillip for guidance and friendship, similar to how impoverished children are likely to fall into the gang subculture and other such bad influences. Terry seems to be alcoholic, something that he seems to have passed down, or at least allowed to be passed down, to his son Zeb. Zeb, aside from having no ambitions, somewhat depressed, and increasingly alcoholic if not so already, is also hiding a sense of abandonment. Thus, when his father's words (When drinking, Terry lets it slip that "I love you, Jack. You are my greatest f*cking achievement.") more or less confirms this, his version of revenge is to expose Jack for who he is, later saying that if his father is choosing this murderer over him, his son, he hopes Eric Wilson/Jack Burridge suffers and gets what he deserves. This is obviously quite an impulsive and immature move on his part, and he may not have fully understood the implications of such a decision. The lighting, mise-en-scene, cinematography was stellar in this film. Subtle changes in lighting and angles at the right moments made all the difference. Most of the film was emotionally moving and tear-inducing, i.e. the final scene on the pier in which we see the result of society's blatant refusal to open its eyes, let alone to consider forgiveness. As he says goodbye to those important to him, Andrew Garfield concludes his truly masterful performance, with conviction and heart. I am not sure that anyone could really have saved him, although Michelle would have been his best shot. And why is this all so important? Because this is what the best of films do for us: they serve as bridges- igniting our synapses and neurons to think about real-life issues, concerns, relationships, problems, in ways we would never otherwise intuit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't really watched an intense movie in a while and it took watching Boy A to really make me aware of that fact. This movie was overwhelming. I didn't really know what to expect before watching this but I don't think there is anything I could have done to prepare myself for such a harrowing ride. The movie revolves around Jack/Eric an underage offender and we are introduced to him as he is just released from prison. He must integrate back into society under a false identity and at a difficult age considering what he's missed out on . The nature and extent of his heinous crime is slowly revealed to us making for a more dramatic film and it gives us a chance to develop a bond with his character before judging him straight away. When Jack/Eric is released from prison he has the naivety of a child and this is shown to us through his social interactions and how inexperienced he is with the most common tasks such as ordering food. This is actually a remarkable movie it's so authentic in every way possible the scene from the night out is all too familiar. When they were in the taxi reflecting on the night whilst being out of their minds.... well it was like deja vu. The director more than convinced me that Jack was entitled to a second chance no matter how atrocious the crime he had committed. He served his time, was remorseful, and by nature was not an evil person. He was just an underprivileged child in need of guidance and sought it in a best friend that was subjected to even more torment than he. An extremely intelligent movie, from the beginning everyone turned their backs on him and in the end nothing had changed leaving jack to feel as if he were alone once more with nowhere to turn. I have to add that I never liked Andrew Garfield as an actor but this was truly a riveting performance. He succeeded in capturing the intensity of his character and has forced me to reconsider my judgment of him.</fullReview>

A good solid film with excellent characters.The sets and locations provide a noticeably stark background, devoid of warmth. The story provides just enough unresolved mysteries to keep us wondering.

		<fullReview>The movie was just fantastic. The film maker finally created the movie about something nobody ever even tried to mention, the social rehabilitation of a murderer. It definitely got me thinking about the ethic of this situation, which is whether I should feel sympathy for Jack or not. and I still can't reach the answer. The problem I got is I would probably take the same action as Terry, Jack's boss, and Kelly if I were them. For example, if I knew Jack is really changed and ready to back to the society, I would try my best to protect Jack like Terry. and if I'm his boss and happened to know that Jack murdered a little girl in his past, I would fire him and ask him not to come to the work place never again in order to protect the rest of the workers and company's reputation.I'm just confused whether we should accept the "ex"-murderer to the society or not.First, I was like "Doesn't the law forbid disclosing the identities of minors involved in crimes? and they have the rights to have a ordinary life after they come out of jail. Isn't the media which tried to reveal his identity as a "ex"-murderer the one to blame?But more I think about the situation I came to the idea that I can't 100% believe the idea that they truly changed and will never hurt somebody again. Moreover, while a ex-con has a right to live peacefully, we also have right to live safely and eliminate those possible dangers around us.The only answer I got for this situation is there is no correct answer or perfect ethic, and that's why I want a lot of people to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Boy A" is a very difficult movie. It's also a very good movie?which makes it even more difficult. The story it tells, of Jack Burridge (a reformed convict who re-enters society after having served time in prison for a heinous crime he committed as a child), straddles the line between righteousness and sympathy. The film's narrative is structured perfectly? the story of the present-day Jack is intercut with flashbacks to his previous life as Eric, and just as our sympathy for Jack has reached its height, we are confronted with the grim reality of his past crime. Moral complications abound?just as Jack seems to have attained some stability in his new life, an act of selfless heroism thrusts him into the media spotlight, creating tragic implications. Andrew Garfield is masterful as Jack, and the largely unknown supporting cast is solid. Not a movie for those who like their films unambiguous, but if you've ever wondered what life might be like when your deepest, darkest secret is exposed, you will not be able to tear your eyes away from this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime and Punishment. But what about rehabilitation and a second chance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A horrible crime was committed. The young perpetrators paid their price in jail. One of them is about to be released and he'll try to start a new life. Everybody needs a second chance. But does everyone agree on that? Punishment was already made or it must be equal to the one he committed in the past? In the amazing "Boy A" Andrew Garfield plays the title role, his name while during his trial for killing a child, along with a friend. Now he's out of prison, with a different name, Jack, and he's going to rebuilt his life along with his protective rehabilitation worker Terry (Peter Mullan) who'll help him find a job and everything he needs. Simple as that? No. Jack is still haunted by the ghosts of the past, often reminding of how he end up doing what he did and also thinking his future might be ruined if people discover the truth. His work colleagues and his girlfriend know he did something to be imprisoned but they don't know what. Things would be the same if he reveals the truth to them, now that he's settled, quite happy and things aren't so tough anymore? But destiny has its odd surprises...Carefully constructed over an quiet, dramatic and tense atmosphere "Boy A" moves to so many directions without being confusing or problematic. It moves back and forth with Jack's new life and his life as a kid, giving us through the whole film an incredible sense of doubt if he really did committed a murder or not. The story greatly presents themes of redemption, love, friendship, humanism, it's all good but I had the sense that somehow, if you look carefully and closer to the elements given here in this story, you'll find some issues that can and will bother some viewers (although I think almost anyone haven't noticed such issues). Here they come: Sure, it's totally laudable to tell a story about someone who made a mistake, now needs a second chance, we can care about those things, we feel sorry for the young man. I know this was adapted from a book so they had to follow it's base but here's where my point of view tries to reach: Would we care for this film if Jack was portrayed by a more average type of actor, not so cute like Garfield or of a different race? Maybe, maybe not but it certainly would have less importance than this film has and "Boy A" is a great achievement because Andrew Garfield does an extremely convincingly job in the main role, and that was used by the director as a way to manipulate their audiences in the sense you must forgive the criminal, you can't condemn him to more punishments than the ones he already got. And you do feel lots of sympathy towards Jack/Garfield that's why I think the challenge made the film worth it (to an incredible number of viewers just look at the positive reviews here on the site) but this same cause might not work to some people, specially close-minded ones. Please don't get me wrong because I'm giving these remarks and a 10 star rating for this film; it's not contradictory. I'm just like what Terry is to Jack, he knows the young guy is imperfect, knows what he did but he cares for him in high esteem, no matter what. Same thing here between me and this film! Now launched as the new Spiderman and the memorable Eduardo Saverin of "The Social Network", Garfield must be highly noted for his performance here. If you haven't seen it run for it! He plays an difficult role portraying many different emotions into just one character, a man with a heavy burden to carry trying to unload part of it with his new life even though he's forever attached to his past. He really amazes us by showing what a guilty conscience is, it's that kind of feeling of never letting things go even when you know it's far behind you. Supporting him in great style is Peter Mullan, who plays an interesting figure in Jack's life, a man more proud of this boy even with all the things he done rather than feeling some admiration for his own teenage son, of whom he isn't so close after some problems in the family.At last but not least I loved this film for the small things that made the whole difference in the story, the minimal and almost unnoticed thing it occurs here: the importance of a good family structure. Lifes were shattered and never were the same if people would only pay attention to that little boy, who turned out to ruin another family lives and the story goes and on and on. Dramatically effective, quite realistic (inspired in the events of James Bulger case) and very well made this film is a must see for those who like involving stories and are not afraid of feeling sad or depressed through the whole journey. It certainly will reward you. 10/10</fullReview>

I also think this movie can raise questions on justice and reform and also will emotionally strike chords with parents.The acting is not amateur but professional and direction is picture perfect. The language is also understandable and would work as well if promoted in other countries and across the waters in Hollywood. I'm not sure on the budget this movie had and I have never heard of the lead actor until this movie - it has created such a great first impression with me and I know many other people.This is a must watch and much support and recognition is needed, Potter move over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Garfield delivers a wonderful performance here as Jack Burridge, a young man struggling to redeem himself from the sins of his past.The opening scene shows Jack as he is released from prison and prepares to join the outside world under the guidance of his caseworker Terry (Peter Mullan). With Terry's help, Jack assumes a new identity and a gets second shot at life. He gets a job, his own place, a couple of good friends, and even bags himself a girlfriend. Everything seems to be going well for Jack, but a happy ending doesn't seem to be in the cards, and we watch as his past finally catches up with him, swiftly unraveling the life he had just begun rebuilding.I've always liked movies that leave you with something to chew on, and this one definitely fits the bill. "Who decides who gets a second chance?", asks the film's tagline. This is the question you will be pondering over and over once you finish watching this film.Andrew Garfield shines in this one. He's believable as a young man who genuinely wants to turn his life around, but is constantly haunted by his past. He seemed to have just the right amount of charm and crazy in him. You're convinced that he's good, but you know his past messed him up real bad. Plus there's that unforgettable scene where he's tripping on E, which is simply awesome.</fullReview>

Andrew Garfield, casted as Eric, manages to be very emotional and improves some acting skills totally unbelievable.This movie, despite sticking up for public's opinion, makes us feel pity about Eric, and bring love and tragedy in our lives.The suggestion of Eric's suicide at the very end of the movie will certainly not be understood by everyone, but the dice are rolled.What do you think ? Do they really deserve all the cr*p that happened to them just because they had a "Dark Passenger" speaking for them when they were 10 ?

		<shortDescription>Powerful film that poses interesting questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The death of a child is always shocking on screen. Back in 1931, audiences watching the horror masterpiece Frankenstein sat in shock as the monster threw a young girl into the lake, drowning her. Watching the film now, it still maintains its shock value. John Carpenter's excellent 1976 film Assault On Precinct 13 sees a heartless thug remorselessly shoot a young girl in a brutal scene that I couldn't believe when I saw it. It's difficult and risky portraying the death of a child that ultimately represents the innocence that we all see disappear as we grow older. However, one thing that is rarely even attempted on screen is to follow the killer of a child as a main protagonist. Fritz Lang tried and ultimately succeeded in M, one of the greatest films ever made. That was back in 1931, and it's rarely been tried since.Boy A stars Andrew Garfield as Eric Wilson, a young man recently released from prison, getting ready to start a new life under the new identity of Jack Burridge. Helped to re-locate and ultimately settle in his new surroundings is Jack's rehabilitation worker Terry (played by the ever-reliable Peter Mullan), who treats Jack almost as a son, having been with him from his troubled beginnings. Finding a new job and making friends at work, he becomes romantically involved with receptionist Michelle (Katie Lyons) and looks like he is slowly being accepted back into society. But Jack is hiding a dark secret from his past, and were this truth ever to be discovered, it would mean the end to his new life and the possibility of a lynch-mob reaction. His childhood is revealed in flashbacks, as he falls in with Philip (Taylor Doherty) at school and begin a strange friendship which ultimately ends in tragedy for both of them.Boy A's main strength is its refusal to take a moral stance. It just tells the story of a mentally scarred young man who made a terrible decision early in his life that has had an irreversible impact on the rest of it. Garfield is terrific as an almost child-like adult struggling with the need to grow up quickly and face a strange and often hostile world. When he begins his awkward romance with Michelle, his character appears to almost feel guilty about allowing himself to enjoy it, with knowledge of what he's done and the possibility that the truth may be revealed. In a powerful scene, while Jack and Terry are having a drink in a pub, Jack discusses the fate of Philip in prison and wonders why he has been allowed to have a second chance. Garfield is outstanding as I mentioned before, earning a BAFTA for his performance back in 2008. He has come far since this and will play Spider-Man in the upcoming re- imagining of the comic-book hero.The film has invited comparisons to the infamous 1993 James Bulgar case, in which two youths Robert Thompson and Jon Venables tortured and horrifically murdered the 2-year old child in Liverpool. For an incident that saw one of the most vicious public outcries in British history, the film has taken a massive risk not to stir up a similar controversy. Thankfully, everything in the film is sensitively done, taking time to show the backstory of the main character up to the incident. It also doesn't sugar-coat it either, building up with an almost uncomfortable intensity that tastefully doesn't linger. It also poses some important questions about the legal system, trial-by-media, and how old a person should be before they can take responsibility for their actions. It attempts to answer none of course, letting the film provoke discussion.It's a fascinating, sad, funny, tragic and unsettling film that is well handled by director John Crowley, and strongly performed by the cast. If only more films would have the balls to tackle such a sensitive subject. Superb.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a heart breaker. This hurts! It makes you stop and think, it makes you question yourself... Just what would you do if your life had been the one changed by the hands of boy a? If it had been someone in your family who had been killed at his hands? Would you fight against your reaction to like this character? Your emotions tell you you should despise him, but as his new life takes shape and he opens up and begins to live you realise he isn't evil at all. A guilt quickly set in for me because he is so likable as a character and if it hadn't been for circumstance, he wouldn't have killed anyone, or been left to rely on his best mate.Waiting for the shots of the past to feed you more and more information, with that little dash of hope, praying that he didn't do what they said he did. But I'm guessing that this is really only because I felt guilty for feeling sorry for him and liking him and realising that he was just a child and maybe, just maybe no one should suffer for ever for a crime they commit as a child. It goes against everything I believe in, before this, my views were opposite.But then again I can't even contemplate (and I tried) what the reverse reaction would have been if someone I loved had been killed by Boy A. I'm sure I would have reacted very differently to this film. It's so worth the watch. Amazing actors, great story and it leaves you questioning yourself. Adults play a huge role in forming the character of a child. Just because we can breed, doesn't mean we should...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard to watch even here in the states where echoes of the Bulger case do not blot out the film as a simple slice of fiction. Sadly in the US, there have been enough horrifying instances of a crime committed by youths so underage that it is hard to grasp.The acting here is amazing, and we see evil surely, but we see in not in mere monochromatic view. The thought of the sins (and or absence) of a father have a meaning as severe as the underlying crime that propels the action here.I'm generally a fan of second chances in life, but there do seem to be some points that are past return. I suspect that is the problem with this film, if one comes in solidly aware of such points, the film will just irritate you. And the filmmakers end up being perhaps a bit too compassionate, whereas for me, I felt the angst of being in the middle, and the pull towards compassion then would be met with some resistance.However, the idea of some pain inside that you cannot share and cannot unburden, if you take the specific circumstances here away, and just think about that, it is rather remarkable. As is the depiction of it by Andrew Garfield here. And the whole ensemble really, just done with grace and grit.Well worth viewing if you are not repelled by the concept and/or parallels to the real world. I hold this in contrast to Lilya-4-Ever as a film that faces a painful aspect of life, without taking the easy nihilist angle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eric Wilson(Alfie Owen) befriends a troublemaker Philip Craig(Taylor Doherty) who is a bad influence on him. This movie makes it clear why parents don't want there kids to hang with other bad kids, because they will end up learning and doing bad things themselves. But later it explains why Craig is a bit demented, which is actually pretty messed up. Anyways they kill a schoolgirl after she criticizes them but it is unclear who kills her or if they both did it. Eric who is now dubbed as Boy A goes through rehabilitation is released and tries to start fresh with the help of Terry(Peter Mullan) a rehabilitation worker. And Eric soon finds friends and love, but not everything goes so smoothly. The film doesn't really go in the direction where you sympathize with Eric or hate him for that matter when his sins catch up to him, I sort of sympathized with him though a bit. I liked how some parts are not clear and isn't spoon fed to the audience, usually I don't like a movie with more questions than answers but I liked the direction they went with this and it's challenging and provocative. Eric struggling in society was engaging while his past is revealed a little at a time. The build up was nicely done, but that doesn't mean "Boy A" is something groundbreaking or plain brilliant. It just didn't seem harmonious or like some critics seem to be saying, it didn't really have a coherent narrative flow and seemed to lack some elements. It's a film worth checking out though, the editing was good and seeing the character Eric trying to get his life on track while also allowing him to redeem himself through his life encounters was engaging and yet saddening to watch. Just don't expect anything suspenseful and action, it's thought provoking though and has some in-depth character studies.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film when it was a two-part drama on Channel Four two years ago. My ex gave me the DVD along with some others about a year ago but, being a film fanatic and owning quite a lot of DVDs, I didn't get around to watching it again until now ? and I am so glad I did. I was spellbound throughout.I won't go into great detail about the plot because I'm sure enough people have been there already. Firstly, I have to say it is a refreshing thing to see a film that has taken a realistic subject matter and built a gritty and haunting emotional drama around it. They have truly succeeded, with brilliant acting, particularly from newcomer Andrew Garthfield playing the lead; "Boy A" himself. Supporting roles from the young boys (Alfie Owen and Taylor Doherty) and Peter Mullen who played Terry, Jack's councillor, were all spot-on too.As somebody else said, this picture really is an emotional roller-coaster. We follow Andrew Garthfield's character through his journey, with some truly uplifting and heart-warming scenes, juxtaposed with the pain, guilt, fear and anxiety as he is coming to terms with what he has done, and the fact that he can't seem to escape from it.I don't think there's enough words to actually give this film justice. It really is a masterpiece; compelling throughout, a powerful eye opener, and you'll still be thinking about Jack and his fate long after the credits roll.(And to whoever said this is a good film from Canada what were you thinking! ? this film is British through and through!!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie that might haunt you, after you watch it. A movie with more than stellar performances, that make you (almost) forget, that this is just a movie. It is not only shot (almost) like a documentary, the actors convey the feeling, that what you see them play, is who they really are.And of course they are not the characters they portray on screen, but they play them perfectly and add so much to the realism that the movie en-chances and make it almost unbearable. Unbearable to watch that is. But a movie does not have to be a fun ride to be good. And this movie is anything but a fun ride.If you cope with that and can overcome that fact, than you will enjoy one great drama, that also plays with the time-line. Which means, you won't get every story detail from the get-go and have to be patient, because the story reveals itself slowly. A great watch, although it started almost 2 years after it got made (in Germany that is).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting and human film about rehabilitation and wanting a second chance at life.The lead actor (Andrew Garfield) is very convincing. This film has little in the way of histrionics but does indeed suggest that Jack (Andrew Garfield) was culpable of a very heinous crime. Can a person like this ever readjust or will he just hurt those around him when they come to be told of his past ? this is strongly suggested by the reaction of his girlfriend. The strength of this movie is that it does not dictate to you how you should feel ? it suggests empathy and understanding of all aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is, at it's very least, a fascinating look at a sort of duality in life. Whatever you call it, you couldn't call it fake or lacking in substance. Maybe that's because it is (in a distant sort of way) based on things that really happened in England back in the 1990s, but the director and cast deliver the story expertly.It's a strange thing when a film does what Boy A does. It's simultaneously life-affirming and a kick in the teeth. You've got Jack/Eric who's done some horrible things in his past but looks to make amends. On his journey of redemption he's constantly pushed back down by a society that hasn't forgotten what he did and wants his head for it. There's also Terry, the father figure helping Jack get back on his feet but at the same time struggling (and mostly failing) to have a meaningful relationship with his own son. The film does an incredible job of portraying the character of Jack as someone to root for even though you know who he is and what he's done.The story itself moves along fairly slowly but never really seems boring which is something films rarely pull off these days. If it's not going a mile a minute, it's usually making you yawn. All of the technical aspects (if you look for that sort of thing) are all pretty much above average. Definitely worth your time, even if you have trouble with the slightly sensitive subject matter (it's not thrown in your face, but you're certainly made aware of it). Every now and then one has to look across the pond when summer comes around and Hollywood starts pumping out stuff with 1000 times more budget than brains.</fullReview>

But now he's reformed and ready to pick up a normal life again. His past is hunting him down though - the people of the country have not forgotten the actual murder yet and it is clear that he will be in trouble when found out.A film about making mistakes and making up for them again. A film about people growing up and becoming responsible fun adults. A film about people not being able with the past and having the lust for revenge cloud their proper judgment. This film has a good pace to it and takes a good time to introduce the characters. Once all of them are properly defined it plays out the rather painful and completely predictable ending - in a most fitting way.9 out of 10 people hunted by their past</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Impressive ! That was the word which came to my mind when I went out of the cinema after having seen Boy-A: Impressive. The actors are just amazing, Peter, in the part of the absent father always ready to help Jack is quite weird. We can not see if he is a good man or not. Indeed, on one hand he is very close to Jack, he really tries to help him, but on the other hand he does not really care for his own son... Then comes the part of Garfield, even if he plays the part of a criminal, he is very moving. Katie, in Michelle's part, seems, at first, a bit lusty but then, when she starts to go out with Jack we discover a tender woman and even if the relationship between Jack and Michelle is carnal, I find it very cute... What is quite disappointing is the ending, though it is a way of not falling into clichés, but I did not expect such a sad ending! I think that the most important thing in Boy A is the fact that we feel sympathy for a murderer, it is quite disturbing... Boy-A was a thorny subject to work on but John Crowley did it very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My only issue is that Zeb, Terry's son, appeared guilty to me from the go. Maybe it was the way his character "snaked" in? Maybe set lighting or camera angles? Maybe it was the actor not pulling back? I guess it doesn't take a psychic to sense that the only role a dedicated caseworker's long lost son could ever play in Boy A was to somehow ruin his dedicated caseworker father's relationship with Boy A. Sibling rivalry, etc. Apart from that and a few other tiniest of details, I thought this was a brilliantly executed film. I fell in love with Boy A the moment he appeared on camera. You walk with him every step of the way. You're so close to him that you can almost feel his heart beating. He makes you proud. He makes you laugh, cry and feel every awkward emotion in between. He makes you believe again. Just when you think that this is the kind of person you'd like to marry, you see his childhood crime. You see him think long and hard before making a choice. He appears almost evil as he proceeds with a grin. Can people change? Is he a different person? I thought yes, yes I would still marry Jack... until I ejected the disc. I've slept on it now and I still don't know. Mental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! PROCEED WITH CAUTION!This movie was the first I ever watched that compelled me to write review. Why? Because this is honestly one of the most gripping cinematic experiences I've been a witness to. Everything, from the realistic relations of the characters, to the way every single actor seemed to just...be. As if they were born to play these parts. I found my heart absolutely constricting when the characters were in pain because I had come to believe they were real.Now, here's where the spoilers come in. This is also one of the first movies that has made me cringe from the violence of it all. Not because it's a bloody slasher-esque flick, no. The violence is so...daily, it's so real that it's absolutely terrifying. The way the boys continuously brutalize the bully until you can practically see him coughing up blood, or how you hear the simple 'squish' of an eels head as they beat it with a stick. Even the subtle slash of cutting flesh as the boys go at the young girl with a knife. The part that got me the most was the simple violence in that young boy dragging a girl down under the bridge, and the rest is left up to the imagination. That's what's truly haunting to me. How they left one of the most pivotal parts of the movie to my sick imagination.Then comes the final thing that's been on my mind since I watched it, which was Garfield's breathtaking performance. I've been very interested in this boys acting talent since I noticed him in Doctor Who. How diverse he is. How he can play stunningly emotional, very sarcastic and bubbly, shy, or just overflowing with rage and screaming at someone until the message is sent into your mind that he actually feels that way. Which of course, he doesn't, it's in the script. That is what really makes it hard to watch this amazing film, because this boys realistic scenes of regretful tears, of horrid realization, every tiny emotion that crosses his spectrum, is so clearly visible on his face and in his words, and very clearly in his eyes, that it just breaks my damn heart.If you're a very strong-hearted person, I would highly recommend this movie. If you're not one for emotional roller-coasters, honestly, stay away. This film will linger in your mind for days. Perhaps in a good way, but there's something about it that stays with you. The acting, the timing, the fact that they've jam-packed so much emotion into this one film. Whatever it is, you're in for a very depressing and incredibly beautiful ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Namaste from hicflicks.wordpress.com !Its been a long time since I have seen a movie that felt so real or genuine. The film moves at a rather slow pace (so not meant for action junkies), but is a very good and deep character study. Most of the scenes in the film felt really believable; even the one in which the lead character takes an 'Ecstasy' pill, given to him by his friends in a disco, and then starts to dance wildly &amp; peculiarly on his own, without a care in the world.The story revolves around a young ex-con Jack, newly released from serving a prison sentence for a murder he committed as a child. It portrays the guilt and remorse that he feels for his age old crime very well, and how he is trying to adjust to normal life again (things that he has never experienced). The film also raises a good question around the topic of whether a heinous crime is ever forgivable. The lead character in the movie, Andrew Garfield has done a brilliant job and I am wondering why he never won an Oscar for this role. The other actors too have done a rather good job, particularly his mentor, Peter Mullan.This is one of those good flicks that somehow missed the limelight. Worth a catch on a lazy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BOY A ? CATCH IT ( A- ) Boy A is a genius and remarkably depressing. This is a story about two young kids murdering an innocent girl and what happened to them after one of them comes out of juvenile jail. The director unfolds the story in the end and meanwhile you are just keep wondering, what exactly happened? How a kid released after 10 years in jail sees the world is incredibly portrayed in the movie. The whole movie rests on Andrew Garfield's shoulders and in every single scene he showed how brilliant and fantastic actor he is. Every innocent moment in the movie will bring tears into your eyes. Andrew Garfield is undoubtedly one of the talented young actors around. After watching "Boy A" I think he will effing rock the Spiderman Reboot. Peter Mullan as a guardian is brilliant and his story with his teenage son is well portrayed. Katie Lyens and Shan Evens were really good. Alfie Owens, Taylor Doherty &amp; Madeline Rakic-Platt, kids in the flashbacks did a fantastic job. The director did a fantastic job overall but in the end leaving the audiences ambiguous about Andrew Garfield's decision about jumping of the bridge? Was not a genius move. The movie is inspired from the novel and in the novel Andrew also just standing up there and thinking about jumping into the river or thinks he can swim to the board. We never get to know that! I think at least for the movie, audiences deserved an honest ending. Overall I wanted to give it (A) but giving it (A-) considering the ambiguous ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic story of a crime that can't be lived down...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution: Spoilers When Jack Burridge (a beautiful, raw performance by Andrew Garfield) is released from prison after doing time for a crime committed when he was just a lad of about 14, he is so heartbreakingly hopeful and ready to leave his past behind. With the help of his parole officer Terry (another beautiful performance by the great Peter Mullan), Jack gets a job, makes new friends, and even finds romance with lovely Michelle (Katie Lyons).When Jack and a friend from work wind up saving the life of a little girl in a car accident, it begins to look as though Jack can truly move on and be a new person, leaving that troubled boy far behind. But the pressure begins to build. At first it's minor: Jack feels like he's being phony being someone new. Terry is adamant that Jack must never tell anyone about his past, and that's good advice. The crime that the boy committed was not something trivial like shoplifting or taking cars for joyrides. It was a horrible deed, committed by two young boys, one a violent leader and the other, a lonely follower. Instead of running and finding help for the victim, even if the help couldn't come on time, Boy A, as he is known when on trial for the crime, makes the reluctant and terrible decision to participate.This intelligent film forces you to take into account all of the factors: Boy B, as I will call him, has a will of iron, a violent, nihilistic personality. You will learn that he has been raped repeatedly by a family member. Does that matter? Boy A, the title character, came from a loveless, neglectful home. Dad drinks and ignores his son. Mom, in bed with cancer, treats the lad like she can't stand him. He is also constantly bullied at school. Do these things matter? Frankly, no, but nevertheless, you are forced to see whole characters, not just stone-faced criminals. It's hard to imagine such a sweet young man used to be Boy A. And it's not hard to believe that Jack is truly repentant, and hates his past so much that he wants Boy A to be dead, not just in the past.A single act of spite and hatred reveals Jack to the public, and the result is devastating. Jack Burridge realizes he'll never escape what he did. From the victims families' view, he is a monster. From my view, Jack is the boy who almost made it.It's a beautiful film with no flaws to speak of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film wrought with raw emotion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the films subject matter, Boy A was always going to divide opinion. Some could not let themselves into the film purely by labelling the main character as evil. This is proved by the countless posts likening the film to the case of Jamie Bulger. But to just compare the film to that would be unfair, and labelling the main character of Jack Burridge is as equally unfair. But of course there is a difference between the film and the real life tragedy, we are taken on the plot of Jack being a very unfortunate child, with an ignorant father and a mother with breast cancer. He is the outcast of his class and has no friends. But when he meets Phillip, he starts to become a normal child. Only to realise that Phillip is the same as himself, a very tortured child due to the fact of being sexually abused. The influential Phillip very much leads Jack (Eric) into a downward spiral which eventually ends up with murdering a young girl. Now this is why it is different, with the real life incident we are presented it merely as an act of unthinkable violence, whereas the film provides a completely unbiased approach. Showing the slow build up towards the inevitable crime alongside a sweet and shy Jack building a life for himself. And film is all about interpretation, so fair enough if you don't agree with him getting a second chance, just don't label him as evil as soon as you know what he's done. It was an evil act, but that doesn't make him an evil person.Sorry to bring up a serious case in a review, but there was a lot of dismissing of the movie for those same reasons and I wanted to combat them.The film features two terrific performances, one from reliable character actor Peter Mullan, putting in a wildly likable paternal role. Grounding Jack in his new reality, while always coming off as entirely trustworthy. But the main performance by Andrew Garfield is nothing short of spectacular. It's an understated emotional role, with his stutter and awkward demeanour, Garfield lets us know so much about his character with probably half the dialogue the rest of the main cast get. It is truly a revelatory performance, making it wildly exciting for the anticipation for his role in The Social Network and of course playing the titular Spider-Man in its 2012 reboot.The film carries two completely differing emotions, at the start there is an incredible sense of worry. With Jack's every suspicious look, the films tension is at times unbearable, thinking every moment that he'll suddenly be found out. But the testament to the film is, that at the same time this incredible tension is created we are also taken on a rites of passage tale as Jack slowly establishes a new reality. Making the film brilliantly divisive in its tone.The films finale is particularly strong, with the happy life of Jack coming down around him. The audience is treated to some of Jacks own suspicion when Michelle goes missing and we start to suspect somethings wrong. And the slow unravelling does the rest of the films perfect pacing complete justice.Overall, the film is an incredible achievement. Taking on a bold subject matter and turning it into an incredible character study. Taking down previous ideals and shattering any pre-constructed notions of who deserves to live and who doesn't. The one image I am left with still is when Jack escapes his room by climbing down the roof, he jumps from the shed and hurts his knee. He struggles and walks down an alley, holding the wall. On the other side of the alley, two children pass him, seemingly happy in their own world. This image perfectly encapsulates the films message of who is a monster? We all start the same, some make horrible decisions, but if someone is willing and capable of change, who are we to deny it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy A is one of the best British films I have seen in a long time. It provides excellent drama full of thought provoking questions that are cleverly weaved into the story.The ability for the writers and the director to take sensitive subject matter which many people have strong emotional opinions about, and then craft that into a film that lays out a moral issue in a balanced way is remarkable. Everything from the bleak setting in Manchester to the melancholy score fits perfectly within the storyline.Our lead Jack Burridge has an incredible back story that is referenced through flash backs to when he was younger. It shows him being bullied by older school kids, and his father. We see the non-existent relationship he has with his ill mother. Jack has become a socially awkward boy in a mans body. I feel that Andrew Garfield should be praised for his very convincing portrayal of Jack. Jacks naive and timid manor, and the internal struggle with his old self comes across perfectly.The supporting cast also gave excellent performances, one of note has to be Peter Mullan as Terry (Jacks case worker). Terry comes across as a very non-judgemental, loving man who devotes himself to his work. This has repercussions with his own family, the way it's played out is so subtle and not without purpose, it's a subplot that has a key role in advancing the story later on in the film.The remaining characters have a lot of depth too, and they all feel very real. The dialogue between the characters is always spot on, the way Jacks friends talk to one an other, and how they behave on a night out is very much in line with reality. I found it very easy to relate to Jacks awkwardness which addresses itself again when he becomes intimate with his new girlfriend Michelle.As the film progresses we get more flashbacks of when Jack was a child and his interactions with his only childhood friend Phillip. Phillip who is obviously more troubled than Jack and has had a much rougher deal, stood up for Jack when he was bullied. They play truant together, presumably in part to avoid the older bullies. Here I can't fault anything either, the two children are written very realistically and it is at this point that Jacks crime is revealed.The director does this in such a way that we the viewer really question that gut feeling you often experience when hearing about cases like James Bulger. Our instant reaction, that reflected by Jacks new friends when they find out his past is one of repulsion, hatred, and anger. But the film forces us to really question this knee-jerk reaction, and for me personally it did a great job of showing the other side of these kind of crimes and their contributing factors.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing. That is how I would sum up Boy A in one word. The plot of Boy A may be considered as an offensive one, because of the dark dimension in the movie, but it is not. Garfield's actor's game is really stunning; he manages to create a link, an emotional link between his endearing character and spectators. This is such a thought-provoking movie, and the way it has been directed makes us closer to the story. We feel as if we were really living the story, like we were IN the story? That is why Boy A has an extraordinary emotional impact on spectators: after watching it, we feel as if we had lived a new experience. Even if some scenes are a bit dark, for example when the boys kill the girl, it may seem too violent and useless, but it is important to know that it is how life goes for some people. For those reasons, I really think Boy A is a moving gem and I think it did not get the reception it should have got. Usually I am not keen on that kind of movie but the thing is that Boy A is really great and everybody will enjoy watching it. But the most important thing, from my standpoint, is that everybody must have a second chance to erase the bad things they made in the past and become who they want to become. Humans can make misdeeds, the most important is to fix them. And I think that, in his movie, Crowley has developed a very important principle: forgiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a touching movie it is! I must admit that I was skeptical about this film and its theme before having watched it, even if all the reviews I had read on the internet were far more than positive. My doubts came from my point of view on kids' murderers, and, in a way, from being narrow-minded. Andrew Garfield and his actor's game changed my mind. This film stages Jack not as a murderer but rather as a human-being. It conveys the idea that the main character paid for his crime and should get a new chance, the opportunity of being someone else. I think the main word in this film is "forgiveness". Can we forgive everything? Even the worst? I thought we could not. Perhaps was I wrong? This film is like a journey into the murderer's feelings. You can feel from your seat his happiness as well as his despair. The directing has made a remarkable work. I also enjoyed the soundtrack which increases the emotional impact of this film. This film deserves to be watched by as many people as possible. This is truly one of the most enriching films I have ever seen. I think it's not too strong to say that this movie makes you grow as much as "This is England" or "Into the Wild".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always preferred British films to U.S. ones as they are more often honest and realistic. Lives of ordinary people are generally not full of becoming heroes or obtaining sophisticated skills, dramatics is spread in minor events as well. I can understand that horrible deeds should never be forgotten, but a witch hunt by media is not justified as well - especially if a person has changed for the better as Andrew Garfield's character has repeatedly demonstrated. Moreover, cornered people, who have nothing to lose, may act totally strikingly.Boy A is a gloomy film, full of stress and misapprehension, but very realistic and with excellent acting (esp. Mullan and Garfield). I could have expected a different, more clear ending, but it is probably my fault :) Not recommended to those accustomed to bright and trouble-free life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Irish theater and film director John Crowley's second feature film which he co-wrote with Irish playwright and screenwriter Mark O'Rowe, is an adaptation of a novel from 2004 by British author Jonathan Trigell. It premiered in the Vanguard section at the 32nd Toronto International Film Festival in 2007, was screened in the Panorama section at the 58th Berlin International Film Festival in 2008, was shot on locations in North West England and is a UK production which was produced by producers Lynn Horsford, Nick Marston and Telly Garner. It tells the story about 24-year-old Eric Wilson who is released from prison after having served fourteen years. Thanks to a social worker named Terry who has taken care of him like a father takes care of a son, he is given the precious opportunity to start his life with blank sheets under the name Jack Burridge. Jack gets a new apartment in Birmingham, England, a new job and acquaints a woman named Michelle whom he takes a liking to. Life smiles at Jack and his prospects looks brighter, but he has a dark history.Distinctly and engagingly directed by Irish filmmaker John Crowley, this fictional and internal study of character which is narrated mostly from the main character's point of view, draws a gripping portrayal of a young man who believes that his return to society under a new identity will give him the life he wants, but who soon realizes that he has to confront and overcome his consciousness which is tearing him up inside. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Jon Henson, cinematography by cinematographer Rob Hardy, use of music and intelligible way of conveying the protagonist's inner conflict, this character-driven and brilliantly written independent film which examines themes like identity, guilt, prejudice, friendship and redemption, contains and energetic score by theater director, playwright and composer Paddy Cunneen which illuminates the significant atmosphere.This somewhat romantic, at times humorous and instantly engaging coming-of-age tale about a shy and somewhat introspective man who is haunted and suppressed by the dark shadows of his past and his lost youth, is impelled and reinforced by it's fragmented narrative structure, rhythmic pace, substantial character development, quick-witted dialog, interesting characters, the fine supporting acting performances by British actress Katie Lyons, Scottish director and actor Peter Mullan, English actor Shaun Evans and the compelling and memorable acting performance by American-English actor Andrew Garfield who through his sporadic body language and expressive interpretation of a singular character, envisages complex emotions with remarkable conviction. A heartrending and mindful psychological drama which gained the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor Andrew Garfield at the British Academy Television Awards in 2008.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boy A is an A+ and then some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film a while back, but it has never left my mind.This movie will draw you in and it'll interest you from start to finish. The only downside is that it might be a bit confused, I remember watching it with a friend and we were (we aren't stupid) both confused about who was who (the dialect for Americans might be a bit thick). Needless to say, the movie is perfection.Boy A is a story about a boy who is released from jail and has to begin a new life. The story of the murder was big news and his release is made aware through the media. He gets a new identity as a case worker tries to help him, but adjusting is hard when society attempts to invade his privacy.This film is the reason I am now an avid fan of Andrew Garfield and it also sparked my mass viewing of movies I've been meaning to watch.This movie is dark and depressing, but it excels in every way imaginable.10 Stars and then some.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>questions from the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought it was a really good film, and the 2 boy actors wow i was almost disturbed by how good they were and i didn't know whether to feel sorry for 'Jack' or not because of the questions in the next few lines... I didn't like the ending because of how random it was for him to bump into the girl but what i was wondering was.. is he actually a child murderer? because he never actually hit the boy and you didn't actually see him do anything to the girl you just saw him walking into the tunnel.. so is he just an accomplice who feel guilty, an actual murderer in the fact he helped kill the girl or has he been wrongly convicted of murder? Oh and what happened with his mum?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid movie but the ending was a bit disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie the other day after reading up about it first on IMDb. I heard nothing but good reviews so I decided to give it a watch and im glad I did. Andrew Garfield does a great job as the lead he is a great up and coming actor. People say this movie resembles a true murder story from 1993 where two boys killed a little boy but I don't see many similarities just a story is all.This movie is about a young man who is released from prison after committing a murder as a young child. He regrets what he has done now struggles to try to make a normal life for himself while trying to leave his terrible past behind.This movie was really good. It had some great performances and the story line was well written I was just disappointed by the ending I feel they could have explained more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much needed, yet not letting the viewer think much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young man is released from prison following ten years of incarceration for his involvement in killing a ten-year-old girl. A supervisor aids him in surviving in the outside world, of which he knows surprisingly little, yet this doesn't help much as media condemns him as a monster (the favourite term English tabloids use when describing children who kill) and desperately tries to find him. Even though I think this film is needed, I also think it is more evidently than eloquently written, not allowing what I think would be letting the viewer think for her-or-himself using more subtle methods, thus letting in more breadth and humanity. To its strength, the film is very well-played, has excellent Kubrick-esquire cinematography (just see the courtroom imagery and I think you'll see what I mean) and is singular in more ways than one. It is interesting to see that while adults who kill children are often - in the USA, according to report from the documentary "When Kids Get Life", viewable for free through the Frontline site - children are often utterly condemned, as is the famous case with Mary Bell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film Boy-A, by John Crowley is not, in my opinion, a blockbuster. I can begin saying that if you have nothing better to see, why not. We can easily understand that the hero, Jack, struggles with his emotions. I enjoyed that film but I do not think that it has its place at the Tribeca festival even if there are some scenes which are thought-provoking and which get right under your skin, like the scene when Jack saves a little girl from a car accident. During that scene we can really see that Jack's behaviour is impulsive. He has an impulsive act of heroism. After seeing that film I wondered if this movie was not manipulative. I asked this question to myself because I think that, in a way, we should hate Jack and be scared of him (Aren't we too naive and gullible ?)but on the other hand, we feel sympathy for Jack, we forget his past and forgive him. Even of there are some gasps (like the schizophrenic dance, which brings nothing to the film) that movie is, all in all, very moving, this s a brutally honest story which makes you think and wonder about forgiveness. As an ending, I will not say that this movie is a movie gem even with the actors' games, like Peter Mullan's performance which fits him perfectly. Finally, I give this film three and a half out of five.</fullReview>
