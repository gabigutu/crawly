		<shortDescription>One of the bravest observations on the truth of humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching Dogsville and felt like turning it off.. after all, what kind of movie could occur with no scenery? No doors.. it seemed like some sort of play/movie hybrid but after a shortwhile all those things faded away until I realized how much I would have missed if I had turned it off - it is now one of my favourite movies of all time.Why? It is so brave to criticse humanity like this and admit just how 'dark' a race we truly are - not matter how much each of us profess to being 'good', we all know that most of us are anything but. Through this movie you see a woman who learns the cold harsh truth in a place where she expected to find the goodness that her faith told her existed. And then on not finding it, discovered that even within her lay a wrath that echoed the darkness that she herself wished did not feature so dominant in our race. And the biggest test of this is to observe your own emotions throughout this movie until what you feel at the end as perfect evidence...I honestly believe those people that don't believe what this movie is expressing needs to take a cold hard look around them. And if they still don't believe, they are just like the people in this movie - unwilling to see the truth and coming up with excuses and reasons when nothing justifies the horrible world we live in.A true masterpiece - one of the few pure pieces of art in cinema with amazing acting from Nicole Kidman especially, and the lack of a set causes you to be immersed in the characters like no other movie. And its 'them' and human nature that is the focus. Will leave you thinking and astounded (unless you don't like to think and can't watch a movie that isn't afraid to do something unique, in which case there a countless movies for 'you').</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploration of the darkness of the human soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one is looking for a starter to this heart-tearing masterpiece, I suggest My Dinner With Andre from 1981. Another movie from which you get a feeling of having read a good book. Very few films render that feeling, but these two do.Where to start describing the bouquet of feelings this masterpiece has caused in me? A good point is admiration for Nicole Kidman's mix of wit, grace, innocence scented with beauty that, as the film evolves, turns into a thick film, a pellicle of suffering and enduring, glued together with forgiveness. I do not wish to believe that those qualities can be displayed credibly without the actress actually possessing them ( :) ? ) From the point Chuck takes advantage of Grace the first time, I couldn't stop occasional shivers the just-observed caused me, so much it touched. The conclusion can be drawn after watching the film: one cannot know his/her true nature unless given a real ungoverned power over another living being. They all seem nice in the beginning. The power and a sense of opportunity of free use only amplify themselves in Dogvillians. The evil seed in Chuck spreads among all the dogs, or were they all evil a priori?Artificial settings? One stage? Please! They are forgotten in 10 minutes. As all true works of art, this thing glows from the inside, it doesn't need a vivid facade. Long movie? I would have liked to see maybe an even longer one, but it would have probably put me into even sadder mood watching the ugliness killing the grace.Indeed, Tom, a great illustration of the fact that humans haven't changed from the medieval or perhaps even more primitive times - still dismissing the truth about themselves as lies, the truth that only very few of them are unselfish, decent in terms of morale and even 1 cm away from the animal desires for flesh.Grace concludes that she wouldn't have been much better had she been born in Dogville. I disagree - one can be no matter how poor but still cultured, at list on a microlevel of one person, on a macroscale culture of course doesn't develop without having material funds at its foundation. Then a human raises his head from a plug and looks up in the sky, and connects with Love, and then the decency is born in him/her as a little fire that can't be put out by any amount of torture inflicted upon her/him. The decency can also be transferred from a parent to a child.Dogville got what it deserved, in the end, justice comes in and flushes the inner hollowness created by co-suffering with Grace, heals the pain.Thank you, Lars, and thank you, Nicole, this work is engraved into my mind for a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable Bitter Play About a Town, Which Did Not Deserve To Be On the Map, and Its Disgusting Dwellers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the Great Depression, the fragile and beautiful Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives in Dogville, a small town in Colorado, escaping from the mob. Tom Henson (Paul Bettany), a young local man, welcomes and introduces her to the distrustful community. They decide to vote whether she could stay with them or not. After a brief meeting, they decide to lodge her for fourteen days, when they could judge her behavior and come up to a final decision. Meanwhile, she should perform some small jobs for them in a sort of retribution, receiving a symbolic payment. Later, the police come to the town with some pictures of her, informing she was a missing person. The vulnerable Grace becomes a slave of the community, being used by the locals in the most sordid and cravenly way. The conclusion of the story is spectacular. Two days ago, I started seeing this long unusual movie, indeed a filmed play. It surprised me in the first moment, but a friend of mine told me that this movie was a sort of 'love it' or 'hate it' film. Yesterday, I finished watching the DVD and actually it is one of the best stories about human exploitation and pay back I have ever seen. In some moments, the unfair misery of Grace recalled me Victor Hugo's Jean Valjean. It is amazing the tendency of the human race, when having some kind of power, to exploit those who need. The lack of scenarios or special effects highlights the stunning performance of the cast in a very original screenplay. This film is a great homage to the theatrical world and for great actors and actresses. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Dogville' ('Dogville')</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I started the movie and realized that it isn't really a movie, that it is more like a play and that there is really a lack of props and scenery I thought to myself, My God, what the heck did I buy???? I'm a huge fan of Nicole Kidman and she is the reason I bought it in the first place. The movie (or play), whatever u might wanna call it, drew me in and I couldn't stop watching. The end is so powerful, I was speechless. That's one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long, long, long time. I don't agree with the Anti-American comments I read here in some of the comments. Human emotions are all the same all over the world and this movie could have played in any country. Anyway, go watch this movie it's soooo worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as anti-American as you might think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is long, and if you don't have the patience for a slow ramp-up of tension, it'll turn you right off. There are a couple story devices Von Trier uses that really bugged me, and I almost shut it off once. I'm glad I stuck with him, though, because he really took it somewhere and I came away really enjoying the experience..Critics who hated Dogville talk about it's hamhanded anti-American slant (Lars von Trier refuses ever to set foot in that country). I knew nothing about this film or Von Trier before seeing it and I have to say I entirely missed the anti-America thing until the backcredits. Don't get me wrong, there are several scenes that make commentary about rampant nationalism, prejudice towards immigrants and small town xenophobia, but those comments could be made about the zealous in ANY region of ANY nation at ANY time.If we are to criticize 21-st Century America, and there are plenty of reasons to criticize it, we must also criticize other peoples and governments who are screwing up royally. I think if Dogville has a point to make to America, its not that it is uniquely problematic, but that it is as problematic as any other nation. Where on this planet can you NOT find a group of people who think:THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF EVERYONE WAS JUST LIKE US.That statement is the kernel of failure for every major conqueror and every major religion in history and it portends the long, inevitable swirl down the toilet and the people who want you toppled have only to sit back and watch you do it to yourself.America is a great nation, with a lot of culture, history and art to be proud of, and maybe that's why modern artists feel the need to make pieces like Dogville. To remind America that, as great as it is, it's still a nation of crying, barfing, excreting, whining, greedy, worried, scared mouths to feed, just like the rest of us -- no better or worse.That's all I think Dogville does as an anti-American piece. If Von Trier meant to just poo on America, he missed his mark and ended up making a point about all of us. Regardless, he among many others wants America to change it's mind about itself, and it doesn't matter if he hates it or loves it. Much more interesting to me is the blatantly obvious point Dogville makes -- to what point do you forgive the transgressions upon you by others who may be less fortunate but are nonetheless doing wrong? It sure made me take a look at my own pacifism.Nicole Kidman was brilliant, as was Paul Bettany and the simpler townsfolk who will play so skillfully with your emotions. It seems I've been flooded with Kidman movies regularly for a couple weeks now and this is my favourite of her performances.Good film, Dogville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disturbing Sense of Illustration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dogville" is, along with Peter Jackson's "Heavenly Creatures", one of the most disturbing film experiences I've ever had. Love it or hate it, it's impossible to be indifferent about this overwhelming film written and directed by Lars von Trier.This is the first part of a trilogy ironically entitled "USA: Land of Opportunities" ("Manderlay" is the second, "Wasington" will be the third). "Dogville" begins with a prologue and extends to nine chapters in almost three hours of daring, exquisite film-making.Nicole Kidman gives the performance of her career, in my opinion. Forget her (great) portrayal of Virginia Woolf in "The Hours", and the ambitious Suzanne Stone ("To Die For"): Kidman's most accomplished composition to date is Grace. She's a beautiful young American who, apparently on the run from gangsters, hides herself in a small Colorado town called Dogville, helped by Tom (Paul Bettany) and the other residents. Things go fine for some time until Dogville's folks begin to exploit the lovely Grace and, literally, chain her up like a dog.You'll better appreciate the film if you don't know too many details (and even if you do, Von Trier reserved us lots of bitter surprises). We could say briefly that this is a film about those people you lend a hand and want to take your arm, but "Dogville" is too sharp and intelligent to be summed up this way. Many people accused Lars von Trier of criticizing the American arrogance violently. That's true, but the fact is that "Dogville" is a universal story: it could happen anywhere. Human beings are really this bad?, we wonder by the end. "Dogville" wasn't made to make you feel good, but it's a compulsory film for everybody."Dogville" is a much better work than "Dancer in the Dark", Von Trier's previous film which gave him the Golden Palm at Cannes, and proves definitely he's one of the greatest filmmakers nowadays. He led his ensemble cast wonderfully, and all of them are superb (that's no surprise, however, regarding Kidman, Ben Gazzara, Lauren Bacall, James Caan, Chloë Sevigny, Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsg?rd, Jeremy Davies, Patricia Clarkson, Harriet Andersson, Udo Kier, Zeljko Ivanek and Philip Baker Hall, among others ? honourable mention to John Hurt's excellent, ironic narration). 10/10.P.S.: You'll never forget David Bowie singing "Young Americans" after seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film after much of the controversy about it at Cannes had passed. The buzz in the U.S. press was that the film was slanted and reflected Lars Von Trier's ignorance of American society. Such arguments are specious on their face--there are examples of great literature and film making where the creator never set foot in the setting, as any reader of Shakespeare well knows. So discounting the self-appointed guardians of America, what exactly is this film about, what are the film's merits and why does it evoke such strong feelings from its audience, especially American ones? What Von Trier has done is take several American icons: the gangster, the small town, the woman in distress, the ideal of the common person, the local sage and the wise elder gentleman doctor, and has turned them on their head to create a timeless play about human motivation, greed and the corrupting influence of power. The people of Dogville are on the surface simple and decent people. Grace's arrival and her helplessness is the catalyst that, step by step, tempts the people of Dogville to inflict upon her greater and greater humiliations to feed their now unrestrained desires. So complete is her humiliation that the twist at the end leaves the viewer very little sympathy for the fate of Dogville's citizens. It is a powerful message and the judgment of the characters is one that takes no prisoners. That there are more than a few examples of this behavior in contemporary American society (and in the American past) and that it confronts these issues directly is the reason for the controversy surrounding it and--apart from the brilliant acting, especially by Ms. Kidman and Paul Bettany--what makes it great art. Von Trier has made a movie that is part of the quintessential American proletarian artistic tradition and its setting in 1930s America is part of the film's genius. That he is not an American and that this movie did not originate in Hollywood should give us all pause. There is a scene in which Grace confronts the people of Dogville with a critique of their bad behavior. Their response is to either deny the truth of what she has said or to blame Grace herself for tempting them. This movie, without being preachy or dogmatic, attempts to provide its own critique and received much the same reaction as the movie's protagonist. I would not be surprised if this was Von Trier's original intent. Dogville is a disturbing and powerful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lyric movie about society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not the best I've ever seen, and probably not as good as "Breaking the Waves". But I left the theatre astonished, shocked, sad, confused, and a bit angry with the director, for being so cruel (and true?) in portraying human behaviour with vulnerable people, for using no props, for forcing me to watch the characters in their eyes and facial expressions 'cause there was nothing to draw my attention away. But this movie deserves to be seen, because that's what an artist is supposed to do, to share a bit of his thoughts and views, without giving answers, but arousing emotions and questions: and it has probably more right to be than other blockbuster movies sold by studios with nothing but what people like to see in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morally challenging but still a gripping, well written and well acted film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is a small mountain village outside of George Town; it is a tight community of good people who look after each other. However Tom, the town's writer and moral heart feels that the people are not caring deep down. He has the opportunity to test this theory when a woman, Grace, stumbles into the village to escape gangsters. He challenges them to hide Grace and take her in - and is pleasantly surprised as they gradually do. In return she agrees to do work for the villagers - however the relationship begins decreasingly pure and increasingly exploitative.I have a natural dislike for films that come across as pretentious or arty for art's sake, so you can imagine I approached this film with slight trepidation despite not having seen any clips of it. However, I did really like the film and was surprised just how quickly the three hours flew by. In terms of the plot, it is more than up to the task of the three-hour running time - in fact I (and most of the audience) stayed in my seat until the very last credit had run over great photographs and the great Bowie's `Young Americans'. The plot is good enough to be accepted but you do need to see past the script and look at what it is saying to appreciate it - although having said that it would still grip me even if it hadn't made me think.Leaving the cinema I felt that I hadn't really bought the film's moral that nobody is really `good' because I felt that most people are not bad, and certainly not to this extent; but I think my mind was stuck on the specifics of the film rather than the meaning. In the film everyone is socially polite and restrained, but once the chance to take advantage comes, it is increasingly taken (albeit to extremes). I felt the film was particularly harsh to Tom, who was actually a `good' person - however I think time has allowed me to understand it better. We are not good people. We do take advantage of others, whether it be individuals (while trying to keep up our good public image as much as we want) or groups. Even those who turn a blind eye are `bad' simply because they could have acted for good and they didn't.I saw this film two weeks after illegal immigrants drowned in the UK while picking cockles for very, very low wages - they were caught in mudflats by the rising tide. While the obvious `bad' people are those who made them work like this, many others knew of the work and ignored it. More pertinently to the film is the fact that a vulnerable and needy group were exploited by society - just as Grace was here. I didn't get the photographs over the end credit (I was into the music!) but they were all of the poor or minorities etc on the fringe of society - I found this challenging. When many of us see people in need we will do enough to look `good' and keep our social niceties (ie put a ? in the cup) just like those in Dogville did. We all feel good after this, but this film challenges that idea of `good' as wholly inadequate and that just being polite and moving on is still `bad' even if it is on a sliding scale. This is not to say that the film's plot and themes are perfect, but even flawed they are clear and will keep you thinking of the film long after it ends.Of course it is unrelentingly bleak for the entire second half, but this is the film and I had to accept it for what it was. In terms of being arty, I found the bleak stage to work very well. The only downside of it was cuts from very black scenes to white scenes hurt my eyes in the cinema. This is not just theatre being filmed, the film uses the lack of scenery well. Sure it focuses the attention on the actors, but it also highlights how the people turn a blind eye. In my favourite shot, a rape occurs in one `house' and the camera shoots it through all the others, they are unable to hide from it even if they don't look - it is a very simple way of showing the audience that everyone knows but is socially polite. The film still uses makeup and props except for, inexplicably, Nicole Kidman herself. She starts the film looking good but ends it looking as good - when really she would have looked tired or bedraggled and destroyed.In fairness Kidman manages to do that without makeup and her performance is very good throughout the film - it is easy to dismiss hers and the other stars' roles as some sort of justification of themselves as `real artists' but it was still a brave move for a business that is more about dollars than art. The rest of the cast more than match her and I was surprised to see so many big names. Bettany is very good as are Bacall, Hall, Ivanek, Sevigny and Skarsg?rd. Even the child actor is very self-assured and Hurt's homely narration is colourful and funny. Ironically the two black characters have little to do - the script says they are there as a token indication of Edison Sr's open-mindedness, but it is almost like they were token at times - sadly Shims' whole contribution is going `shhhh' twice! Despite that there are no weak links, the acting is superb and it certainly appears as if von Trier's aim of stripping the film away to focus on performances has paid off in a big way. Acting awards may not come but I have not seen more daring performances from a Hollywood cast for quite a while.Overall this is a bleak and challenging film - not only to watch but to think about and apply to myself too. I left the cinema enjoying it but disagreeing with it's moral point of view, however I allowed myself to look and I now agree with it, as sad as that sounds. As a story and a film it is wonderful; the fact that it has come to the multiplexes' forcing thought and emotion is even better. The saddest thing is that so many teenagers at the screening I was in walked out - they saw something they were not used to and they rejected it within 30 minutes; I find that horribly depressing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like watching a brilliant novel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the only way I can describe a movie like this. To me, the best movies are like watching novels. In some ways, this can be detrimental, and at times, I did indeed find myself disconnected from the movie.However, therein lies the redeeming value in "Dogville." Like a great novel, its nuances and details develop slowly and become intertwined with the underlying message within this film. This movie forces you to pay attention to the story at hand. It's sparse of scenery and locale, yet if you're willing enough, you can fill in the details if you want to. The lack of scenery forces you to focus on the characters and the slow deterioration of their human sensibilities.It's a movie that, like all brilliant movies, has themes that transcend into society as a whole.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tough. Once again Lars von Trier tortures the audience (as he did previously on Dancer in the Dark) by upraising the darkest side of the human being. From the beginning you know that things can only get worse, but I doubt that one can figure out neither what's to come nor the powerful conclusion. Nicole Kidman's interpretation is perfect - intense, poignant, passionate, you name it. She is fantastic and so is the small cast locked inside Dogville's scenario (a wonderful creation - I wonder how something so simple can bring such a strong effect). Again, the entire cast is fantastic and for that goes an extra credit for Lars von Trier. His capability of pushing actors to the limit and extracting painful emotions from them creates a heavy atmosphere, full of tension and, at the same time, so familiar. It is not that Dogville represents the essence of our communities, but it exposes some aspects of our lives that we prefer to hide under the carpet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>People as animals (spoilers throughout)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it quite amusing that so many Americans were outraged that Lars von Trier had the temerity to criticise their country without having visited it. After all, we do it all the time, don't we? Millions of us are quite content to sit on our sofas and criticise China, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Israel and countless other countries without having visited their shores. And we're perfectly justified in doing so. So why should Von Trier be vilified for criticising America from a few thousand miles away? Well, of course, I don't think he should. He's perfectly entitled to his opinion, and those that cry and moan are symptomatic of America's biggest problem ? its inability to take criticism without getting its pants in a twist. Surely every great country should thrive on criticism. It should help it grow and develop. But instead America seems to resemble a child sometimes, spouting unhelpful phrases like, "America: love it or leave it" or, "You're either with us or against us." Therefore a film like Dogville, one that refuses to revel in the hollow American Dream, is vital, and it's a film that should be embraced, not shunned.But anyway, what the detractors seem to overlook is the fact that Dogville could really be a small town anywhere. It may be the first part in an American trilogy, but the small town values with their prejudices and hypocrisy are universal. Everyone can relate...The film begins and ends with a God's eye view of the proceedings and it isn't hard to imagine that Von Trier is looking down on the characters, judging them. In fact, as Tom himself says, everything is a game, a test, and Von Trier is the one pulling the strings.The game begins when Grace enters the town. The townsfolk are frightened, but Tom thinks it's a gift. He wants to see if Dogville has a problem with acceptance. Well, at the beginning, the citizens are understandably cautious, but they're eventually placated when Grace proves that she can help them out. And so at the beginning she develops a good relationship with the town and its citizens. But even at the beginning the relationship is far from equal. She may like everyone, but she's essential a slave. Yet the townsfolk like her best like this, when she's happily subservient.As the film progresses, the town is tested further. The police post wanted posters and accuse Grace of crimes that she couldn't have committed (as she was in the town at the time). But rather than this bringing everyone around to her cause, the town gets cold feet. It wants to help, but only as long as it doesn't put them at risk. Therefore they decide to doubly enslave Grace to make themselves feel better. It's an extraordinary move, but one that is anything but far-fetched. Individuals are brave, but people have worrying habit of proving themselves to be spineless.And seeing as Grace affects the status quo, the townsfolk decide to take their frustrations out on her. The men rape her physically and the women rape her psychologically. In fact, the most upsetting scene isn't one of the numerous rape scenes ? although Chuck's rape scene does prove the brilliance of the set, what with it showing everyone going about their daily business and turning a blind eye to what is going on - it is instead the womens' abuse of Grace and the destruction of her figurines. It's more than just a physical violation. It's a violation of everything. Her dreams are being smashed right before her eyes.But why do the people of Dogville react this way? Surely their behaviour is an exaggeration. Well, it is and it isn't. Of course the film paints a bleak portrait of human nature that you might not find down your street, but I think that the film proves that we all have darkness present in us. It only takes the right conditions and the right buttons to be pressed for it to emerge. In the case of Dogville, it emerges for many reasons, but I think the main reason is because Grace shows everyone what they are. Before her arrival everyone is happily stuck in a rut, but once she arrives everything changes. Everyone is faced with their mediocrity and everyone's lies are exposed. In one scene McKay, after having finally admitted his blindness, indeed thanks Grace for "showing us who you are", but during her time in Dogville she also forces Bill to realise his stupidity (by playing checkers for him), Liz her unattractiveness (by catching Tom's eye), Ben his loneliness (by providing for him), Chuck and Vera their unhappy marriage (by catching Chuck's eye) and Tom his cowardice (through his refusal to kiss her even though she's admitted her love for him). Needless to say, not everyone likes being exposed. It's hard to face yourself when you don't like what you see. And therefore the person that you're going to punish is the one that made you look at your reflection? The ending is certainly bleak, but I think it forces us to take a hard look at ourselves. How often have we taken advantage of other people when we should have helped? How often have our intentions been selfish? And Grace's final actions suggest one thing to me: if you treat someone like an animal, you shouldn't be surprised when they treat you like one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reference to Edison a criticism of contemporary films?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers***Let me start my review by saying that this film accomplishes what most filmmakers hope for when they begin the mountainous task of creating one: it provokes and engages the viewer's mind. I will not review the film's plot because prior posts have amply covered the many questions that are presented and only partly answered. This was an unforgettable film for me even though I do not accept its ideological foundations.One of the subtextual layers of the film involves what I see as a severe criticism of the film industry as a whole. I'm sure that most readers are aware of Lars von Trier's grievances. In many ways, the things he has said about modern cinema ring true. How many times have we viewers left the movie hall, after watching the latest blockbuster, shaking our heads? The special effects may have astounded us, but the characters seemed petty and one-dimensional, or even worse, a GLORIFICATION of all that is bad about our culture. I emphasized the word "glorification" in the previous sentence because I do not believe that a film should ignore the bad - just that it shouldn't make the antagonist the hero.The moving picture was invented by Thomas Edison. Because of him, we have the gift of film. Dogville begins with a father/son duo named after this famous inventor and it is here that I detect a critique of contemporary films. The younger Tom struggles to come up with a story; he wants to create something of value but he can only manage a meager three words. He walks around Dogville wanting to help its citizens, but he cannot relate to their situations. He, unlike them, does not have any financial worries because he lives with his father, Thomas Edison Sr., who brings in a comfortable pension.Tom the younger is living off of his father's success. (Edison Sr. represents old Hollywood and is presented in a kinder light than the other town residents - i.e., he does not molest Grace.) Ineffectual in influencing his culture, young Tom is the first to recognize that Grace, played by Kidman, is a gift. He introduces her to the townspeople.Grace is accepted by the townspeople and for a while all are content to share in her sunshine. But then, the benefactors begin to long for a greater exploitation of Grace. Through Tom the younger's mediation, they seek more "balance" from their relationship with Grace. No longer interested in her goodness and humanity, they want physical gratification at her expense (and ultimately Tom's). Tom eventually goes along with them and is corrupted himself. (Tom, representing modern cinema, panders to them by wooing Grace even as he furthers her captivity. He gives them the equivalent of the gratuitous sex scene, car chase, or mass explosion with resulting body count.)Grace leaves Dogville and, in the spirit of the Dogme manifesto, decides that the world would be better off if the current societal malaise were eradicated, along with all of the money and capital of the modern film industry. Hence, Grace provides the coup de grace to young Tom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Are you shivering after seeing Dogville? I am.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably the most shocking movie experience I've ever had, not only because of the emotional impact, but because this is truly a morally horror movie that gave me a slap in the face.The movie is nonetheless one of the best moral tales ever told, in which Nicole Kidman and all the supporting cast shined. Why did the makers try to make it look incomplete? Why haven't they used more sophisticated production set rather than some made-believe structures directly exposing the film studio's interior environment to you? I didn't get it in the beginning, thinking that this might just be another pretending piece of crap that tried to be "artistic".However as the story proceeded, the whole thing started to make senses. Featuring some of the best character study I've ever seen, the film naturally involved you into the adventure of Grace, the main protagonist who's supposedly to be despised so logically and naturally. Then, the audiences were forced into a game that the makers keep you guessing what would happen the next, until the very end.The ending, which in my opinion, is the most shocking and frightening ending ever seen in a movie. Dogville is principally not a horror movie, but if one still have any conscience in him, he should stand the test the movie has given us. However, I chose to live with all the miseries happened to Grace and play along just like everyone else, "sh!t happens" as they say. This, has not only put me in shame but also freaked me out at the end. Considered the potential spoilers I would caused, I'd suggest you to see it for yourself.With superb acting, very well plotted story and a shocking message for a senseless society, Dogville is easily a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film which is stunning in its simplicity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially I found the 'play' set-up gimmicky and disconcerting, however I soon forgot all about the framing and became fixated on the picture itself. There are no special effects nor camera tricks and make-up is kept to a bare minimum, which allows us to focus purely on the story and the quality of the acting; both of which are exemplary. Nicole Kidman is amazing as usual bringing a wonderful vulnerability and frailty to her character which conceals an underlying ruthlessness and brutality. Ample support comes from co-stars Betthany and Chloe Sevigny and in truth the whole cast is frighteningly convincing.The story is simple, a young woman who it appears is on the run from the mob seeks refuge in a small town known as Dogville. The residents who are initially wary of her soon warm to her and welcome her into their midst. This however, comes with a price she must do small favours in return for refuge. Inevitably greed, desire and mistrust take over the residents which corrupts them and has devastating consequences for all involved. The dramatic shift in the mentality of the townspeople is so well handled and expertly crafted by Von Trier, that it makes the emotional payoff which one receives at the end of this film even greater. It is utterly compelling and has universal themes. Ultimately, this is a film which may serve as a cautionary tale for all self-proclaimed 'civilised' societies and as a treatise upon karmic retribution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What I got myself into...an unbelievable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I went into the movie theater to see this film I didn't really know what I was getting myself into. All I knew was that "Dogville" had Nicole Kidman in it- an actress I have always liked- and Lars von Trier, a director I have always respected. I was quickly surprised by what the film was. Set entirely on a stage/sound stage I couldn't believe my eyes. As a theatre actor it was exciting to see how this all was going to work out. Dogville did not disappoint. Lars von Trier clearly creates a town that may seen ordinary and odd into masterful. Nicole Kidman was excellent and the supporting cast was flawless. It was great to see Lauren Bacall and I enjoyed her performance. When I first saw Paul Beattany in the film all I could think of was the awful film "A Knight's Tale" that he is also in. However he proved me wrong in his well developed character. Patricia Clarkson was great in her role as Vera, she is a stunning actress. If she keeps getting these great roles an Oscar is sure to be in her future. The film on the whole is wonderful. My only complaint was the length. Around the 2 hour mark I was getting kind of antsy, but the film brought me back to finish the roller coaster ride that the film gave. Truly an original. Go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is God's Will In Dogville...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday I saw Dogville after almost one year of waiting its release in Mexico. I didn't know anything about the movie besides the basic plotline: a fugitive from justice seeks refugee in a small town that takes advantage of her. I knew that it was shot in a stage and that it was being criticized for being anti american. To my surprise and being a big admirer of both, Von Trier and Kidman, Dogville exceeded all my expectations. The movie is about major issues and throughout its exciting imagery, raw performances and sharp script, Dogville digs deeper than what its detractors are saying about it. It is not, in no way, an anti american film. ***WARNING. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** My interpretation is that it is metaphor on Jesus, as a female character, an arrogant rebel that denies her own father (because she doesn't understand his and thus, her power) and doesn't want to be her daughter.She's kind, noble, and teaches everyone how to be a better person and how to be useful, but in the end they turn against her, condemning her and -metaphorically speaking- crucifying her. Then, in a surprise ending that is literally taken from the Bible, she decides to do God's will in Dogville. It is a really brave decision from Nicole Kidman to do this character that may cause some heavy conflict in some viewers, and its is a triumph for Von Trier to choose such an exciting way to shoot the film, after all, if God is everywhere and see us from the top, he should see trough walls and ceilings. This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Different But Entirely Wonderful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm going to begin this review by pointing out that this movie has some very, very, very slow points in it. So slow that I would occasionally flip through a book I was reading at the time until something of interest caught my attention and I was watching again. But the parts that got my attention were well worth the dragging moments in-between. This may contain spoilers, so you are warned again. Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, is running from the mafia (for currently unknown reasons) and seeks shelter in a small little town out in the middle of nowhere. The town actually reminds me of what the original American colonies might have looked like or an Amish town, but with technology. The townspeople reluctantly agree to hide her but they ask that in return she work for them just like everyone else in the town. Of course, the grateful Grace agrees willingly and eagerly sets to work to help the community that had accepted her despite the obvious dangers. But gradually, Grace's jobs become more demanding the play less and less. One of the happy things in the town though is that she finds love in a man named Tom (who is a soft spoken gentle man who likes to ponder things). Unfortunately, the other men also take notice of Grace's outstanding beauty and begin to threaten her with her safety if she refuses to sleep with them. In turn, the women blame this fact on Grace herself and punish her by breaking some of her most prized possessions. Grace finds she cannot escape from the demented town and is forced to put up with their cruelties, despite whatever small help she gets from her lover Tom. Again, one thing that I LOVED is the filming and set design of this film. It's almost as if you're watching a play. Everything is labeled in chalk (the streets, the graveled path, the bushes, snow, etc.), the houses are represented by tall wooden flat pieces of... wood, there's an actual truck though and tables and other such things. I loved this concept... it's like seeing a play but paying the price for a movie. Now to talk about the things that horrified me the most. And this is where the SPOILERS come in. * When Grace tries to escape in the truck only to be returned to the town (why they were so hellbent on keeping her I have no idea... it seemed rather silly but it made them all seem the more crazy) and forced to wear a chain around her neck that was attached to a large metal wheel that she was forced to drag around. This was complete with a metal collar with a bell attached to it so that they all knew where she was. * When Vera forced Grace to watch her shatter the beautiful ceramic figures that she and Tom had been saving for months to buy when she found out that Grace had slept with her husband (though this was more of a rape as Grace tried to tell the upset Vera who would not listen). This made me sob, to put it mildly. * Tom's betrayal. It broke my heart that he should defend Grace this entire time only to realize that he had never really truly loved her and had only been afraid and had been using her. He then calls up the mafia to come and get Grace, hoping that it would be the end of it. Which brings us to the ending (MAJOR SPOILERS!!). I LOVED the ending more than words can say. I was hardly surprised when it turned out that the mafia man who had been hunting her had really been her father the entire time and that he really had no intent of killing her but instead to make her a partner (something she wanted nothing of). He also offers to take her away from the town, for somehow he knew all the cruelties she had been put through here, and that his men would kill them all if she so wished. She replies that she would rather live with them than with him and that none of them were cruel at heart. Her father then asks her to step outside and take a walk to think it over, which she gladly does. I love what happens next. She sits on a bench, looking down at the town, and thinks about how the townspeople were really just scared. She thinks about how she would have done the same if she were them and that she never really thought them wicked at all. And then, the light changes and in classic literary style she sees the townspeople's true natures in this new light. She then calmly gets back into her father's car, says that she wishes them dead, and tells him about a mother with children. When the killing is done and all of Dogvilleis dead, Grace sees Tom whom she asks the men not to shoot. She then takes a gun herself, listens to his pleas for forgiveness, and kills him herself. Like I said, I love this ending more than words can describe. At first I was really REALLY upset that she would just forgive them. I was outraged that she might let them live. Then I breathed a sigh of relief. It was truly a very moving, beautiful moment. One of the most moving that I've seen in a movie in a long time and in a way it was almost poetic. This movie could not have ended any other way. Bravo!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb people still watch movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a check-out operator (let's call her Jane) at the local video store says: "Do you really want to rent that, it's the worst video we have in the shop?" you can understand she's trying to save you a dollar. Good on her.Trouble is, when she says it about a movie like this (Dogville) you just realise how dumb she is. Dogville is tremendous. Powerful, clever and brutal. No doubt my check-out chick had never seen a play or heard of Albee, Pinter etc. Short story is that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Sure, it's slow, has no set to speak of and has far too much voice-over narrative (no doubt in a vain effort to entertain the poor Jane's of the world). It makes up for that in the raw emotion it shows.Don't be swayed. This is a story about one thing and one thing only. It's about how naive immigrants/visitors to a new country inevitably get screwed by their new community. It's a beautiful cometary on how new arrivals try hard only to get rammed by the society they arrive in. This ISN'T just anti American as many (too many) commentators have said. It's the same in Australia (where I live) and Britain, Spain, France - anywhere where refugees go.The point is, human nature is the same everywhere. Osama Bin Laden are you listening? Creed, religion, upbringing mean little when put up against the basic human urges. Have a look at this movie and you'll understand that what's inside people is all the terrorism we can stand.I'm not a great fan of Nicole Kidman's acting, well until now. She is superb. I don't know when I've seen a film that has 'wierded' me out as much as this one. It's absolutely tremendous. The only criticism I have is that the ending is a bit contrived and quick but I guess after you've tortured and audience for 120 minutes, the end should be swift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I am surprised that 'Dogville' is not on IMDb'S top 250: it is one of my favorites and one of the most original movies I already have watched in my life.Many people doesn't like the lack of scenarios,special effects and soundtrack, but all of these things are secondary in Dogville: the high point to pay attention here, is the story and the message it is trying to show you: That power can corrupt and even people who seems to be nice, can exploit and use other people for their own selfish uses. Full of metaphors,I already heard some people saying that Dogville can be a metaphor of God/Christ and Human race, and many of the parallels can really fit in the story. (Look here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0276919/board/flat/23839682)Dogville looks a peaceful city with nice habitants, but in reality is like everywhere else and humans,sadly, are the same in everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is SO overrated! (SOME SPOILERS!!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really did not like this movie. I have followed Lars von Triers career for a long time, and have seen all his movies, and the only one i really enjoyed was RIKET (The Kingdom) and Breaking the Waves. What annoyed me about Dogville was a lot of things: The main thing is that it never really gets to me, i don`t feel anything while I see it. And Von Trier himself once said: "Film er f?lelser" or "Films are feelings." Dogville is surprisingly cold and it leaves a great distance between me and the characters. Another thing is the experiment in form. For those who havent seen it: It all takes place in the studio. The actors are in costume, but instead of streets, houses and trees and bushes there are markings on the floor that the actors were forced to relate to. The move through invisible doors, and you hear an invisible dog barking. Far away form his DOGME film THE IDIOT. It`s all very neat, but it all becomes very artificial. Which off course is why he did it. It all looks like a theatrical play that is being filmed, which is a thing i really hate. The story is ok, I was never really bored during this 3-hour movie, and the main reason for that is the wonderful actors. But if you come from Scandinavia you will find the story no more advanced than a Finnish tv-drama, filled with really evil people pretending to be nice, and the problems in small towns. Finnish tv-drama is an expression in these countries, and a genre Von Triers knows a lot about. But this kind of story demands an intimacy with the characters that you don`t get in Dogville. The theatrical appearance of the film creates a huge distance to the whole story, and the film falls between two chairs. It never moves or inspires. It just tells a long, long story, that frankly is not very believable, specially the ending, when we find out who Nicole Kidmans characters is, and she orders the whole village to be executed. A scene that never would have worked if Von Trier had uses film effects in stead of theatrical effects. It would have been to violent, and the N. Kidman character would have been even more difficult to swallow. The last thing that annoyed me during the entire film is John Hurts voice-over. He has a fantastic voice and presence in the film, but I hate it when a voice-over is telling me what I`m looking at. "Now you`re seeing this, and now you`re seeing that!" It is overstated the whole way through and it creates even more distance. All in all, a HUGE disappointment. Lars Von Triers experiment with the form of cinema fails big time. And I really feel a lot of people like this film just because it is weird and strange, and experimental. And I really feel sorry for the actors, see DOGVILLE CONFESSIONS and find out why. That doesn`t really matter, Hitchcock was terrible to his actors too. But go see it if you get the chance, find out what you think, I would love to discuss it, and as I said; the actors really save this movie from total failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark social parody by the contemporary Voltaire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars van Trier attempts to remind us that the moral rules which we think govern our daily lives are very fragile and could be easily altered to justify even the gravest of crimes.One aspect of this fragility is what is known as in-group/out-group problem which might explain why social groups have different sets of moral rules when it comes to treating outsiders. This dichotomy can explain why the value ascribed to the live can be so different. The distinction allows otherwise 'good people' suspend their ordinary moral rules when it comes to outsiders. In extreme cases, this resulted in persecution of Jews by the 'good Germans', torture of terrorists by the 'good Americans', or bombing hundreds of thousands of German civilians to death during WWII by the 'good British'. And in this respect, Grace's social status allows for this selective morality to take place. She has never been accepted by the villagers and hence ordinary moral rules did not have to apply to her.Another aspect is that morality often gives in to other more pragmatic considerations including those of economic benefit. Again, one of the contemporary examples could be the oil grab by the US branded as 'energy independence' policies which has the popular support across the entire country. And in the movie, as villagers start to realize clear economic benefits associated with Grace's presence their conflicting economic interests escalate the situation to her downright exploitation. Since ordinary in-group morality does not apply in her case, there is no limit to how sinister this exploitation can develop. As long as she remains excluded from their tight social group, it is not immoral even to slave her sexually.Finally, van Trier clearly believes that moral rules can be equally suspended by anyone in the society. So, in this respect there is no difference between evil gangsters and righteous villagers, rationalizing philosophers and primitive philistines, spiritual church-goers and pragmatic atheists, or even corrupted adults and innocent children. All members of these usually contrasted social groups manage to participate in tormenting Grace due to psychopathic, economic or political reasons.Perhaps this startling uniform complicity of entire society is the focal point of van Trier's work. This irresolvable problem in which every individual and society at large is responsible for horrendous crimes committed throughout the history of humankind is so grandeur it begs for some sort of solution. And although the director's solution might seem containing a self-referential problem which might require extermination of entire humanity, nevertheless under this vision it is clear why even a baby was killed in the aftermath: to save the world from the 'human plague' before it has the potential to harm anyone.The story is thus a startling critique of both society for being a cruel divisive exploitative authority, and the concept of 'morality' for being fragile and essentially meaningless. It is an excellent dark social parody from the contemporary Voltaire.</fullReview>

It is also possible that there are some aspects of the weak, manipulative characters in the film that might appeal to those who find their 'entertainment' in causing the needless suffer of others.

		<shortDescription>Not good, a little (well not little) bitter film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with those who say this film is a disappointment. Funny, I watched this the same day I watched "Tree of Life." Within 5 minutes of Tree I knew I would love it, and I did. Within 5 minutes I knew I would hate this film, and I did. But not for the story, since I hadn't seen much yet, but for the, as the French say, mise en sc?ne. It was a theater piece, but if I want to see a theater piece, I can go to the theater. But, unfortunately, it got worse. The acting was too theatrical except perhaps from Kidman. The story was numbing in its non development. First the town people help her, then they demand more for some nonsensical reason (it costs double to protect her), then Tom's solution is absurd. Then they turn to sadistic tortures, physical and mental, but it's not really punishment. Unbelievable for a film that takes 3 hours to tell. And of course the cruel finale that shocked many. Some have said that this could be an anti-Jewish film. Could be, but I see it more as a modern version of Sodom and Gomorrah. Grace is Abraham and at first wants to save the town, before the revealing light of the moon convinces her to have it destroyed. Whatever, this film is not worth the trouble thinking over long. It is not, clearly, a brain teaser like Mulholland Dr or Tree of Life. It is pseudo intellectual at its finest, like other films by this director, like the equally mediocre Melancholia. Final note, while watching this I didn't think it was especially anti- American, but once the end credits started rolling, it was a shock to hear Young Americans and to see images of poor Americans. Then, and only then, I thought that this piece is anti-American, and I believe it is. The song itself is anti-Americana at its best. Then I thought that the cheap set might reflect the idea that American life is seen as cheap and artificial, compared to the real, authentic European life. In any case, I can't recommend this film. It is over touted like most, if not all, of von Trier's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has a very particular Old Testament message to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comments about the film's message regarding how the nation treats its poor are quite accurate, however, I think it is worth pointing out that von Trier conveys his point in an almost Biblical sort of way (which is not unusual for von Trier, given the message in "Breaking the Waves"). I am particularly inclined to believe that he had in mind Ezekiel 16.49 when he wrote the script, given that the message is so similar.If it were the case that von Trier did have the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in mind when he wrote "Dogville," then it would seem that the characters of Grace and her father take on a quite interesting meaning. The two may represent the two forms of God which visit the city: Grace as the visitor(s) who are raped and treated un-neighborly, the father as the aspect of God which passes judgment on the city.Just some thoughts...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that takes place on a theater stage with almost no props. Painted outlines on the floor delineate the buildings and other props. To that weirdness, add the fact that it is a pretty scummy and unrealistic story. Finally, make it a loooong story. Artistic? Maybe. Cutting edge? Maybe. Bad? Well? Many have said Dogville has a subtle plot that takes a while to develop. I can't argue. Watching it does feel like a lot longer than 3 hours. With no visuals, it is really just a dialog movie. Basically, it's a book on tape. If you want to watch a book on tape (rather than listen to it) here is your chance. In the realm of books on tape, this one is a milestone. But I for one want to watch a movie to enjoy the power that a movie can bring to a story, i.e. recreating the images I picture in my mind when I read it. If that is not done for me, what is the point of sitting down to the movie? I give film-makers a little leeway to get creative, but that ultimate task is paramount to my enjoyment.

		<fullReview>Those who are predisposed to the film's political indictment may find Dogville brilliant; I, on the other hand, felt pushed and pushed by von Trier until I became completely detached from the movie about 2/3 through.*Minor spoilers below*Kidman plays Grace, a mysterious woman who fled into the clutches of the residents of Dogville. All went well at first, but gradually the townsfolk began exploiting her vulnerability. One by one they bare their teeth and prey on her dignity. How much can Grace take? How much can I take before things get so ridiculously extreme that I don't care anymore? The answer to the second question lies around the time the good folk of Dogville decided to wrap a chain around her neck.There is no question that the film was skillfully made. The chalked set is not a problem; it in fact becomes an effective technique von Trier wrings to shock and appall the audience. The performance was superb, especially by Kidman. American English is not my native tongue, but I think Paul Bettany spoke it fine. All that craftsmanship and art, however, went into a questionable allegory. I don't think there is any doubt that von Trier targeted USA. I'm sure cruelty worse than what Grace suffered is inflicted to immigrants and people in general everyday. Hell, NYTimes just ran an article about sex slaves in New York. But the script of Dogville shows so little restraint in its vitriol that it loses credibility. The first time Grace was raped was horrifying. By the time the engineer-wannabe joined the act it was comical.In fact I'm not sure if it wasn't meant to be an attempt of black humor through absurdity. There are a number of winks and nudges by the director suggesting that, after all, in a town where a dog is represented by a chalked outline, one shouldn't take it too seriously. I didn't laugh, though. In fact I felt manipulated and betrayed by the cruelty Grace had to go through and her seemingly infinite patience. By the time chapter 9 came around, I really didn't care enough to take any pleasure from the payoff.The director's heavy hand tried to tug me along every scene, and it had the opposite effect. I won't lose any sleep over this film tonight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Synecdoche, New York, I lost the expectation to be able to find movies that would offer me the same level of catharsis that's incited by Synecdoche, New York. But Dogville was the proof of my false assumption.However, emotional release is probably the last thing that speaks the greatness of this movie. How Von Trier deceives and plays his audience like puppets through Dogville are things that make me consider putting this movie side to side with Synecdoche, New York.Through this movie, Von Tier invites you to a seemingly sophisticated discussion on human nature and morality. He treats you like an equal colleague and nods in an agreement on whatever ideas you proposed while gently directs you to ideas and point of views that will be employed to make his point. He will provoke you a little and then discuss your reaction to the provocation before supporting your rationalization with an inaudible patronizing tone.In the end, he will hand you a gun and tell you that you have made a perceptive point. You'll start blazing that gun to all directions. And you know that it's already too late when you hear a tiny giggle coming from behind. You maybe dismiss that victorious giggle altogether and delude yourself into believing that you only do what you're doing for humanity. Or, you can laugh in a horrible excitement without noticing Von Trier's giggle and accept his view on humanity. Either way, you lose.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistake:this is not just another movie, where you can sit down in the theater and switch your brain to stand-by mode. You should come prepared, as if you were going to see a theater play. Because that`s what it really is:a stage with hardly any props or background, no neat visual effects, and tons of dialogue to develop the story. 3 hours of constant attention are required. This sure sounds like it`s a good piece of work to watch this movie, so you may ask yourself:why do it then? The answer is simple:it`s one of the best stories you will find this year outside of a book.... The story of Grace (Nicole Kidman) who is a mob refugee and ends up in the probably most remote town on this planet, Dogville, solely lives on the slow and frighteningly real change the people of Dogville and Grace go thru. From the earnest, hard-working rural folk that are won over by Grace`s earnest attempts to be worthy of their hospitality, they step by step are corrupted by the most vicious of all feelings-the feeling of having power over someone. Soon all their dark desires and surpressed feelings of inferiority surface, and they start abusing poor Grace physically and emotionally, simply because finally they can. It`s a comment on human nature, and the result isn`t very pretty. Lars von Trier cleverly decided to have no walls on the stage, so while Grace is violated by an honorary member of the village, the audience at the same time watches the others doing their everyday business-but they should know? Yes, they DO know-but they don`t mind...Especially the role of the self-proclaimed local artist is a rather nasty comment on the way artists` neglect the individual`s horror during horrible times in their self-absorbed search for the big picture of human nature and psychology....But in the end a huge surprise is waiting for the "good" people of Dogville, when they decide to finally get rid off Grace, this subversive element endangering their small society`s peace, things don`t go exactly the way they planned... and now it`s for Grace to decide what to do when you have the power and consequently the responsibility to make changes for the better..... It`s not an easy movie to watch, being familiar with the working ethics of von Trier sure helps-and then you will be surprised that he actually decided to alter some of his Dogma rules to make this the best possible movie, and not let them become obstacles by blindly clinging to them. Probably Dogville is his most easily accessible movie yet, though it`s visualization may seem awkward to the occasional moviegoer, this time he has a strictly sequenced story to tell and a message to bring across (though it`s an arguable one).... Dogville is a most interestingly filmed and fascinating study of human nature and what horrors lurk behind the clean surface, waiting to be unleashed...... Without having to rely on blood,explosions or fancy bullet-time effects, von Trier created images that will stick with you-because he has done what all good moviemakers should do-aim for your head, not just for your eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was astounded. Astounded at how completely boring this film was. How could anyone like this tripe?!! How can you delve into the social significance of a film when you're fighting off the urge to fall to sleep? They paid the entire budget to getting Nicole Kidman to star in it and obviously couldn't afford to pay for a proper set. I cannot discourage you enough from seeing this banal detritus. I get a student discount so it only cost me ?3.70 to get in, I still feel ripped off. My friend received too much change from the cashier in the cinema so he was effectively paid to go and watch this and he still feels it was a waste of time. The makers of this film have their heads so far up their own backsides it's unbelieveable. Avoid at all costs unless you've got your head up your own backside as well!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasted three hours of my life watching this so it's hard to spend more time writing about it. But, here it goes.First , I could care less if Lars von Trier is trying to show us Americans, Europeans, or people from the mid-east. This movie is about the morality of mankind. It doesn't take three hours to tell me how bad human beings can be to each other. I know that from first hand experience. If it wasn't for the kindness of strangers I would have put a bullet in my head years ago. Second, this is just a poorly put together group of unfocused, badly edited clips. It took way to long for each scene to be completed. The actors delivered "robotic" performances. Toward the end that narrator just kept going on and on. I just wish someone would have put a bullet in my head to stop this boring piece of crap.This film doesn't deserve to be in the top 100 what a joke.Thank you for your time P</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lars Von Trier Should Seek Medical Attention Immediately</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, I'm worried about that dude. Something must have happened to him. Maybe he burst a blood vessel in his brain. Maybe he has developed a hormonal imbalance. But after proving his abilities with the remarkable and heart-rending "Dancer in the Dark", it's hard to take "Dogville" as anything less than a cry for help. This movie is flat out awful. The plot could kindly be called "allegorical" by people who don't want to say "implausible" or, more honestly, "shitty". The characters might be called one-dimensional, if they even had reliable, static traits, which they don't. The story is a sensationalistic, over-the-top account of rape, slavery and murder, and yet it manages to be crushingly, ploddingly, maddeningly SLOW (nearly 3 hours). The cameras were in focus, and Nicole Kidman was attractive, but other than that it is hard to think of a single thing that went right. Now, I understand that a lot of people love this movie because they think it exposes the seedy underbelly of human nature in general, and of the American national character in specific. (I certainly won't question Von Trier's credentials as a commentator on American culture, having lived all his life in Copenhagen, a city with several American fast food restaurants.) And I imagine you really could make a great movie about a woman who is initially welcomed and eventually enslaved and violated by a small American town. However, this ain't that movie. In order to understand the depths of awfulness that this film achieves, maybe it would be helpful to enumerate some of the things that would be different in this highly theoretical 'good' version of 'Dogville' relative to the all-too-actual 'Mongolian clusterfuck' version I review here.1) It would have very little voice-over. Voiceovers are to movies what bandages are to people: both indicate that that something has gone wrong. Voiceovers usually mean that a director made a major change to the movie after principle photography, generally because he (Von Trier being a he) has realized in editing that the movie he shot sucks dick. Our theoretical 'good' Dogville would have no need of repeated voice-over, because the story would actually tell itself.2) Grace (Kidman) would be a rational human being. She would do things that would help her avoid suffering, like resisting at least one of her many rapists, or telling someone that Tom had stolen the $10, or pressuring Tom to get her out of town early on, or saving up her money for a damn bicycle instead of those cheap figurines, or trying to make friends with someone in the town in order to solidify her precarious position. Something like that. She definitely wouldn't spend the first 2.5 hours suffering silently like some martyred saint, and then last 20 minutes burning the place down like Attila the Hun. 3) Tom would be a rational human being. He would be bookish, but not completely insane. He would fall in love with Grace, and then show some actual concern for her safety, instead of wandering around for two hours spouting nonsense. And most importantly, when he found out about the rape it would have some kind of emotional effect on him (any normal person would FLIP OUT). He certainly wouldn't go to this woman that he apparently loves and gently bitch to her about how unfair it is that he is the only person who doesn't get to rape her. And even if he DID do that, Grace would respond with something a little more salty than a lecture from a graduate level philosophy seminar on the nature of love in a slave society. 4) The other townspeople would be rational human beings. There would be less of them, say 9 instead of 15, which would allow each one to appear on screen more than once every 30 minutes. There would be a good reason why, say, the church organist who befriends Grace doesn't protest when Grace is literally placed in shackles, a reason better than, "Boy it would be inconvenient if I had to start sweeping the stairs again." Even if there was a reason, some of the townsfolk would at least be SOMEWHAT conflicted about the whole idea. Oh, and there would be a good reason why the first person to take a disliking to Grace wouldn't immediately drop a dime in order to get the $5000 reward.5) The movie would be about 75 minutes shorter. The extra time would come from all the time the characters spend milling about, doing chores, talking about nothing. Grace would show up in the first five minutes, she would be raped within the first 60 minutes, and the town would be burning by the 100 minute mark. Tom wouldn't get more than a minute to yammer on about moral rearmament, nor would anyone get to spend 10 minutes shouting the word "arrogant" repeatedly. These are just some of the things that would happen in a good version of "Dogville". Two thing you wouldn't need to change is the excellent ensemble cast and a director who, when properly medicated, is quite talented. But then, as flawed as "Dogville" is, this amounts to no more than installing expensive toilets on the Titanic. IN CONCLUSION: Do not see Dogville. It isn't worth your time, even in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way. If you like America-bashing, rent a Michael Moore film. Moore is at least funny and concise. "Dogville" is a muddled, frustrating, ridiculous mess. None of the characters ring true, and as a result, the horror and shock that should accompany this story never materialize. If you just have to know what you are missing, go see "Dancer in the Dark" and try to imagine a horribly botched sequel. But again, do not see "Dogville" under any circumstances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of morality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this a tale about the loss of humanity as an individual suffers from the power of group behavior? Is it a about an idealist / philosopher unable to handle events and see the tragedy around him? Is this a scathing attack on the social conditions in the US? Or is it about the New World reversing power roles with the Old World? Is it a biblical allegory? Or an autobiographical description of Von Trier's life?Dogville, made as a staged play and inspired by the song Pirate Jenny by Bertolt Brecht, is all, making not the structure of the tale set in a Colorado mining town complex, but its interpretation. Like in Breaking the Waves, Von Trier uses the literature reference, dividing the movie in chapters to tell his tale of an individual becoming victim of group behavior, this time combined with the idealist / intellectual standing by and having no solutions on offer. It all watches like a Greek tragedy, the Greek names of the children of Vera and Chuck only confirming this.The biblical parts are thrown in with the dog Moses, as guardian of the Ten Commandments which are severely transgressed by the citizens of Dogville. The dog can only be seen at the end and is spared. We have the name of the main character Grace and her treatment comparable to that of Jesus; the blindness and the window; the seven figurines broken by Vera stand both for her seven children and the seven sins. Also the Old and New Testament (father and daughter in the car having different interpretations of morality) are touched upon, and Tom representing the betrayal of Judas.The concept of power plays an important part throughout the movie. The line of power starts with Tom, convincing the citizens of Dogville to give Grace a place to hide. As the philosopher, writer and spiritual leader of Dogville he is unable to cope with the basic problem of keeping mankind under control, he is shown as a theoretic, not someone who has practical solutions and fails as an authority (the practical engineer only adds to the misery here as he only makes instruments of oppression). Later the power is taken on by the group to commit the atrocities shown. Dogville is therefore also a warning about letting ignorant and simple minded people take on authority and decisions as there can be horrific consequences. At the end Grace's father comes in and Grace assumes the power from him. All misuse and are unable to handle the concept of power to proper use, the power of Grace and her father is mafia power after all (there is a hint the movie uses that the power of the US has grown out of criminal power, a common historical misunderstanding). The US State is unable to prevent anything of it happening here, it can only be heard in the distance or seen shortly when the police arrives (a prison and police force is the only thing the state offers in the movie). Dogville starts with a speech to be heard on the radio made by the President of the US; the radio is turned off before he starts talking. The end credits with the pictures give way to interpretations of the lack of a proper welfare state in the US, at least at the time of the Depression.Another moral issue arises in the most important dialog in the movie between Grace and her father. At first Grace is incapable to condemn the villagers. Her father calls that arrogance, because she should judge others by the same moral standards as she judges herself. She changes mind after thinking about this concept of morality, judgment and punishment. The whole view on mankind in Dogville is extremely dark: As you make yourself dependent of other people, they will always misuse that opportunity and take advantage of your weaknesses. Later Grace forgets all notions of forgiveness.Another interesting addition and layer comes when Tom suddenly takes on the role of Von Trier himself (the point where he talks about the trilogy). So in reality Von Trier sees himself in the role of Tom. And he makes a deliberate parody of himself, because the harsh and demanding way he treats actresses is in a way comparable to the treatment of Grace.Technically the movie is well shot with the camera-work of Anthony Dod Mantle. When Grace is raped for the first time, the camera retracts and it diminishes on purpose the impact of that scene. By showing inhuman acts without barriers like walls and doors they show how ignorant people usually are about them. But the best shot technically is from Grace under a blanket in the truck, it has surreal qualities.Two side notes: The beautiful music is by Vivaldi ('Cum dederit dilectus suis somnum' (IV) from 'Nisi dominus' RV 608). On the mine shaft we can read Dictum ad Factum, meaning Said and Done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers, somewhat implied, not majorDogville- Deserving of praise, and criticism Reviewer: Palme from San Diego, CA USA Dogville is a masterful, intuitive, and original concept brought to life in a master diagram of symbols that ask you to interpret their analogies and interactions in certain ways. It demands that you compare it from the tale of Christ, to the tale of the immigrant. For many, Christ is the path they have chosen, as Grace, the main character, sacrifices her being to please a small town's inhabitants. The beautiful set too, must have a purpose. The chalk drawn lines, and the bare sets must represent an allusion to ancient times and the lack of substance representing oldness and lack of substance in people's characters, as the viewer soon finds out, as Grace becomes haunted by continual abuse after the people have the slightest reason to abuse and torture her. I see it differently, it is the tale of a woman that wants to stand above the all-too-apparent animal nature of the world by continual forgiveness and continual humility in all regards. By letting herself get tortured, and forgiving, she is making herself divine. She plays the divinity willingly and arrogantly. She resorts to what she does later because she realizes that she cannot be divine without taking things into her own hands, for being divine also means power. The arrogance in perfection is never enough.The faults of the movie, really only lie in the end credits, which were offensive, and the sheer length of the project, which made it somewhat arduous. However, if the ending song had not been used, I would've given it five stars.The thing I though was most amazing about this movie was Nicole Kidman. This strong actress is used to playing people with a love of breaking down as dramatically as is possible. In this movie, she transforms herself so completely by creating the world that the director planned for herself, and becoming Grace. She looks as if she has lost a will long ago to cry, she's lost the will to emote, but there are feelings and vulnerability that come to her amazing eyes, and she strikes fear in the hearts of viewers. She gives a performance like none other that I have seen, and carries it through dignity, presence, vulnerability, understated elegance, and the ability to seem full of pride that she gives tiny nuances for and a clinging arrogance that can make her seem full of importance and and silent dignity even when put into the most compromising of conditions. She transmits pain flawlessly and elegantly, and the performance was mindblowing. She deserves an oscar for it, she made such an incredible use of her eyes. It's perhaps the best performance by an actress ever put on the screen. The challenge of the role was unthinkable, and she met it, surpassed it, and she melted so flawlessly into a wounded woman's soul and bared it. WOW!!!The rest of the cast was very good as well, but Nicole Kidman gave the most thrilling. Paul Bettany should get some recognition for his intellectual run as Tom, the suitor and protector of Grace. Ben Gazzara gave a highly stylized performance as well and I was taken away with his intitial scene with Nicole Kidman. There styles so different, it made for a terrorizing experience.This is a good movie, with an incredible performance by Kidman and a great supporting cast that is a must see for any Kidman fan, or independent film lover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville is a mis-conceived project, full of freshmen, self-canceling urges that von Trier should be deeply embarrassed about. Von Trier is serious, see, so he omits the sets, and basically hands you a three hour play. It's like watching PBS. Why does he reject this fundamental aspect of film? Who knows. If he wanted to focus your attention on the ideas, he'd just film it inconspicuously and the unremarkable production would drop away, foregrounding the ideas. Instead the severe non-set becomes a conspicuous way of saying that he's different; that he's a genius with ego needs. He hires an all-star cast (Hmmm, I think I figured out why there's no budget for sets). The morose 'play' is like a dated Clifford Odets piece co-written by Josef Goebbels. He wants to grind your nose in a bleak story that plays out over a pretentious length (He's so serious, see), but you're not thinking of the ideas in the piece, because he hired that distracting all-star cast. If he wants to make a serious point about the hopelessness of human nature, why make it so obscure that only 100 viewers (tops) are going to relate to it? He sabotages the life of his own ideas. Even the end credits are unrelentingly hopeless; in case we missed the puritanical condemnations of the story, we're presented with bleak, historical images of impoverished Americans. You end up watching it thinking 'What was his goal? ...Why did any of these actors get on board?' because the answer is not on the screen. It begs the question; Of all the thing von Trier finds contemptible, isn't being a director who makes obscure, arty-farty films among them?The camera work is noticeably feeble. The narration is bookish, and deadening. The Elm Street markings look like a board game, not the thoughtful layout of a real space. von Triers Dogme charter really produces some sucky movies.Full disclosure: I an enormous fan of von Trier's film Europa (aka Zentropa). When he made his 2 lame "women in peril" movies (Beneath the Waves, Dancer in the Dark) I realized ruefully that he was never heading back to the richer material of Zentropa. Our loss.</fullReview>

Nicole Kidman was riding high on her Oscar win for The Hours (another waste of two hours of my life) and I expected something interesting with Lars Von Trier directing. What did I get for my $18 (Cdn)? Answer: the most pretentious movie I have ever seen in my life. I would expect something like this to come from a 1st year film student at a small community college with all his/her friends "acting". This film is not clever, the dialogue is downright boring and when it is not boring you to death it is downright laughable. There is a scene with James Caan and Nicole Kidman where the conversation comes across as written by a high school student. Avoid this movie at all costs. 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me preface this review by saying most of the movies I watch, most other people would call artsy-fartsy. But this one really takes the cake, it's such artsy-fartsy s*** and for no good reason. I'm sure, reading this by now, you're aware that the entire movie takes place on a soundstage with hardly any props, but the actors pretend the props are there and you hear the sound effects. It was torture having to sit through three hours of watching Nicole Kidman get tortured, brutalized, raped and exploited through this pointless movie. There is a solid social commentary and story in this movie somewhere... if it could have been shot on an actual location and whittled down to two hours, von Trier would really have something here. Yes, I realize that is the most Hollywood thing to say, but it's true. If I want to go see a PLAY, I'll go to a playhouse. Shooting a play on film is excrutiatingly boring, and that's what this movie was. And as if I wasn't p****d off by the end of this movie already, what he does with the ending credits is truly tasteless and shameful. He plays a very upbeat song, "Young Americans," over images of Americans in poverty. And von Trier isn't even American. What the f*** man???

I give it a few points for going out on a limb with the style, but again, it just feels like something a very high college student would come up with the day before the script was due. And it was a one-trick pony, the sense of style was never used effectively for anything else. It contributed absolutely nothing to the movie.The acting was fine, just terribly dull. Never felt the slightest connection to anyone, or felt that any situation was any more than a ridiculous farce; everything happened not because it naturally follows from the characters and events, but because it had to happen to move the plot forward. Everyone but Grace is basically a hive mind who feel everything in perfect lockstep with each other, like a good fable. The brutality followed the generic revenge flick arc trod by hundreds of other movies, even the narrator just felt utterly pointless and jarring, instead of quaint and unusual.Obviously, there are quite a few people who love it. Give it five minutes, and you'll already know if you'll enjoy the whole movie or not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville's a Dog!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a fascinating production premise of shooting on a presentational set design (that is, drawing chalk lines and bidding the audience to imagine that the walls are there). This is the stuff of theater, and Lars Von Trier forces the presentational method into that of movies, which are usually representational in design. But that's the only kudos I can give to this boring, badly written movie with overbearing on-the-nose narration, and awkward lines. Cinematography was distractingly bad as well. I believe that the idea was to simulate the feeling of seeing a stage play, so almost the entire movie is shot with extremely long lenses from 50 feet away, which feels, obviously, like you're watching a movie from fifty feet away.Now the Flannery O'Connor-like moral allegory in the story is what many people comment on, and regarding that, I would like to give Mr. Von Trier one, no two, very big middle fingers.The root of all evil is not found in poor and working class white people. I'm sure that there are bad people among regular rednecks. But why pick on them? Because they don't fit into some liberal category for pity?On the positive, I thought that Nicole Kidman was great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW what an amazing film...I've just finished watching Dogville for the first time. I have to say that is the most shocking film I have seen in my lifetime. Considering I watched 'Oldboy' merely a week ago that is saying A lot. This film wasn't graphically gut-wrenching, but it's the actions of the characters and the finale of the film that really made me think.The film is shot entirely on one 'stage' and has sporadic narration. Some people may find this theatre-like atmosphere off-putting, but I think this is an ingenious, not to mention unique, idea. The point of having the whole film shot on this one stage is that it helps to illustrate how close-knit a community Dogville is. There are no walls on the set only props, it's as if the film is baring its heart and soul (the characters) to the audience. All i can say is patience is a virtue, so if you can sit through the first few scenes and get used to this 'universal stage' idea the story will soon engulf you and compulsion to watch the whole 9 chapters is certain (not sure if there is a relevance in the number 9).The basic plot (no spoilers): Tom is an aspiring intellectual/philosopher, he daydreams about morales and the ideals of right and wrong one day hoping write a successful paper on this. He is fed up with the narrow-minded people of Dogville, accusing them of non-acceptance in regards to outsiders and the world in general. When Nicole Kidman's character Grace stumbles upon Dogville by chance, Tom sees this as an opportunity to test the town's people. Grace takes up residence in Dogville and the story takes flight....The cast is absolutely superb, Nicole Kidman puts in a first-rate performance. I think all the actors and actresses really got to grips with their roles and this makes the film all the more special. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a gripping, meaningful story as well as a shock or two. This film is simply enthralling. 9/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A completely originally styled film! Wonders will never cease!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What does one make of Dogville? I can say, without risking speaking out of turn, that this is the most originally styled movie in the history of movies. The film starts by introducing us to the town of 'Dogville', which is basically just a lay out that consists of white lines on a black canvass. Naturally, I expected the film to switch to a more proper set once it started proper - but it doesn't! Flamboyant Danish director Lars Von Trier leaves us with just this very basic set, and I was expecting to start hating the film very quickly for that very reason. But this style only allows Von Trier to show what a talented artist he really is, as the lack of distractions allows him to put the focus on the acting and story, both of which are immense. The story is rich with themes of acceptance and retribution, while the entire cast - which consists of many smaller European stars - prove their worth by delivering it in a way that is engaging and thought provoking. We follow Grace (Nicole Kidman) who, while on the run from gangsters, stumbles into Dogville where the locals agree to take her in.?at a price.I admire the audacity and bravery of Lars Von Trier for making this movie, which most people, frankly, would have laughed at if they heard the idea before seeing the movie. The movie clocks in at just less than three hours, but you honestly wouldn't believe it while watching. Von Trier has shown that all a movie needs to work is a strong story and some good actors to deliver it. Dogville is story telling at it's most basic as it is delivered with hardly any means other than dialogue and acting, and so requires a talented auteur to tell it, which it has in Lars Von Trier. The director has made many original and inventive films, and has gained quite a good reputation, of which this film only adds to. One thing that many people tend to think of movies these days is that there's no originality left, which is true to an extent, but my response to those people is simple - watch 'Dogville' and reconsider.</fullReview>

Difficult to follow by the viewer used to constant leading, explicit reference and the persistent presence of the unnecessary. The first transformation turns a difficult film into a heavy weight: suffering and un-reasoning are explained first hand to whoever witnesses such humiliation and is left without comfort. We will alternatively identify ourselves with the victim or the villagers, or just leave the game. There will be, nevertheless, no place of comfort. The second transformation turns a heavy weight into raw liberation. Witnesses will find reparation. It is not the return to a balance previous to the conflict, but awaited reward.If you have plenty of motives to explain your behaviors, if you are in peace with yourself and you wouldn't change that, if you choose films that give you just what you wanted, then do not see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The work of an extraordinarily good storyteller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having recently seen Lars Von Trier's latest in a string of strong morality-play style films, it's starting to become clear to me that Von Trier really is becoming an extraordinarily good storyteller.That's not to say that `Dogville' isn't yet another experimental departure in form for Von Trier: it is. While its sheer lack of sets and on-location shooting causes the film to far more closely resemble the kind of front-row view that you might expect of a stage play than that you would expect of a fully realised film, the effect of that is two-fold. Firstly, it focuses the eye on the pure performances that are laid before it, and secondly, it focuses the mind on the moral and philosophical issues that underscore the film.With regard to the former, all of the performances in this film are excellent: Nicole Kidman's central role is subtly played and perfectly paced (in many ways reminiscent of her equally stellar performance in Gus Van Sant's To Die For) and it is nothing short of a pleasure to see Lauren Bacall back on screen.As to the philosophical themes which Von Trier slowly and delicately unfurls during the course of this film, I don't intend to go into their narrative specifics in any great depth for fear of ruining the film for anyone who hasn't seen it as yet; but suffice it to say that during the course of this film, Von Trier takes his audience on a journey that begins with an act of pure altruism and ends with one of pure vengeance.In the midst of that journey, Von Trier confronts his audience with the following philosophical question: should we forgive in others things that we would not permit of ourselves? The answer that the film gives is, quite plainly: no.For forgiving of others things that we simply would not do ourselves, Von Trier avers that we are placing ourselves above them, essentially imagining their characters' to be inferior to our own, and consequently permitting more of them. The film argues that this kind of behavior is not so much the hallmark of a kind and altruistic heart, but rather a display of pure arrogance.It's difficult to find a flaw in Von Trier's logic here, even where it intersects with the very Christian ideal of `turning the other cheek', for the film's criticism simply cannot extend to the biblical acts of Christ himself (who, as the son of God, had every reason in the world to be arrogant - but was not).Von Trier's film loops back at its end to pick up the thread of another familiar biblical theme, but to find out which one it is, those of you who haven't seen the film yet will need to (and I do hope that you manage to enjoy it as much as I did).- Vanessa Long</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minimalistic, Interesting, and Thought-Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dogville" is a movie quite different from what we are used to see. The atmosphere is utterly minimalistic and theater-like: For example, the "buildings" are actually areas demarcated by chalk-scribblings within which a couple of elementary pieces of furniture are located. The action takes place within this "stage" and there is nothing else to be seen.In this environment, the 16 main characters that constitute the movie (excluding some occasional outsiders such as policemen and gangsters), i.e. the fugitive Grace (Nicol Kidman) and the Dogville residents, are portrayed in an extremely powerful way; indeed, the absence of the usual constituents of a film (scenes, visual effects, etc.) magnifies each personality and his/her interactions with Grace. This a film about the human character, and actually for the dark side of the human character: The way the villagers gradually expose their nasty elements (greed, contempt, lust) towards their "protege" is telling. The characters are portrayed wonderfully, and Nicol Kidman again proves her undisputed talent.In the end, despite the long-awaited catharsis, the film leaves the viewer with a melancholic feeling: The movie loudly reminds us that despite appearances people ARE bad, and it just takes the right opportunity for them to show their true nature.A very good movie, yet one that might alienate several people due to its highly minimalistic scenery I explained above. For those ready for something different and thought-provoking, go and see this 8/10 film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sensorial experience worth living</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautiful woman escaping from the mob seeks refuge in Dogville. The young town master convince the people to cover her; they are reluctant but finally accept when she make small jobs for each one. However, the police appear looking for the woman, first as a missing person then as a criminal with a reward (blaming her for a crime she could not possibly commit). Town's people use this to threat her in order to get `more favors' even sexual thus becoming the town's slave. Escaping from the town proves to be not very easy when even the people she trust could betray her. Dogville has become a living hell for her, but when everything looks like an unavoidable tragedy; a surprising twist turn over the situation (and powers).Dogville was cataloged by many as `Anti-American'. I imagine people who think that must find themselves too similar to the movie (fictitious?) characters and their false moral and hypocrisy. Having living in very small towns outside USA and also been part Italian descendent; I can tell that these types of behaviors is very common in closed groups (small towns, families or even circle of friends) were outsiders are punished or ignored. Is not that the justification of the KKK or other `institutions' alike in many part of the world? Lars Von Trier created an incredible parable about the very thin line between good and evil. How easy, people tempted by the power over others, abuse and torture them without even realizing. Trier was always obsessed with hypocrisy in the society we live. His most notorious films `Breaking the Waves' or `The Idiots' were hard critics to people condemning others just because of they are different. This time, he went one step further.Dogville is not a traditional movie in any sense. First of all is divided in nine chapters with a brief introduction. Second, the DOGMA 95 creator is still demonstrating that he can make wonderful films without `accessories'. In this case he took out almost the entirely scenery. Yes, the whole movie was made in a warehouse; the town is chalk drew on the floor and just a few elements like pieces of furniture or a bench are really there. No walls or roofs; all to our imagination; and it works!!!. During the first minutes, the feeling of looking at a play in a big theater, but the camera (or the view) moves in every direction in the 3D space creating a sensation of intimacy even when there are no walls at all.Nicole Kidman is excellent in her shift from innocence to desperation, to acceptance and to madness. The rest of the cast (mostly Americans) manages with perfection parts somewhat (but necessary) stereotypical, but Blair Brown as the very smooth and kind wife who became absolutely cruel and violent when her world is affected, is worth mentioning.The only possible critic to this almost perfect movie is the length. At almost three hours, Trier takes all the time he wants to transfer the mood of his characters to us. He could probably get the same results with shorter scenes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting was worth seeing the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is a microcosm of all society but the writer/director hits you over the head. The eclectic group of actors was worth seeing the film. Blair Brown, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, Ben Gazzara, Stelan Skargard and Patricia Clarkson. I find it very interesting that Lars Van Trier does not like America and has never visited America. He left a very negative impression by ending the film with photos depicting some of the worst of human behavior and suffering. Not that we do not have our "areas of improvement" but why does he feel the need to identify us and not the horrors that exist in other areas throughout the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strange movie, unlike any other movie ever made. Von Trier confirms his reputation as an innovative, unconventional director. One of the most striking features is the absence of almost everything but the actors. They're playing on a huge stage, where the outlines of houses are painted on the floor and only some fragments (a bench, a church spire, a desk) are visible of what is supposed to be a village. Moreover, the movie is divided into chapters, and large parts of the story are narrated by a voice-over. But it all works very well. Kidman is outstanding as a humiliated refugee who takes revenge in a terrible way, and the whole film is so surprising and wonderfully made that this is a sure winner for the Palme d'Or. Nevertheless, the length of the movie demands a lot from the viewer. In my opinion, it could have been shorter. There are quite a few moments I wished the story would continue a little bit faster, and the end scenes are long and a bit confusing. Nevertheless: a wonderful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no desire to see this movie because I'm no fan of Nicole Kidman but a friend recommended I see this. This is probably one of the most original movies to come out in years and I'm sorry I missed it in 2003. Everything about this movie is terrific. The way it's filmed so simple, major Hollywood filmmakers should take notes that you don't need 100million in special effects to make a movie good. The movie's filmed from a state set, small prop pieces, few items here and there but it works. Good performances make this movie work and I must admit I was rooting for Nicole Kidman's character to come through. Be warned, this is a hard movie to watch. In fact, I still can't get it out of my head. Certain scenes will make you cringe and a shock of an ending will just sort of make you depressed. The story is very simple, so are the characters, and the setting. Kidman's character shows up one day in an ordinary town. She's running from something and so her whole reason for being is mysterious. Who is she and where did she come from? She meets one of the locals who allow her to stay in the town in exchange for doing chores for the people who live there. Eventually, they agree to vote on her staying but at the same time, take advantage of her. she is kind and well meaning, even trying to better the town's attitude toward one another. This is where the story gets complicated. Soon she is mistreated to the point of rape by the men of the town and is offered no help or support from the women. Each character of this town is revealed to be so vile, even the kids are heartless and cold. Over time, it becomes clear, there is no redemption in this town. The ending, not going to give it away but the payoff is shocking. In addition to the display of violence and sexual perversity displayed throughout the movie, it's like a hammer hitting the nail on it's head. Had this been an actual play and not a movie, this would have won every major award of the stage. I can't even begin to imagine the intensity of seeing something played out like this on a live stage. This would have become a global phenomenon and much like it is on film, talked about for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the wrong side of the tracks from "Our Town" lies "Dogville"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier takes the luscious fruit of "the American Dream", peels off the pretty facade, and reveals the ugliness, vanity, and judgment underneath. Yes, Dogville could be any town in the world, but it fits 21st century USA too well to ignore the connection.The early theme of the film is, "You people need to be more accepting," which flies in the face of American self-sufficiency. We can make it alone through hard work and faith in God. We don't need anything from "outsiders".When Tom introduces Grace and tells the denizens of Dogville that she will provide them with a chance to display their generosity and compassion, they are extremely skeptical. One of the delights of this film is watching that seed of skepticism evolve, first into a small plant of teamwork and trust, then later into a huge, monstrous tree of hate and intolerance.There are many ways to analyze this film, but what first came to me was that it was an allegory of America's disdain for welfare. Grace must offer herself to the community and do little jobs for them in return for shelter. At first they must create work for her (she can do "things you don't want done"), but slowly the citizens expectations and demands increase, and they lord their power over her with threats and insults, much the same way many Americans act towards poor people who are on welfare ("They're lazy, they should get a job, they're not one of us."). Eventually Grace becomes literally "chained" to the community, a slave and criminal. Finally the citizens just want Tom to get rid of her, so similar to how much of America would like to have their poor and homeless problem just go away.Another theme constantly repeated throughout the film is the theme of "arrogance". Grace mentions more than once the sin of arrogance, and it is most certainly that which brings about the violent conclusion of Dogville. America and arrogance? I'll let the readers decide the legitimacy of that connection."Dogville" is also about the presence of evil in all human beings. People appear decent on the surface, but given the right mixture of circumstances and motivations we are all capable of terrible acts. Following said acts we are also capable of rationalizing our behavior and deluding ourselves into believing we acted morally, perhaps even heroically. Patriots commit atrocities for their flag. True believers do likewise for their God.Bravo to the brilliant Mr. von Trier for exposing the dark underbelly of the American Dream in such a pointed and creative way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human behavior can be more frightening than horror movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director : Lars Von TrierI have not felt so many different emotions after watching a movie for a long long time. Dogville is brilliant not only because it's shows us the frailties of human nature, but also because it does not shy away from showing the methods to deal with them. The opening shot itself grips you and then you are hooked to this 3 hour movie, which is not in any way a deterrent, because of the way the movie is narrated and it's theater play like filming. The movie is narrated in 9 parts along with an prologue, in almost a novel like flow which encapsulates the mind of the viewer till the end. The parts are precisely named and described which helps to know exactly what to expect ahead, still it manages to shock you. The director decided to shoot the entire movie on the stage using stage props and lighting. It may seem weird and hard to accept initially, but the lack of a proper location, is advantageous for this kind of cinema where more focus is given to the human emotions.The variety of human emotions and the complexity of human relations is the most shocking and revelatory part of this movie. How do humans exploit other human's weakness and unleash the hidden vultures from inside them is shocking to say the least. There are so few characters in the movie which are confined in such a small place, that you cannot help but feel the hostility. How can anyone survive this place is the thought that lingers in the mind as new chapters keep unfolding. This is one of those movies where the human behavior is so scary that it will haunt me for some days even more than a ghost horror movie could. The ending is also such that will leave anyone short of words. On the acting front, Nicole Kidman may have played the greatest role of her life. The variety of emotions she portrays is applaudable. You sympathize with her but also hate her for bearing all this and being "too" good. In the climax, I felt like giving her a standing ovation and then felt bad about myself. It is that kind of a movie. The other cast has also played their parts to perfection and everyone will remain in your thoughts after the movie ended. Was good to see screen legends Lauren Bacall and James Caan after a long time even though in minuscule roles. In conclusion, I would want to ask one question, would the movie would have been any different if the fugitive seeking a refuge would not have been beautiful Nicole Kidman, but a middle aged man, or maybe a less attractive woman? Anyways, this movie will linger for some time at least in my mind.Rating : 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is set in the 1930's and is the predecessor to the film Manderlay (which I actually saw before this film). The film is about a young woman named Grace who is on the run from the mob and she then stumbles upon a small town named Dogville. One of the members of the town named Tom takes a liking to Grace and has a town vote where they decide to let Grace stay. To repay the townspeople for their kindness Grace helps everybody out around town with their chores and tasks that need to be done. Everyone really seems to take a liking to Grace, but that soon changes and Grace then discovers that the people in this town who she thought were so nice really aren't that nice at all and it probably would have been better if she had never have stumbled upon this town in the first place. Winner of The Bodil Award for Best Film (for the film's writer/director Lars Von Trier) at The Bodil Awards; The Cinema Brazil Grand Prize for Best Foreign Film at The Cinema Brazil Grand Prize; The CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards; The Honorary Award for Lars Von Trier at The Copenhagen International Film Festival; The David Award for Best European Film at The David Di Donatello Awards; The European Film Award for Best Cinematographer and Best Director at The European Film Awards; The Guild Film Award Silver for Foreign Film at The Guild Of German Art House Cinemas; The Robert Award for Best Costume Design and Best Screenplay at The Robert Festival; The Golden Aries for Best Foreign Actress (Nicole Kidman who plays Grace) and Best Foreign Film and The Audience Award for Best Film at The Sofia International Film Festival. Dogville has good direction, a good script, good performances by the cast and good costume design. As I stated above I saw the film's sequel Manderlay before I saw Dogville and I must say that they are similar in many ways, but because I liked Manderlay a lot I do not mean that as a negative comment. Once again this film like Manderlay has very few sets and no walls and the film is very low budget. The film is a little slow moving at times, but it did not stop me from enjoying the film. Once again writer/director Lars Von Trier proves that he is a very good storyteller and does not need a lot of movie, sets or special effects to make a good film with a good story. I liked how in the film I didn't really know where the film was going and the ending surprised me in many ways, but in a good way. I like how the film went in different directions and tried different things and it achieved everything it went out and set to do. As I said in my review of Manderlay this film may not be for everyone as well. It is a slow moving film and it is quite artistic and fairly symbolic and philosophical in some ways and I just thing people may be bored with the film because of it's style and long running time. However I think this film is perfect for fans of artistic films and films that have good stories and that is mainly what the film focuses on instead of big effects and things that would further help sell the film. Instead what we get is an interesting story that is in a lot of ways like reading a novel. A good novel as a matter of fact because it draws you in and you want to see where the film goes. I think after reading this review you should be able to tell if this film is for you or not and if you are not sure if you would like this movie than it might be better not to see it, but for those interested or who want to experiment with this film then I recommend this film and it's sequel Manderlay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambiguous and challenging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, this film certainly presents a lot of moral dilemmas and paradoxes. Is it anti-American? No doubt. Does it also, as many people have argued, say something about human nature in general? Possibly. But it is ambiguous in this respect. If it is a comment on all mankind, then why the ending montage and the desire to make the setting so unambiguously American? You could argue that the townspeople behave like the Germans during Nazism, etc., and thus the theme is more universal, but the specifically American imagery undermines this.Also, the justification of mass murder is similarly problematic. Is it revenge, divine retribution, or something more insidious? I mean, it would not be hard to read the film as: Grace--the beautiful, blonde, pure heroine corrupted and debased by the town of vile, lying, less -than-human (dogs in fact) scum, who are then exterminated. I'm not saying that this is what Von Trier necessarily intends, but it did cross my mind while watching the film. I was also reminded of the German Baader-Meinhof/RAF gang who tried to justify their antisemitism as a sort of exorcism of Germany's Nazi past (i.e. they could attack Jews and deny the holocaust because in their words they were trying "...to get rid of this thing about Jews we've all had to have since the Nazi time.") Again, I'm not saying that this is what Von Trier intends, but the ambiguities of the film do make interpretation open. If the film is implicit that the dogville-ians (i.e. Americans) must be exterminated to make the world better, what about the long history of similar problems in Europe? Are those being denied? Why go to lengths to make the film seem explicitly anti-American, if it isn't? Anyway, this ambiguity does make the film more interesting. At first I had the feeling that the Dogville was very heavy handed and obvious. But in the end it turns out to be complex and challenging. OK, maybe a bit heavy handed at times but heavy handed saying what? Go figure it out...</fullReview>

Routinely these days, I'll try to find a movie that is rumoured to be good, but about which I know nothing and go and watch it cold. I knew absolutely nothing about this movie other than a certain starry actress was in it (and she was definitely not my reason for seeing this, generally speaking, I find her mannerisms a tad annoying, and her acting a shade unorganic and plastic). Due to my fortunate lack of intelligence of what to expect, I had the pleasure of.. well find out for yourselves! One caveat, this is an intellectual movie, the Hollywood brat audience will be bored to tears as the movie is nearly 3 hours and demands a certain investment on the part of the viewer to accept an uneasy switch from certain movie conventions. The comments of people that disliked this movie seem to be rather lame, and scribed in the very style that Dogville might have a certain disagreement with :) If the movie is anti-this or anti-that, then so much the better! The gods save us if political correctness means all movies/art are supposed to be uncontroversial and "fair" as has happened to dreary Hollywood (Mind you, a very different, much more insidious propaganda is at work in the Hollywood products). Dogville is recommended! 9/10 for entertainment, 10/10 for that rare fizz: innovation. *Minor SPOILER* - the said protagonist actress's acting was the least convincing of the assembled thesps, though she was probably the most watchable, pleasant and charismatic creature most of the time. But another case of the star that spoiled the ointment? It's a very minor grumble, but she was the weakest link. I wish audiences and producers could resist stars. Anyway this is an exaltedly remarkable movie. Toodlepip! Eadon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes a movie is hard to watch. This is one of those times. You are slapped in the face with a reality that maybe we are not as civilized as we make out to be.Some say this film is anti-American. I disagree. It is anti-human. We tend to put ourselves up on a pedestal as being so much better than all the other animals, when, in reality, the base instincts that we have in common with the animals are just below that surface.Nicole Kidman was outstanding in this film. She showed just the right range of emotion. She was supported by a great cast that included Paul Bettany and Lauren Bacall, as well as Ben Gazzara, Philip Baker Hall, Patricia Clarkson, Chloë Sevigny, Harriet Andersson, Jeremy Davies, Zeljko Ivanek, Blair Brown and James Caan.The minimalist set allowed us to focus on the actors and we were rewarded with great performances that showed deep down we will act to serve ourselves when our psyches are threatened.This was my first Lars von Trier film.

		<shortDescription>Von Trier's bleak moral prognosis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit I'm a huge fan of Von Trier's previous works that I have seen (The Idiots, Dancer in the Dark, Breaking the Waves) and therefore have no real delusions of being non-partisan in critiquing his films. I believe that, despite how painful his films usually are to watch, his unwavering vision and stunning ability to transcribe it both visually and narratologically have created some of the most unforgiving yet ultimately enlightening films of the past few decades. That being said, Dogville stands right up there with past successes as being a haunting, fascinating study of charity, desire, and crowd psychology. Playing like a sadomasochistic version of Thornton Wilder's Our Town, Von Trier's script describes the plight of Grace, a young fugitive who comes to be harbored in the quiet town of Dogville, only to eventually become the scapegoat/whipping mule for each of the townsfolk's character flaws. Realizing that the script, with its archetypal proles and static setting, would suit more the stage than any real-life setting, Von Trier decided to film it as though Dogville were some audience-less sound stage (in the film's commentary, Von Trier mentions that they almost left the lighting rigs in the shot to extend that sense of self-aware fiction, a theme that first started throughout his early Dogme associations), with minimal props and theatrical lighting. Combined with Von Trier's patented shaky-steady cam and illustrious overhead shots (that took some 156 or so individual shots to make), Dogville has a look that is wholly its own. No Von Trier film would be complete without gut-wrenching acting, and Nicole Kidman and co. should be commended for tackling a notoriously abusive director and coming out alive, and with such evocative performances. Despite it's three hour running time, Dogville never feels languidly paced, and the theatrical style is not nearly as distracting as one might imagine. I read one review that called the film blatantly unAmerican, which I supposed it could be construed as such, but to distill the film's message into simple political rhetoric belittles the film's grandiose themes regarding human character and its flaws, intrinsic regardless of nationality. Still, see it for yourself and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Dog were one of us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just returned from "Dogville", one of the most mesmerizing and meaningful movies I have ever seen. Superlatives fail me. My friends also emerged from the film absolutely speechless and ready to view the film a second time to grasp its full brilliance.I have enjoyed von Trier's previous films, "Dancer in the Dark" and "Breaking the Waves". However, I realize that von Trier takes enormous risks and, in some critics' estimation, does not always succeed. You might say that he is the master of the brave failure.But not here. Von Trier revisits his usual themes of blindness, sexual violence and sacrifice, with even more insight and searing vision than ever before. Interestingly, although one of the characters in "Dogville" is sightless, he sees more than his fellow townspeople. His conversation, and the set itself, is suffused with light -- a fitting counterpoint to the darkness that reigns in the hearts and souls of the denizens of Dogville.The set is suggested, schematic, outlined in chalk like a giant game of hopscotch as it might be viewed from the heavens.It might be argued that "Dogville" is not cinema, that it is even anti-cinematic. Yet von Trier does far more than merely present us with a filmed play. Every once in a while, he surprises us with a cinematic technique that reminds us that we are indeed dealing with film and not just theatre."Dogville" is anti-cinematic in another and far more positive sense. It is a salutary antidote to the high-tech blockbusters that fill our eyes with flash and our ears with noise and our minds with brainless pap. It is a film that dares to allow scope for the imagination and food for the intellect -- to treat the viewer with respect, not condescension.The script is endlessly fascinating, and the stellar cast uniformly excellent. Well-known actors and actresses are so deglamorized as to be virtually unrecognizable, so that it is a shocking surprise when we finally realize who they are.The film is set in Depression-era rural America, but it transcends that specific time and place to become a microcosm for humanity as a whole.The final half-hour of "Dogville" kept me on the edge of my seat, trying to figure out the message of the film -- and, just when I thought I had got von Trier's drift, he did a U-turn and stood my interpretation on its head.But I think I can say, without overstating the case, that "Dogville" is a morality play -- more than that, a theological reflection, albeit of a very dark and pessimistic nature. It is no accident that Nicole Kidman's character is named Grace, for Dogville finds itself touched by grace, though it ultimately fails to be redeemed. And James Caan is quite simply inspired casting. If you remember that he was a key figure in the Godfather saga, then you realize that, in this film, he plays precisely that role -- Godfather, or rather, God the Father. Nicole Kidman thus becomes a Christ figure -- and yet even she, by the end of the film, becomes the instrument of a very unChrist-like divine wrath.The word "dog" in the title is the key to understanding the message of the film. Clearly, von Trier means us to read it backward. If the townspeople had "known the time of their visitation" (to use a very appropriate biblical turn of phrase), Dogville could have become what it was truly meant to be: Godville.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As well they should... What starts out as a Thornton Wilder-like paean to the beautiful nature of the simple American village and its good-willed inhabitants evolves into a lustily vengeful and welcome destruction of a person's fantasies about life. It's a 'coming of age' film unlike any ever made. And the overused word 'original' really belongs to the physical and poet construction of this allegorical tale. In some perverse way, it is a continuation of the theatre of American darkness that started with DEATH OF A SALESMAN. This last sentence you are now reading was put here to fulfill the 10 line requirement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Von Tier, but the way in which this film conducts itself is truly interesting. When i saw this film, many people left during the first hour due to boredom. I'm usually not drawn into movies that try really hard to set themselves apart and behave strangely. but the characters and the set up of this film make it unique and watchable.Mr. Von Tier has never been to America, which i think makes me able to appreciate this film more for what it's trying to do. It testament to the abstractness of our ideas about things about which we haven't the slightest clue. He's never been to America, so he doesn't have a clue. but yet, he has the right idea on some things, others he's way off. And he's just a little bitter and close minded like the townspeople of dogville. And maybe that's ok. The film and it's set-up are stunning, and each scene is directed with a purpose. He draws upon many techniques of theatre and Brechtian principles of drama. The end credits did leave a bad taste in my mouth, though.The actors really come into their own. IN each scene, i got a sense of their fear of screwing up or frustrations about conflicting with a difficult director. I find nicole kidman too frail, raspy voiced, and whispery. She's like this all of the time, and acting isn't really pretending to be week. but in this film, in the last hour, she's incredible. I'm a negative person and usually don't like movies and rip everything to shreds . . . but this is her best performance. By far. All the other actors are perfectly cast, and you can tell they fully embrace the set and the style of the film.The set really is Beautiful, and it reinforoces the story. Stunning all around, and worth seeing. Even though its message is highly debatable, it's form is something new and fresh, while building upon the old and refusing to be another gimmicky art movie. See this movie. It actually dared to try something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story of what happens when Nichole Kidman arrives in Dogville is either going to thrill you or strike you as one of the worst films of all time. There is no set to speak of, only lines on the ground so the film comes off as nothing more than a filmed stage play. And while John Hurt's narration adds a dimension of literary quality to the proceedings, proving this is probably a better movie to listen to then watch.The performances are uniformly excellent across the board and those wishing to see great acting should see this... ...but the movie goes on way too long and ends up being one of the most bleak films in recent memory. I'm not sure what the point of it all is and any ideas I did have got lost with the three hour running time.As I said you'll either love it or hate it - Me I'm in the five percent of people who'll be on the fence. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps you're old enough to remember when NBC aired Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" as a teleplay back in the late 70s, featuring Robbie Benson and Glynnis O'Connor as George and Emily, and Hal Holbrook as the stage manager. It was an excellent production that featured minimalist sets which helped focus attention on the story and its message. Think of "Dogville" is "Our Town's" dark, brooding, tragic twin, with elements of a very dark Walton's episode thrown in for good measure. The same use of stark set decoration proves absolutely riveting. This film is an intense experience from beginning to end, even though we all know what happens to us mortals when we refuse a visit from Grace, ala the Biblical story of Sodom.The acting is a thing of wonder. It turns out Nicole Kidman isn't really a movie star. She's an independent film siren, and this is not her only indie. I dare go no further for fear of spoiling the film. It usually runs in America on cable/satellite on IFC: Independent Film Channel, and is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville, A New Medium for Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given my theatre background, Dogville is extremely appealing to me. The Film completely changes the way Film medium is usually represented on the big screen. Not many filmmaker is willing to risk there creativity in other medium like live theatre.I think it was at the turn of the century, there were something called televised theatre, which is the broadcast of live theatre performances. As the development of many new media technology and the "impossibility of nothing", live theatre is dying.Seeing a film like Dogville for me, as a theatre goer, is quite exciting. Dogville doesn't belong to any film genre that's already existed, but the film itself is a new form of contemporary cinema. and I hope I can see more film work like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's clear to see why the American critics denied this film the credit it deserves.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogme initiator Von Trier has produced a film that manages to contrast visual flamboyancy with visual bleakness in combining impressive costume design and props without any 'actual' set. Grace (Kidman) embarks on small suburban town Dogville and although seemingly normal to the town's residents, the viewer is watching these people subsist in houses not too dissimilarly at all, to that of a Cluedo board in that their foundations are chalked out like corpses at crime scenes yet lacking the customary four walls. It looks theatrical, like a Peter Greenaway production with (dare I say) lower standards and on a tight budget. Though initially hard for the eyes to get used to, after watching the film for its three hour duration you'll think all towns look like this. As for the plot itself, it's pretty classic. This town is close, dependent solely on itself and strongly set in its self proclaimed flawless, traditional American standards. Naturally Grace is from somewhere else, somewhere that isn't Dogville and her job as an outsider is to integrate herself into this town; this family. Her 'helper' in all this is resident Tom (Bettany) who tries his damnedest to have his people accept her as one of them. To go any further would be truly spoiling as from here the script gets intrinsically clever making the viewer feel endearance in areas and ultimately discomfort and upset in others. At the heart of this film is the effect that instinctively follows a cause in social interaction. This is an illustration of the downfall of an American dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Lars Von Trier brings his slanted take of an America of the 30s as a metaphor of what is wrong with the country. He brings his own agenda to a place he has only known in his mind, because the fact remains he has never set foot in the country!The idea of setting the film in a sound stage seems original at first, but then it works against it. The limitations of the setting don't add much to what is happening, but that's Mr. Von Trier's own interpretation of how he wants to tell this morality play.The story of Grace, the destitute woman, who shows herself one day in Dogville, has a lot of interpretations and meanings. At first, she gains the trust of the citizens; they let her stay. The middle section is how Grace gives her best to the town, only to be punished and enslaved by the same people she tried to help before. This in turn, leads to the betrayal by Tom, the man who loved her, to sell her to the unknown gangster that turned out to be Grace's own father.This film could use some trimming. The acting is first rate. Nicole Kidman, as Grace, is at the top of her craft. She is brilliant in a role that is tailor made for her. Also good is Paul Bettany. His Tom goes a deep transformation. Chloe Sevigny plays Liz with conviction. It's very hard to single out anyone because the ensemble acting is first rate.At the end, while the credits are rolling, the director decides to show a slide picture presentation about a corrupt America for all of us to see as we leave the theater. Mr. Von Trier will not be filming in this country any time soon, but a trip to a Dogville, USA, is in order for him to put his perceptions in order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think my mum actually ever forgave father. It wasn't so much what he did. More the fact that she devoted 15 years of life to a someone she was not in love with. Altruism can certainly be character building. Yet do most people inwardly want something in return? Self-sacrifice for its own sake can be foreign to our western way of thinking.The wonderful Nicole Kidman is Grace, a very attractive young woman. She's also a beautiful fugitive, escaping from gangsters.Seeking refuge, Grace enters Dogville. It's a sad, 1930's hamlet in the Rocky Mountains. She will do odd jobs for the inhabitants in return for sanctuary. At first they refuse - very arrogantly - they don't need anything. But amateur philosopher and moderniser, Tom, intercedes. Soon, she is gratefully doing something for everyone. But are the townsfolk risking all by sheltering her? They soon become self-righteous, oppressive, and abusive, piously proclaiming that, "it is for her own good." And yet Grace harbours a terrible secret . . .The audience of Dogville is taken through increasingly nasty, almost unsolvable moral dilemmas. Forgiveness, justice, tolerance, and conceit. They all culminate in a traumatic and disturbing finale.This highly original movie is not an easy watch - and, be warned, it lasts for three hours. The first thirty minutes can seem tedious and affected. A few later scenes are exceedingly graphic and quite hard to watch. It will surprise you, it may distress you, and it may cause you to ask questions about yourself. It may even make you walk out in the middle (though hopefully you won't!) Dogville unravels those psychological mechanisms which expose people's real natures. And it doesn't necessarily offer answers.Grace, of course, is not only the name of the main character, but also a 'state of grace' that descends on this unsuspecting town. Heavy symbolism in almost everything is strengthened by unusual cinematography. It is shot on a bare sound stage with markings for walls, bushes and the dog. Such avant-garde theatrical style is unnerving at first, but after half an hour or so one just absorbs it. We become unaware of it, the way one does, say, with subtitles. Dogville, indicated almost entirely by chalk lines, soon feels real and solid. Whether it is justified relies on how much you buy into the mythology being ingeniously created and depicted (Though my opinion is that this is one of those rare cases where revolutionary technique has been completely and holistically justified). Minimalism, literary chapters and omnipresent narration (delivered by John Hurt), help us to focus on Dogville-as-parable rather than Dogville-as-thriller.As the plot thickens, we are forced to watch the emotional isolation and degradation of Grace, neighbours turning a blind eye. We are awkwardly conscious of ethical tensions: the self-justification of the townsfolk, Grace's uncomplaining nature, then ultimately (and perhaps uncomfortably) the implications of such dynamics in our own world.The film has a strong (though not explicit) comment on attitudes shaped by New Testament fundamentalism, of 'turning the other cheek,' versus Old Testament 'eye for an eye' philosophy. But the bigger puzzle is how valid these are, how far they can be taken. More overt comments are directed at foreign and domestic policy, and many people from the USA have taken offence at the thinly-veiled allusions to America.Dogville is gut-wrenching in a way that stays with us long after we stop watching. It is a film for serious filmgoers rather than those wanting easily-digestible entertainment. In its own way, Dogville is a monumental achievement, for its innovative techniques, its effectiveness and impact on its audience - not to mention its implications on the world we live in. One of the most mature and arresting works made by Danish Dogme founder Lars von Trier, many see it as a modern masterpiece (if also a readily misunderstood one).On the arguments that raged over it, von Trier said, "If there is a moral it is that good and evil exists in everybody and circumstances can bring it out." But to reach the states portrayed by the characters, he nudged them towards trauma so powerfully that they had a 'confessions' box on set and appeared visibly disturbed by what they had gone through.Political comment, satire, religious metaphor, an expose of psychological forces within each of us, a feminist diatribe, or pure cinematic art? Dogville is probably all of these. Or is it just pretentious twaddle? Critics and scholars worldwide have been divided and will continue to be divided on Dogville, but its place in cinema history seems assured, as does its place in the annals of Kidman's greatest works.My parents, by the way, both found their ideal partners in later marriages. My father left first and so mum claimed the moral high ground. But I think our early days of near-poverty were more character forming than any self-sacrifice. Poverty is often an absence of power. When you come out of it you've learnt the effect that other people's power on you has and, hopefully, used that to do better rather than beat up yourself or others with it. Survivors, for good or ill, rarely feel beholden. As Grace says, "Some things you have to do yourself."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic implausibility!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever such a thing existed, Dogville would be it. A mix of Dogma 95 film-making and filmed stage play on the technical side, Dogville should not work as it does. Dogma 95 is a pretentious minimalist movement supposed to extract cinematic purity from its subject. Filmed plays with no sets are a bore. Yet Lars Von Trier's technique has never been more appropriate.Dogville happens in a desperately poor and quiet township of feeble, simple, ordinary folk, among which philosopher Tom (Bettany), who wishes to elevate them beyond what they are. His ideal test would be a stranger to test their acceptance. His prayers are answered in the form of fugitive Grace. At first the darling infant like Grace (Kidman) is kindly accepted but as her hunters are more and more relentless in their efforts to seek her out, the town starts to demand more and more of her to "compensate" and, well, things get out of hand to put it lightly. This hardly sums up all the more subtle aspects (in fact this same synopsis is on the DVD's cover): Dogville - the very name being a metaphor for the film's great theme, how humans can range from God to Dog in such a small amount of time - has many things to say about small communities where no formal rules are established and reprises in a very efficient way all the themes of a story it resembles: Lord of the Flies. Dogville has no police, thus to draw the parallel with Lord of the Flies, no "adult supervision".The themes are universal and are treated in a very adult manner on many levels. The actors give stellar performances and Kidman is more a vehicle for the story than a true hero, though she serves it well. Kudos go to the many excellent supporting players: Bettany is fantastically nuanced and more than holds his own against the film's star, often overshadowing her. Otherwise, Skarsgard, Ivanek and Caan give memorable turns in a film littered with perfectly balanced and credible performances. The technical aspect serves the whole psychological aspect for, since their are no walls in Dogville, we see the houses in our mind, according to the level of moral corruption of the moment. First described by our narrator as miserable huts, during Grace's days of joy they become beautiful and warm. During the later moments of betrayal and suffering they become ugly and oppressive. Von Trier successfully invites us to fill the blanks in ourselves. This film also has its moments of visual beauty, unlike most of Von Trier's work: the elegant aerial mobile shots of the town make the town folk look like ants or pawns, digital fireflies floating through the air on the 4rth of July add a surprising touching poetry, A steady frame shot of Grace, lying among apples in the back of a truck, weeping... So many odd moments that come out as breathtaking because they form such a special mix of the unusual, appropriate and poetic.Again some will be put off at first and this is only natural. To some degree the whole experiment come can off as arrogant and overly pseudo-intellectual and those are flaws Von Trier definitely possesses as a director and as a person, yet intelligence and a bizarre kind of cinematic gift are qualities he certainly has as well. If one is to get anything out of Dogville, and their is a huge wealth to walk away with, one must be prepared to invest oneself. The first half hour might seem trying for newcomers, but once you've started playing along, the film engulfs you with a strength you would have never suspected...A cinematic implausibility. A testament to the moving image's power to awe and inspire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville (2003) **** (out of 4) The town of Dogville consists of a dozen or so hard working people that get an unexpected visit from a young woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman). Grace arrives late one night after the townspeople heard gunshots coming from the direction that she arrived. The town's spokesman, Tom (Paul Bettany) greets her when a car drives up. Inside the car are some gangsters asking Tom if he has seen the young woman but he answers no. The gangsters leave a card with a number so that they can be reached but when they drive off the town sets their eyes back to Grace.Tom thinks that the town should take Grace in and protect her from the gangsters but the rest of the members aren't so sure. Protecting Grace could get them killed and they really aren't getting anything in return so Tom decides to come up with a plan. Grace is to work for the town for two weeks and after that time the town can choose what to do with her.They can keep Grace as one of their own or they can send her on her way. After the two weeks Grace begins to grow on the town so they keep her on but it isn't long that the town's kindness turns to evilness and certain members start to abuse Grace. Soon, everyone in the town sees Grace as a target of some sort of abuse but there's one little secret that they don't know about the mysterious Grace.Dogville like the director's previous films will be one that people either love or hate.Throughout the three hour running time I really wasn't sure where I stood because like Grace trying to figure out the town and discover who these people our, I as a viewer was trying to figure out what was the point of the film only to see its truth near the end at the same time as Grace makes her final decision. This is a very complicated film and a film that requires a lot of thought and imagination from the viewer but in the end I couldn't help but feel that I had just seen something very special and unlike anything I had seen before.The first shot of the movie is one looking down on the town, which sets us up for what we're in for. The film takes place on a soundstage where there are no buildings, no trees, no mountains and pretty much nothing else. The town is marked off with chalk and everything from those trees to the mountains aren't really there and instead of viewing them we must use our imagination of how things are really supposed to look. At first this is a very distracting thing to get used to but I suppose the director did this for a purpose and that was to make us learn these people and this town the same way Grace does.As her character begins to settle in and see the town more clearly then the viewer starts to not notice that characters are walking through doors that aren't there and that the houses are simply marked off in chalk.The biggest thing the film has going for it is Nicole Kidman who once again proves she's the best actress out there. I wouldn't be hesitant to call this a very brave performance and I'm rather curious why anyone would want to do a film like this. Was it the idea of creating something new? I suppose that could be the case but either way it's quite remarkable watching Kidman as she slowly becomes torn down by the town and the people living there. Kidman shows a great deal of range throughout the film from a happy, loving friend to a woman beaten down. Kidman as well as the other actors go through the film in a trance and could easily be mistaken for zombies due to their quiet voices and slow actions. The supporting cast does a wonderful job setting Kidman up for everything she does but in the end this is the actor's showcase and Kidman is the star carrying this three-hour film.I'm sure the film will gather a lot of heat due to its portrait of Americans as being loathsome, hateful rapist but I really don't feel the director is doing any sort of anti-American bashing. I really don't think it matters that this film takes place in America because if you think about it nothing in the film is real. Must like A Clockwork Orange, this film takes place in no real time and you could say it doesn't take place in any certain country, state or even a matter of space. The director does a remarkable job making his own world and in his world people are ugly creatures will to hurt others just to make themselves feel better. The look and the feel of this film isn't bashing America today because the film could have taken place a million years ago or a million years from now. Dogville is an ugly and depressing film but it's a film unlike any I've seen and it's a film that has guts, which isn't too common today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers A long time ago, I watched a movie called Pollyanna which, incidentally, starred Hayley Mills, the brightest child-star at the time. The story is about how Pollyanna, a little orphan girl, coming to live in an embittered town and changing everybody's life, touching even the heart of the hardest cynic portrayed by Agnes Moorhead. Had Dogville ended in it's 'chapter three' (out of a total of nine chapters), when the 15 tolls of the bell announces the acceptance of Grace (Nicole Kidman) by the town's unanimous vote, it would have been another version of Pollyanna, a feel-good movie, albeit at a more mature level. Dogville, however, goes on to be a feel-bad movie. The weakness of human nature is exposed through the remaining six chapters, through demonstrating how when opportunities present themselves, people start exploiting the vulnerable. While some find the ending devastating, I can see it coming all along, and consider it almost inevitable. Even the twist is so very predictable. In the end, an often-asked moral question is thrown right at the audience, as Grace confronts the challenge that she is in fact the most arrogant of them all: when (if at all) will virtual go too far to become self-righteousness. At the end of the day, Dogville ends in revenge disguised as poetic justice, as if to make us feel just a little better.Kidman's performance here is obviously at a level higher than what she has been allowed to attain in Cold Mountain. One interesting observation is that in both, she is supported by a most fantastic cast (in addition to the co-leads). In Cold Mountain, there are Philip Seymore Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Natalie Portman, Brendan Gleeson, Donald Sutherland and Cathy Baker (as detailed in my comments thereon). In Dogville, we first have Lauren Bacall (Ma Ginger), a veteran among veterans, whom I remember most vividly as the powerful mastermind in Murder on the Orient Express. James Caan (the Big Man) is again doing what he does best (at least to the general audience's perception). Patricia Clarkson (Vera) does not have a particularly challenging role, one she handles with ease. She is the wonderful actress who had an Oscar nomination in Pieces of April and, in my view, should have won over Renee Zellweger (Cold Mountain). Ben Gazarra (Jack McKay) , another veteran, should be well remembered in the TV mini-series QB VII, where he acted opposite to Anthony Hopkins, who at that time didn't quite have the status he has today. Stellan Skarsgard (Chuck), the powerful actor from Sweden, has been very productive lately, with Troy, King Arthur and Exorcist: The Beginning. Last but not least, is the voice John Hurt, so unforgettable from The Elephant Man, always active, appearing recently is two worthy movies, one good (Miranda), one excellent (Owning Mahowny).Elm Street is the name of the main street in Dogville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak, experimental masterwork, about morality &amp; retribution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with his previous film, the austere musical-fable Dancer in the Dark, Dogville looks at the workings of an American society through the eyes of a na?ve, trusting and somewhat martyr-like outsider. From this rough thematic assessment - coupled with the use of John Hurt's sombre, storybook-style narration, and the exploitative humiliation central to the plot - many have chosen to view Dogville as a political allegory, which looks specifically at the unfair manipulation, abuse, betrayal and degradation heaped upon the outsider by the American people, who are here portrayed as highly intellectual, multi-dimensional characters, stricken and simplified by the feelings of fear, paranoia, hatred and xenophobia. However, although this social interpretation is partly true, the nature of the film, not least, the overall message, is more in tune with the issues of personal betrayal, human morality (or, in some instances, immorality) and personal retribution, which gives the film a more universal aspect that goes beyond the rather offensive and simplistic idea of European, anti-American propaganda.The central ideology behind the story - that being, the corruption of the human spirit and man's capacity for evil in the face of greed and retribution - coupled with von Trier's stark visual design, hints that the story could really take place in any small town in any country of the world; which, to an extent, is completely true. Although the iconography of Dogville (the golden sunlight, the "implied" mountainous landscapes, the stars and stripes, the Model-T Fords, the Thompson machine-guns, Elm Street - the site of the Kennedy assassination - and that closing photo-montage of U.S. devastation) would suggest that von Trier is attempting to create a vision of bleak Americana, his approach to the film (an international cast, no real sets, no exterior filming, etc) instead demonstrates that he is also interested in creating a kind of anonymity; shrouding Dogville in a cloak of obscure theatricality, to not only simplify the process of film-making (to get to the root of the drama and the truth of the performance, as he had done with Breaking the Waves and the Idiots), but to also simplify the underlining sub-text of the plot.The visual aesthetic of the films sees much of the action take place on a blackened sound-stage, with all the shops, houses and street names represented in chalk outlines etched onto the floor. Alongside this, von Trier uses a dense and layered soundtrack to fill in for the lack of sets, whilst also using lighting effects and digital trickery to help further create the world of the film and the mindset of it's central character. It's an audacious move, taking influences from the work of Brecht and the Derek Jarman film Wittgenstein, whilst the use of hand-held digital photography (processed into cinema-scope), pieced together with jarring jump cuts and temporal shifts in emotion and location, goes back to the previous von Trier films, all of which could be seen as something of a stepping stone to this. For me, the most impressive thing about the film's design was von Trier's idea to have every member of the cast on stage at all times, which gives the film a much darker feeling of conspiratorial foreboding, as we witness the abuse, degradation and numerous physical assaults against our protagonist Grace alongside the townsfolk, who, despairingly enough, turn their backs as if nothing has happened. Unlike the townsfolk of Dogville however, we, as an audience, are forced to watch as the film spirals towards the same kind of bleak melodrama present in von Trier's last three films (and also his earlier TV film, Medea), as the director keeps his probing hand-held cameras right up close to the action, to document the town's downfall in all it's agonising, unflinching, naturalistic despair.As a result of this, Dogville can be a particularly difficult film to watch, falling into the same category as films like Cries &amp; Whispers, A Short Film About Killing, Dead Man's Shoes and von Trier's own Dancer in the Dark, by continually hitting us with scene after scene of utter emotional despair, that can only ever lead to the bleakest of bleak, emotionally devastating dénouements. However, despite this, there is certainly a great deal in the film that is worth experiencing, not least, the overwhelming final act... in which von Trier subverts the entire meaning of the film with one of the most shocking and thought-provoking explosions of real aggression that we've ever seen (whilst also proving himself - once again - to be one of the most talented and provocative world filmmakers currently at work). It's certainly not a film that you could call entertaining, with the film leaving you with a number of upsetting thoughts and questions that will linger for many days after your initial viewing, with von Trier succeeding in the creation of the bleakest, most confrontational portrayal of humanity ever before seen.Naturally, from this, the film will appeal to viewers looking for a powerful cinematic experience; though, personally, I think it's one of those films that should be experienced by as many people as possible. The overall performance from that great ensemble cast (featuring, amongst others, Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, Lauren Bacall, James Cann, Ben Gazzara and Stellan Skarsg?rd) is absolutely impeccable... as is the production design, sound design, editing and cinematography throughout. The extras on this DVD edition are perhaps a little slim, although the transfer of both the picture (which thankfully is presented in the integral cinematic aspect ratio of 2.35:1 anamorphic... despite what the DVD sleeve states) and the sound are close to perfect. At present, I'm not entirely sure if Dogville has beaten Europa and Breaking the Waves to the title of "the best von Trier film ever made", although it's certainly close... and represents one of the cinematic highlights of the decade so far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An innovative and boring movie with a nihilistic message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is a plodding and pretentious allegory with a clear nihilistic message which can also be discerned in "Dancer in the Dark" (the other film I've seen by Lars von Trier). I had been uncertain about the underlying message of "Dancer in the Dark," since it was obscured by pseudo-realism, song-and-dance numbers, and gut-wrenching melodrama. Dogville lacks such elements that might pass for entertainment. Although I appreciated the play-like presentation, I found Trier's use of jump-cuts to be inappropriate and distracting. Lars hints that humans are capable of love and altruism, but he apparently believes we are more prone to self-serving and amoral behavior (like dogs), if not worse. Moreover, it seems Lars believes that democracy and (especially) capitalism bring out the worst qualities of humans; people become commodities, and relationships are inevitably governed by the principles of commerce and power. The primary underlying message appears to be that America is a country of victims and victimizers. Any doubt I had about whether Lars was specifically condemning America was put to rest by the ending credits of Dogville, in which he essentially gives America the middle finger. "Dancer in the Dark" delivers its anti-American propaganda in an entertaining and powerfully disturbing package. Dogville is powerfully boring!Michael J. Sykes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Have Not Seen A Movie This Unique In Quite Awhile, and Grace Is Far Better A Person Than I.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not expect anything of this magnitude when I first saw Dogville. "Powerful" and "brilliant" are two words that are thrown around far too much in the movie business, but they truly do apply here. I would say it was beautiful as well, and while it did have some beautifully rendered scenes, there was a whole lot of ugliness in the film to really be described in this way.Dogville is different than any movie I have ever seen. The whole town is nothing more than a few props placed on what seems to be a giant chalkboard on the ground with chalk outlines of the houses and other significant areas of the town. It takes place in the Rocky Mountains probably around the 1930's I would guess, however, you will not see anything scenic except for one lone bush (I'm not sure if that has any meaning or not, I'm sure there is all kinds of hidden messages here). I enjoyed this premise at first, then got slightly annoyed by it but at the end, I hardly noticed. Being able to see in and out of buildings as regular townsfolk get on with their lives was kind of nice background and in certain scenes, thought provoking. Who really knows what is going on behind the locked door right next to you? This alone makes the film very unique but it delivers more within the story, itself.The story begins as Grace Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) is fleeing from something and is pretty frightened. She is caught coming through Dogville by Thomas Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany) and convinces Grace to stay in town after jumping through a few hoops with the people of the town (15 people comprise this small town). At first, Grace makes an effort to befriend the townspeople and gain their trust, and succeeds. After a bit of time, because of things that happen through no fault of her own, the town begins to turn on her. They realize that her choices are to be caught by the police, the gangsters after her or to remain in Dogville (I'm really paraphrasing here for the sake of space). Upon figuring that out, they turn very nasty towards her, in almost every way imaginable and the one person she trusts, Tom Edison, seems unable to help. As anyone watching will no doubt figure out, there is going to be a twist and it turns out to be a nice one.I thought the movie was great, as mentioned above, but I do not think it was necessary to fill 3 hours and I thought the end could have been a little more... well, just more. They could have had some real fun there. Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany turn in excellent performances and director Lars von Trier deserves some kudos as well. Good job by all! 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>extremely experimental</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's Depression era Dogville which lies at the end of the road to an abandoned silver mine in the Rocky Mountains. Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) hears a gun shot and then finds Grace (Nicole Kidman) on the run from some gangsters. Tom hides her in the mines and then tries to convince the town to protect her. Most are skeptical and Grace does chores for the people. They eventually accept her into their town but the ugliness eventually grows.This is a highly experimental theatrical experience. The set is more like a play. The buildings have no walls and things are often represented by written labels on the ground. It sets the movie feeling fake. I also don't like the constant narration. This is something deliberate which detracts from the enjoyment. It accentuates the fakeness of this morality play. It's also way too long. The good aspect is Kidman and the other great actors. In addition, the movie has a point and it makes it with surety. This is an unique film and not an enjoyable one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nihilistic film about the ever-present potential for evil in all humans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have never heard of Dogville (2003) you are not alone. Three hours is a lot to invest in what some call a blatantly anti-American diatribe in an experimental hybrid of theatre and film. But this avant-garde masterpiece should be seen, at least in part, by anyone who is serious about modern cinema. Danish director Lars von Trier has located the tiny hamlet of Dogville in America for many reasons but this allegorical meditation on the nature of evil and justice is as universal as the human condition, and is far more about a state of mind than a place.If you have not seen it, some facts will prepare you for what is a unique experience. Dogville is set on a minimalist stage with chalk lines for roads and rooms, no doors, a few props to separate inside from outside in this closed, struggling claustrophobic Depression-era community that is suspicious of all strangers. Originally written in Danish by von Trier, the translation to English picks up a lyrical formalism which is precise and slightly stilted that allows more time to reflect upon the dialogue. The amorphous production setting intensifies the impact of acting, and the camera-work moves around quickly from close-ups to panoptic 'eye-of-God' viewpoints to flat long-view pans, all dynamically lit to create the illusion that this is a real town.While the plot line is uncomplicated, the story is multi-layered and its interpretation challenging. The hamlet provides shelter for beautiful fugitive Grace who is so grateful she offers to work in return. The town progressively learns she is wanted by both 'the mob' and police so they increase her work hours to "compensate" for harbouring her. They demand more and more compensation with each revelation, increasing her work to hard labour from sunrise to sunset. Soon she is shackled by a leg-iron contraption, endures physical and sexual abuse in public. What appeared to be a benign hamlet becomes a hub of pure evil while the innocent and once-forgiving Grace learns about moral relativity and human failure.This extraordinary film pivots equally on the genius of von Trier and tour de force acting by Nicole Kidman. While a long film, it continuously builds tension towards an unpredictable and chaotic climax, with the various elements woven into a single narrative fabric by the expressive gravitas and ironic humour of narrator John Hurt. But there is little to laugh at in this nihilistic film about the ever-present potential for evil in all humans. It begs the question why we do not see more experimental films like this? The question answers itself: they are too risky. This film is not for everyone, but it is mesmerising, intellectually challenging, and so worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good story, bad ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty obvious that Grace's name represents something more than just a random name. In whole of the film her behavior, actions, reactions are not something that would be considered as "normal" human behavior in such circumstances. She truly was the personified ideal, everything good that we all promote and imagine to accomplish in ourselves and in society. Her "arrogance" as her father defined it, is exactly it if viewed from humans' flawed perspective. But it is not arrogance! It is an ideal, and by calling it - no, by choosing to call it arrogance - we try to excuse our dishonorable behavior. That's why the ending is not logical nor justified. With choosing to step down on humans' level, get her revenge and condemn the people of Dogville to death, Grace actually negated herself and everything she was the whole time. Now, I would go even further and say, her gangster-family background is not relevant. It is shown throughout the story with her actions, and with her own saying "I've never stolen anything before. So now, now I have to punish myself. I was raised to be arrogant. So, I...I had to teach myself these things." It is clear here that no matter where she comes from, she is her own person, creates herself, is responsible to self only. There is one other sentence: "If she had acted like them she could not have defended a single one of her actions and could not have condemned them harshly enough". But it is only at the ending that Grace finds herself for the first time, at position of power - and she chooses to behave just like the flawed ones. By judging them to their own standards she actually goes against her own nature. If the acting is right (and I don't doubt that) she watches the executions and cries, but as there is horror there is also some satisfaction in her - seems like a transformation of personality is taking place. This is interesting also from the gnosticism's point of view. If Grace is grace (Sophia), would the ending symbolize a gnostic phenomenon of "Sophia's fall from grace"?Should they all be punished? Yes, definitely. By their own standards? Of course. But is it up to her to get down on their level as soon as she got the power and do the executioner work? In the ending, what becomes of Grace? And what is done to grace? Was there ever any, or is it the same as the writer who never wrote any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Difficult But Rewarding Experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Called anti-American by some critics and tiresome in its simplicity by others, "Dogville" is not anti-American nor is it tiresome: it is, instead, a deceivingly bare-bones, bizarro masterstroke of a satirical small town America. Not echoing the satanic elements of "Twin Peaks" or the ugliness-under-the-beauty breadth of "In the Heat of the Night"'s Sparta, "Dogville" would rather take on the old trait that the human race is inherently cruel and violent, despite an initially hospitable facsimile.Von Trier, the most controversial director of the 2000s (sorry Tom Six), doesn't make such a bold claim with outright magnification; he takes nearly three hours to build upon the suggestion, mounting and mounting until the thought becomes dreadfully exaggerated. And, in a polarizing method of story amplification, sets are not sets but chalky squares on a sound stage, given identity through minimalist props and map-like text designating the area (the main road is stamped "Elm St.). For most, "Dogville"'s austere texture will be off-putting. Its complete lack of a structural "setting" and its epic running-time are attributes easier to leave than to take.I, perhaps in the minority, don't just appreciate von Trier's daring filmmaking approach here; I applaud it. It works. It's thrilling. "Dogville" dawdles at times, and it is especially difficult to avoid clock-watching after the second hour, but impressive is the way that von Trier manages to pull off a film so stylistically eyebrow raising. We are only distracted by its design for the first few minutes; the screenplay, so strong in its ideas and dialogue, gives the environment a three-dimensional shape. Thought-provoking and thoroughly one-of-a-kind, this is a film you won't be forgetting any time soon.Set during The Great Depression, "Dogville" follows Grace (Nicole Kidman), a woman on the run from gangsters. Fleeing the law, she stumbles upon Dogville, a miniature Rocky Mountain town with a population so small it is nearly familial. Tight-knit and untrusting of outsiders, the citizens are unsure of whether to accept Grace into their community. It is eventually decided, through Tom (Paul Bettany), the self-appointed spokesman of the public, that Grace can stay as long as she makes herself useful, acting as a maid for anyone who asks. People are reluctant, but before long, she becomes a welcome addition to the normally close-minded Dogville.While most films would end happily, with Grace starting a new chapter in her life, "Dogville" continues on and descends into more malevolent territory. As one too many secrets come to light and more and more citizens begin to harbor hateful feelings toward Grace, it doesn't take long for the once pleasant town to transform into a poisonous brewing of malice. It took me three days to finish "Dogville", pacing myself at an hour every night -- not a response of boredom, but a response hoping to savor. With nine chapters and a prologue, the film is decidedly a magnum opus of ideas, most of them penetrative if you take the time to really think about what you're watching. By spacing viewing out as far as possible, I was then able to digest the film -- helpful considering its size -- and in return, I found myself riveted. Not riveted in the same way I was when watching Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton play verbal cat-and- house in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?": riveted by the performances, von Trier's unfolding of his conceptual idiosyncrasies."Dogville"'s plunge into perniciousness does not come swiftly; it climbs slowly, arriving almost inevitably. "Evil can arise anywhere," von Trier stated about the film upon release. "As long as the situation is right." With a relationship built on enigma and dead end, the town's disdain for Grace comes as no surprise, but the way they make it known is terrifying, affecting us enormously. Humans may be inherently cruel and violent, but von Trier's delivery of the sentiment is hardly contrived. If most were to philander around a hellhole like Dogville long enough, how long would it be before they spoke their minds instead of hiding their feelings for the sake of manners? How long would it be before confrontations became a norm? The shocking conclusion places morality itself in question. Heaven may be a place on earth if you find the right person, but if your life is sinful, crime-riddled, lonesome, does politeness, unfiltered kindness, matter?A film like "Dogville" requires performers unafraid of ambitious material, and the cast, large and monumental, transcends limitations. Kidman is fearless, by turns sympathetic and maddening, and her co-stars, particularly Bacall, Clarkson, and Bettany, startle us in their ability to convincingly walk around wearing two faces and really mean it when they rip off their inviting one."Dogville" is an extremely difficult film. It requires a viewer that regards patience as a virtue. But with its cerebral ideas and deceptively condensed setting, it offers filmmaking thrilling in its unwillingness to conform. Von Trier doesn't fear his audience and he doesn't fear his innermost beliefs. Call him controversial, call him xenophobic; he goes where other directors wouldn't dare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought it was original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The calm before the storm is how I describe the first hour of Dogville. It's a steady build of unease and worry. At first it had me wondering why it was rated R, but not for long. A creeping dread overtakes you and won't let up until the intense final act.The first thing that needs to be mentioned when talking about this film is the play style format. At first I was very confused. The set is just a big stage with chalk lines on it. There are no locations. It's a small city condensed to an even smaller size. For the first hour it can be very distracting. The characters open invisible doors and talk about nonexistent objects. There are only props and partial pieces of things to give the audience something to imagine. The directorial style instantly made me think I was sitting an auditorium watching from the crowd. I had honestly never seen a movie like it. I over all had mixed feeling towards everything. On one hand I'm amazed by the overhead shots of the whole town. I can see everything everyone is doing all at the time, and it looks so good. On the other hand I'm kind of scoffing at how ridiculous some of the other things look. Someone got mad at someone else for not walking around a chalk drawing of a bush, and sound effects coming from nothing are just some of the weird things that happen. I think that once you get used to the style it can add something to the movie. For example, I like how you can see almost everything that is going on in the town at once. You can see people talking amongst themselves in their own homes as other characters talk outside. I think the viewer gets more information about the emotions and mood of the town this way. Without it, it would be a different movie. Would it have been better shot in a more traditional style? Possibly, but I think this style is something unique that no other movie has. I wouldn't want to watch this style all the time, but I think in this film it was a success.Part of the reason the stage play aspect works is because the acting is so good. I may not have believed they were in a town the whole time, but the characters did. Nicole Kidman gave the best performance from her I've seen. It was subtle and quiet. I was cheering for her character even in her most morally ambiguous moments. The supporting actors all did stellar work as well. They all were completely believable in their creepy small town ways. Even the child actors sent a chill down my spine! Over all I liked the movie. It was often hard for me to enjoy what was happening. I would say if you watch movies for the technical aspects, you care about acting, and you watch for filmmaking techniques you will love it. If you only watch to have some fun or to have a good time you will be somewhat confused and probably not like it. All in all I thought it was a good original movie and I'm glad I watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provokes a reaction one way or the other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film begins showing a damsel in distress fleeing her pursuers by escaping to an isolated town in the mountains of Colorado. The isolated residents of Dogville are initially wary of the stranger but eventually accept her in as she ingratiates herself by helping around the town. This "helping" grows in intensity to the point of slavery as the town becomes increasingly dependent on her and she is scared to leave fearing what brought her to Dogville in the first place. Ultimately the situation is resolved. As for the film itself, one would have to believe that the director made this movie in order to cause a reaction. It's almost as if he is saying, "I don't care if you love it or hate it, I just want you to feel something". It this vein, I believe he accomplished his goal. There are aspects of this film that I loved and hated, sometimes simultaneously. For one, the movie is a full three hours long. That's a big commitment for one sitting. Secondly, the dialogue is choppy and sometimes confusing. It's as though it was written first in Danish and then translated into English. Sometimes this works, sometimes it falls flat. The acting is superb and I especially enjoyed Nicole Kidman's performance. Overall, the payoff in the end was worth it but be prepared for a long journey.</fullReview>

Once again (especially, after starring in "Birth"), Nicole Kidman proved to be a very talented actress.But the plot does not give her credit:in the end, when she claims she has forgiven those poor Dogville citizens, she - all of a sudden - approves of the annihilation of the place and its inhabitants.It seems a little illogical and not in the heroine's character.This film is a good mirror to watch ourselves critically.</fullReview>

Unless there is something I missed then I'm curious as to what it is that Grace has done, or what it is that we can be lead to assume? We find out her relation the Boss, but I don't see exactly what it is that she is running from, at least in terms of her own culpability. I would contend that she is guilty of the arrogance that her dad avows is her weakness (ironically, it is the same arrogance that offends him as she accuses him of the same possession). Someone please expound on this. I also have not done the research to figure out a further importance of Thomas Edison Jr. Besides a particular similarity to Alva Edison in terms of "arrogance", I wonder if Edison Jr.'s character was created for a greater, almost literary function.</fullReview>

A political analysis of the film would have bad results for its lack of objective thoughtfulness, BUT, like a fairytale or a (good) horrorfilm (if that word exists in English :)), Dogville is able to create powerful and very childish (which is positive!) emotions, provided you stop thinking rational and just imaginize the story with full intent. That ability do not many filmmakers have - so it must be an eight - but for the likes of Julius Caesar with Marlon Brando as Mark Antony, it cannot be nine or ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is more to Dogville than meets the eye.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film, Dogville, contains more than what the basic plot reveals. While it is true that a beautiful young woman named Grace comes to town fleeing danger, and the town unwillingly accepts her, it is also true that she is not simply Grace the woman, and the town is not simply "any" American town. Viewing the film on face value can work, but it doesn't reveal the film writer's intent. If one "views between the scenes," it is obvious that Dogville is an allegory which uses Grace to possibly symbolize God, or perhaps all that is good in the world. Grace enters Dogville seeking refuge and is given it. But when the townspeople turn on her, they will ultimately face her wrath. Grace is good in everything that she does, and she tries so hard to do what is asked of her. Even when she is abused, mistreated, and used, she accepts her punishment and abuse and continues to struggle on. While that may not seem realistic from a simplistic vantage, it is what happens when people struggle to survive. We adapt, give in, try to please, do what is necessary to survive. When given the chance, we would try to escape, when given the opportunity to elicit revenge, we would destroy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Challenges the boundaries of what we can expect from films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman stars in this extraordinary film as Grace, a woman on the run from mobsters, who is taken in by the residents of a small and isolated town called Dogville. Gradually the townsfolk turn against her, and blackmail her into accepting increasing levels of abuse, but there's a twist in the tale.The film's most startling feature is the fact that all the action takes place on a set, representing the town, with no buildings and no scenery. When viewed from above, the town has the appearance of a giant Cluedo board. This has the effect of making the town seem far smaller than it normally would.This is far more than just a stylistic flourish. As the audience is able to see through walls, they can view everything that goes on in the town, provided of course that the camera is pointing in the right direction. This emphasises the elusiveness of privacy in a small community where everyone knows everyone else's secrets.While the townspeople act as if the walls are solid, in fact they are only too aware of what goes on behind closed doors, but won't act to disturb the superficial calm. This makes a negative suggestion about human nature; that given the chance human beings will exploit vulnerable people rather than protecting them.Because there is no scenery to serve as a distraction, the viewer's attention is solely focused on the performances, which are uniformly superb. Kidman demonstrates that despite her star status she is not averse to taking risks, and Paul Bettany is excellent as the man who tries to defend her against the rest of the townsfolk.Dogville challenges the boundaries of what we can expect from films, and does so with considerable success. The only downside is the end credits, which unnecessarily court controversy, and spoil an otherwise subtle film, which deserved better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman in a Lars Von Trier drama set on a theater stage, this certainly seems interesting. And the movie is; very interesting and fascinating, though very peculiar and odd.Nicole Kidman is Grace, a woman bewildered up in a Colorado mountain town named Dogville. Containing very few citizens, the locals is very skeptical to Grace except Tom Edison, a sort of spokesman to the town. Nobody knowing about her past, it's certain that Grace is on the run from something or someone.. To get to stay there as a hide, she agrees to do work for them.DOGVILLE is exceptionally original. Set in a dark stage, where the houses are simply marks on the ground with titles on the floor, as; bathroom, kitchen and even dog! Seeing such a star as Kidman in such a low budget movie is also odd, and makes the whole setting very fascinating. And the whole idea is extremely well; being a viewer you can simply see through all of the walls through off course the town visitors are acting like there were actual houses there, so you get the feeling and you do, see everything that's happening behind closed doors.Paul Bettany, the growing star, also does a very fine performance and altogether with the town citizens, they make brilliant cast that all convinces and all have such deep water. DOGVILLE stands clearly out, not being as any other movie you have probably seen for a while. A mixture between a theater cinematic and some sort of gangster-drama, it works like nothing I've ever seen before in it's own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Most Unique and Exceptional Stage Play on Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is really much more of a stage play than what one would normally think of as a film. I simply couldn't imagine it having as much impact if it were a traditional movie. That being said it is very difficult to objectively review this film or stage play. Obviously the script, acting, and direction were excellent. But that falls short of any type of review.The storyline is what makes this work somewhat unique. It is something of a black philosophical look at human nature. And what makes it rather exceptional is the historical reality of the Great Depression era it so carefully depicts. It asked some tough questions of human nature in difficult times, and it does so eloquently with purpose and strength. Even though this is the equivalent of a nine-act stage play it does not drift or drag. It stays on point building up to a climax that the viewer does or does not necessarily expect.I simply liked this for all of the obvious reasons that anyone would enjoy a fine work of art, but I found exceptionally unique in its sense of purpose while being entertaining. In my opinion this is an exceptional and unique stage play produced on film. It's certainly worth the nearly three hours it takes to view it.</fullReview>

But as the movie goes on, as grace is subjected to more and more humiliation, it just makes you cringe and want to get away from it. But then, I could never leave a movie in between, ( I actually sat through all of little nicky, yet another teen movie etc)and surely not this one. By the end you get to hate the people of dogville so much, and the climax is the only possible thing that could have made a person survive this.

		<shortDescription>An interesting exercise or should I say "illustration"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By making a fool of the character "Tom" in his film of "Dogville", Lars Von Triers also can't help but make a fool of himself with this exercise. By taking the same distanced approach to his study on human cruelty, the director ends up effectively holding a mirror to the artist rather than at society.His story is forced and artificial by any stretch even before the cinematic trickery of the huge sound stage taking the place of realistic locations. The tiny number of people in a cramped setting (to call it a town would be generous) Film is a medium of movement (as Kurosawa proved to great effect) and on this test Von Triers fails miserably.It's almost as if he was too lazy to craft a real film out of the bare bones of a story. My opinion is that if one wants to set out to capture the drama of the theater, one should write and direct a play.This is not to say that the actors don't do a terrific job in their respective roles. Kidman is amazing and proves how formidable an actress she is once again. Also excellent is Stellan Skarsgard as a gruff farmer.In many ways, watching these great performances without location shooting or even realistic sets made this film seem like a rehearsal instead of a finished product. Lars needs to quit trying to be so clever and start making films instead of pretentious nonsense. I am a huge fan and expected more. This is yet another case proving that film festival awards mean nothing.The dim view of human nature is certainly a pessimistic and narrow view with which to view our fellow man. It doesn't surprise me that someone with such a low opinion of his audience would fail to provide them with a finished product. As usual, I realize there will be countless "film nerds" out there just chomping at the proverbial bit to lavish praise on this film because it is, well, pretentious. How do I know? I used to BE ONE. These "film nerds" make themselves feel better about their lack of lives by enjoying films that the average audience disdains or ignores completely. Their argument is that because it is "different" it is somehow good. A feeble argument at best and certainly no reason to watch a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't get it out of my head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew not what to expect, and only knew that Kidman was in it. It even sounded a bit boring, but I was bored so I got it on video. Wow! I loved the idea of the set, and I recognised some other actors so I settled down to watch. Initially I thought Grace was dangerous and was going to hurt the people of Dogville. I actually felt protective over them at first. But when nothing happened, and she just wanted to fit in, I hoped they would just keep her. The acting was good, the story OK, and I was thinking of giving it a 7 just for style. Then I crossed the halfway mark.There were moments when I wanted to switch it off in disgust, but something kept me watching until the end. And I'm glad I did because this movie has one of the best endings I've ever seen. It's not an 'Others' or 'Sixth Sense' kind of ending that surprises you and gives you a fleeting moment of gratification. Rather, it's a slower satisfaction with deep roots in that conflict between a righteous yet immoral retribution.This is not a movie I will ever watch again. It's too disturbing, like Once Were Warriors, or Passion. But its brilliance cannot be denied. I can't get it out of my head.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story well told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't read up on this film before I rented it. I am really glad that I didn't now; I think if I had, I would not have rented it at all.Initially I was disappointed by the stark setting of the stage/studio but after about 5 minutes I started to adjust; a little like learning to breath under water (although I still haven't mastered that trick yet).Some of the reviewers on IMDb complain that Dogville portrays Americans in a bad light. Personally, I think that Dogville is simply a study in human nature - all be it a little on the dark side. It appears to be a human trait to take advantage when in a position of relative power; that is one way in which the strong survive and prosper and I think the director was attempting (quite successfully) to demonstrate this. I found that I was forced to use my imagination - similar to when reading a novel. After all, the imagination is far more powerful a tool than any Hollywood CGI effects, smoke and mirrors.Dogville is a master class in story telling. This film could possibly have been made with a huge budget and expensive sets but would have been a poorer film for it.More power to talented and innovative directors I say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a town without pity can do.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No one taps into pain the way Lars von Trier does. Whether showing the perverse needs of a quadriplegic husband or giving us Bjork's piercing shriek as she's forced to commit a murder, von Trier is somewhat of a film sadist, creating astonishing works that dare to be watched twice. No one else blends these moral fables into bendy genre pieces like him either. He's encompassed the Dogme 95 movement, tackled the musical form and in Dogville, his most daring, experimental piece, he creates a world on the open stage.Dogville is introduced in map form on a stage floor. It's an insolvent, Depression-era town where bold white lettering identifies the different homes and landmarks. John Hurt openly narrates and introduces us to the typical small town folk. The scenery is sparse, a shrub here, a roof there, a bell tower. Nothing is hidden in von Trier's intimate, see-through town. At least until Grace (Nicole Kidman) runs through the town one night, carrying a gun and trying to make her way through the mountains. She's on the run from gangsters and possibly the law. Tom (Paul Bettany), a writer who fancies himself Dogville's moral compass persuades the town to let her stay for a two week trial in exchange for manual labor. It's amazing that Dogville works with this strategy of minimalism. The film separates itself from its theatrical roots with some stunning overhead shots and smart, effective lighting from Anthony Dod Mantle, a DP to watch for.Nicole Kidman infuses Grace with such earnestness and compassion that only the town's crabbiest resident Chuck (Stellan Skarsgard) remains unimpressed. Skarsgard gives Chuck palpable self-loathing and a hatred for Dogville that is evident in every poison-tipped word. The rest of the town seems to enjoy Grace and learns to benefit from her honesty and her unconditional acceptance of them, despite their flaws. That is until 'Wanted' signs get posted in their town and the threat of the law entering Dogville becomes real. From here, we're escorted right back into von Trier's standard chess board of cruelty as Grace walks the tightrope between two evils, the men she's hiding from and a town without pity. Forced to work long hours for little or no pay, Grace soon finds herself struggling against the advances of all the townsmen, much to the dismay of the jealous women. Weeks turn into months and during this time Grace doesn't merely traverse the downward spiral, she's kicked down it. By the time she's fitted with a crude device designed to keep her from escaping, just about everyone has turned against her, even the town's children. The ensemble cast of well-renowned actors do a fantastic job of becoming deplorable in a socially acceptable manner. Through it all, Grace remains Jesus-nice, turning the other cheek, making excuses for the town's poor behavior. Kidman does a wonderful job selling her character's altruism. Her seemingly bottomless fountain of innocence makes one want to beat bloody fists against the screen in revenge and curse von Trier for showing us the darkest part of ourselves.And Von Trier doesn't hold back as he builds to a climax that challenges our own moral compass by forcing us to contemplate what we would do in similar situations and examine the limits of forgiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then you watch a film that really holds you in it's grip. It leads you in, gets you to follow along with the plot to the point where you feel that you're controlling the film's course yourself. You feel that every event is, of course, what would happen next at that point.Dogville was such a film for me. Once I'd got used to the bizarre, minimalist set - which was like going to the theatre - the brilliant acting of the characters (especially Nicole Kidman) had me hooked.I think this is a very powerful and moving film - certainly a 'must see' for anyone who appreciates a good movie. My advice is to not be put off by the initial scenes, the apparent early slow pace and odd book-like narration and chapter headings. Chapter 9 is definitely worth waiting for.9Algis Kuliukas</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not to be redundant, but I also had no idea what to expect and wasn't buying the less than a stage play staging for about 10 minutes. After that I was hooked. I think those who would make this anti-American, anti-capitalist or a commentary on Iraq must have one eye closed watching this. One of the best things about it is that it isn't tritely about the noble poor. There was a line about working according to needs at one point and the usual bell (not Palovian, thank God) went off as I waited for the inevitable unmasking of this as a socialist allegory. But, it proved deeper than that. I'm still trying to come to conclusions as to what the allegory really was, or rather what the director thought it was. This is a really fine film because it caused me to think and did not spoon feed me predictable rhetoric posing as ideas. My girlfriend, who is not the Indie art-film nut I am, also liked it. So if given a chance, this film could win over viewers. One last thought. If this had been done as a stage play, most audiences wouldn't have had trouble with the stripped down set and lack of walls. Only in cinema, which is arguably the most flexibly visual form, do audiences expect a rigid status quo realism. Sad.</fullReview>

That's about it.Usually, i want to know nothing about a movie that I have decided i want to see. In other words, i don't want to know what happens in the movie before I actually see it. That's the cool part about seeing older or foreign movies since many times I will know little about them aside from basic plot.Now, here, i kinda wish I had known how this movie would be filmed, since for the first 15 minutes of the movie, I kept wondering if i had stepped into auditions for the movie or had walked into the filmed play version of the movie. I can't recall seeing any other movie filmed like this. It really shows how important cinematography and sets are to a movie. Not much.Because this was an amazing story. This 3 hour movie felt like it was 80 minutes (As an aside, i just saw a 80 minute movie and it felt like 3 hours). It is an interesting and fascinating tale about human nature, as explored in this chalk-lined town set in some soundstage. It almost felt like a filmed "book on tape." I feel like I just read a book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville once again illustrates Lars von Trier's strong sensibility, his peculiar intelligence, and his persistent artistic vision - persistent, in this case, as in nagging, irritating, and infuriating. As he mercilessly punishes yet another pretty woman selected for abuse, he also harries and bores the audience, this time, with an unappealing set, jumpy camera-work, and three long hours of creaky storytelling punctuated only by brief snatches of baroque music and toney British voiceovers spoken by Mr. John Hurt.Dogville's minimalist stage-set of a miserable, isolated Rocky Mountain depression town with a folksy narrator and quick vignettes of the various townspeople imitates and mocks the structure of Thornton Wilder's 'Our Town.' 'It's a Wonderful World' quickly devolves into 'It's a Horrible World' as von Trier unfolds his Hobbsian view of human life (or if you prefer, American society) by depicting a rural existence that's "nasty, brutish, and short." Into Dogville one evening comes the chosen victim, a disheveled but beautiful fugitive named Grace (Nicole Kidman). The place and its people have already been described for us by a young ne'er-do-well writer with the ironic moniker of Thomas Edison (Paul Bettany). Tom, who functions like Wilder's Stage Manager, also tries to foist his vague moral schemes on the locals and plays a pivotal role in the action by taking Grace under his wing and urging the townspeople to protect her. They do, but their acceptance is so conditional that we already suspect the worst.Though she's clearly a pampered city lady who's on the run and being searched for, exactly what Grace is fleeing from and what her life was like before we never learn, except to find out in the end that she's the daughter of a powerful gang lord (James Caan).Dogville's residents include a retired, hypocondriacal doctor (Philip Baker Hall), a black woman with a handicapped child, the keeper of an apple orchard (Stellan Skarsg?rd), some people who make tchotchkes out of cheap glass, a blind man who pretends not to be blind (Ben Gazzara), a couple with six young kids, and an organist, but no church. The rather random-seeming array of characters lodged in their wall-less, diagrammatic Dogville 'houses'don't add up to a coherent unit. In fact it's questionable that Trier has conceived of Dogville as a real functioning town. Basic physical requirements such as kitchens and outhouses are not shown, nor are other basic needs tended to. Where do they get their food? It's all a bit vague. All that really seems to matter to von Trier is Grace's ordeal, and the townspeople's poor performance under moral scrutiny.Grace is given two weeks on approval. People are being mean to her: we get the idea all too clearly. Grace has not only been raped by the apple grower and pawed by the blind Jack McKay (Gazzara) but has had her collection of tchotchkes smashed by Patricia Clarkson and, worse of all, been betrayed by her ostensible romantic love, Tom Edison (Bettany).At some point it begins to look very much as if Grace represents foreigners in America who're exploited as cheap labor. At other times American xenophobia, violence, and authoritarianism are referred to. Tom is clearly an ineffectual, morally reprehensible liberal intellectual.. There's a certain pal of Tom's, Bill Hensen (Jeremy Davies), who's of subnormal intellgence and has nothing to do, till he develops 'engineering skills' in time to fashion Grace's leg iron and restraint collar.Through all this Grace behaves in a saintly manner.This finale provides the classic ineffable thrill we always get when malefactors get their just deserts, even while we can't help but feel that such poetic justice is itself more than a little inhuman, not to say downright evil. Is it better to be a gangster than to be a meanspirited Depression town dweller? Ours not to reason why. It's Lars von Trier, not we, who gets to play God.Wilder's 'Our Town' seems undeniably corny today, but it still contains humanity and evokes life. Its families suggest real American families of the period. Von Trier's highly allegorical Dogville is Brechtian in its schematic, abstract depiction of reality, and the way it mocks Wilder's sentimentality by testing the townspeople and finding them sorely wanting has a moral fervor about it. But Brecht's plays are so much clearer, more pungent, and hopeful than what von Trier gives us. Brecht has heroes and villains; von Trier gives us only villains and patsies. One cannot deny that his style is arresting and his images do get under one's skin.But -- as with certain dreams - while they momentarily fascinate, even hypnotize us, we end by rejecting them and the grim outlook they represent as preposterous and over the top. A moral vision that grows out of a weak sense of the actual has little validity. There is nothing wrong with the acting, which is generally fine, and in the case of Kidman and Bettany particularly so; though the casting seems fairly arbitrary.Some will think this a masterpiece, as is usually the case with anything strong, daring, and peculiar. Some will consider von Trier to have emerged as the new Brecht. But for this writer the lack of economy is damning, and in any comparison with either Wilder or Brecht, von Trier is ultimately the loser.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Few movies can rely simply on its story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier latest piece of work is known for its eccentricity. No locations, no soundtrack, almost no anything, just a script and actors playing their characters. After Von Trier's Cannes winner "Dancing in the Dark", a musical that relied very much on its photography and score, it is curious such a different choice like this.The story is all that Dogville has to keep viewers attention during the three hours the film lasts. And it does greatly.When you see how small the city is and how few scene elements are available, you start feeling that you'll be bored after the first half hour. However, as the city and its characters are being built and the main character is the opposite of them, you get so involved with everything that is taking place, piece by piece, that you start suffering together with Grace.After all, the 178 minutes have gone by and you realize that, paraphrasing a famous short-story by Stephen King, the film should have been entitled: "Grace and the Dogville Redemption".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, Dogville. What can I say about Dogville?THE GOOD: Dogville was very well made. Lars von Trier is a magnificent director. The movie sort of had the feel of a stage play. This was due largely, though not entirely, to the experimental set design, which was very simple, yet elegant. In short, I loved the directing, acting, set design, costumes, special effects, and editing.THE BAD: I did not like the incredibly pretentious story. Yes, I like movies that make me cry. However, this movie's attempt at manipulating my feelings was way too blatant for my taste. Dogville was a formulaic "show the good and happy exterior and then show the dark and ugly underbelly" movie, where the main character's suffering was not to make the story interesting as much as to make the story "art". The message was not only a cynical outlook on human nature, but on any attempts to deny the dark side of human nature. I loved the ending, which was also cynical. Dogville had a great ending. The ending did not make up for the rest of the movie.THE UGLY: The hardships of the main character start out reasonable, but become more and more ridiculous as the movie progresses until they no longer even seem plausible. I mean, our hero is raped by everyone in the movie at least twice.RATING: 3 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a cartoon spoof on Von Trier's previous works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this very strange movie called Dogville with as ever great performance by Nicole Kidman. It's the latest from Lars von Trier of Zantropa, Breaking the Waves, Dancer in The Dark and Medea (that last one was truly fantastic) fame.The main strangeness of this movie is this. Usually when I see a movie I'm initially not sure about, the more I think about it afterwards the more I seem to like it. Here I think for the first time in my life I have the reverse. The more I think about Dogville - the less I seem to like it.I think von Trier really is beginning to lose it a bit. No wonder, the movie that came to Cannes with expectations of swiping it ended up not getting a single prize. To summarize it, Dogville is an incredibly one dimensional movie. Von Trier touches on same fetishes and on same aspect of sacrifice as he so brilliantly covered in Breaking the Waves, but here it almost reads as a programming algorithm.Given: the village, the girl comes into the village. She acts this way, the villagers respond in acting that way, the algorithm keeps on looping until she gets a pep talk from her father and kills them all.The more I think about it the more contrived and even tastelessly plagiarized the movie really feels. Sure, it takes place in a truly surrealistic setting. Sure she acts as a mix between Dostoyevsky's Idiot and his previous (great) character Bess McNeill from Breaking the Waves. The ending, the very ending that is, borders on Orwelian Animal Farm, but I knew almost right from the start that the main male character at the end is going to act out his version of Judas. The reason for main character's running away from and being shot at by "the gangsters" are to say the least unrealistic and almost comical. Her transformation at the moment's notice at the end looks cartoonish. In fact the movie ends up feeling as almost of a cartoon spoof on Von Trier's previous works.Now to von Trier settings. I never quite understood why his Dancer in The Dark took place in America (can't be that anti-capital punishment of a piece since the story itself takes place right after WWII when nearly every country still had capital punishment), and that same goes for this one. Actors act and look more Scandinavian then most Scandinavians I ever met (and I met a few), and anyway by no means do they act somehow American (find me an American who has a way of philosophizing like the main male character of the movie and you get a Nobel prize, but I sure know at least one simularly thinking Swede!). Both stories are rather universal in nature then in any way distinct to any particular culture. Why does it have to be another English language movie from a Danish director escapes me, since the movie wouldn't make that much money in the English-speeking part of the world anyway? In fact, I'm beginning to suspect that he does it for a rather strange commercial reason. He places the movie some place where he isn't going to make much in-roads one way or another, while in the same time making Europeans (probably his major market) think secure that it is a typical American setting, that staff like this could hardly happen in Europe. I know it sounds odd, but I can't think of any other reason. In fact Van Trier seem to reemphasize the movie's uniquely American roots with the documentary slide show during its final titles.Anyway, now to the good staff. Nicole truly is wonderful. The supporting cast and in my opinion especially Lauren Bacal are just fantastic. I found the movie by no means a boring one, those three hours flew by in a flash. The theatrical setting also is somewhat of an original. And the narrator's voice, that I usually tend to dislike in movies, here actually adds to the film's mystique. That's about it.6 stars out of 10, and that's being too generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an allegory of staggering proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many critics in the United States have pilloried this movie, accusing its creator of anti-Americanism. But such paranoid jibes completely miss the point: although Dogville is set in Depression-era Colorado, it really could be any place, any time. The tagline reads "A quiet little town not far from here", and the sparse stage set reinforces that point. The viewer's imagination is meant to fill in the gaps, making Dogville their home town for nearly three hours.Dogville is a troubled place where damaged folks nurse their own private woes. So when Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives, seeking shelter from pursuing gangsters, the natives are reluctant to help. With the assistance of local 'philosopher' Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), she eventually persuades the inhabitants to relent, and they grant her a two week trial period. During the fortnight, she manages to win the villagers over by performing good deeds, but gradually they begin to take advantage of her kindness and the rot sets in.This is an extremely long film, but it is definitely worth the effort. An allegory of staggering proportions, it deals with virtually every aspect of humanity and some of the most fundamental questions people can face, whilst maintaining a lightness of touch that makes the mental workout more than bearable. If that's not enough, Dogville is also home to some great supporting characters, played by the likes of Lauren Bacall and Chloë Sevigny, whilst John Hurt's narration is simultaneously whimsical and profoundly moving.So empty the tank, keep a drink in reserve, and settle down for 178 minutes of cinematic genius.</fullReview>

With a remarkable ensemble cast, all of which use there immense talent to portray difficult roles, of which require great skill, a feeling of unease creeps throughout the three hour duration of this film. The closing chapter does to seem to ease this somewhat with a powerful act of revenge by Grace (Kidman), but still a bitter taste is left when the film closes. Not the contrived and conceitedness found in other works by von Trier, but the final upbeat irony of the closing credits does echoes his deliberate audacity. A fine piece of filmed theatre, made greater by the talents of Nicole Kidman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Transfixed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here I go again, devoting just ten minutes to write about a film that took three hours to watch, and several days to digest. But for what it's worth:I was transfixed. I saw this in an empty movie theatre (no surprise there, I saw it in Peterborough, cultural desert but ground zero for theme pubs) so at one point I got up and paced about, leant on the railings, and yes I stroked my chin thoughtfully ... After two hours I was sure of it: I would never buy the DVD. Too hard to watch, too 'different', too slow, too stylised. Three days later, I've just ordered the poster and am hungry for the DVD so I can watch it again, alone, at home, because I don't know a single person who would sit through it with me.Maybe this says more about the quality of my friends, but that's another subject entirely .. :-)Look what I'm trying to say is that Dogville is just insanely different from any film I've ever seen before. Forget Brechtian analysis, God metaphors, social comment on the state of smalltown USA, acting critiques ... I've loved a couple of Lars Von Trier films (Breaking The Waves especially - Dancer In The Dark is elemental but I can't steel myself to watch it again, other than the beautiful opening sequence), but Dogville is up on a higher level. It's INCREDIBLY visually interesting which, given the well-discussed setting that i don't need to repeat here, is quite an achievement. But there are scenes of great visual beauty .. Kidman lying in the back of the apple truck is hypnotically beautiful.A word about Nicole .. I thought I didn't like her any more, she'd got too thin, too much of a Star, I couldn't see past Her to find the Characters any more. But in Dogville, she just blew me away .. I've never seen anyone more beautiful. Couldn't take my eyes off her. It's an unbelievable performance.I'm not wholly uncritical of the film - I think the worm turns a tad too predictably towards the end ... Grace wouldn't really just mutely accept the deteriorating behaviour of her captors (but then, this is a story) ... and what the hell was Thomas Edison (Paul Bettany) thinking about? Come on man, stand up for your girl!But I have a feeling about Dogville. I think it's going to become one of my favourites, and I've seen plenty. On rewatching it, I think I'm going to notice a lot more than I did the first time around. I think I'm going to grow to view it as a masterpiece of film making, and an example of why I love cinema. Once in a while, I see a film that reminds me that all movies are NOT the same, and that there are people out there like Lars Von Trier who can try something different, work straight from the heart, convince talented actors (and what a cast this is) to go with him to create something extraordinary in the medium of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an extraordinary film made by one of the best and most inventive directors working today. Lars von Trier is also one of the most challenging. He doesn't make it easy for his audience but usually you leave the cinema after seeing one of his films elated and inspired. Dogville is one of his best films and is certainly the best film of the year so far. The story is simple, harking back to early Westerns, but there's an astonishing twist at the end that quite literally takes your breath away. von Trier's set is very theatrical but it works. You are able to see and experience everything that is going on in the town of Dogville as it happens and the way this is achieved is very clever. In particular there is one scene that is quite shocking but at the same time everything taking place around it is normal and calm which adds enormously to the sense of shock and disquiet.The acting by the ensemble cast if first rate. Nicole Kidman's performance is magnificent and deserving of an Oscar but this is not the kind of film that normally attracts Academy votes, otherwise I'd say von Trier should be nominated for Best Director. Quite simply, this is a masterpiece which deserves every accolade heaped upon it. Not to everyone's taste I guess, but then I hated Love Actually which was a box office hit so what do I know?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good film. An acid critic for the american society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Even though it is not the best from Von Trier, I must admit that I never watched a film like this before and everybody will probably recognize its singularity. Clearly the political side of the film is the one to be given the attention, very different from the other films from this director, where the emotional side is always approached with more intensity. Von Trier puts himself in a very delicate situation in this movie (clearly is a personal film), and for being so daring, is one of the reasons I love this Filmmaker. He gives a very acid critic to the American society that can be interpreted in many different ways. It has a very rich script and very obvious, but polemic, subjects in it. The conclusion is superb. I don't think I should tell the plot, because every little detail can spoil all the surprising events in this story. It is also an overcastted film. Legendary actors like Nicole Kidman, Ben Gazarra and the voice of John Hurt are brilliants in this piece. One thing that I forgot to comment on that calls a lot of attention is the set. There are no walls, or doors. The houses and the street are marked with chalk on the floor, so every little scene, even the ones where there's a long dialog between two people, it was necessary the presence of great part of the cast. Again, I must rephrase, it is not a masterpiece, but it is a very, very good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece! (that is not for everyone)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, Dogville is a masterpiece of film making and story telling, however the format for its delivery is not for everyone.The comments in this forum are more mixed than for any film I can think of. I don't really understand why the people that called it boring or rubbished it went to see it in the first place. This is an arty film. I don't think it apologises for that. The spartan set, mirroring the openness and fragility of the characters and storyline. The film drips from the script and Lars Von Trier's camera work and direction.I left the film and has spent time analysing it ever since. Haunting thoughts of humanity and the extremely high number of ideas and concepts it presents throughout. Who was playing who? Before I mention the film, I just want to say, Anyone who enjoys a different film experience, devoid of effects and overflowing with ideas. See it now. Anyone else, take it all as an experience of what film can do. It is certainly not boring and certainly not rubbish.*** SPOILERS *** Was Tom playing both Grace and the town? I can't believe the town folk came up with the ideas of increasing her work. I think it was Tom experimenting for his own amusement. I dunno about the god concepts raised in this forum. It might be stretching Von Trier's ideas. But thats the great thing about this film. It is overflowing with concepts to think about, talk about and even argue about.A Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, though experimental nature questionable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, the story and morale of the movie are great, and that's a good extra for movies -- to earn a bit of insight or knowledge while enjoying entertainment. But still, entertainment IS the primary objective of movies - it's what draws people to theatres.This movie is highly experimental. It looks like a staged theatre show, and the environment in which the film was shot contains a minimum of substance (e.g. the houses have no real walls and doors, there's text and drawings on the floor indicating items that should exist there). Perhaps it was meant to bring to focus the characters and minimize visual distractions, or perhaps to symbolize laying bare the inhabitants of the village and/or human nature, but in either case the concept is alien to the casual movie viewer and can initially put you off. You get used to it after the initial shock and quickly get absorbed into the plot, but you won't get immersed into the movie enough to experience strong empathy towards the protagonist, which in my case, were that movie shot conventionally, would've caused me to cry my eyes out due to the strong drama.I think a more conventional movie, with vivid daylight colors, with "real" environment and steady camera work, would have brought much stronger feelings (and thus entertainment) without affecting the morale of the movie. This movie will probably be remade that way in a decade or two.I can't help get the feeling that the director, Lars von Trier, is actively trying to distinguish himself and aquire a kind of cult status as great directors such as late Kubrick had. Starting with "The Kingdom" where von Trier took the pain to introduce himself at the end of each chapter, to Dogville's promo which seems to promote the movie by the sheer fact that von Trier is its director (and neglects unimportant stuff such as content), to the movie itself that is (unnecessarily, in my opinion) unconventional and crying out loud for attention to its director (Arrogance? Now wouldn't that be ironic). I must admit I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing other works from von Trier except the aforementioned ones (an issue I mean to amend), so it may just be his style and I may be doing him injustice with my unfounded criticism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two major advantages of theatre performances as opposed to movies: the physical presence of the actors and a certain unpredictability and irreproducibility of each and every performance. For these two advantages the audience readily accepts the obvious drawbacks: the imperfect illusion caused by the rudimentary set, and a possibly imperfect play.Having seen Dogville, the question does not seem to be skippable, why the director has imitated a theatre performance and restraining his means to its limited boundaries, instead of sticking to whatever methods film making commonly has to offer. The theatrical advantages don't apply: Dogville IS still a movie, so there might be no physical presence of the actors when watching it, as there is no fascinating irreproducibility of the performance. Still the major drawback remains, the limited and primitive set. Given the thesis, "less is more", does a primitive set necessarily lead to salvation? I bet it does not. I don't get the point, why I had to suffer for hours and watch a pseudo-theatre performance, having no plus of any kind. As it seems to me, this chosen method was merely a pseudo-intellectual preliminary strike against all audiences, a vain and doubtful show of an assumed artistic potency, or spasmodic efforts to be and create something... different.Apart from that, the movie is still interesting.For most parts, I really liked Kidman. Unfortunately the story is unbearable, unless you are a Bertolt Brecht fan. As always in his case, the underlying piece ("Der gute Mensch von Szechuan") is a propagandistic story with a moral - for the masses. The moral in this story is, that there are good people and there are evil people, and well, things mix up sometimes a bit. Whack, this is the same conclusion you can easily gain by watching any James Bond movie. The characters are flat; the story is flat and predictable. Just the acting saves the show.As to the accusations of this movie being a deliberately anti-American one: I disagree with that. The story is universal(ly flat).I have found the cinematography concept very unpleasant and disturbing. The excessive and arty use of tele lens close-ups is difficult to watch, and limits the actual playing to [parts of] the faces, for no apparent reason.(Just as a footnote: anyone who has seen a dog in his life from less than a mile knows, that no one can ever steal a dog's bone [with some meat on it], especially if it happens to be a Staffordshire Terrier, unless that dog is very, very dead. In which case it is no stealing.)Casting James Caan as the mafia boss just like in similar roles in "Godfather" or "Mickey Blue Eyes" etc. is not only an idealess cliché; it is an unjustifiable mortal sin, for which Lars von Trier is likely to burn in hell for the eternity, except if he is to be reborn as a house dust mite and find his miserable death within my computer on the surface of an overheated chip.As a vote, I've given it a seven (out of ten), but I'm likely to revise it in favour of something lower, like, say... five. Or three.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heart- and gut-wrenching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* POSSIBLE SPOILERS*A new masterpiece by Lars von Trier. A most impressive film that reminded me a lot of "Breaking the Waves" (except for the ending). In the beginning, I had a bit of trouble with the shaky hand-held camera and the theater-like staging, but then I got sucked into the story and lived through it with all its ups and downs."Dogville" tells a heart- (and also gut-) wrenching story about a little town that is "tried" by the sudden appearance of a young female stranger. And the town fails. While someone wrote here that the ending made them very happy, I was not happy at all. In my opinion, the ending expresses that even revenge cannot do anything about what has happened before. If someone takes revenge, they only do evil themselves. Once evil is done, it could only be eradicated by the clear acknowledgement of one's bad actions and by repentance, the film suggests I think. But neither character is capable of doing this, that is why Grace's tragedy engenders another, even more devastating one.I think those who talk about anti-Americanism in the respect of "Dogville" are wrong. This story is about the nature of human evil (and the evil in human nature) and thus universal.A most impressive, moving film that makes you think a lot afterwards. I recommend it to all open-minded people who are not put off by the experimental staging and the length of the film (which I didn't even realize as I was so absorbed by the story).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just at the first showing of Dogville in North America at the T.O. film fest. Lars of course didn't show cause of his fear of flying. The movie is very interesting and very Lars. Shot without location or sets and heavy with narration Dogville is a truly unique approach to film making. The film was superbly acted and shot and evokes the anger and discomfort typically associated with Lars' work. I don't think it's going to be too popular with Hollywood though the Dogvilles of all Dogvilles. Very interesting commentary on North American values. I highly recommend it for two reasons: 1 it's truly rare to witness true originality in film and 2 it is actually a very good movie. See the movie with a friend and spend the next few weeks arguing about morality, film making and the film industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie set is nothing but a huge stage and chalk marks and minimum props. well... OK!It is three hours long. No problem!There is more narration in the film as there would be in a radio show. So what?!It an original concept and experimental film. Great! That's what we want don't we.?What I am wondering is that this director sets out to make a bold, intellectual and experimental film. Any ways the subject matter of the movie is dense and deep. Then why does the master director go another mile to make this movie a tough watch by totally ruining the camera work????Believe me home videos are better. The cameraperson who shot this theatrical play unfolding on the stage,must be having Parkinson's. It was irritating to hilt when the cameras zoomed and jerked and swayed as if the equipment was on a trapeze!!!When my friend and me got out of the movie hall we were looking seasick! Dogville, for its entire path breaking original story and movie making style, fails totally to make it a friendly viewer experience. With eyeballs rolling every time the camera sways without a cut, it became difficult to digest the brilliant three-hour movie experience!Its just so pretensions to try to add more experimental flavor to an already offbeat film with MTV style amateurish shooting. Why I wonder this had to be done?Just ordinary camera technique would have added hues to this otherwise good film concept where the entire ensemble performed brilliantly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Dancer in the Dark but still not good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me tell you that I consider Dancer In The Dark as one of the worst movies of the last decade. Lars Von Trier used so many tricks to move the audience that it got funny and ridiculous, like those horror films that don't scare anybody but make laugh. Moreover, the direction sucked and if Bjork gave all she had, Von Trier filmed her in such a bad way that she couldn't move at all.Well, just to say that when I went to see DOGVILLE, I didn't expect a lot. So I was quite surprised: The film is visually beautiful(it changes from his previous visual craps), some scenes are beautiful, Nicole Kidman is great(and well filmed, contrary to Bjork), it is not boring at all.BUT, the film doesn't reach its aim. It is meant to be an illustration of the cruelty of Man. But his demonstration is cheap and simple, and he doesn't manage to give life to his universe. There are no characters, only puppets. It is meant to make you think, but it is too easy and obvious for that. Therefore, I've already forgotten the film :)))) The only message of the film is: "Men are all cruel, they are like dogs(see the last shot), and the world would be better without them."Oh great! He must have thought about that for years! And the ending credits sequence (I don't know the correct English word) is one of the most ridiculous things I ever saw on a screen, a poor trick to disturb you much too obvious to work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lauren Bacall is back in this masterpiece of Lars Von Trier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to see this movie for three reasons. 1- Because this movie is from Lars Von Trier and his ?Dancer in the Dark' just shocked me in every sensible way. 2- Nicole Kidman is great in controversial films, just as in ?The Hours' 3- But my principal reason is ?Lauren Bacall', there are not a lot of words for her career, just stunning ! Dogville is a long film, 165 minutes of pure emotions. We have a lot of characters in the movie. All great actors and they all give fine performances. A few names ; Patricia Clarkson, Paul Bettany, Philip Baker Hall, Lauren Bacall and of course Nicole Kidman. What strikes me the most is the way of filming. It is like theatre a kind of Bertold Brecht's work. White lines and a lot of imaginations were used to make this movie. Yes, Nicole's performance is good, but don't forget the other ones. They give the best of themselves. There also a lot of rumors around the anti American message. I didn't see a lot of it, only in the credits, there you saw a picture of Richard Nixon. But the real message about America will come in the next movie ; ?Mandalay'. The story is quite simple : Grace runs away from her father and she hides herself in Dogville and the citizens have to protect her, but it causes problems... My opinion : it is a quality movie, but I don't know if everyone will likes this. It is not a usual movie, with a usual message. But I was ready for a chance and the actors were also prepared for it. When you would ask me ; ?which film do you prefer The HOURS or Dogville' ?Well I would go for The Hours because it was more a film that interested me and I needed a lot of imagination to follow ?Dogville'. But it becomes better the more you think about it. It is the comeback of Lauren Bacall who retiered for a while after ?Diamonds'. She is great and I love her. She is the only actress from the 40's who is still working and I realise now after the lose of Katharine Hepburn and Gregory Peck recently, that we have to keep in great honour. By the way it's also a small comeback for me. I stopped writing comments for a while, but now I am back just as Bacall. Rating ; 8,5/10 or ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, touching study of community and morals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is one of my favorite directors of all time, so I went into this film expecting to like it, but I was not expecting this film to be (arguably) his best. Like all of his other films, Dogville was very dividing among critics and audiences (even though it is one of his better received). Some praised it for being groundbreaking and innovative with its minimalist approach to set design, and deeply emotional and moving with its incredibly human characters, while others criticized it for being tedious, melodramatic, pessimistic, and of course the classic Von Trier criticism, pretentious. That word gets thrown around a lot, pretentious, and rarely do people even know what it means, it means adding greater meaning or importance to something then is actually possessed. And believe me Dogville never tries to be more important than it actually is. But what is Dogville about? Well if you somehow didn't already know and are reading this review I'll give a brief summary, Dogville is about a very small town up in the Rocky Mountains, that doesn't receive any visitors and is essentially shut off from the rest of the world (minus a radio and a telephone). In this small town a strange girl appears one night seeking shelter from some strange men that are after her, after the town reluctantly accepts her, she pays them back by doing small things around town that, as the film says, don't really need to be done. The film then explores the nature of how a community functions, moral convictions, Justice, and punishment. As the heroine tries to live her life in the small town of Dogville. Nicole Kidman plays the heroine, Grace Margaret Mulligan, with a performance that is able to rival björk in dancer in the dark, or Emily Watson in breaking the Waves. But she is not the only great performance in the film, all of the supporting roles, even minor characters are noteworthy, and it is basically impossible to talk about Dogville and not talk about the set design, I hinted at it earlier, but the really is nothing like it. There is only one set in the whole film and that is the town and that is just a big empty space with chalk borders drawn on the floor and a few props her and there, of course in the reality of the film it is a real town, but to us the audience we see everything wide open we are entering their small world, just like Nicole Kidman.9.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a film which can really make you question your way of life and view of society then avant-Gard drama "Dogvill" would be the right choice for you.The plot of the move is set in a remote small town somewhere in USA during the prohibition era. A young girl named Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, comes to this imaginary town called Dogvil where meats locals. Gradually she becomes familiar with their way of life, personalities, fears and above all with their hypocrisy.The theater like setting (no walls etc.) giving the impression of everybody's awareness of evil deeds which are happening. This way director achieves the effect of guilt transmission and making spectators think about their own social settings, their involvement and responsibility.Dogvill definitely deserves significant place in history of film as a monument of brave and uncompromising criticism of society. Although I would not recommend this move to people who do not feel the moral issue is important in their lives, to children under the age of 16 and to those who suffer from serious depression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a masterpiece, since it really develops and studies the whole idea of the real human nature, how vulnerable he is to temptation and greed, and how easy is for him to fall into sin. As all deep and meaningful movies, it's not for everybody, since you really have to think for yourself, and it's not a movie that every 5 minutes has an action stunt, however if you are the kind of person that likes to think and reflect on humanity, you'll find this piece of art amazing.Also it questions the idea of forgiveness in a very eye opening way, I'm how should It work, and how it actually works on our society. So many subjects that this film studies, all about the humans and their spirit, and how they work with the society. It could be related to a book such as "The Karamazov Brothers" by Dostoievski in some way, since both of them tell a story in a daily basis sketch, with simple stories and constant characters, and yet they use this daily activities and situations to question the human kind.Apart from the deep meaning the film has, the photography of the film is great, also the fact that it is presented as a theater play, which probably has arranging for Von Tirer, and makes this film also different, to see how the characters work with the ambient and elements that are even there. As well as the acting, specially from Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany and Patricia Clarckson is very powerful and even touching, makes your really forget for a moment that your watching a movie and gets you into this people's life's.Bottom line, if you like a film that leaves you with doubts and thoughts about deep matters, then this movie is the ideal; however if you don't like a deep script, and movies that could be seen as "flat" or not so "action packed" as others, then probably you won't find the movie as perfect as it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we first selected this movie from Amazon Prime, we were prepared for a movie that we had somehow missed with Nicole Kidman in it and not prepared for the play; however, I was immediately captured by the staging. I have been raised seeing a lot of plays, and my boyfriend has not been seeing them for that long. At first he wanted to change it, but he is just as much entranced by the movie. Another reviewer commented that they hardly noticed the staging after a bit and later realized that there would have been so much that they would have missed had it been presented any other way. I totally agree. It brought out the softness and tenderness, as well as emotions (or lack of emotions in some cases) in a more striking and memorable manner.It reminds me of watching Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams or Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman in that they both delved on the humanity within our souls. The narration in this helps to keep the viewer on track and guided with a great tone of voice.If someone doesn't put this on a list for classic movies/plays to see, it would be a travesty in itself. Anyone interested in staging, humanity, etc. would be in complete awe.Nicole Kidman was fantastic, as well as all the other cast members with a pleasant surprise to see Lauren Bacall in this too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the four Lars Von Trier films that I've watched so far, this was the first and on reflection still the best, surpassing the 'sequel' Manderlay (which I liked), Antichrist and Melancholia.It's a profound piece of work that will have you marvelling at the depravity of human beings by its end. We huddle together in our little groups in all classes of society, condemning outsiders. It's happened to and against me, but not to this extent. We're strong as a group but weak as individuals - that's the only excuse for the spineless actions of the Dogville community as a whole, besides fear.I was sceptical about Nicole Kidman at first. She's too well-known for such an intricate piece I thought, but I was wrong - she's clearly brilliant. The lack of props, even for a stage play, is something I've never experienced at this level before, but it's not an element that carries forward as it progresses or detrimental to overall enjoyment of the story. It's sparse and harsh, which is the desired effect, I guess.A very thought provoking piece of work that requires viewer commitment to get through the first half-an-hour due to its lack of pace and absence of visual stimuli.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was a movie that would to provide a big split between critics and audiences, it would be this film Dogville. However, the contrast isn't as great as I thought it would be. But, this film is unlike any other film I have seen before. I always encourage experimental filmmaking and this is a prime example of it. The film is in play format and the town has no walls or doors suggesting that there are some philosophical themes in play. Each person would interpret this movie differently and that seems to be the goal of the filmmakers.Lars Von Trier's film takes place in the 1930's in a small, quaint town of Dogville which is seemed to be located somewhere in the American West. The citizens of Dogville are tested when they decide to take in a young lady on the run from some gangsters.This film is well-acted and that is also why the movie works, in my opinion. There are some stand-out performances by Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsgaard, and James Caan. These were the stand-outs, but the rest of the cast was magnificent as well.Overall, this is a great piece of experimental filmmaking. But however, the film is a bit too long and it could lose a half-hour or so. I know that people criticized this film for putting America in a bad spotlight, but then who doesn't? There are many themes to be taken away from this film, but I'll leave it to the viewers which themes the film is implying. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmed in a theater set, no real objects except the characters but very successful however. The movie is very surprising by the keen changes of the all characters' attitudes against and thoughts about the strange visitor came to their little town in need. &#x130;n time, they show every malicious behaviors and thoughts which they had repressed for a long time. Shortly, it can be said that the movie has a pessimistic look on the human nature. May be it's also the reality on earth. &#x130;n fact, we all acting in our lives and not genuine to each other, only waiting the right time to show our real faces. &#x130;t wouldn't be fair if I don't say something about the acting of Nicole Kidman. &#x130;n my opinion, this is one of her best performances, also looked too beautiful as compared to her other movies. She deserves more..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very fine film with impact.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, 10 is merely excellent? If I ignore that anchor and say 10 is tiptop, I'd give this film about an 8.5. In terms of execution (no pun intended), the film is excellent throughout--the set, acting, shots, narration, etc. are obtrusively controlled and thought-provoking. I've read about 50 other reviews, and none yet has mentioned 'Our Town', which this film seems to aim to mock, or Durrenmatt's 'The Visit', which is about revenge from the very beginning, but still about the corrosive effect on every member of a community an outsider can have.Grace (Nicole Kidman), and the town's treatment of her, call to mind Christ for sure, but even moreso slavery as an institution, so that the black actress's complicity in Grace's abuse is strikingly ironic. A key message of the film, as I viewed it, is that Grace's very goodness, and early unopposed evil acts, partly the cause of the town's corruption. The townsfolk seem to get along OK before Grace arrives; the other attractive young woman in town does not get raped, etc. (as far as we know). But Grace is helpful, sympathetic, good-spirited, uncomplaining--and so she gets exploited and then brutalized. Chuck, the apple farmer, talks about how she empathically 'understands about the apples' and so is ripe (not intended) for his rape of her. And then, if one person exploits her, the others come to believe that they are justified in doing so, too. If this is von Trier's point, it would come through more clearly if a stranger who was NOT a dazzling beauty entered the town with the same results. She's also downright inhuman in never standing up for herself or effectively protecting herself. Is a reference to the Holocaust intended?--an interesting question in the light of von Trier's comments about Hitler.Although she is unfailingly good throughout, Grace's likeness to Christ is clearest at the end, when her Father explains that her mercy and forgiveness are arrogance--failure to use the same standards to judge others that she uses to judge herself. Jehovah and the Flood? Anyway, her reaction is very interesting, as she is first reluctant to have all the villagers killed, then reasons that if they were not punished/ massacred, they would treat the next stranger to visit the same way--a rationale that is unmasked by her decision to torment one woman especially nastily and vengefully and to kill her betraying 'boyfriend' Tom herself--"One simply must do some things oneself." (That's the gist.) My reaction to the film's conclusion was high suspense about whether she would 'do the right thing' and kill them all off, and I cheered when she did (though she did not treat Chuck nearly harshly enough for my taste). But then: has power corrupted her, too, and is that what she was fleeing, and is von Trier's conclusion that no one--not Christ, not God--can be good in this world?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville might sound like the name of a town and i expected some kind of town effort film with a happy ending, and although the latter was so for me, it was because by the time the three hours had passed, i had agreed with its misanthropic view.The film brings a very unique and potent perspective to the film world. At first i wondered why it was done this way... in a dark studio with no walls or roofs. Even the plants are drawn... but the longer the movie drags(which arguably is the worst thing about the movie), the more it becomes clearer why it was done so. An all around good movie with some great performances and unique directing. Without giving any spoilers, i highly recommend this movie, though its probably for those with a developed taste in film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Obvious Allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is a minimalist, and somewhat critical and pessemistic, allegory of America from its inception to relatively modern times (and by extension, if loosely, of the Western world). If that first sentence makes you think "wtf?!" then this isn't a film for you; you're probably one of the residents of Dogville without actually realising...maybe I am too. Like a theatre production which makes good use of the audience's imagination, this film is intentinally sparse, set in a studio with painted outlines of buildings, streets, plants and even dogs. I read that as an intention for the story and characters to be the most, and only, thing that should be on the minds of the viewer; it works.Whether that allegory is based in the time the film is set in 1930's (post-) depression America or modern-day America is a finesse that a non-American would never understand: it seems equally valid today.The story centres around the arrival of Grace (Kidman) to a small mining town known as Dogville, which has seen better times but is now secluded, isolationist and introverted. Grace arrives as a refugee from oppression, and meets the beautifully-acted Tom (Bettany) who hides her in the abandoned mine. If you want a dry synopsis of each chapter of the film, Wikipedia does it well.In my view, Grace represents the ideal of America (not necessarily the American Dream). Her journey throughout the film begins with hard work to become accepted, her gradual, graceful and brutal exploitation and eventual submission to the very thing she fled from in the first place.The various supporting characters are relatively easy to define as aspects of American society - Tom represents the well-meaning liberalism that seeks acknowledgement and approval for good deeds whilst exploiting that which he seeks to protect, The Big Man (James Caan) represents imperialism (in the guise of organised crime) from which Grace sought to escape, but to which she ultimately returns after the abuses she suffers at the hands of those who don't understand her and seek to use her for their own ends, etc.This is a movie that is as entertaining as it is hard to watch at times. If you're prepared to think about what you're watching and accept the director's criticism about the way we live, it's very thought-provoking. If you watch it literally, there's not much here for you and maybe a Steven Segal or Jean-Claude Van Damme movie is more your speed.I personally thought the credit music of David Bowie's "Young America" was a bit heavy-handed, and purely there as a "this is what the movie's about, stupid!" comment, simply because you either understand this movie or you don't; if you haven't got it by the end credits, then a song isn't going to illuminate you.Overall, it's a sublimely-acted film, perfectly cast and very engaging if you appreciate theatre and can look beyond the obvious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something very different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is the sort of film the viewer will either be engrossed in from start to finish or they will want to turn off after a few minutes... thankfully I was in the former group. As the film opens it becomes apparent that it is something very different; in a time when many films have stunning locations or large CGI landscapes this goes the other way and has virtually no scenery being filmed on a stage where locations are labelled but not actually shown; so a house will just be white lines drawn on the stage. The only props we see are those that that are essential to the plot.Set in a small hamlet in the Rocky Mountains where nothing much happens until one day Grace, a beautiful young woman arrives; she is trying to get away from a group of gangsters. The townsfolk agree to let her stay for two weeks, and at the end of that time they will vote on whether she can stay; if one person says no she must leave though. During that time she offers to help them out in various ways. At first they say they don't need help but soon she is doing little things for all of them and at the end of the two weeks they vote to let her stay. Not long afterwards a policeman comes looking for Grace, the people once again decide to let her stay although as time passes the little things they don't really need help with grow to fill most of her time. Later the police man returns and says Grace is wanted for a bank robbery; even though they know she could not have committed they crime they expect her to do more and more to let her stay. After being raped by one of the men she tries to leave Dogville but the person she paid to take her away betrayed her and returns her to the town where the people chain her up to prevent her escaping. At this point they give up all pretence of being decent and treat her like a slave as well as all but one of the men raping her. That one claims to love her but when she declines his advances he contacts the gangsters who where looking for her all that time ago. What he does not know is that that gangster was Grace's father and when he gets there he just wants to bring Grace into his business and while she is initially willing to forgive the townspeople she soon decides something must be done so that they can never do to another person what they did to her... after she is finished the town's name is chillingly appropriate: the only living creature left in the township is Moses the dog.When I watched this I'd already seen its sequel; "Manderlay" so wasn't sure how I'd like seeing a different actress in the role of Grace as Bryce Dallas Howard was great in the later film, I needn't have worried though as Nicole Kidman was equally good. Strangely the open set managed to make the town of Dogville seem very claustrophobic, nothing was done that everybody doesn't know about making everybody complicit in her suffering. While Grace is the centre of the film that doesn't mean Nicole Kidman is the only actor that gets to show off her acting skills all of the cast perform well, especially Paul Bettany who plays Tom, the man who claims to love Grace but who does as much as any of the others to keep her there. Mention must also go to John Hurt who narrates the story and obviously to Lars von Trier who had the vision to create such a different film. I'd certainly recommend giving this film a go; just don't expect it to be like anything you've seen before; unless you've seen Manderlay.</fullReview>

You can't help but put yourself in Graces shoes, and suffer the indignities with her. This is Triers genius; he makes you welcome what happens at the end although it is very shocking.I thought Dogville was very good indeed, it makes you FEEL something, which is the ultimate test for a film. However the sound stage style seemed to get in the way of the story rather than intensifying it, the Peter Greenaway inspired narrative was pretentious and the occasional hand-held video camera sequences don't have that documentary/reality show feel that Trier was obviously after...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie to watch just once in your life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dogville" is a movie that some may call a play. It's set on a large production stage, the houses are marked with chalk, and there are close to no props. However, the movie works in a couple of ways. Director Lars von Trier prepares us for this theater-based movie by placing a heading before anything starts. It states that what we are about to see is a prologue and that we are about to get introduced to the characters. Then a narrator comes on and we are shown the whole 'city' of Dogville. This narration is simple yet highly descriptive, and helps the audience participate in much of the visual aspect of the movie.The setting seems isolated and withdrawn from any major city life. The townspeople all have different jobs and they all seem to participate and communicate only amongst each other. They are the only source of energy in the whole town. Nothing other than the characters is real, and nothing at first seems out of the ordinary. This is a very original idea in that movies like this only work if you have the right script. Luckily, Lars von Trier wrote the perfect script for a movie like this.We are first introduced to the key character, Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), a writer who's having trouble writing his latest novel. The rest of the cast is almost clueless to anything but their own, repetitive life. During one night, Tom sits outside as a beautiful woman wonders through their town. She hides behind a mountain and Tom offers to keep her safe, as she is followed by gangsters. She introduces herself as Grace (Nicole Kidman) and immediately there's a sense of chemistry between the two. The rest of the townspeople seem incredulous and oblivious to Grace's appearance, and all want her to prove herself trustworthy of staying in their town. To do so, Grace goes door to door asking everyone if they need help with their chores. At first they seem reluctant, but soon rely only on her to take care of their work for them.The movie runs for almost 3 hours and for a good reason. There is a definite establishment of character from each person in this movie, and a high drive for all of their actions. It's a way of presenting a society that's been isolated their whole life. We meet Chuck (Stellan Skarsg?rd) who also came to Dogville from a different town. At first he resents Grace but later uses her for more than just work. As each person in the town blames Grace for no reason other than that she hasn't lived there all her life, Grace falls victim to rape, imprisonment and slavery. All of this presents a very powerful idea about an isolated society during the great depression.The aspect that sticks out about the movie is definitely the acting. Nicole Kidman's risky performance is brilliant as she subtly yet flowingly portrays a confused young woman who's falling apart from her past and from her present. She beautifully steals the spotlight (no pun intended) as the gorgeous hard-working stranger that everyone uses for their own sick pleasure.Often portrayed as an anti-American with his false portrayal of the society, Lars von Trier creates something so original and unique, that it almost dares not enter mainstream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can understand that many people might find this a difficult film to watch let alone enjoy. After all there is no set to speak of, all the action takes place on a sound stage with markings on the floor depicting walls etc. It was this idea that appealed to me and prompted the purchase of the DVD (I missed it at the cinema, which was a shame).The lack of set means you focus on what really matters, the acting. Nicole Kidman is superb as Grace entering a town in the grips of the depression, perhaps this is why they react to her in the way they do, or is it more fundamental of human nature. Anyway she acts her socks off. The support cast also do a fine job, dear old Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, Patrica Clarkson etc.There are times when you find the going tough, especially the rape scene where because of the lack of walls on set not only do you see this horrible act but life going on around it, children playing, people shopping. It heightens our feelings of revulsion. I have to admit to a feeling of satisfaction at the end when she fails to save the town, after all she had been through I didn't blame her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I love Lars Von Trier. I love that he made Riget and Riget 2, Zentropa, Dancer in the Dark...I love that he made Breaking the Waves even though it left me cold...and I loved that he made Dogville even though I don't love the film. He is one of the few interesting directors working in film today. He is unpredictable and always worth a watch. Still, Dogville fell short of my expectations...forced and not believable, not one of its characters rang true(perhaps they should have been props as well)... all is a slave to ideology.By the time James Caan appears in the back of the Cadillac all I could think was 'I guess Al Pacino said "No" '. I even had difficulty being offended by it although I did get a laugh out of the end credits...imagine, a story about a village (country) taking advantage of a vulnerable refugee, turning them over to the authorities after treating them in a sub-human way, only to have a firestorm come down upon them and destroy their village ( I think that actually happened somewhere in a big way last century) and it happens in ... America! of all places. Not that America is anything close to perfect...but I find being lectured to by an Aryan on the subject of intolerance the absolute height of arrogance (as long as we're playing the guilt-by-association game).Still and all a very admirable try, worth watching as I'm sure his next work will be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no doubt about it, Mr von Trier is clever, and can write a story. The story is quite interesting, although loses its way a little at some points, and at other points the trauma heaped on the protagonist is just too over the top.However, this movie smacks of clever dickiness; of being clever just for the sake of it. Realistically, this is not a movie; a rational description is a stage show that happens to have been filmed. That's fine; but mentally masturbating about this as some kind of inspiration is not necessary. It's simply a choice that most people wouldn't bother exploring, because it's fairly obvious that it's not going to be very useful. Interesting? Yes (somewhat). Clever? Yes. Great?

And boy am I happy that I finally sat down and indulged.To be able to sympathize with every character along this twisted, dark path and become emotionless with Grace as she searches her soul for the strength to forgive and understand how these people are the way they are was very appealing. I was completely encapsulated in Grace and felt every emotion she did at exactly the same time she did. I felt remorse, hatred, sadness and compassion hoping that she would eventually teach them to become what she envisioned.Really I am just rambling words of nonsense hoping to be able to recommend this wonderful film to all. Please see it and you will also become speechless but feel that you are articulating it properly and with purpose.

		<fullReview>This was an excellent study of man's inhumanity to man. At first, the movie moved sluggishly and I was hard-pressed to gain an interest in the characters, but as time went on, I began to see the true nature of each of the individuals in the story. I think writer/director Von Trier was trying to make a commentary on life in America, but I feel it was unfair of him to choose the setting during the Great Depression. Those were troubling times, and who knows what lies hidden in the depths of each of our souls during those kinds of times. I think if this story was set in any other country, it would work just as well, but only if the story took place during a specific time of tribulation in that particular country, such as our Great Depression. The story itself was riveting and Nicole Kidman was unsurpassed in her scope and depth of the character she plays. It was fun seeing old familiar faces pop up in one role or another, like Ben Gazzara and Lauren Bacall. Although the movie was quite long (three hours), I think it was necessary to complete the entire feeling for what came after. One thing I enjoy after seeing a movie is imagining alternate endings (which some DVDs add these days), and I let my imagination run loose with this one. I was not especially happy with this ending, because I did not feel it reflected the mind-set of its main character, Grace. However, I found the movie as a whole very thought-provoking and worth watching.</fullReview>

There was a stage with chalk lines for houses - no walls, no doors, and one window (which revealed a character's blindness).There was a dog named Moses whose bark you could hear, but was invisible until the end.There was the character of Grace, who worked magic in people's lives selflessly and without judgement, until the end.And there was a vain blind man.There was also so much more.Lauren Bacall...

The key is the conversation Grace has with the "Boss" at the end of the movie.I'm not a Christian, but this movie makes a powerful statement that most non-Christians can understand, and see the Christian Message in a whole new way.Brilliant.

		<fullReview>I'm no big fan of Lars Von Trier, i can admit that right away. That is also why it took me so long to decide i wanted to see this movie. The style used in the movie didn't seem appealing to me either so i remained skeptical. But at last i decided to give this a try. And i was, to put it frank, blown away.Dogville is the tale of the young Grace (Nicole Kidman) who arrives mysteriously at a small mountain town called Dogville. She seems to be hunted by someone and she is taken in by the friendly Tom (Paul Bettany). However, for her to stay in the little town she needs to consult also with the other towns-folk. They take two weeks to decide whether she can stay in town.Dogville is a rather bleak look at the aspects of humanity. It presents a rather grim view of human nature and what ordinary people might do when given power to use their fellow man. As Grace becomes more desperate to stay, and the people of the small town realize this the friendly folk suddenly change. It doesn't surprise me that director Lars Von Trier is the one to present the kind of view on humanity that is shown in this movie, as he has always seemed rather cynical to me. However i can't really say that i feel he's wrong.What is the most obvious thing about this movie is the method in which it is made. There is no scenery and hardly anything except the actors and the clothes they are wearing.. The small mountain town is drawn up in chalk in a studio, some furniture are put in the drawn rooms and people move inside and outside the lines in the ground. In this way it becomes more like watching a minimalist theater play than a movie. While this may sound awkward i found it to work very well. Which brings me to the second thing that was obvious right from the start.The acting. Amazing. Nicole Kidman does what i would term one of the best performances of her career. But she's not alone, all the other actors are also rock-solid. Paul Bettany is also worth a mention in my opinion, i have never seen him this good. And this amazing acting is also a huge contributing factor as to why the whole theater-setup with no scenery works so well. With less good actors this could have been catastrophic.I was, like i said in the beginning of this review, quite skeptical to watching this movie. But now that i have i'm happy i did. This absolutely stands as the best movie i have seen in quite a long time. It says something about peoples capacity for cruelty that really made me think. This one i feel will stay with me for a long time. A very recommended viewing and a triumph for Lars Von Trier. I rate it 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A BRILLIANT film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier has finally hit the masterpiece. I have to admit that I had until now appreciated Von Trier's film philosophy, but never got into the films themselves. I admittedly haven't seen what is supposed to be his best (Breaking the Waves), but I thought Dancer in the Dark, for example, was a horrible film - overly long, poorly acted, and unnecessarily boring and dreary - and Italian For Beginners was amusing, but hardly an instant classic.That said, I went into Dogville with an open mind. The brilliant cast and fascinating subject matter (and the rumours I'd been hearing about the film) equaled the long screening time and Von Trier's history. I noticed a high number of walkouts during the premiere, but that didn't surprise me. Many people have a LOT of trouble watching a film that is highly intellectual and has little in the way of fast-paced action or high- drama. This film is not about America, it is about the world. It is about humanity, and the levels of degradation we can sink to. It's about the mistreatment of our neighbors and of strangers. it is about a decline in basic civility and social 'grace'.This film is anti-Dogme; instead of an all-natural film we have one that is purely artificial. Where everything is pared down and exposed. This is very significant considering the subject matter. The sets are refreshingly unique, the acting stellar, and even through a 3-hour sitting I barely noticed the time passing by. The end credits were just icing on a beautifully constructed cake.I recommend this film to EVERYONE. if you're uncomfortable or have trouble with this film, force yourself to watch it, to think critically about it and to discuss it. A solid 9/10.</fullReview>

The cast is flawless, with Nicole Kidman simply disappearing inside her character. The script is tight, and everything seem to be well written and thought out.Although as perfect as the movie looks and sound, I think - and here I stress the word "I" because this might be very subjective - that it lacks solutions to the problems it sets out to study. It takes a very dark look at a certain human behavior at a certain location and at a certain time, but it never offers any way out of that. I'm aware that maybe the author didn't think there was a way out, or maybe he didn't think it was necessary to offer any, but then the film left me with a very uncomfortable feeling of incompleteness. It took me very deep inside a hole, and then just left me there.But then again, that might just be that I am spoiled. Overall all, in spite of the last paragraph, I really liked this movie, loved its originality, and am looking forward to see more from Lars Von Trier. I give Dogville a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film makes that you think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film that leaves one wondering the next day about the thoughts and questions it raises. The obvious dominant theme is that power corrupts and the more power the greater the corruption. But as the cast make a thing of it, is 'arrogance' a stronger theme and if so just exactly in what way? And who is the most despicable character - might it in the end be the heroine. Is escape from our background in life ever possible and can we ever find freedom? Is the violation of trust worse than the violation of the female body? Would we, as allegedly civilised compassionate people in the audience in fact be there doing the same in the same circumstances? Is there a religious parallel as Grace endures the agonies the town folk dispense - but if so Grace's 'resurrection' seated literally at the right hand of the Father at the of the film is hardly heaven on earth. Do we see what went on objectively or do we see what the narrator of the film interprets and thinks we should see? All these questions will make sense once the film has been watched. I have no idea what the answers are and that's a big part of the attraction of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Trier's folly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i must say i found "Dogville" somewhat disappointing, especially considering that i've been championing Lars Von Trier for a while. I was totally aware beforehand of the whole sound-stage thing, in fact it's one of the things i was most interested in the film about, but i never once imagined how intrusive it would really be. I'd call it a gimmick except that i think highly enough of Von Trier to assume that he had a reason for doing it that way. But in any case it didn't help my enjoyment of the film any, that's for sure. Not that it's the only problem i had with the film. I also thought that the staginess of the whole thing seemed to somewhat affect the actor's performances as well, making them more theatrical than natural. Although i guess this could also be in part because most of the characters weren't actually three-dimensional people as much as symbols, which is true of all of Von Trier's more recent films, but in this case it was somewhat enhanced by the theatrical presentation and the overall lack of the high-intensity emotionalism of "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark", which is probably the thing that bothered me most about the film. Wereas those previous films were very intense, emotional character studies on top of being parables, "Dogville" lacked the dramatics and thus all the audience is left with is a rather heavy-handed sermon. Luckily, in this case Von Trier was preaching to the choir on my part, so this aspect of the film bothered me less than it might otherwise have, although i must admit the point he was trying to make was pretty much all there was to the film, and it was the same point being made over and over again throughout the film, and none-too-subtly either. In this sense the dramatics of "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" resulted in a subtler approach, at least to some extent. Not to mention that the message of "Dogville" was basically the same as "Dancer in the Dark" to begin with. This was another problem i had with the film, that basically it seemed like recycled ideas from the "Golden Hearts" trilogy. Which, if it turns out is a continuing trend in "Mandarlay", will make me question the necessity of the "America" trilogy at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trier's Theatre of Cruelty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>* Spoilers Ahead (It's impossible to comment this film and not talk about its ending) * I didn't like "Dancer in the Dark" and "Breaking the Waves" (although I enjoyed Trier's "Kingdom"), so this was in some ways a pleasant surprise. The minimalist set is actually aesthetically interesting (much more than the horrible musical sequences from "Dancer"), and Kidman's never been more beautiful. As the film put her character thru more and more suffering, I thought, well, there comes another pointless martyrdom a la Breaking the Waves (I hated the ending of that film). So it was a surprise to see everything turn around in the final chapter. And of course, by making us identify with the heroine until the end, Trier makes sure that we end up actually supporting her revenge at the end, which is somewhat disturbing, since it verges on sadism. And I suppose that's exactly what Trier wants. Despite all the clear references - Brecht's Pirate Jenny, Thortnon Wilder's Our Town, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon - somehow it reminded me more of a Biblical allegory or a story by Flannery O'Connor, like the one in which the Misfit says, "She would a been a good woman if there was someone to shoot her every minute of her life" - a message that could apply to all Dogvillians. But, as in all allegories, Dogville works by creating an unrealistic portrait of life. And for all its anti-Americanism (or, more exactly, misanthropy - could happen anywhere), I did not feel the ending as scathing as, say, the work of great misanthropes such as Swift, Machado de Assis or Golding: I did not end thinking that, "gee, humankind is really evil", and I think it's because some of its misanthropy feels stagey or coldly calculated. Some events that at first seem exaggerated, motivated merely by unjustified cruelty (putting Grace in chains, the repeated rapes), you see that are put there to justify our anger and support for Grace's revenge in the end. But I guess I do have a problem with allegories - I much prefer films like Renoir's Rules of the Game, in which no one is totally good nor totally bad, but somehow the problems of society are better illustrated in the end.That said, I do think that Dogville was a pleasant surprise, a really interesting film and not boring at almost three hours (which is saying something). Besides, when many films are so unwilling to go against conventions, Trier does all he can to rip them apart, mixing literature, theatre, film, whatever. Some may say this is "filmed theatre", but who has decided how film should be and look like? You might not like his films (and from what I read Trier is not very likable as a person either, or at least quite tough with his actors), but just for going against the general attitudes he is a refreshing presence in modern cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often simplistic to the point of aggravation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****I'm not positive how spoiler-free this review is, so be forewarned.*****The problem with "Dogville" is that it's very allegorical and didactic. Not only that, but the writer/director is very uncompromising towards those who disagree with his worldview, and the film leaves very little ambiguity or room for interpretation. In the case of this particular film, this is not good modern storytelling, but rather indicative of a frustrated artist who simply wants to thumb his nose in the face of his viewers and critics. Lars von Trier is trying to teach us something, but in trying to do so he becomes so blue in the face that his words fall on deaf (and rightfully indignant) ears.The last hour and a half of the film is essentially an extended "I TOLD YOU SO!", and simply uncomfortable to watch. This discomfort is not the result of any film making or scripting merits of Lars von Trier (as many often seem to misinterpret), but through the sheer boredom and repetition of the storytelling. This boredom is accentuated through the minimalist play-like stage set, the very utilitarian cinematography, and the intentional lack of actor continuity. Note that any of these features might have served a useful artistic purpose if they weren't present simply as yet another tool to objectify the citizens of Dogville. The only thing I can't fault the film for is the acting. Every actor fills their role to completeness, and none of the performances stand out in any unnatural way.As every further injustice upon the female lead in the film becomes more outlandish and crude, one can't help but roll their eyes at the absurdity. Lars von Trier makes no distinction on why this comes to pass, other than a heady, albeit valid, dogma which is hammered into the head of viewers and then finally explained to death in the final chapter of the film. "Dogville" is the stuff that Greek plays are made of, and illustrates quite effectively why storytellers have long-since abandoned this structure of story: It's ultimately unsatisfying. "Dogville" becomes even more worthless when one realizes that the writer/director hasn't really said anything genuinely new or complex about human nature, but rather repeats the old theme of complete human fallibility that has been illustrated time and again, and often in a much more expert and less pretentious fashion than "Dogville".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Platonic searches require universals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plato led an indefatigable search for the meaning of "goodness." The joy of art's character is to reveal meaning with more than ideas and words. Here in this extraordinary picture is what von Trier manages to accomplish. Reminiscent of cinematic stagings of films such as "Our Town," and "Come Back to the Five and Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean," "Dogville" is realized with exceptional clarity and artistry, one that brings new dimension to this genre.Notwithstanding, in the previous 247 comments there appears to be a need to ascribe the incontestable universal theme found in this film to America alone. Though it is not incorrect to do so, it can be conceived as somewhat "arrogant" (to use an oft repeated word from the film). Yes...hypocrisy, superstition, and greed is a prevalent motif throughout -- themes that have been explored through American cinema for decades -- and World cinema for that matter because nearly every country has explored those precise human traits.It is clear that von Trier is brilliant in his capacity to ply his skill so well as to create a resonant piece of art among diverse individuals. What is "arrogant" of non-Americans (or of LVT himself) is to solely ascribe the motif to America. But what is "arrogant" of Americans is to deny that small mindedness continues to eat away at the heart of the land like a worm - and instead, prefer to whimper, "Petty behavior and greedy acts exist in every country not just America." As though saying that others are likewise makes an act less repugnant.All that has been said is possibly true..but all of it misses the mark. Either the film will provoke one to think more deeply about lines drawn on goodness or it will not. We can spend hours talking about illustrations of indignations perpetrated by the human race (American or otherwise). Or we can begin to think about our own actions and prejudices. The best art will do that. Whether the artist intended to parody or point a finger or not, it simply does not matter because the art will speak or it will not. Here are words spoken in The Thin Red Line -- words from the "enemy" that continue to ring in my ears whenever I arrogantly draw my lines.."Are you righteous? Kind? Does your confidence lie in this? Are you loved by all? Know that I was too. Do you imagine your sufferings will be less...because you loved goodness? Truth?"</fullReview>

She tries to integrate into their society and mentions the importance of forgiveness several times during her trials. When she meets with her father in the limo, she confronts his Old Testament vengeful-wrath approach with arguments of understanding and forgiveness. We have Moses the dog and parting clouds rather than a parting sea. Of course this story does not follow the complete Bible line and the daughter is surely not the Son of the New Testament. The length almost lost me until the scene in the limo which brought some meaning to the many earlier dreary events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Dogville," Lars von Trier treats viewers to yet another tale of an angelic innocent degraded, despoiled, and otherwise victimized by those around her and the circumstances in which she is placed, although in this case the innocent ends up having teeth. With the earlier, similar works "Breaking the Waves" (1996) and "Dancer in the Dark" (2000), and to a lesser extent "The Idiots" (1998), one can only hope that this is the final chapter in this theme with which von Trier appears to be obsessed. Frankly, it has become tiresome.Perhaps dissatisfied with the vagaries that can arise from his self-imposed Dogme 95 rules when shooting outdoors, von Trier enters a Brechtian phase with "Dogville," choosing to shoot it as a play with minimalist sets. To some extent, they remind me of the similarly simple yet evocative sets the Japanese/Irish-American artist Isamu Noguchi made for the dancer Martha Graham who was active during the time period of this film, the 1930s. And I think this was a wise choice, certainly as it helps minimize the technical gaffs that are part and parcel of von Trier's Dogme years, although there are still more than a few here: the editing is sloppy (unless von Trier believes that jump-cutting is still artsy cool) and continuity errors abound. However, these are small complaints about an otherwise well-crafted work. The large ensemble cast performs well for the most part. I found the performances of Ben Gazzara and Stellan Skarsgard particularly notable, and somehow von Trier was able to make the always-annoying Jeremy Davies refrain from his ubiquitous twitches and idiosyncratic hand movements. Now _that's_ directorial genius. John Hurt's voice-over narration was also spot on. I did not find the length of the film burdensome; I never lost interest in the story as it progressed. Most of all, I was surprised to find that I wasn't put off by the film as I have been with most of von Trier's works.From a political standpoint, I didn't find "Dogville" to be particularly anti-American as some have claimed, certainly no more so than Sam Peckinpah's "Straw Dogs" (1971) can be said to be anti-English, or Guy de Maupassant's depiction in some of his stories of some particularly loathsome rural villagers can be said to be anti-French. I think the theme of small-minded cruelty arising from ignorant parochialism can be considered universal. As for the sequence of still photographs of dire poverty flashed during the closing credits, with David Bowie singing "Young Americans" in the background, many of those shots (perhaps most of them) were taken during the Great Depression during which the film is set, and the Depression affected the entire world. And if, for the sake of argument, it was von Trier's intention to be 'anti-American,' then he has impaled himself on his own sword. At the end of the film, who sits in final judgment of the residents of Dogville? Those with the guns; i.e., those with the military power. If the USA is indeed the world's sole superpower, is von Trier then saying that it has the right to sit in judgment of the rest of the world? I should hope not! Nonetheless, I can see how America with its element of social Darwinism might seem a scary place to anyone born into, reared in, and (as far as I know) continues to live in a cradle-to-grave welfare state as is the case with von Trier, particularly since he has never lived in nor even visited the USA. But consider the following thought experiment: if one were to visit the capital of each of the world's nations, which embassy would most likely have the greatest number of applicants for visas to move to that embassy's country? Here's a hint -- it wouldn't be Denmark's. Rating: 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched Dogville and I was shocked. The movie is a real masterpiece. And it makes it more disgusting. It is full of hatred and contempt to Americans, or may be to the humanity. I am sure that an artist must be responsible for what he is doing and Lars Von Trier is not. This film carries fascist's ideology. It tells us: Look, these people are stupid, they are cruel, they are cowards... they are not worth living. This film is dangerous because it is of good quality but it poisons the spectator with contempt and hatred to the people. Let as hate not people but the cruelty, the stupidness, the cowardice, the meanness. Believe me I was not sure if the author really meant that, but when I saw the photo gallery at the end -- the photos of poor Americans, dirty-faced children, drunkards I understood it clearly. It was not Grace decision to execute Dogville -- it was Lars Von Trier's revenge, his verdict, his hatred. But, to tell the truth I am thankful. Because this film made me to revise my attitude to people. And I saw that I suffer the same contempt and the same anger. But we must not let it go! It's too easy to hate... Best regards!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure Good draws the Shadow to it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grace does not exist in a state of grace, but rejects the evil which is her legacy (her right of inheritance of power from her gangster father). She is the mythic transformational stranger who arrives on the scene -- we expect her to be a catalyst. However she denies her Shadow (the evil in herself) and the Shadow of the townsfolk by being all good and all forgiving, respectively. Thus she draws out the evil all too ready to emerge from the townsfolk. With repression, without consciousness of their Shadows, their evils overwhelm them, transforming the townsfolk into arrogant evil doers. It is as though in the Christian story Christ's goodness and forgiveness transformed his opponents and attracted his persecution. Her stance is an arrogant one, as explicated in the dialog between Grace and her father. Likewise, the townsfolk are arrogant in their denial of their Shadows and the projection of their Shadows on to Grace. The final scene leaves the protagonists acting out their evil: the arrogance of pure evil (without mercy) is no better than the arrogance of pure good. Only the audience has the consciousness which can contain the tragedy of both.This film has a mythological flavor, like a Greek tragedy, like von Trier's earlier Medea, hence the archetypal, non-complex nature of the characters and the directing, the minimalist staging, and the narration, which is comic in its fairy-tale just-so style interspersed with choric comments on the tragedy, but in the same style.

		<fullReview>One has to admire Lars Von Trier for taking risks with his work. Anyone can make a crowd pleaser like Jerry Bruckheimer, but that wasn't even von Trier's intention with Dogville. One can tell that this movie was made more as a statement than as entertainment. It falls into a genre all its own.People have said that the movie is insulting, minimalistic, and anti-American. They would be correct on all accounts. Von Trier takes no pains to hide his disdain for America, a country he has never visited. However, let's not dwell on this peculiarity, because Dogville is not about America alone, but rather about all of humanity, with a special emphasis on America. Really, the anti-Americanism did not affect me in the least. It is an art form and his freedom as an artist should let him say whatever he would like. Thus, I will not comment on the political statements of the movie, but rather von Trier's general style of movie-making in general. There was one very very big problem I had with this film and that was the screenplay. It was overt, lacking subtlety, and one hour too long. Von Trier takes us all to be idiots and feels that he needs to point out every single symbol, every single nuance he places into the movie. It is as if he feels that he needs to point out exactly how clever he is, because we as an audience are too stupid to recognize it on our own. For example, the symbolism with the apples in the truck and the apple orcards... anyone with higher than high-school English could figure out what those apples represented but von Trier decided to have his third part omniscient narrator blatantly spoon-feed it to us. I like movies that make you think, that are left open to debate. Dogville, instead is a movie, where there is no room for interpretation because everything has been spelled out for you. For lack of better words, it is an intellectual movie for non-intellectuals.The script was wooden in that he chose dialogue that no one in real life would ever say. It was completely unrealistic. But then again, the movie is supposed to be a parable. Are parables supposed to convey any form of realism or can they be tongue-firmly-planted-in-cheek? I don't understand why everyone is doting on the outstanding acting in this movie when all the principal actors (Kidman, Bettany, Bacall, Skarsgard, and Sevigny) have all been better in other movies. The problem is that all these actors had very wooden dialogue to work with and thus, came off being really wooden.With all that said, I must point out that the minimalist set was genius. I loved it. After the first half hour, you totally forgot that you were watching everything on a sound stage. The no walls choice was particularly effective in the first rape scene as everyone watched and continued their daily chores. Secondly, the lighting was amazing since you could barely tell that everything was inside given the realism of daylight and nighttime. And finally, the ending scene is mind-blowingly fantastic. That scene alone makes me give this movie a 7/10. Trust me, it would have been a lot lower had it not been for the superb conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogmatic satire of "Our Town"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dogville"is a dogmatic satire of "Our Town" done like Brecht's "Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny." But where Brecht employed gangster imagery to attack capitalism and corruption as an outgrowth of the inevitable "greed is good" tendencies within cruel human nature, Lars Von Trier seems to think that it is American democratic capitalism that is intrinsically evil and violent. His fictional Rocky Mountain town is as off-kilter as his lost in translation view of American industry in "Dancer in the Dark." One indication of his European-bent view is that the central counterpoint in town to Nicole Kidman's lovely, fragile abused stranger, of course named "Grace," is a resident ineffectual, hypocritical intellectual liberal named "Tom Edison," played earnestly and thereby ironically cruel by Paul Bettany -- a Shavian, European type that is simply not present in American literature, and barely in films other than maybe nobly in "To Kill A Mockingbird," let alone in real small towns, to be satirized like this. Evidently Von Trier hasn't read Sinclair Lewis, let alone Mark Twain, who were puncturing the tyranny of American town meetings a long time before he was. While the step-by-step transformations were carefully built up to through the three hours to reveal the ugly character truths, as the bullying and exploitation piled up, I tuned out so missed some of the stilted dialogue that the excellent cast really tries to bring to life, especially James Caan, until the revengeful conclusion that was more Carrie than Pirate Jenny. Judging by his concluding photo montage of American economic and military atrocities shown to the tune of David Bowie's "Young Americans," that was reminiscent of the ending that Spike Lee tacked on to "Malcolm X" just in order to make a longer movie that year than Oliver Stone, Von Trier must think that "Lord of the Flies" was only a criticism of English boarding schools. Pick a decade or a century or a continent and human physical and economic debasements have taken place anywhere in the world, and have been evoked by artists through millennia. Von Trier only sees one Great Satan.</fullReview>

I couldn't finish it because I fell asleep all the time. Really dull, slow and at times a bit ridiculous. For example when someone knocks on a door which is not actually there, and they add a knocking-sound to it. Being all grown up I only have so much imagination, I'm sad to say.

		<shortDescription>An incredibly important film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't already know, the interesting thing about Dogville is that there are no real sets. It all takes place in a theatre where the individual houses in the village of marked out with chalk and labelled, and there are even boxes with "Dog" or "Gooseberry Bushes" written on them -- the only things that appear are generally props which are actually used in the film. From a practical, film-making point of view this means that von Trier can show whats going on in all the houses at any time, and also he can show the whole town and all the people from overhead, as if some great god was looking down on them, which is a device he uses several times.Many people presume that Von Trier was attempting to make the film something like a play, but I definitely felt that he is more blurring the line between a film and a book. Tarantino attempted the same thing with "Kill Bill", but not to this visionary extent. This film is also divided into chapters, but he takes it further by including summaries of the events as a novelist might, and it also has a narrative throughout that sounds an awful lot like writing from a literary novel. The fact that there are no sets also makes it a lot like reading a book, in that you have to use your imagination. If a writer failed to describe the buildings of a town in a book, your imagination might conjure up something that looks like Dogville.What I'm trying to explain is that I feel this is something more than just a clever gimmick, it is a device of some importance and hopefully other artists will take inspiration from von Trier's vision. But this is not something inherent in the writing of the film -- it could just as easily have been filmed in a conventional way, with actual sets and all, and it still would have been worth watching.And so, onto the film itself. It is a heavily philosophical piece of work, and the writing and the dialogue is very strong throughout. I felt somewhat let down by the ending, but I won't give too much away there. This is not an easy film to watch, but hardly anything that is shown is gratituous -- von Trier doesn't linger on anything, in fact, for longer than is necessary. It also seems that the fact that the actors have to use their imagination more than usual has definitely brought out the best in them. The two leads, Kidman and Bettany, are both excellent in their roles, as is the entire supporting cast.It's a film you should see if you're interesting in it as a form of art, and I'm sure in time it'll be shown on pretty much any self-respecting film course. As far as people who watch films solely for entertainment go, I'm not sure how much you'll like it. Not because there are no sets, as you practically forget this after about an hour has gone in the same way you imagine what isn't there when watching a stageplay, but because of the harshness of the story itself. I only hope that it can be appreciated, and that a general audience of Nicole Kidman fans when it's released in US theatres doesn't reduce the film's rating too much.</fullReview>

The story is straightforward to follow, quite gripping, and has a very satisfying twist at the end - which I don't think anyone on these pages has given away.The chalk-line set is not just a gimmick, but justified by the storyline, which is all about seeing people as they really are. A kind of Lord of the Flies.Nicole Kidman is brilliant as usual - though looking painfully thin - and it was nice to see James Caan again. John Hurt's voiceover is detailed and helpful. It's a shame that, at least in the UK, the film has been given such a limited release that few will make the effort to see it - an effort that would be well repaid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Dogville' (Lars von Trier, 2004)Only a director like von Trier could have pulled this off: a Brechtian experiment with an A-list cast. For the most part the film is a winner, although it does get lost somewhere toward the end.This film is far from perfect, and certainly won't appeal to all tastes. Those who give it a chance will be surprised and leave the cinema thinking. Surely a rare feat in the age of the digital blockbuster?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First half hour I thought this movie was gonna irritate me, but I was also very curious about the story. Now I saw the movie and it shows me how people can act to each other. Not a happy thought although. Selfish people, sexual frustrated, unbelief to fair people and protection to each other in a "not fair way". Great to see Nicole Kidman play. I think I know why Lars von Trier choose her to play this character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What Von Trier does better than anybody at the moment is to make you believe what you shouldn't believe in. Be it a musical or a protagonist that looks right at the camera, he creates the truth within untrue circumstances. Here, he makes us believe in a community when all we see is a black stage and chalklines. And the way he does all this is through his supremely structured narrative. Ten minutes into the film, you forget there are no walls, no buildings, no horizons. You believe in the people and you see what is not there. Kidman delivers another flawless performance as the girl on the run. But it is Von Trier who deserves the praise for taking Cinema into the 21st century like no other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogma Meets The Mystery Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A knowing, assured movie in postmodern-renaissance mode, where wordsmith director and character actors form a group of players to deliver an edifying, moralising tale to groundling audiences. Clever narration and self-referencing asides ensure that the suspension of disbelief is polar: we engage with the characters, we disengage, we think, and the cycle continues through the chapters of the film. Literature students should burn their New Wave playwrights and study this. So what can be said to convince sceptics to see this film, besides the acting, which nearly all reviewers (even the naysayers) applaud? First of all, small town observation to rival Ibsen, Harper Lee, Hugo Claus and Dylan Thomas. Second, a celebration of the English language's preponderance for homespun philosophising and absurd musings - I haven't heard actors speak their lines with such relish since 'Quills'. Third, a refreshing take on the kind of sentimental abuse-revenge narrative we have learned to hate since Sergio Leone was co-opted by Van Damme. Stylistic criticisms have been amply covered by other reviews of the film. Naturalistic objections will no doubt plague viewers in the opening minutes: lush, virtuoso trompe l'oeil cinema this ain't, nor is it the kind of cinema verité we've come to expect from Dogma. Yet the intimacy of theatre and John Hurt's wry, avuncular narrator wins us over. The stage provides an unintrusive structure for big emotions, dialogue-focus and universalism. The minimalist decor, lighting and significant props (kitsch figurines, makeshift manacles) are worked into a deliberately contrived narrative. Most of all, so little of this 3-hour film is extraneous (with perhaps a few exceptional in-jokes - the Latin on the mine entrance for one, or the Ellis Island photo album to David Bowie's 'Young Americans' during the closing credits).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sincere and honest toward mankind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years ago, after watching The Idiots of Lars Von Trier, I promised myself that I'm not going to watch his other movies ever again. I could hardly watch The Idiots because of its cruelty which is not simply from blood or slash stuff. I was distressed mentally over the film. However, two years later, I came to watch Dogville, (I broke my promise..) and became to love Lars Von Trier.Dogville is also very hard and harsh to watch as I imagined. very inhumane. At the very beginning of the movie, I thought it is silly of the movie due to its background settings. Everything is set up as if I am watching a play. Audiences can see everything obviously through the emptiness. There's no blocked, structured buildings, but only chalk lines explain here is a house. I felt like I am walking through a barren woods where twiggy trees have no leaves. I wondered what could happen at this place in which every single step and breath is shown transparently. The settings even seemed cute to me. However, after Dogville started, I mean, from the start to the end, I became speechless about the genius director and brilliant set which is highly important to carry out the movie's theme. Sound effects or realistic location is unnecessary when it comes to Dogville. What Dogville wants to show is 'human beings' themselves, not other things. It is hard to focus on people in the jungle with abundant leaves and trees. But, it would be much easier among naked trees. I got attracted to the director's brightness and originality even from a set.Dogville concentrated on human kinds, and reveals them. Grace sneak about Dogville with a secret, and Tom, who calls himself a philosopher but actually got only hypocrisy, decided to make Grace as a good illustration for his theory. From the first, Tom considered her as his 'tool' in order to realize his ideal and empty thought. He only thinks that Grace is a kind of material to make him different from others. Other villagers, at first, did not care much about her. Grace started to help them with thinking that they will open their mind to her someday. And bit by bit, the dwellers got to realize that she is helpful, and they let her live in the village. The people of Dogville did take her not because of humanity nor morality. Every person in the town saw a convenient tool in Grace. When the wanted paper of Grace was attached in Dogville, people found that they got higher positions and more powers than Grace. The village people became to treat her as if she is a slave, and they showed their ugly aspects as it is. Tom kept saying that he will save her from the village, but what he said was nothing but a wordy show. The only person called an intellectual in Dogville couldn't take an action, and he just put Grace into more terrible situations. For Tom, Grace was a practical example that he is actually a hypocrite same as others.Grace believed that forgiveness and goodness can change the world in a different way, not like a gangsters' society based on power and fights. Still, the harder she tried to help and forgive people, the more they showed their hideous desires and selfishness. She finally realized that it was very arrogant to say that she would be superior to others if she sacrifices. Therefore, she punished Dogville. killed everyone, burned it. She especially killed Tom by herself. He was too arrogant to let him killed by other hands. And, the dog Moses survived, who is the most superior creature in Dogville. (Isn't it very meaningful?)The movie Dogville describes ugly and passive nature of human so well. Human is not the one who 'thinks' and 'acts' by morality, but his only concern is life covered with desires. The reason why this movie is so persuasive is because the town Dogville could be found in everywhere surrounding us in real. It is easy to observe a number of inhumanity and evil deeds in this world. People do not hesitate to beat others if they have much power. The world is more like a movie than a movie is. Therefore, the empty set of Dogville is getting to be filled with this real society while the movie goes. I've been thinking why Dogville makes people including me uncomfortable and appalled. And I guess that's because the character Tom is quite similar to them. Seemingly, look moral and good, but inside, ugly and wicked. And all is killed in the film.It will be interesting to see this movie in terms of religion and Christianity. Is Grace depicted as Jesus here? What about mankind? Is the end of the movie parallel to the Last Judgement?Anyway, Dogville is an amazing movie for me. I might have to take a look on more works of Lars Von Trier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story is a powerful reflection of the abjection of the human being and spirit. The theatrical minimalist approach made the story even more compelling by attracting the spectator towards the story and not towards the setting or the cinematography.It is one of the best performances by Nicole Kidman, which I consider a merit mostly of the director, who forces her out of her comfort zone as an actress to portray a vulnerable not so innocent woman. All the actors are great in their roles, although is the script what mesmerizes the spectator.Von Trier took many risks here, those that will not satisfy lazy watchers or people who just want to watch a movie without any depth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Theatre and cinema together to create an amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen something so nice for long time, shame on me I just saw this movie. The story is divided in nine chapters and takes place on a stage with minimalist scenery, with chalk marks to indicate walls, streets and even a dog drawn on the floor. It seems to be at the theatre but sitting on the stage, you can feel the actors' breathes. The story narrated by Lars Von Trier is so terrible and so true about human behaviour, about our weakness and contradictions. He succeeded again. The main character is performed by Nicole Kidman and she is perfect for that role, cold but sweet, mysterious but deep at the same time. Grace comes to Dogville while running away from gangsters, the entire community of fifteen people is aware of it and decides to give her the chance to stay there if she proves to be a trustful person. Then starts the weakness of the human nature, power turns people into jackals. Each character, stereotype of a small town character, threaten her to exploit her more and more, worse and worse. The town turns into a prison and she tries to run away from it, being disappointed and humiliated again. A political-religious allegory remains under wraps for most of the film but it comes out in the closing credits in a juxtaposition of David Bowie's Young Americans accompanied by a montage of photographic images. By the end, the victim takes the power and use it against everyone, forgets her rules and ethic to punish. You feel it's right, you feel redeemed, relieved, you want to take the power and punish. It's amazing, you think the way Von Trier thinks and he that's his success. I really enjoyed the movie but I do love very long movie, for someone can be a bit too long but try to keep watching until the end. It's worth of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville or the darkest side of human beings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is an experiment. Lars Von Trier didn't have the idea of setting the action on a stage from the beginning but did so due to budget reasons. We won't ever know how Dogville would have been in a realistic frame. But we do know how this Dogville penetrates slowly inside you and ends up as a devastating outbreak. At the beginning of the film, the viewer has some difficulties to get into the plot and forget the fact that this is not a conventional film. Past 20 minutes, if you have been patient enough, you'll probably have understood the game Von Trier is proposing to you. The plot seems harmless and kinda boring but little by little, the actions turn out to be hard, cruel and difficult to watch. Dogville is no land for heroes or good souls. Dogville is a place where people are ready to whatever to get what they want. And this reality is like a punch in your stomach. The cast is incredible in their far-from-hero roles. I admire Nicole Kidman for having led this weird project, very different from what the industry of Hollywood offers and something that could ruin the career of a famous actress. Some American critics and users have rejected this film as it's supposed to be Lars Von Trier's view of America. Let the political be the global and get ready to face the most disgusting side of human beings. If you know how to enter the game, you won't regret it. Or maybe you will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sublime Nicole Kidman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A mysterious film in which everything is upside down. No setting really, in fact a nearly empty stage like in a minimalist dramatic production in some avant-garde theater. The only originality is that the camera can look down upon the stage from a higher position, which an audience cannot do. Of course too the camera can move around the stage. This is supposed to express a society that is upside down and besieged due to the depression. Depression in all directions: the mine is closed, there is no work for anyone, survival is the fundamental rule, autarky is the objective of everyday life. But that is not all. A female fugitive arrives one day in this dead mining community in the mountains preceded by the sound of gunshots and followed by a car that looks like a gangster's car, and it is. Yet the girl is hidden at first, then accepted, and then things turn sour. The film is about this slow transformation and revelation that human nature is not to be trusted. The girl is given some tasks in a friendly manner at first, and then little by little these tasks become an obligation that everyone expects. Thus the girl is transformed into a domestic slave. The next stage will be the progressive use of her body by all the men and the total hatred the women will feel and express for her. From being morally enslaved she will become physically enslaved with a chain and a flywheel attached to the chain itself attached to a metal collar. She becomes some kind of bitch or dog used by the villagers for their chores and impulses. The young would-be writer who protected her at first and declared is love at the beginning is also transformed from a rather kind and loving young man into a traitor who accuses her of a theft he had done himself, for her to escape it's true, but himself with his own hands. Then he will little by little consider her as an obstacle between himself and the village, hence an obstacle on his road of laziness and comfort. He will in the end call the gangsters to come and get her out of the village. On that level, simple people in a simple community hit by the depression, the least we can say is that good intentions and civilization are very superficial and very short-lived. But the worst is still to come. The gangsters come back of course. The girl is the daughter of the boss of the gang, and he gives her the responsibility, if she wants to come back with him out of this hell, to give the order to shoot everyone and burn the village down. And she will demonstrate a tremendous level of arrogance, condescension and cold hatred that was unimaginable before. For the details go to the film and she will be the one who executes, shoots the handsome would-be writer. "There are a few things you have to do yourself," will she conclude. That frozen inhumanity is beyond all limits. The film thus becomes a demonstration of what human beings can become in extreme conditions. If they can be that rude, brutal, cruel in a situation that has nothing to do with a war, you can imagine what they are ready to do to survive in a situation where life and death are a daily stake. The survival instinct is the strongest motivation for any individual, any group or community and even the human species as a whole. Humane attitudes are in no way natural. So, if you push aside the varnish of good behavior, you find out that many people are bullies when necessary in extreme conditions, even if only a few, and even few of them would be bullies in normal conditions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a cautionary tale about human nature -- how a few "good people" turn from being a woman's protector into her tormentor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in a small village in the Rockies in the 1920s or 30s this is not a typical western with spectacular scenery and exciting action. The silver mine at the edge of town is abandoned and all that is left are fifteen adults and a few children. Dogville is about them and Grace, the young woman who comes to their town seeking refuge from gangsters in a nearby town. It is a cautionary tale about human nature -- how these "good people" turn from being Grace's protector into her tormentor.Dogville opens with a high overhead shot. At first it seems you are looking at a board game then, as the camera zooms in, it becomes apparent that you are looking at a stage setting -- a minimalist set where the audience is forced to focus on the actors. Rather than acts, the work is divided into chapters like a novel; just short of three hours, it is a long novel. If one is able to enjoy this film, one must wait for human nature to change at its own slow pace.The stellar cast includes Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Paul Bettany, Blair Brown, Ben Gazzara, James Caan, Phillip Baker Hall, Stellan Skarsg?rd, Chloë Sevigny, and is narrated by John Hurt. All perform well. Young Miles Purinton also does an excellent job as a perverse preteen. Bettany plays Tom Edison in the pivotal role as town philosopher. It is Tom who discovers Grace and persuades the residents of Dogville to allow her to live amongst them to prove that they are able to accept her as a gift despite any obstacles that occur from themselves or outsiders.In the end fear prevents the people of Dogville from accepting the gift of Grace's love, good cheer, good sense, and willingness to perform hard labor to assist them -- fear of acceptance, commitment, and the fear of unknown consequences for aiding a woman wanted wrongly by the law. The film may be seen as an allegory for any type of discrimination and its consequences.</fullReview>

I cant forget that lonely night in my room at 2:00 am when i see "Dogville" for first time. Undoubtedly that will never forget itThe story talks about Grace. A woman that needs hide of her dad, a man from the mafia. She founds Dogville, a " quiet little town no far from here" and meet a man who help her. But the town don't think like him, so Grace decides win the love of the town doing favors and working for them. But the town began to take advantage of her in horrible ways. But... well, Grace..."Dogvile" is an excellent catching film, the plot never let you go . I read a movie's magazine from Colombia called "Kinetoscopio" and there, i read little interesting thing about this movie. The movie was very rejected by many critics here in Colombia (and i think in the world too). After all, the critic matters? The critics matters? This critic matters?. You can read it, of course, but like the writer of the article in that magazine says, the objective of critic is not so it well understood. So, many movies can be rejected for many of famous critics, for example one critic says that "Sal? or the 120 days of Sodom" of Pier Paolo Pasolini was a bad movie. But, just because a critic say the movie that i see is bad i too had to say is bad? You know that don't. But, many of us let us take by critics that say "The Lemon Sisters" stinks when i think that rules. But... be carefully, after all, the critic has a good function to prevent. Are films that i hate like "Cannibal Holocaust". You can read good reviews about this title and then see it... surprise! a disgusting surprise. For that reason we should not trust in the act of any critic that we see. When you see movie you take risks. I think that "Cannibal Holocaust" will be great... well, i was so wrong... that is the most disgusting and inhuman film of all. Only for sick people. And why happen to me? Because i read critics that say that is good and i don't read the other critics that say that title was bad. And now... how can you trust me than "Dogville" is a must see film. Well... for the message.The message of "Dogville" is about us. The human being. We are simple. We can live good and simple. But the ambition and hate can make that us make mistakes. I think that "Dogville" is a portrait of the daily life. We see people that they take advantage of us, or we take advantage of them. So, is "Dogville" the us that many times are and we don't accept. See this movie... then you find the answer... and believe me... you never going to forget it. *Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any</fullReview>

She is on the run from the big city gangsters and seeks refuge in the small town of dogville, were she is very well received at the beginning, but dogville shows it's claws eventually and the towns behavior to grace gradually get's more and more ridiculous, all into it get's sad and criminal.The movie is so well written and directed that you don't pay any attention to the missing set. The fact that the "set" is only a floor with white paint on it is amazing. No American could ever have made such a movie. This is really Dogme film at it's finest.

		<shortDescription>A Film Far From Appealing To A Mass Audience, One Of The Strangest Film Structures Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is very different to most films you will see and the fact is it is not afraid to be that way. Dogville is intriguing, disturbing, depressing and hypnotic. This image of a town that resembles next to nothing and is left for the viewer to imagine is one that is original or as some might put it "pretenious". Of course on the outside Dogville seems a very nice place, full of kind people and that's all it is on the outside.You see the idea of the audience have to watch a half made set piece may be strange, but it shows the fact that in this tiny town nobody can hide away their secrets. Everybody has to be kind on the outside to hide their evil and sorrow that has been dwelling inside themselves. You see nothing is quite what it seems in this twisting story. Nothing happens until the very last minute, I found myself gripped with suspense from start to finish.Nicole Kidman manages to give a spellbinding performance as Grace the kind hearted lady who is running from the modern life. She wants to find something better for herself and ends up finding that really anywhere you go people are not as pure as they first seemed and rather fuelled by greed and corruption. Nicole Kidman gives a vivid and detailed performance, easily her best in years and she has been cast perfectly.You've also got the classic actors such as James Caan who believe it or not plays a gangster. You could say that was slightly "type cast", but he actually manages to pull off his performance with a great ease and you forget the fact he has played similar characters in the past. So once again James Caan proves a talent that reminisces the almighty performance of Sonny Corleone back in 1972. Paul Bettany also gives a career changing role as the town's "leader" and pulls it off with great attitude and intensity.Dogville is a lot of like a bitter poem or a fable showing the ills of society. Some have even said it's Lars von Trier's Anti-American movie, but that's up for the viewer to decide. I can be certain though that the film is brutally honest at depicting the downfalls of society and the dark side of human nature. Not only is Dogville a film that mystifies the viewer it manages to change from being a charming film to a dark tale of the ills of society.The film is separated into sections which perfectly underline the change from the problems facing this women. Dogville is a very brave piece of contemporary cinema because it is not afraid to be controversial. The film echoes revenge, lust, anger and sexual deprivation. There is a underlining sexual tension that weaves through the movie. Dogville is very slow paced, but perfectly fitting for a film of it's kind. The film is a work of art, I have never before seen a film where I felt as though I was sitting in a theatre (The film relies on a basic set-piece) and watching actors act. The illustration is one that is nothing like what I've seen on screen before and mixes so much emotional complexity that it makes room for repeat viewings.The film feels very un-edited through this style of direction and the beautiful imagery such as when Nicole Kidman lies in the truck by the apples is one of the few different styled scenes. The movie follows a pattern and sticks out, the narration that plays throughout the film adds a feeling as if you are listening to a story tape and comes to a very strange un-nerving kind of effect. The voice is very "storylike" and provides a detailed analysis of each character who are all really the same people on the inside. Dogville is a film that will make you think, it is intelligent and thoughtful and constructed in a way that demands the viewer to keep their eyes glued to the screen.I doubt you'll ever see a film that's quite the same and that is what makes it one of the most creative and original works of art in recent years. A masterpiece in my eyes.</fullReview>

Final was blood-freezing hard and full with all sensations with a human can feel, you can be angry, sad, happy etc about last scenes.Of course this is the opinion of the director, but (I think) movie business is about entertaining the people. Not to bore them. Movies may be didactic OK but if your main (only) purpose is teaching people about something you can't find them in your movie next time.

		<fullReview>I'm writing this review to make amends for the merciless trashing I gave elsewhere on the "Internets" to Lars von Trier's "Dancer In The Dark", which I still consider perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Needless to say, I was reluctant to watch another of his movies. However, I like a bit of everything and had to try "Dogville" based largely on its high IMDb rating. When it was over I walked around the house for several minutes trying to deal with the fact that I had just witnessed a fantastic (9/10) Lars von Trier movie!Unlike some others who have reviewed this movie, I apparently became absorbed in the writing and performance of this film and was not taken aback by the purposely awkward setting and editing. If you haven't read it yet elsewhere, "Dogville" is set entirely on a stage--though the stage would probably be a bit too large for most "live" performance venues. (I spent some time thinking about things that would have to be changed in this film in order for it to be performed live. Although I watch about 150 movies a year on DVD, I go to live theatre performances several times more often than I go to a movie theater.)If you watch this movie to the end, you will undoubtedly find parts of it a bit "over the top". However, as any intelligent kid who grew up in a small town (writer included) can tell you, it isn't as far over the top as some might claim. If you appreciate live performances of edgy stories, I believe you'll like this film and be thinking about it long after it's over. If you don't have the imagination for that, you will quickly get bored.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's the "dog"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a brilliant film which I can only imagine has come from an even more brilliant novel. Dogville shows a wide display of human emotions and capabilities. Moods change from fear to love, to contempt, to hatred, and finally into a state of incompassion which reaches beyond human nature. Or does it? What Dogville so accurately chronicles is the capability of mankind under certain situations to be cruel, without empathy. These same feelings of hatred, when combined with feelings of inferiority and superiority, create relationships like history has displayed through slavery and hate crimes, the side of human nature that we don't want to see.Dogville is told in a simplistic "story book" fashion which parallels a fable or more accurately....a parable. Countless morals are revealed, some open and easy to interpret, while others are harder to understand. But it is surprisingly difficult to view much of this film. It sickens me to my stomach to see humans act this way, but they are not beyond our capability. The thing to think about in the end is whether Grace gave into the hatred, reverted to her human nature, played God, or simply taught the world a lesson. A lesson that she had just, in fact, learned herself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too critical of Humanity for Humanity to Praise?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was my expectation when I started to read the reviews here. So I was startled to see such a high overall rating for a film that moves at the pace of an arthritic slug and which ultimately paints such a bleak picture of human nature. Did we learn something here about exploiting the apparently downtrodden and innocent? Or was it like bad sex you still got off on, ultimately satisfying enough that you kind of forgot all that you had to go through to get there?After you get over being fascinated by and adjusted to the innovative minimalist set (ultimately part of the problem, since there is little variety on screen), this IS frequently an excruciatingly plodding, yes boring film. The townspeople's attitudes and behavior must evolve, but do they have to evolve at what seems at times like the same rate that species evolve new physical characteristics? Arggh! I appreciate deliberate plot development, and my perceptual system has a hard time with the now common flash-cut music videos and movie promos (when they start giving me a headache - usually after about twenty seconds - I just shut my eyes), but here I'm on the side of those spoiled by fast-moving action films and video games, whom I imagine find most of this film little short of sheer torture! It does finally pay off with a meaningful ending, sort of like most of the original Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents shows. You find yourself periodically muttering to the director, as if he's there beside you holding your popcorn, "why are you doing this to me?" until, after what seems like an eternity and a half...A Scandinavian shut-in during the long cold northern European winter might find this movie better than spending the time listening to the wind whistle over the semi-perma-frost. The rest of us, with the possible exception of a few drama majors, would be better off working out on the treadmill and making arrangements for that overdue root canal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what Europe thinks of the US?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Questions for Mr von Trier? Are we, the people of the United States, xenophobic, mobbish, and brutal - like the inhabitants of Dogville? Do we present one face, then reveal a ghastly other. Do we behave abhorrently in the face of fear? Do we build cases for punishment based on manufactured evidence? Is America Dogville? And Americans, dogs?Mr. von Trier may think so. And he also thinks we should get ours in the end. That is if you choose to view Dogville as an allegory to American arrogance. Which, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. It certainly isn't realistic as a straight fable. At least in its final half.Anyhow, in spite of its heavy-handedness (if he's bashing the US), or wrong-headedness (if he's telling a straight tale), it's still a cool movie, with more in common with "Death Wish III" than "Cold Mountain."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Essay on Arrogance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my reservations about "Dogville." I felt the audacious Von Trier had taken a step back with "Dancer in the Dark"--essentially a pretentious overwrought musical retread of his masterpiece "Breaking the Waves." And when I heard about the familiar plot (heroine endures increasingly grim hardships and becomes a martyr) and the chalk outlined sets and "minimalist" aesthetic he would be applying to "Dogville," I feared he might never again reach the earlier heights of his past films. He was retreading the same themes in new pretentious ways.But fear not, Von Trier delivered the goods in ways I had never suspected and for the first time in many moons showed some signs of growth thematically as a director (alas, the heroine does not become a martyr but instead gets her revenge). "Dogville" was unfairly dismissed by many as a filmed "play" because of the staged quality of its sets and cinematography. But for me, with its superb voice-overs that made the narrator seem as if he was reading excerpts from some lost classic of literature and its quaint chapter stops (this is a film told in nine chapters with a prologue as the sparse opening credit tells us) "Dogville" became a literary endeavor. And once you adapted to the strange visual style and the literary devices, you soon realized that Von Trier was here to provide us an "illustration" of a theme. Why are people afraid of accepting gifts? Why are people reluctant of outsiders? Why are people so arrogant in thinking that they can make the world a better place by some small or large deed, by some intervention or favor? These illustrations are brilliantly depicted in the anguish on the actors' faces as they play characters ravaged by arrogance and set on a path to impending doom because of their inability to see the error of their foolish, yet originally well intentioned, ways. Though it takes place in a small mountain town in Depression era America and the main character is a runaway mob moll (played devastatingly by Nicole Kidman) the illustration is both very timely and timeless. Is this film made by a notoriously arrogant European anti-American? You betcha! Will students of cinema debate its merits for decades to come? You bet your sweet bippy! Will I ever doubt Von Trier again? NEVER</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exploration of character development and actor choices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a well done movie with every inclusive minute as important as the next. Each chapter displayed character breakdown and motivations so that each town member transfers from the two dimensional world of naivety and innocence to the three dimensional world of human dynamics which include greed, lust, anger, rape, and violence. These character developments work for and against Grace, the main character, for the absolutely surprising and phenomenal ending. Lars Von Trier instigates the idea in this movie that natural tendencies of human beings do not preclude forgiveness. I think that the set of this movie brings forth these character studies as it is so aesthetically limited. Of course, the story is as well acted as it is written. One might not suspect at first that Nicole Kidman is the best choice for this role but her subtlety and beautifully innocent face and form provide exactly what the character "Grace" implies. It proves, once again, that her more indie-type explorations in film are satisfying. Her beauty does not absolutely limit her acting capabilities. And for a first time "American" accent, Paul Bettany does very well. Throughout the entirety of this film, one could hardly suspect his European (or United Kingdom) background. This is not a movie for people who do not wish to spend time contemplating or analyzing a movie. This piece of film making would fall victim to severe criticism if it wasn't viewed in this fashion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant filmmaking, but von Trier misses his mark a bit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant film, no doubt, although I think I prefer almost all of the other films I've seen by Lars von Trier. His work is always problematic, but he has such a mad genius that even something as questionable as Idiots (or, indeed, Dogville) succeeds even as it kind of fails. This is the story of a small town of little means in a remote area of the United States called Dogville. One day a young woman, Grace (Nicole Kidman), wanders in while being persued by gangsters. The townspeople are afraid of what might happen if they harbor her, but they like her and they decide to do so. But the thing is that they have something on her, and they own her. She depends on them, and they quickly begin taking advantage of her, and ruthlessly. She even tries to escape, but the town refuses to let go of its toy. It's a pessimistic and entirely misanthropic viewpoint, the cruelest situation that Lars von Trier has ever depicted (and that's saying something!), and I suspect that many will be sickened by it. To add injury to insult, the theme to which the director has been continually returning, the theme that upsets many, that of the suffering woman, is on full display here. Kidman is raped and later used as a sexual object, and the narrator of the film informs us that the men use her like a hillbilly uses a cow. After she tries to escape, she is fitted with a cowbell and tethered to a heavy wagon wheel.The purported anti-Americanism in the film is strange, to say the least. It reminds me a lot of the way Zhang's Hero ended. That film veers towards nationalism very near the end, and it really doesn't follow, like the director had to do it but had no real interest in doing it. I'm sure Lars von Trier did have interest, however misguided, in making Dogville into an anti-American statement, but it just doesn't work. The credits play over numerous pictures of poor and homeless Americans, with David Bowie's `Young American' playing. What has this at all to do with Dogville? The story is set in the USA, but the same observations about human nature could be made about any people in any part of the world. I suspect that only a few elements would need to be changed to set the film in Denmark and it would not ring any more or less true, depending on whether or not you buy the moral of the story. But it is most certainly anti-American, as was Lars von Trier's previous film, Dancer in the Dark. But like Dancer in the Dark, Lars von Trier's observations about America ring false. There are plenty of gripes to be had with the US, and it would be very easy to make much more potent works of art that explore its faults, but neither Dancer nor Dogville make very effective statements about America. I've yet to see a European film that said anything substantive about the country that I live in. Well, whether or not Lars von Trier has skewed his target, I would never suggest that he hasn't produced something original and interesting, and he has definitely produced a film that will inspire discussion for years to come, and that's always worthwhile. Dogville will be a big candidate for repeated viewings, as I probably didn't take it all in on one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slow to start, but intense and powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSEvery year at the Academy Awards, a few Oscars go to set design. The sets which are rewarded are normally lavish, fully recreated places where hundreds of extras roam around. With "Dogville" however, the set is the inside of a huge building. The town is created using chalk outlines (even the town Dog being a chalk mark), and people are visible in their houses constantly. This might sound disturbing and strange to viewers, but for some reason it actually works.In the film itself, we are introduced to Paul Bettany's Tom Edison. Tom is the Philosopher of the town and whilst looking for an example of giving and taking, he encounters beautiful stranger Grace (Nicole Kidman). Introducing Grace to the town, Tom convinces the townsfolk to keep Grace safe in return for occasional chores. Eventually however, the people of the town begin to get a bit extreme in their job suggestions."Dogville" is not a fast flowing film. It's actually so slow at the start that the first fifteen minutes feel more like ninety. Whilst the rest of the film might not be as slow as the start, it still doesn't move at any great speed, but this doesn't matter. Lars von Trier's film is an amazing art house style feature which is at times intense, at times deep, and almost always powerful. With beautiful performances by Kidman, Bettany, James Caan and the rest of the cast, von Trier has created a masterpiece. The way the camera moves without any fluidity adds to the effect, and at the same time, the way the walls surrounding the set change colour is beautiful.The greatest beauty of this film perhaps is that it demonstrates the love everyone involved has put into it and their fear of their director. Bettany was so scared of Lars von Trier's mind, that at night he would try to move his bed as far away from one wall, simply because he wanted to be as far away from von Trier's head as possible. Kidman too was forced to leave the screening at the Cannes Film Festival because of one scene of particular emotional brutality to her. The irony is that, despite these actors, and more, feeling terrified by their director, the majority have stated a desire to work with him again. Their reason is simply that this excentric Danish director is a genius. The way he orchestrates the order of the film, is magnificant and no-one else could pull this film off.In the scheme of things, there's no denying that "Dogville" is not a film which everyone will love. Personally however, it is a powerful, gruelling performance which might take effort at times, but is ultimately very rewarding and in general amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shedding light on the darkness of Humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A story told in nine chapters on a sound stage where chalk lines mark the buildings and streets, Lars Von Trier??s ?°Dogville?± made up in substance for what was lacking in scenery. The unusual, minimalist set-up seemed outrageous at first, but appropriate as the narrative progresses. Don??t be bugged down by the initial discomfort, your mind adjusts quicker than you think.As we first became acquainted with the heroine of the movie, a fragile and angelic woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman in her career best performance). Fleeing from a mob of killers, she enters the small town of Dogville searching for help. When the residents of Dogville agreed to look after Grace in exchange for her labor, Grace??s eyes were filled with hope and her heart satiated by what she imaged to be the feeling and warmth of home. Grace was grateful, grateful to every tenant of Dogville.Yet the joyous bliss was short-lived. Treading the steps of happy times was a looming darkness that Grace could never have foreseen. In lieu of respect and friendship, Grace??s continuous residence at Dogville awarded her others?? mistrusts and jealousy in return. Soon, her physical labor turned into the most demanding ones, as the town??s people, one by one, turned against her in an esoteric compliance -- of the darkness of the human heart -- that her fragility and innocence could never comprehend. But for Grace, she knew now how Dogville was aptly named, as she became the subject of its exploitation. The town??s people, one by one, in a web of conniving lies, took advantage of her and her body, stripping away her dignity and her pride.Now, Grace could see the unpleasant rays of the light that exposed Dogville??s ugliness, that uncovered the dark secrets of the human heart, that exhumed the viciousness and cruelty buried deeply in the most innocent place of the conscious. Our humanity was explored and exposed while we witnessed Grace??s discovery of the truth about Dogville. Are we all as brutal as dogs or animals? Or are we even worse than those animals in our malice and willingness to hurt one of our own? Is there no longer sympathy, gentility, or compassion? As seeds of disgust, hatred and vengeance began to flourish in Grace??s heart, she gave the town the ultimate reprimand before leaving it with the thought of never returning to Dogville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About America? No, about humanity...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, this film is not anti-American. I don't know what Von Trier said previously, but a reading from a neutral perspective indicates that this is more than an exercise in nation bashing. Instead its a parable to relative values and the subjective nature of right and wrong. In rejecting religion as a source of moral absolutes, we are left in a position of relativism which requires that we walk a mile in others shoes before judging them. The triumph of Von Trier's film is in goading us with disgust at the townspeople's cowardice, yet not allowing us to judge them without first understanding their predicament. If we wish to punish them as Grace does for their weakness, then we are appealing to some greater authority than our own moral relativity, yet if we do not do so, we are forced to justify their actions. Neither of which is a comfortable position to be in.By deciding to destroy Dogville, Grace is demonstrating her belief that the townsfolk have not lived up to their responsibilities as human beings. In her discussions of arrogance with her father, Grace comes to the realisation that people must be held to a higher standard of moral behaviour than animals and so she feels free in condemning them while at the same time pardoning Moses the dog. The film therefore provokes a deep philosophical debate between the nature of right and wrong and the extent of human culpability in the outcome of that dichotomy.And for all you people who feel this film is about America and its problems, you're committing exactly the same sin as the people in Dogville who refused to see the elephant in their own living room. Instead they embarked on a path of violence, selfishness and jealousy that led inexorably to their own destruction. How understandable is their behaviour in the light of the vapid commercialism that encompasses a vast swathe of western culture today?I thought so...Yes, the end title sequence is jarring, but is the question being asked, "This is what American is?", "These are the face of the have-nots and should we judge them by our standards?" or even "these are the faces of the have-nots and isn't it wrong that we have put them in the position that the standards illustrated by Dogville might be their norm?"Whichever conclusion you come to, this is a transcendant piece of film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Longest review I've ever written - must mean the movie did something right (***)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still have no idea how I really feel about this film. There are lots of parts that I definitely liked and lots of parts that I definitely didn't like. There were times when I was completely riveted to my seat and other times when I was bored and my mind wandered. Leaving the theater, I was in kind of a daze, with all kinds of conflicting emotions filling my head. Usually that means you've just seen a great movie, but this time I wasn't so sure. Maybe, maybe not. One thing's for sure, it's unlike any other movie ever made. I've only seen one other film from Danish director Lars Von Trier, "Dancer In The Dark", and it was incredible (I need to see "Breaking The Waves" really bad). He is definitely some some of bizarro genius who is not afraid to p*** people off, and "Dogville" is probably his strangest and most intentionally alienating film yet. It's about a desperate woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who, in fleeing the mob, arrives at a tiny town (only about 20 residents) in the mountains named Dogville. Arriving late at night, she meets Tom (Paul Bettany), who offers to let her stay and hide out there, if the other residents agree.They do, but reluctantly. Grace wins their respect for a short time by doing odd jobs for all the residents in exchange for their hiding her. Gradually, though, when the townsfolk begin to realize how desperate a situation Grace is in, and how much she depends on them not informing the mob where she is, they begin to take advantage of her. They increase her work, cut her pay, and she is raped several times by men in town. After she tries to escape, she is chained to a wheel and abused even more. Even Tom, who smugly fancies himself the town golden boy, is revealed to be completely spineless and of no help to her. This is already not sounding like a crowdpleaser, but strangest of all is the way the film is presented. It's set entirely on a large wooden stage and there are almost no props of any kind, not even walls. The "houses" are actually just chalk outlines on the floor and when characters enter buildings, they mime the act of opening and closing a "door", complete with sound effect. To depict things like dimension, time of day, and weather, interesting things are done with the lighting and scant props. Surprisingly, this surreal set-up is amazingly easy to get into after the disorienting first few minutes (when the "door" mime stuff is guaranteed to get some deserved chuckles from the audience). I never FORGOT that I was looking at a wooden stage with invisible houses, but I got used to it quickly and was frequently fascinated by it. Lots of people are saying that the film is anti-American, and I have to agree, not that that's always a bad thing (especially these days, with Georgie Jr. in the White House). The surreality of the film makes all sorts of symbolic interpretation possible, and you could definitely argue that the exploitation and torture of Grace at the hands of the ignorant townspeople is a definite criticism of American xenophobia and treatment of immigrants.Von Trier definitely has some valid points, but too often it feels like he's sermonizing, wagging his finger at us even though he admits he's never even been to America (he's afraid of flying). Still, pompousness aside, Von Trier has some good points and an extremely powerful way of dramatizing them. The film's very violent conclusion (the stage lights turn bright red) is one of the most disturbing I think I've ever seen, partly because of the surprising Christ-like symbolism that suddenly comes into play. So, as I was saying, I stumbled out of the theater, feeling all kinds of things at once. I was disturbed and saddened by the conclusion, I was in awe of the performances, I had admiration for Von Trier's vision at the same time that I was angry with him for the cruelty of his story and for some of its anti-American sentiments, which felt unfair to me.After sleeping on it, though, I've come to the conclusion that it IS a good movie. Not perfect, certainly not an ENJOYABLE movie, and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone except the most adventurous filmgoers, but it's got ideas, powerful performances (the huge cast also includes Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Patricia Clarkson, Stellan Skarsgaard, Philip Baker Hall, Chloe Sevigney, Jeremy Davies, Zeljko Ivanek, and James Caan), and it's haunted my memories for the last 24 hours. That means that, at the very least, it'll get to you.</fullReview>

I was fascinated, confused, and irritated by the movie.On one level, it works as an indictment of our (I am American) incursion into Iraq. WHY are we there? Do we try to fit in? How do we help (serve) the Iraqis? Our final frustration with them being who they are and our subsequent destruction of them. The recent photos of Iraqi prisoners could have been interleaved into the ending. Leaving only the dog for the next (Iran? UN?, local insurgents?) to deal with.I am comfortable with this criticism from outside our country- good (honest) feedback is good and makes us better.However, if this is the intention, then the director SHOULD have taken the trouble to understand Americans. His comic book representation weakens the entire argument and his moral authority. IF he can be so-ooo wrong with so-ooo many things, how can one accept his position?I do not mind criticism: please take the time to get it right...</fullReview>

Unfortunately none of the citizens of Dogville can overcome their base instincts enough to do anything but destroy and imprison their own faith. I wonder if the device of repeated rape of Grace is designed to make the audience feel the proper emotional outrage over the perversion of religion. The ending did a better job at giving me a sobering vision of judgment day than any 50 televangelists ever could. I think I'll see this movie again and pay more attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By dogmatic, I mean the second definition described in the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: "Characterized by an authoritative, arrogant assertion of unproved or unprovable principles."von Trier, might take no offense, asserting that this is his opinion, but given that Mr. von Trier has never set foot in the United States and yet so overt in his condemnation of it, I see no other characterization more appropriate to this film and its maker.David Edelstein's review on Slate.com perhaps summarizes my own feelings more that any other review. I particularly like the last penultimate paragraph of his work:"Von Trier really gives us Yanks the big middle finger in the credit sequence, which presents photos of real American poverty, hopelessness, and desperation while David Bowie warbles the acidic "Young Americans." That was when I gave the movie the finger right back; I wanted to throw things at the screen. I'm sure Lars von Trier would regard me the way Col. Jessup regards the lieutenant in A Few Good Men-I can't handle the truth. But it's more like I can't handle selective half-truths by a preening, misanthropic bully who wouldn't recognize an act of decency if it bit him on the ass."Admittedly, the film-making style of this film was fantastic, and I applaud Von Trier for it. I also give him credit for having the willingness to put forth such a film despite any potential outcry or backlash that might occur. However, my praise of Dogville -- and of von Trier -- stops there. The movie was overly long and would have been better presented were it 15-20 minutes shorter.Leaving us wondering if this was a statement about America, western values, or humanity in general would have invoke thoughtful discussion across the world, but VonTrier makes it quite clear in the end credits where his hositility is directed.That by itself does not bother me, but what does is the suggestion -- perhaps overtly -- in the film that the world would be a better place without Dogville (aka America). Such direct hostility is nothing more than ignorant, bigoted, and counterproductive to human growth. The only real statement VonTrier makes with Dogville is that VonTrier himself is a dogmatist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars von Trier has never been to the USA, and I've never left it; who's to say which of us is in a better position to judge?I think "Dogville" is masterful movie-making: the stripped-down set is a marvelous concept, giving as it does a God's-eye view of the proceedings, especially when seen from above. But von Trier is conflating his own point of view with God's.Make no mistake about it, this movie is not meant to be about Human Nature in general; it is a statement about America and Americans, and it is insulting, slanderous, and false.I grew up surrounded by small-town America, and granted it ain't always Mayberry. Outsiders can find it very unwelcoming at times. But once they're accepted, the mentality of "protecting our own" comes to embrace them as well. There's no way that what Grace went through could be considered representative of ANYTHING, let alone our national character. It is purely and simply a false picture. There's more truth in five minutes of "News from Lake Wobegon" than in the three hours of "Dogville".Now, I'm no Rah-Rah cheerleader for the USA; American capitalism definitely has its victims, and we leave an over-large footprint on the world politically, culturally, ecologically... But on the whole I think Randy Newman's satire is on point: "No one likes us, I don't know why / We may not be perfect, but Heaven knows we try." To paint the USA as a second Sodom, where not a single righteous individual can be found in order to save us from destruction, is the action of an Ass.By the way, von Trier does like to put his heroines through Hell, doesn't he? I'd hate to be a woman in von Trier's life; he seems to expect them to carry the sins of the rest of us (that is, of us men) on their backs...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a really daring experiment. There is no set, to speak of, everything takes place in a dark studio with white lines on the floor to mark out buildings, and only the most basic props. This is supposed to represent the tiny town of Dogville, somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, in the middle of the Great Depression. Into the town comes a woman named Grace (played by Nicole Kidman), on the run from gangsters. The film has been accused of being "anti-American". I don't see it myself. Lars Von Trier himself said the film was "set in America, but not about America". Indeed "Dogville" could be set anywhere in the world in my opinion, without changing the basic plot. Von Trier has also been accused of "misogyny" and I can certainly see why (as in many of his previous films, most notably "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark", the female lead suffers terribly during this film). Although, to be honest, I think "Dogville" is more misanthropic than misogynistic. Von Trier seems to have it in for everyone here.Some people may also be put off by the idea of the bare set, the film's lengthy run time (3 hours), and jerky hand-held camera work. I found it a gripping drama, superbly acted and very thought-provoking. It's certainly not easy viewing but it is certainly worth the effort.Whether you love it or hate it, at least you'll be thinking about it afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Trier goes Brecht</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(This makes more sense if you read it after having seen the movie.)From the alienation effect created by the bare theatrical setting and the odd voice-over to the didactic message, this movie has Bertolt Brecht written all over it, and just as Brecht does, Von Trier explores human nature and human exploitation from an odd analytic distance: his Dogville is no more in the USA than Brecht's Good Person of Szechwan is set in the real China or Saint Joan of the Stockyards in the real Chicago. Rather they are all just examples of universal characters that can be found in any place.Von Trier's moral inquiry goes one step further than Brecht (whose protagonists typically fail), when he provides a cathartic ending that somehow feels good even though it is totally inappropriate in moral terms; immediately before, two characters discuss the concept of arrogance, in which they apply it to totally opposite characters, and yet both are right. And even if it's true that the villagers' best was not enough, who is Grace to decide this? Once she is in a position of power, is she not just as bad as the villagers - or perhaps even worse?What is the story about anyway? Is it about a poor fugitive who is taken advantage of in the worst possible ways and who then takes bitter revenge, or is is about a group of poor villagers who are taking revenge on a rich girl, only to be beaten back into submission?And the pictures of poor American farmers from the 1930s juxtaposed with American homeless of the 1990s during the end credits - are they meant as criticism or excuse?If anything, the point that the philosopher character, who claims he can see through everybody, is the most clueless person in the film, should give you a clue that there are no answers in this movie, only questions, and as soon as you think you have an answer, you notice that you have been deceived.So who is arrogant - Grace, the gangster boss, the villagers, or you, the viewer?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST MOVIE FOR 2003 (doens't contain spoilers but watch the movie first!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh my! I saw this movie yesterday and was entirely entralled! Lars Von Trier does an unimaginable work, with this highly symbolic story he narrates us. Purely an allegory on human nature, it is a movie where each actor works as a symbol. The messages the film tries to convey are several, of course: the most apparent one is that power corrupts. Even the superficially simple and good people of Dogville cannot resist the gift given to them: Grace. The box of Pandora opens and each and every one of them, men, women, old people, even the children take turns on her. The movie, quite brutally, makes us understand how easily humans are lured by power. The character of Grace (obviously not an accidental selection of name) is of course the one on centre amidst this drama, with Kidman portraying Grace as a woman of nearly divine forgiveness (originally), a martyr who silently endures the torments. Generally, Dogville represents the entire world, like a miniature of the human society: the weak and vulnerable ones become prey to the others. I don't think that the movie is exclusively anti-americanic (though definitely Trier has consciously inserted some anti-americanic elements, like the 4th of July dinner or the end credits, in the way I got it, at least). I think the film also applies to a universal level and shows that everyone, whether currently powerful or powerless, has a potential for evil and manipulation. The best part of the story, after all, is that the Dogville people never really perceived doing something wrong. Of course, this can evade discussions about the similar ways the American Imperium invaded a country lately in the name of international peace and so on, but I really don't want to initiate arguments about these matters in this board, so let's just focus on the way Trier is unmasking the hypocrisy of our society in general, and not just of the American society. Anyway, I don't have anything else to say, just that it was one of the most remarkable experiences of my life and it was even better the way Trier presented it, with this Brecht-like theatrical style of his. It was truly like viewing a play, or an Greek tragedy and it was purely delightful! Best movie of the year for me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Our town is not this town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked into the film not knowing anything other than a recommendation from a Catalan friend. Immediately I was shocked by the "Our Town"-like set, no walls, chalked outlines of buildings, miming opening doors, etc.I heard a sigh from my friend and thought, we're not going to make it through this film are we?But as we progressed we were drawn in by Nicole Kidman's mesmerizing performance. I agree with other critics in the fact that if it weren't for her performance, we couldn't have handled this heavy monologue (and narrated) film.I felt at moments I was watching a Hawthorne morality story (a la "The Scarlet Letter") mixed with a Marquez magical realism short story ("A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings"). The camera work was inspiring, especially scenes when we were suddenly given true omniscient narrator viewpoint from above.By the time the end of the movie neared the end (which you are prepared for by the "chapter" titles) I was enthralled. But then Von Trier spoils his universal message about human frailty and wickedness with the closing credit still shots of Americans from the 1930s and Bowie's "Young Americans."His "politics" seem to be worn on his sleeve and taking a cheap shot at "America" when anti-American sentiments are running high seems a bit weak. I rather liked the idea that the romanticizing of "poor" people and "simple," "salt of the earth" folk is a fallacy instead of learning that he just had it in for a country on whose soil he's never even ventured to step.</fullReview>

I thought Nicole Kidman was almost flawless (which is amazing considering she was a 30-something Australian playing a 20-something American mob boss' daughter). Skarsgard was grumpy, all brow and no eyes and did it well. Jeremy Davies was befuddling and awesome. Really, the acting was great. The script was OK. The pop-philosophy message was simplistic and woefully Euroamerican but, as I write this, I'm getting over that part. Von Trier made the film he wanted and he got some spectacular acting out of his cast. If his attempt at providing a rebuttal to the feel-good human nature thing fell kinda flat, well, that's OK.*Spoiler Alert* If you don't like Skarsgard rear(what's your issue?), teenage goth philosophy, spanking, James Caan, or seeing a baby shot at close range by a mobster, you probably won't like this film. If you like those things, you still may not like this film. Note: there is no spanking of James Caan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant study on humanity and morality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dogville" is a movie that has created a lot of controversy due to its supposed "anti-American" message; nevertheless, the work of director Lars Von Trier transcends nationalities and, intentional or not, its powerful message is a social critic to the very human nature. A very dark tale that explores humanity and morality, in a way a fable would do.The plot is quite simple at its core; Grace is a runaway, and suddenly she enters in the small town of "Dogville", a town lost in the Rocky mountains where its inhabitants live peaceful and simple lives. Tom, a resident of "Dogville" finds her and offers her help, he convinces her that the people of "Dogville" are good and will help her. They come to an agreement with the town where Grace will work for them in exchange of her safety. When the people of Dogville begins to abuse of her needs, nothing will be the same again because she has a secret, a very dangerous secret.As most people know by now, the main characteristic of "Dogville" is that it has no scenery, and that the setting is established by simple chalk lines and some props, giving the movie the feeling of a play, and focusing the audience's attention in the characters. While this may sound like a very hard task to do, it actually works superbly because the nature of the story is not in the visuals, but in the actions, and the same way we can see through the walls of "Dogville", we can see through the characters, and we witness something we wouldn't like to know about them.The movie is a very interesting study on morality, and it works on many levels; starting with the first scene, is Grace really innocent? should the town help her? Grace is a good woman who seems to do anything to be accepted and as times goes by, she becomes part of the town, but as soon as the troubles begin, everyone seems to have reasons to use Grace at will, turning her into an object. Why does Grace accept this suffering? Is this really better than her past? What is fair? Who makes the laws? The movie raises this kind of questions. It is a movie that actually makes you think and reflect on the very nature of mankind. It is a very well developed story.A movie like this is very challenging for actors, but the cast is up to the task. Nicole Kidman as Grace carries the film with power and her performance is truly believable. Paul Bettany is Tom, and he is really one of the surprises of the film, his performance is quite amazing and is hard to believe he is British. He manages to do a good accent in the movie. The rest of the cast is equally impressive, with Lauren Bacall, Stellan Skarsg?rd and Patricia Clarkson in superb roles as residents of "Dogville".Sadly, I cannot judge about the editing and pacing. I have read that the movie is quite long and drags at times. I have seen the international 155 minutes version, and that cut really has an amazing pace and makes the movie flow easily and still delivered a powerful message.In the end, is not about Dogville being America, is about Dogville as representation of mankind, mankind at its darkest nature. It is a haunting reflection of ourselves, and the message is delivered perfectly. 10/10. Masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot summaries for this movie say that it's shot entirely in studio, etc, but they don't make it clear that this is probably the most minimal movie production from a major director in the last 30 years (or my lifetime anyway). I don't think it's a spoiler to say that most of the set pieces and buildings aren't actually present, but rather represented by chalk outlines. I felt like I was watching a Ionesco play at the Theatre de la Huchette in Paris, not a Nicole Kidman movie in America. Needless to say, I found it a bit grating. However, despite how much I disliked the ham-fisted devices (or lack thereof) in this movie, I still give it a 4 (as opposed to a 1) for the fact that it did indeed produce extremely memorable moments involving Apples, gangsters, farm trucks, and headlights. You may end up hating this movie, but you won't ever forget it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone bother to look up the latin phrase carved on the silver mine? Did anyone else even notice it or did you all just write it off as unimportant, as if anything could be mere eye-candy in a film as visually sparse as Dogville. The latin means "he said it, therefore it must be true." Despite the Dogvillian's first hand experience with Grace, when the cops post a wanted sign, they start treating her poorly. The words override their world, make them doubt it. Later, when yet another sign is posted (this one reading wanted and dangerous), they put her in chains, attach the bell, nightly rape her etc. Again, despite their experience, their knowledge, they let the words of the "authorities" dictate how they act. Yet another level of this phrase is Grace's dependence on Tom. She believes everything he says, needing him and trusting him to present her case accurately and justly to the Dogvillians. Dictum ac Factum could be taken as Grace's motto, as how she deals with people in general, though it especially applies to Tom. Hope this has been enlightening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This quiet little town is much closer to us than we'd like to (**** out of ****)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DOGVILLE (2003)**** out of ****There weren't many great film on the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, but at least three of them deserved to win an award. First, there was Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT, with its daring and original approach to a real-life event. There was also Clint Eastwood's masterpiece MYSTIC RIVER, which went on to win two Academy Awards in 2004. But it was DOGVILLE the true star of that festival. Unfortunately, it didn't win anything- I suppose that was because its pessimistic, radical view of the human nature might not have pleased some members of the jury. That's a pity, because this is a film to enter the history of cinema.With its unusual set design (chalk drawings on the floor to represent houses, only a few objects) and its anti-Hollywood structure (a narrator who knows a lot, the division of the story in chapters), it might repel some viewers. But that all makes DOGVILLE unique. While Nicole Kidman's performance is the best of her career, the most discussed thing about the film will be its ending. Well, all I can say is that Lars Von Trier has guts- the finale tells more about ourselves than we'd like to.No doubt here's a new addition to my all-time top 100. It's the best film since David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DRIVE.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A piece of Art? Maybe, but I'd rather go to the theatre. The underlying story is packed with drama but the movie itself lacks impact until the very end. The dialogue is often insipid, the narration didactic and hectoring as though the the writer/director wanted to be the star of the show as well as its creator. Only Nicole Kidman's outstanding performance kept me awake for the entire (nearly) three hours.Anti-American? Had Dogville been set in (say)a Turkish village (or had all the characters been Jewish) the director would have been run out town by the same people who heaped praise on him. I'm not an American, nor have I ever been, but there seems to have been no reason to set this story explicitly in America (especially since Lars von Trier has never been there and has no special knowledge of the place) other than to imply that American people are intrinsically more corrupt than the rest of us. Not a noble aim for an artist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this movie is rated under 8 - which is a shame - I decided to write a comment and to rate it.&nbsp; I would like to give it more than a 10 because it's a true work of art. &nbsp; Outstanding art changes a viewers perception and leaves a lasting impression on him because it tells an absolute truth. This movie is such a truth. &nbsp; It is a work without compromises and with a clear vision what it should look like. The stage-like&nbsp; minimalism is a means of purifying our senses and getting the message across as clear and as strong as light. &nbsp; It's a film about our society, be it America or any western civilization of today. Americans shouldn't be offended by it because it?s the truth. &nbsp; It's about the mechanism of power. The powerful exploit the weak. That?s how society works: First it's nature, then it's the animals, then it's the slaves, then it's entire nations. &nbsp; The easier it is to manipulate a person the more we take advantage of her ­because we can. The weak and the kind hearted are the first to go under -like Grace. There is no sense of justice or moderation in our behavior - as long as we can easily get what we want. It's a creeping process we're not even aware of.Primitive people do it with violence (wars are the most direct way of showing power). Clever people do it in a more subtle way. The most dangerous are the ones who manipulate you seemingly unintentional - like Tom. He seems likable at first but at the end he's the worst of all.This is a masterpiece in showing how we slip into bondage (either as the oppressor or the oppressed) without realizing it. In the end there is no easy way out other than destruction and death. I hope this movie didn't describe the end of our world!It?s a movie with biblical proportions, it?s a so called big, important movie, a true masterpiece.</fullReview>

But it was a good film despite my partner and I wishing to crush the life out of all the players... The ending as it was became an inevitability. Both to satisfy us as viewers that had suffered along with the girl and also to make the point - a point that might have arguably been made just as succinctly in a 60-80min movie...A bit less NYPD blue camera work would have been appreciated - shaking a camera doesn't fool the audience into thinking you had more than one rolling on any given take and can be REALLY annoying. But there was also some very nice camera work and a similar film done ina more conventional means on location would have been dazling.Great cast, I guess filming in a tight timeframe, in a studio and giving the cast one outfit to wear throughout you can splurge on casting. It paid off in my opinion... and what a treat to see who turns up! I couldn't help but liken my experience seeing this to sitting through Angelas' Ashes.

		<shortDescription>von Trier strikes again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There will probably be spoilers within. Whatever one can say about DOGVILLE, one can't say that's it's not provocative. People feel passionate about this film, one way or another, like most of von Trier's creations, and in this world of increasing apathy and passionless commercial art, that's no small feat. I happen to be an admirer of the von Trier's works and found DOGVILLE to be no exception. The 3 hours flew by for me as I was attempting to untangle his allegory and metaphors in every scene, and here's the most amazing part: I already knew the story, how it ended, and many of the details. I agree with a former film instructor, that viewers often get far too caught in what happens in a story-almost in a childlike way (imagine children telling a ghost story)-while ignoring altogether the most meaningful aspects of a film. In DOGVILLE, of course, those aspects are the allegory itself, the many references to Americana, and reflections on human nature itself.To all that vehemently argue that DOGVILLE is a critique of the US and to those who argue the opposite: I think you're both right. There are too many (wonderfully rendered) references to the myth of being American for it not to be, on one level, a scathing critique of both American culture and American cinema and TV: the obvious relationship to OUR TOWN, the American movie device of using the folksy narrator to tell a heartwarming story about how goshdarn good Americans really are, apples (Johnny Appleseed, American as apple pie), the Mafia running the show, the pointedly simplistic use of language and the initial representation of small town values found only in TV shows like ANDY GRIFFITH, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, etc. If our TV shows and movies are us telling ourselves who we are, then I think von Trier has ample source material to attack with a vengeance. He also makes pointed references to America's Puritan past, and the inherent hypocrisy of taping on `Christian' intentions to purely self-serving motivations. Even though the town has lost its minister and doesn't go to church, Puritan ethics-be good to others, work hard, etc--still structure the town members' thinking. No ethics command their actions, however; hence the hypocrisy that always existed in a country established by Puritans--be good to others unless they're Native American, Chinese, black, anything other than Euro white. Work hard unless you can get someone else to do it, preferably slaves, but at least as cheaply as possible. Grace arrives; she is different, and she will be punished for being different and exploited because she's the minority. von Trier is making a big point here: her name is Grace-Tom prayed for a gift-there are several references to her beauty, both inner and outer. She is the best human being among them, a martyr for her belief that people deserve forgiveness. Providence provided Dogville `grace' and they spat in its face. All that said, of course one can easily extrapolate to include all human beings in this critique, but I believe von Trier's argument is that Americans are, thus far, the most willfully blind about our cruelties, and stupidly broadcast ourselves the most widely as saints. (Much of our TV and movie screen time is telling each other how great we are.) We are the best examples of some of the worst behaviors that human beings can exhibit. There are many, many examples of these behaviors in other societies but no one country regularly (perhaps daily) celebrates itself like the US does, to my knowledge. Now, name some recent movies written and directed by Americans that are this provocative (hell, just this creative). `Dearth' is the word you need. I also think it's interesting how many Americans posted on IMDB how much they admire this film. Maybe there's hope.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why we refuse to see ourselves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw von Trier's DOGVILLE and think it is one of the most original and powerful films of the past ten years. I have read the negative press and heard the shouting of critics and movie-goers as to the film's "anti-American" viewpoint. Why do we, as Americans refuse to believe that there are pages in our history that are not perfect? Why do we not acknowledge the racial and economic oppression that has, and continues to be, a part of our society? There are chapters in our history far darker than those illuminated by von Triers. This country was founded in rebellion. We fought for our freedom in order to allow each individual the unquestionable right to believe what they choose, become what they dream, and worship whatever God their heart follows. Sometimes we have missed that mark. Sometimes we have chosen to avert our eyes in order to preserve our "image." We don't always do the right thing. We don't always fulfill our destiny. DOGVILLE simply and powerfully states that oppression is bad. It exposes some of our arrogance. It asks us to look at parts of ourselves we would rather forget. This is the greatest nation on earth, but it's not perfect. We should see it for what it is and try to learn from our past, not cover it up. DOGVILLE just asks us to lay those truths bare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Dogville' An Avant-garde Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's latest allegory is slow to start but its three hours are justified. Although the story takes place in a small, supposedly picturesque mountain town in Colorado, the set consists of nothing but a black floor with outlines drawn in chalk for the houses with occasional pieces of the buildings placed to give us something to work with. But not much. What others may call pretentious and esoteric I call daring and challenging. He asks of his viewers that we accept the presence of a door and handle even if we only see the gesture. It turns out that the work we have to do in watching it is well worth the story that he provides in return.Grace, played by Kidman, enters the town after fleeing from gangsters who seem to own the police. The law is deliberately portrayed as a hands-off profession in this area, short of posting signs marking her as missing. The town, consisting of an alienated couple (Stellan Skarsgaard and Patricia Clarkson), a greedy shopkeeper (Bacall), a blind lonely widower (Gazzara), and other great stage and Hollywood names, takes her in despite the dangers involved in harboring a fugitive. They receive the help she volunteers for her protection with a wariness and acceptance...for a while.When the sheriff returns with a new poster including a large reward for her head, the town changes its stance. They see her as a risk. What originally seems to be a selfless act of generosity turns into an opportunity. The twists become darker and darker as Kidman's character slowly becomes a commodity and not a person.Although Von Trier has never been to the United States, for which he has been taken to task, he makes quite pointed observations about America's provincialism and greed. We see the way in which a town begins to resemble a gang which pins 'us' against 'them'. One might find a strikingly similar parallel in the current government rhetoric over militarism. We also see the way in which greed, rumors, gossip, and self-deception turn to reactionary violence and immorality.The true genius, however, lies in the transformation that Kidman's character undergoes. As a member of this town for the good part of a year, she begins to accept the backward mentality as her own. At once, she is victimized by the town and yet somehow won over by its methods. The proof is in the ending, which may surprise and horrify some but which truly does prove that she has learned much from her time in Dogville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lars van Trier had had better moments before.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps you won't do justice to a film by comparing it with earlier works of the director. Perhaps it is sign of your growing older that you do compare. Be that as it may, I could not but compare, and "Dogville" comes off badly. In many details, it does not reach the qualities of its predecessors.The acting of Nicole Kidman, albeit far from bad, is never as convincing as the acting of the heroine in Trier's "Breaking the Waves", Emily Watson. There are none of the touching moments that Watson could produce; she played her character convincingly as a victim of her nature, a nature that is partly just a gift of nature, but evidently also partly forced upon her by the influence and educational means of her environment. We do not get to know much about the nature of Kidman's Grace, unfortunately.Most of the characters remain stereotypes throughout the film - which seems to be intended to a certain extend, due to the many allusions to Brecht. But still I cannot regard this as a virtue of the movie.The worst thing about it is the end (this is NOT a spoiler) - the very end, I mean. After the plot is over, we are shown sad pictures of poor people living and dying in the States' thirties as well as the contemporary USA. The pictures are accompanied with David Bowie's "Young Americans" - here van Trier manages to give his movie a last and wholly unconvincing twist. With this scene he risks to turn the film into a clumsy and shallow expression of anti-American resentments. What a pity - though the film is not one of his best, it would have deserved better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the Whole World Dogville?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful and mysterious stranger Grace runs from the gangsters and arrives to the tiny town Dogville that sits somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. The first man she meets, Tom Edison (Paul Bethany), writer/philosopher (who has not written anything yet) decides to help her and introduces her to town folks. Hard-working and decent residents of Dogville reluctantly agree to let Grace stay in the exchange for some menial services. When the residents find out that she may be wanted by the law for the bank robberies, they demand more of her services and eventually make her their slave. Friendly and honest people turn into the sadistic monsters indulging their vile instincts and enjoying the strongest drug possible ? absolute power over a helpless human being. Dodgeville's visual style comes directly from the 50th TV dramas ? minimum decorations, just a few actors, and a lot of text. There are no real houses or mountains on the screen ? the main street, the benches, the bushes, the houses of the residents are marked out with a chalk outlines on the stage. We see some chairs, beds, and desks. There are no walls or doors to cover what happens behind them ? all is opened for us to see. Director's craft is fantastic ? you soon forget unreality of the sets - impressiveness of close-ups, usage of light and different angles are fantastic. Several film's images should be studied in the film schools. One of them is the shot of Grace trying escape Dogville and hiding in the truck full of apples. She thinks she is covered and safe and nobody could see her?Another - shot when the light lit her face and it radiates in a gentle gold ? brings to memory the famous candle lit scenes from Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. The actors are all amazing and they are another reason to forget about the unconventional set. Nicole Kidman played the best role of her career and I have to admit that waiting for so long to see her in this performance was worth it.With all this said I couldn't accept Lars von Trier's Dogville as his masterpiece. He may be a genius but an evil genius. He is a cold and calculating master of provocations. Each frame of Dogville is a masterpiece and I am ready to admire and applaud to every one of them. Unfortunately, put together they contain nothing but misanthropy, hatred and contempt for all humans with only one exception ? Mr. Von Trier himself. I kept asking myself while watching Dogville why he hates us? Not just the town folks of Dogville and not only America but the whole human race. What is it, genuine pain or the evil laugh in which we hear that we all deserve our Hell?Von Trier is a brilliant director, 'Dogville' is a phenomenal film but I just cannot agree with his depiction of all residents. There were children (one of them just an innocent infant who could not be hold responsible for the sins of his parents) and a crippled, helpless girl.This is not the first von Trier's film I've seen. His 'Breaking the Waves' and 'Dancer in the Dark' are very difficult to watch. They, too, deal with humiliated and tortured innocence but there was hope in those two films. The heroines went through unthinkable trials and tribulations but there was light in the end, catharsis. There is no catharsis in 'Dogville' - bitterness, hopelessness, despair, anger, and the question to the writer/director -who are you to judge? You are the one who came up with all these monsters in the first place. I understand the whole story is an allegory of power and how easily it turns seemingly decent people into monsters. As Lord Acton said "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely" but I simply refuse to accept von Trier's message that the whole world MAY BE Dogville. I refuse to believe that an outsider in a desperate need of help will be treated by ALL with no exception members of a tight community in such way the citizens of Dogville treated Grace.

The choices given the characters were inconsequential.The movie continued to undrammatically plod along. Without dialog. Without change. Continuing a misogynistic sense of unforgiving single-mindedness.Truly this film represents nothing about reality. There are not choices. There is no drama. There is simple dullness, like a winter as viewed from another land. No investigation. No observation.Dullness ending in dullness.Don't bother unless you have the time to investigate dullness.There are so many better and more intriguing films made by people who truly want to interrogate and observe the human experience rather than trudge through a path so heavily travelled that tracks and soil have becoming inhuman and unrecognizable as those from our planet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't like films, you'll probably love this one. Lars von Trier does everything in his power to deconstruct the medium. This would at least be an interesting approach, if only the story this film tells were not so predictable, banal and clichéd. Mr von Trier gives us the most basic of fairy tales, where the poor defenseless innocent (Kidman) is set upon by all the wicked witches and bad stepmothers the Grimm brothers have ever collated. All the characters are one-dimensional and clichéd, but supposedly this does not matter, because the director has chosen such a daring, neo-Brechtian/Piscatorian approach to the art direction. Let's not put up sets! Let's keep the sound stage bare and just draw on outlines of buildings. This is so radical, people will think I am a genius. Unfortunately this ploy has worked. People do think Mr von Trier is a genius. Well, I think the emperor is wearing no clothes! For me the word that summarizes DOGVILLE best is "childish". Although "boring" and "interminable" come a close second. I like films, so I'm afraid DOGVILLE is not for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As well made as it may be, the message of this movie gets down right stupid if you break it down to its core... What have we got here? I sum up the story: A girl who ran away from "some gangsters" gets taken in by some mountain town folk. The townspeople are nice at first but after some time, they become more and more abusive until a ridiculously disgusting degree is reached. They end up calling the gangsters to get rid of the girl, but it turns out she is the daughter of some mafiaboss and the whole town gets machinegunned and burnt preferably in a horrible fashion.Besides the fact that this story is incredibly unrealistic altogether and she prolly could have left the village at any point, whats happening is displayed in a context of an extremely misunderstood Christian-moral of forgiveness and punishment... The whole town is incredibly judgemental from the start, and as friendly and understanding as the girl maybe her personality would shine in a very different light if the viewer knew her background story from the start...The point in Christian religion is less "forgiveness" and a lot more "not judging" people... There isn't anything arrogant about "not judging people" that because what it essentially means is: "I wont judge other people, cause i know i will always be just biased as they are." Aka: my opinion is NOT better than anybody elses. Which is the absolute opposite of arrogance. NOT imposing your judgement on anybody else is whats important, its the whole point. When Miss "my dads a gangsterboss" in the end "morally" decides to shoot everybody in the town she IS judging them by her VERY own standards and not a bit better then they were.Did the author really think the world we live in is so full of forgiveness that he needed to teach a lesson like that to the earth????? An eye for an eye? If we'd live by that standard nobody would be alive because the big problem in everybodys nature is, that we tend to be biased towards our own judgement which again and again results in situations where two partys are committing horrible crimes because they each are convinced of their ultimate rightfullness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Its somewhat confusing to many viewers that we exist in a world where art is partly message and partly essays on messages. Most films are both, have this dual identity. How they interact is something I call "folding."It is easier to see the more essay component there is, the much less interesting. If folding is justifiable at all, it is because it enhances the power of art. So, when you evaluate a pure essay, as we have here, you have to ask: is it intelligent? Does it add something somewhere? Does it matter?Is the art that incidentally accompanies it powerful?Von Trier is more an essayist on films and film-making than he is a filmmaker. He stays in that one camp. This contrasts him from real filmmakers whose intent is to affect our lives so swing between introspective insight and the fluids of life itself. Say, Hartley, Twyker or Egoyan or even Luhrmann. On the Hollywood side perhaps Lynch, dePalma. And of course we have the whole pack of recent Spanish-speaking filmmakers.So does Von Trier say anything interesting here? Is it worth experiencing? When I ask that question in a crowd of relatively intelligent thinkers in film, the answer is that it hardly matters. You have to listen to whoever has the floor, whether he is saying something new or not.It is more important that other people are listening than we do. Oh my!Well, what we have here is yet another exploration in cinematic abstraction, yet again in the direction of Chekov sparseness. He's denoted this crudely with the sets which both evoke theatrical minimalism and that notion that a few common, everyday indicators can outline uncommon depth.Unfortunately he selected actors who don't understand this notion of precision by circumnavigation. Our heroine, Nichole, does well when she is a malleable pawn. Luhrmann performed wonders with her without her knowledge. But here she needed to be able to draw, she needed to be Julianne Moore in "Vanya on 42nd Street."If you want brilliant essays on film, go to Greenaway, not von TrierTed's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simplistic, contrived, self indulgent and takes much to long to make it's point.Whatever that point happens to be? Is it that only in America, do small town ignorant people sometimes treat others in the same way they are treated by those more powerful than themselves? Well where on Earth is this not the case? Power can corrupt, and those without any can be overzealous when they taste some for themselves.It should not be a surprise to anyone that, yes, this is a part of our shared human nature, but it has been more cleverly and convincingly and more evenhandedly demonstrated in any number of 1/2 hour twilight zone episodes, than it was in this 3 hour stage play, so disconnected from the reality it is trying to portray.Is it that all people are bad? This is certainly true, but this is only like describing the taste of a grape in terms of it's skin, while completely ignoring its more appealing parts, Humanity is much more complex than this film seems to understand, and the film is an insult to the intelligence to anyone who has given real thought to the good and bad of human nature, where it comes from, and how and when it's complexity is expressed.And what is the point of having it staged? Any message can be more effectively communicated using the full weight of the medium involved. Would it ever truly make sense to make a film using no sound at all, or using only a series of snap shots? Apparently there are many here who might be fooled into applauding such a film for it's originality, when the only real effect such limitations have, is to simplify and limit any originality that could have been possible given no such constraints..In closing this was a long slog through the mud that will only serve to further confuse people who have never had the time to think very deeply on human nature. It is very much like the blind trying to lead the blind, and so perhaps it is fitting that the experience of the average viewer of this film would not be much different from the blind man, who could only listen to it. Not only a waste of bandwidth and creative potential, but of your time as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if I had any expectations other than that this was to be a most somewhat unusual film. . . but unusual applies to this as would "moderately abnormal" apply to a mass murderer. Bluntly, simply, without reservation, this was an anti-American piece of hate shot on DV. From the American iconic names to the use of words to paint a bucolic American setting, every line of this work was aimed at ripping open America to see the rotten insides, to lay open a country of hate, of abuse, of pride covering an ugliness inside that would have to improve before it could even be called depraved. I was astounded-- astounded at the hate on the screen, at the painting of Americans as lower than slime on the evolutionary scale, at the attempt to rip off a facade to show corruption and horror within; and even more so, since this is not the America I know.Before Cannes there was much hoopla about it being the odds on favorite to win the top prize, perhaps to dominate the prizes. Now I understand why it was ignored, ignored by those who might not love America, or things American, but who saw a vicious, hateful attack made without foundation.So what do we say? If America was like Lars von Trier painted it, then he would already be dead, and the copies of the film destroyed. Perhaps nothing could better illustrate the fact that the America he "revealed" in Dogville is not America than the fact that Americans have seen it, openly and freely debate this film, and its message-- even when it is a message of hate, defilement of the principals and goals of America, and contrary to the proven way America acts.Designed to have poor production values, and delivering a message of hate? Lie after lie about what America is, even at its worst, in an overly long and ugly presentation. . . I'll rate this one as pure anti American propaganda, nasty, vile, and false.Any idea why he hates the United States so? .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Because in case he be able to shoot a movie out the self-righteous pseudo intellectual prattle of his, he won't be repeating this brain-child which happens to be also still-born. Actors can be lured into anything -no matter how ridiculous or humiliating this anything might be- provided their agents tell this anything is "artistic".Since Europa (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101829/), a very interesting movie, Lars Von Triers started his steep decline, after Dogville he actually stopped it: he reached the very bottom.By the by, who this moralist wanna-be does he think he is to equal the anonymous people in the pictures on the ending titles with the bunch of slobbering mangy poachers inhabiting the Dogville in his head.One of the most important characteristics of America is her tolerance to criticism, as far as I know there is no other society willing to pay to be vilified and even to praise the vilifier.Just to conclude, this endeavor -the utterance of implacable moral criticism toward certain American issues- can be found in the fiction of Theodore Dreisser, John Steinbeck, William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote, Carson Mc Cullers, H.L. Mencken who are all American writers by the way.The difference between them and Mr. Von Triers, is a crystal-clear one: they were not mere show-offs desperately trying to judge what they thoroughly ignored; quite on the contrary, they were poets (some better than others) trying to find a truth and express it as a thing of beauty.The idea of poor people portrayed as vile is thoroughly fascist.This movie reminds me the nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels who used to say: "tell the biggest lie you can and repeat it often and eventually people will believe it"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pseudo Brechtian Drama Falls Flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was impressive that the film artists involved in "Dogville" attempted a daring use of Expressionistic theatrical techniques, which were at the forefront of the avant-garde in the 1920s and '30s. The film was also blessed with a sensitive performance by Nicole Kidman.But fifteen minutes into the film, the style and story were clear, and the attenuated pace and three-hour length of the film were annoying. In the harrowing drama of the small town's treatment of their captive, the film sought to recycle such stylistic aspects as the narrator from Thornton Wilder's "Our Town" and the story and theme of Durrenmatt's "The Visit." But both of those works are more lively and compelling than "Dogville." John Hurt's narrator became especially grating and tiresome after a couple of voice-overs. The German playwright Bertolt Brecht originated the style that "Dogville" was striving for. But, again, Brecht's plays are much better than "Dogville," especially in his creative uses of music. By contrast, "Dogville" was a one-note film. The story was from the era of the American Depression. But the film's excessive violence says much more about our world than that of the 1930s. This telescoping of time was precisely what Brecht wished to accomplish in what he called "historicization." But one only has to turn on television or read a newspaper today to locate the kind of provocative images and stories that are missing from "Dogville."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier has attempted to create an new version of Bertolt Brecht's DER GUTE MENSCH VON SEZUAN (Good person/woman of Szechwan) centered on a different moral compass. While Brecht was focused on the corrupting nature of capitalism, von Trier focuses on the corrupting notion of being American.The is a lot to be honestly critical of in the United States, arrogance, ignorance and indifference among them. Traditionally critical works have focused on the institutions - corporations, criminals, government etc. This movie argues that the American people themselves are fundamentally rotten.Every character in this movie is a liar, rapist and/or thief. The one pure character learns from her experiences with these people by closing off her humanity and becoming a mafia kingpin.On all accounts this should be a brilliant movie - technically inspiring, amazing performances from a compelling cast. The writing is excellent. What undermines the film is this disgusting vile story that does not offer constructive criticism or moral parable, but only anger and disgust. This film is a direct attack on the character at the centre of the American society - small town America.There is no good in von Trier's America. There is no hope. There is no joy. Do not watch this film, there is nothing to be gained. </fullReview>

If someone actually thought that this movie could enlighten people and change the world, may I suggest that a better idea would have been to have taken the money it cost to produce this movie and spent it feeding hungry people or paying the college tuition for many young people who will not have that opportunity.

		<fullReview>Dogville depicts the happenings of a humble little American town, of the same name, when a troubled newcomer stumbles into town and begins to stir its residents out of their comfort zone. It is the first movie in director Lars Von Trier's USA: Land of Opportunities series that follows a woman named Grace, portrayed here by Nicole Kidman, as she moves through America experiencing its history and culture. Here, she has somewhat of a backwards Cinderella story as Von Trier strips the idea of a small American town down to its bare essentials.The entire film takes place in a black box on a sound stage where the buildings and locations of the town are outlined in chalk on the floor, like a life size map with minimal props around to sell the idea that this is where these citizens live. It's strange for a fully fledged film, but it doesn't take long to get used to, as the story and characters are enticing enough to fill in the gaps for a suspension of belief. Before long, you won't even notice that walls don't hide anything from anyone and the mine at the edge of town isn't just a series of wooden arches.With a background that is mostly black, the cinematography is pretty limited to a few interesting lighting effects and pulling focus to the actors at hand. It seems that it would be very fun and freeing for an actor to be able to work with an ensemble cast on a project like this. The ensemble is so filled with great actors that there are too many to name them all, but the chemistry among them is smooth, fitting them together like pieces of a complete puzzle. They all get their moments to shine within the stories that intertwine these households together.Dogville is somehow a convincing combination of several mediums, film, the stage and prose, that could have gone horribly wrong. All three of these mediums have different ways of telling the same story that need to be taken into account when adapting from one to the other, but here, they all work separately and simultaneously together without becoming a jumbled mess. This is like a filmed production of a stage show playing out the actions read from a novel, with John Hurts as the voice of God narrating the actions, thoughts, backgrounds and feelings of all of the characters, which sounds a bit much but actually ends up being simple and lovely.Though it does still tread that balance of realism and fantasy, this is very different for a film from Lars Von Trier. It is much less involved and simple, in a way, but that lends itself to how Von Trier may be perceiving America, a place the director hasn't really experienced first hand, and it's people who have long been critically harsh and at odds with him. Even still, Dogville manages to be yet another bitter and thought provoking look at life and the struggles we experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My review for dog ville : Dogville is a movie made by Lars Von trier, hes a Danish filmmaker. This movie is about an American town, the movie revolves completely around Americans, albeit the meaning or the moral of the story could be applied to any country of the world but he (Lars Von trier) used America as an example because in my opinion, America is a country which carries more power with its people. Having the power and freedom, it is easy for people to abuse something so easily, (also it can bring good deeds to society but I'm talking about the DE- merit) So I can guess why he chose America as a setting for his plot. America is indeed a great country, but we also have to see the negative side of this great nation. The movie tells us to understand it and confront ourselves to become more of a human being. Coming to talk about this movie, this movie has a greater meaning to it. About everything, its pure art. Looking every side of the movie, it shines art and implies meaning. When I played this movie, I was looking for something typical European like movie with sex and love, but this movie blew my mind. I showed a slight dislike to the movie because of its appeal of how boring it looks, with a stage like features, and drawn out paths and symbols, I thought they are doing another boring weird art like thing, but that feeling is just for 5 minutes to the intro, after that i felt the movie. It really took me with it. I loved how the narration went and how it brought a meaning to its people and how easily I could compare with people in my real life. The movie. It dwells on people's greed and a need of starvation to exploit something to satisfy themselves, they took Grace, a pale beautiful young girl who escaped gun fires from a gangster, (Nicole kid man) for granted. Used her in all means. The people took complete use of her and exploited her kindness. The movie simply conveys how humans have become like dogs, where they have showed their nature and never got any punishment for their ill behavior. The men squeezed her for their sexual satisfaction, and women abused her for being lewd towards the men. The movie also tells that human kindness is all a shade. It doesn't exist much. People have become disguised so much, that finding the lost kindness is pretty hard. Grace thought she would find, but she didn't, in this town, dog ville. People were first, kind to her, like how they seem but as to the conclusion, they belittle her, using dominance over her kindness, commanding her to work physical labor. She was unable to find the love she received formerly. Just like how humans have turned into now. Grace finally brings justice to the humans as well as to the earth by deleting this town from the face of earth and it also creates a great sense and interpretation on how she avoided killing of the dog as she knew the dog was angry at her because of what she had done at the preface(stealing its bone) and not for anything else, like Which the villagers did with no cause or explanation (not gonna say the entire story here)The movie has used the audience's imagination to the fullest, using a set and transparent homes and building to highlight the characters and showcase them, i appreciate what this movie has granted or contributed much to the cinema arts and how many aspiring filmmakers can learn from this simple yet imaginative technique. The actors and actresses were amazing. Nicole kid man is BEAUTIFUL and AMAZING, it really brought a fury in me after seeing how the villagers extracted every faith in her. And the payback really made it much more awesome (And satisfying). Correct use of violence and correct use of casting I would say.I have to conclude saying that this movie is amazing, slightly slow paced and fabricates tautness, when people are eager to know quick results. This movie is a must watch for every Nicole Kidman movie fan, every artist, every sad disturbing movie lovers. This movie is art. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Novel, captivating, and compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a differently stylized cautionary tale. It is a morality play done in the format of a staged play. Using a minimalist set design, the film allows each actor to showcase their skills. Examining the symbiotic interplay of community personas and their more benevolent. characteristics, they are soon to give way to the darker, secret agendas of each. Motives, so it would seem, have sub-motives.Redemption finally comes in the end, which the viewer finds after nearly three hours in this lengthy film. Perhaps it could have been made much shorter, but the movie never lagged, and was engaging to the finish.The worthwhile message is that progressive liberalism is but a illusion of altruism meant to protect and benefit others, while, in truth, is but a self serving vehicle for protecting oneself...from facing the truth about oneself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can ensure you that it never occurred to me once that this is a film about America.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen so many review said that this film is sarcastic about American and that they felt hurt and shameful. But as a Chinese, I can ensure you that it never occurred to me once that this is a film about America.And I feel shameful too, not because it is American, but rather the film talks about the feature of all human being. If the setting is a Chinese town, I wouldn't be surprised.Just see Dogville as a lab for experiments.However,it seems that a lot people agree with the ending of the film where Grace killed them all and felt that the elimination of Gogville will make the world a better place. But this is where I disagree. See, anger and shame will do no good. Revenge and killing will only lead to war and make it all worse. We must see what happened in Dogville in a relative perspective, find a pattern in similar problems, and work out a device to prevent them from happening again. But first thing first, we should admit that it is highly possible for every one of us to behave exactly like the residents in Dogville. People are born sinful, with flaws in nature, and I admit it myself. There is a saying by Confucius :Inequality rather than want is the cause of trouble. I think it renders the problem here perfectly. Before Grace's presence there was a balance in the town and every one was OK with what they got, despise poverty. But after Grace showed up, the balance was broken. The residents needed to scarify a sense of security to shelter Grace. In return Grace offered her labour. For a moment the balance resumed, but precariously. Can you see a change of state of mind when the residents accept her offer? At that moment their mercy and Crace's gratefulness turned into a bare transaction.Ever since none of the two parties was grateful to each other's help, but rather taking it for granted. So when the cops showed up, which implied that the residents need to scarify more to shelter Grace, the balance was broken again. No one ever hesitated to ask for more from Grace, and as a result, Grace didn't have the time and energy to fulfill her work, which arose their anger and sense of inequality even more. The situation went to a extreme ever since. The incentive mechanism was wrong in the first place.Was there pure evil in Dogville? Well maybe, but it was reasonably triggered. We can also detect a loss of law and authority to prevent crime. Because Grace was chased after law and authority in the first place,law did't apply to her. Here we can also draw a conclusion that pure democracy can sometimes lead to pure evil when not properly restricted by law. At the end Grace shot them all to death. And I am surprised to find so many in favor of her. Isn't this the biggest sarcasm in this film? Grace is so arrogant that she started a experiment only to prove she was right. However the experiment proves that she was totally wrong about human being and people everywhere were exactly the same.However she refused to admit her failure, but found a excuse that the people in Dogville were simply not good enough, so she killed them all to make the world a better place. Or rather she actually admitted her failure and found out that human beings are evil in nature, so she decided to let go of herself and become a spokewoman of evil. Either is hardly a good way to solve problem and make the world better, aren't they? If Grace goes to a Catville to do this again. My advice is: never dream of paying them back by your honest labour. When people decided to help you, they would like to see your venerability, so that they can feel good and accomplished. Show your capability when you are in a safer position.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville is a disturbing movie. After I watched it, I couldn't sleep for 3 days. It makes you to think about mercy, crime and punishment. Dialogues were really good. Every minute of this movie was great. Dogville's directing was godlike, too. Camera angels were best. Trier filmed Dogville like a theater. Dogville's scenes were natural. Lars Von Trier's best movie for me. Nicole Kidman's act was really charming, too. All of actors were very good but as I said, Kidman got over herself. Dogville is just like Bible. It tells about everything we,humanity,need. Arrogance, mercy, punishment, love, crime, kill, death. When you watch it,you feel everything.</fullReview>

There's not even any real doors or walls, it seemed like nothing but a cheap movie someone had thrown together quickly. Yet, from the moment I pressed play; I was stuck!It's such an odd, beautiful movie, almost haunting in a way. The shocking truth about the people of dogville wasn't what I was expecting, and the situation Grace is in left me frustrated and angry at the villagers. Until, the ending. The ending was one of those final scenes that you have been waiting to see for the last, half of the movie. The satisfaction of the final scene was worth all of the frustration through the 'struggles' Grace has to suffer through.It's a very different, but great movie. After watching for a while, you will completely forget all about the non-existing doors and walls. Give it a go, and you won't be sorry!</fullReview>

Hopefully without spoolers: fantastic acting by all, not only Kidman (the lack of decors makes that only more noticeable), but what really makes it outstanding is the build-up to a very strong - but painful - conclusion. It is impossible not to relate with our antagonist and it will keep you thinking about questions like: "Does it pay off to be good?", "How do we define good", "can one sparrow bring the spring"?

		<fullReview>This film is completely packed with symbols and it should be perceived in that way. Those who are insulted with its content on the surface have apparently missed all the depth of this work of art.People are just imperfect, that is the point the film is trying to make. We can even poetically say that evil lays in every person, and when circumstances allow us, we will sometimes react as animals led by our passions. What happened in numerous wars especially during the 20th century is the best illustration of this thesis. Even the character of a young philosopher and writer on human morality, Tom Edison, who is not like others in the beginning, gave up and started to manifest his own bad manners. It is an interesting fact that the more people are doing immoral deeds, the more they are acceptable for them.So we are all gray, nothing is black and white ? and terrible crimes can happen literary everywhere. It contradicts common good guys/bad guys Hollywood philosophy, and good nations/bad nations politicians' doctrine, which is often an excuse for killing people and starting a war.From the beginning of the film, Grace refuses to accept the truth about human imperfection and, instead of that, escapes in her fictional heaven and collects figurines as a proof that she really found one. But, that idea, colliding with reality, is as fragile as the ceramic figurines when they are smashed into the ground. Grace acts childishly until the very end, when she realizes there is the dark side of the town and decides to behave in accordance with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dogville" is a new kind of film to me. The film is presented like a play in the theater. The benefits of film techniques are forsaken. But that helps the film. It becomes classical. You are free to fill the detail yourself. It becomes timeless and surreal. The story is simple. A beautiful girl takes shelter in a town named Dogville. Some people and police are looking for her. Tom, a young idealist helps her to settle there. Initially it goes o.k. But problems seem to intensify. The real drama begins. Things begin to change rapidly.I feel spellbound after watching the film. The film attracts my attention with its very different story telling technique, as if I am watching a novel written by Thomas Hardy on the stage. As the story progresses, I doubt, if I am witnessing an old Christian play, or if it is an Italian mafia story. There is so much left to the viewer to interpret and imagine.Dogville is a film to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have tried not to spoiler anything, but I think I pretty much gave away the mood of the film. As I am an acting student, for me this movie was especially interesting to see: the mix of camera acting and acting on a stage must be very challenging for the actors, yet they manage to give a very good performance. The story itself is quite depressing, it shows how even the most regular people can turn to evil actions when they are put in a position of power. The evolution of the village Dogville and its inhabitants goes ahead in an achingly slow pace. The more so the movie is an uneasy experience and you are constantly hoping the events will make a turn for the better, as you are struggling and suffering with the main character. I liked that picture very much and I can recommend it to everyone. That said, I think that everyone who is in any way interested in film should give it a try, as the concept of filming it differs so much from the common movies we see.</fullReview>

Also the themes are wonderful--understanding our humanity, inhumanity and our limits. The execution of the concept works too. However the movie is too long. It belabors the idea of human nature being a little more complicated then we'd like to admit. There is something about it that makes me feel as if everyone involved in the production is trying too hard. If you are into movies that make you reflect on your own biases and motivations then this is the movie for you.

		<fullReview>I must say I like the pure audacity to present thing in the way without scenery. Yet, it catches the attention just in first few minutes of the film, and all other time it is sheer distraction. How come director did not see it? I am troubling myself with that question now, I still did not find an answer. Actors are good, very good. Acting is almost perfect, or should I say, their acting could be seen almost perfectly on the screen. The whole arrangement provoked me to write something of it. Some parts are true perfection, yet on some parts it seems as it was overlooked, as if somebody did not pay much attention to it, as for example, lights are not directed to actors, you can not really see what is going on, etc... It does not make sense that it looks more real, because when there is not scenery, it does not look more like reality, just like plain theater on the screen. Was it on purpose? I know Lars's films as a type when you go to the cinema, people leave early, before ending, or start coughing, or grouching, or just take their balance on other side of the body, making noises with the chair, unintentionally. Overall rate is OK, I think viewers estimated this one well. A little distant from perfection, yet it had a promising beginning.</fullReview>

We get to understand the whole story and suddenly we get in touch with the revengeful core we have inside ourselves.I think it's a film that shows how much evil can be found inside people. Jealousy, envy, hypocrisy and the desire to take advantage of someone who needs help. The main character is nothing but nice and sweet, yet she's seen as dangerous to everyone. The only reason is everyone kept abusing her, what brought light to their unseen failures.It reminded me of Allegory of the Cave in a few moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film transposes the concept of ignored transparency beautifully. It is something we all engage in, rather egregiously, yet it is difficult to see if portrayed so vividly. There is indeed destruction behind beauty, and despite conscious efforts and wishes to see something modified into a supposedly "better" condition, it becomes clear that the unconscious desire will ultimately wreak havoc, especially when aided by a dysfunctional and envious mass mentality. Unintegration prevailed, and when a unifying force showed up in Dogville, one that could make the town actually unite in something positive (the admiration and appreciation of Grace's presence), the threat of disintegration ensued, and she needed to be destroyed and incorporated into the unintegrated structure. There truly are no walls to hold us in, we are all very knowing and aware of what goes on in the minds and bodies of our fellow man, and truly the structures we edify are illusory and used as defense mechanisms so as to not have to identify with the perverse nature of others we see in ourselves. This movie begets the question alluded to at the end, which I interpreted as "is this town real?" (reinforced by the drawing of the dog becoming real at that moment), and truly it is, real in every individual psychic microcosm as an intolerable reality; one may even sympathize with the murderous mobsters at the end wiping out the hapless people. There really is no escape from this labyrinth of twisted logic, we really are primitive beings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh man. Dogville.Initially, I was completely confused. I thought it was some weird introduction, establishing some kind of idea that I needed to reflect upon throughout the film, but then what confused me stayed, and stayed, and stayed...and as the movie commenced, it didn't confuse me anymore. I got that it was a statement on the nature of small towns. I thought it was a really profound idea, and it only made me love the movie more. It was a huge risk by director Lars von Trier, but it really worked. He has my respect, for sure.The only thing I wasn't too fond of was the narration. Nope. Some old guy that's not even a character in the film? Just a random person? Yeah, I could have gone without that. I mean, it kinda helped establish the tone, the simple country living setting, but I still didn't like it. I would have gotten that tone anyway.The story was brilliant, unlike anything I have ever seen before. The movie had some slow pieces, but I didn't mind. It established the characters and the situation, and then the second half of the movie really, really picked up. von Trier used some really great techniques in shooting this film. I was incessantly impressed. It is truly a beautiful portrait of human nature. It's sad, it's delightful, it breeds hope, it satisfies the need for vengeance, it provokes thought.Ahh, what a beautiful film. I own this and I'm really happy that I do. I definitely recommend it. But keep in mind, this can definitely be described as "unique" or "experimental filmmaking". It took a bit to get used to it, but it's possible. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed and written by Lars Von Trier, the movie "Dogville" is based a small, pleasant, rural community in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. During the Great Depression, a girl named Grace, played by Nicole Kidman, flees from a neighboring city that is full of gangsters and violence. Met by Tom Edison, Jr., played by Paul Bettney, he devises a plan to help her get accepted among the heartfelt citizens of Dogville. She is considered a missing person and a criminal, and the people of this small town will not harbor her without a price. They say they have nothing to do, but work her hard to hide her among their tight knit community. With the police constantly coming into their town tensions rise to an all time high. They blackmail Grace and get everything they want out of her and keep her prisoner before turning her into the gangsters she had originally ran from. The ending unexpectedly gives Grace the power again, ending in a violent explosion of emotions.Lars Von Trier played on the fear of Americans during the Great Depression. He was either trying to expose the truth of humanity in a sense that we let authority control us; we are easily manipulated. The fact that we are suspicious of people we do not know even if they are from the same country or area. We are all capable to be selfish and violent people. For example the characters in this movie are more worried about money and revenge to such an extent as to torture, forgetting their moral and ethical values completely. The way that this movie was made was very low budget and filmed on a single stage. I love the way that he depicts the simple town in such a simple manor. I do not agree that the American population would go to such extremes with the hatred displayed in this movie. I also do not believe that we are inherently violent people, but being human we are easily corrupted by authority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville: A Different Sort of Hospitality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts slow and stays that way. It has a long run-time, limited musical accompaniments, a single, static set and a dark melancholy plot line. That said, if one is patient enough (or just interested enough in John Hurt's magnificent narration) there is a gem to be found here.Nicole Kidman plays the role of Grace, a young woman who wanders into the town of Dogville after a series of gunshots had echoed in the distance. There she encounters a different sort of small-town hospitality. After a two-week probationary period the town agrees to shelter her from the law and from the gangsters she had been running away from.The set for the film consists of very little. Many of the items are no more than labeled chalk outlines, described in greater detail by the story's narrator. No walls stand around the houses, allowing the viewer to see the entirety of the characters' lives much the way they would in a novel where the narrator is omniscient. The openness of the town aids in relating the progression of the view of the characters from merely suspicious small town folk, into truly despicable human beings who are more than willing to take advantage of a person to the point of blackmailing her into becoming a slave to be chained and raped. Perhaps the best example is provided in the foreshadowing statement made by the character of Chuck (Stellan Skarsg?rd ) who said: "I've found out that people are the same all over. Greedy as animals. In a small town they're just a bit less successful. Feed 'em enough, they'll eat till their bellies burst." Paul Bettany's character of Thomas Edison is only one who seems to be on the fence of love for Grace and his own self-perseveration. Ironically, and painfully for Tom, Grace is had by all the men of the community save he, who she assures she loves. This sexual frustration only adds to his already strong feelings of inadequacy that he has developed in his failings a writer. Eventually he calls the gangsters and has Grace locked in her room, hoping to profit from the endeavor and leave the painful problem of Grace in his past. When the gang arrives and it discovered that the leader (played by James Caan) is actually her father, Grace has a decision to make: Does she forgive the flaws of the people of Dogville, or does she punish them for the terrible crimes they have committed?The film masterfully builds tension ever so slowly, but its real strength is in the depth of the characters who the viewer can sympathize with in one moment and despise the next. These contradictions make the Grace's final decision all the more real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shattering perception of society and human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the beginning, there was Dogville. A peaceful town in the U.S, somewhere in the Rockies; the inhabitants living calmly and without the bothers of the outside world. By the end, the town and the people are shattered, each person baring their teeth, exposing their mortal flaws and getting retribution.Lars Von Trier's work is a curious exercise in film. Having seen many of his and his compatriots' films, I was astounded by what can be achieved when human emotions are laid raw on the table and portrayed so honestly and explicitly.Every Dogme film i've seen has exceptional heartbreaking performances and everyone here manages some of their best work. For some reason, the directing and sparseness all contribute to intense and powerful portrayalsThis is Von Trier's first time working with an all American cast and his pulls bravura performances out of every one of them including Nicole Kidman. Out of the highly talented cast Bettany's Edison is tender, perceptive, and charming. Bacall's (at 79!) Ma Ginger is leery, judicious, and astute. Gazzara, Clarkson, Skarsg?rd and Sevigny are all benevolent, sensitive, ferocious and unrelenting.The film uses sparse and coarse sets set up like a game of Cluedo where we can see all that is happening to the people at once. This sets up some interesting ironies throughout the film. In society, norms exists so that people treat each other with respect and kindness. But "behind closed doors". What we choose to disclose to people and how much of our lives are secret, to protect others or protect ourselves. One of the big mysteries of the film concerns Grace and what she did in her past life. She is given a rebirth in this town and the opportunity to make them better people, but can people be improved?The lack of superfluous direction "tricks" and visual effects only intensifies the performances and gives the characters nowhere to hide. Furthermore, you pay attention to what is most important in the film - what they are feeling and what they do about it.The film has been explicitly made about America and the end credits confirm this, but as I see it the qualities that the people develop could be occurring anywhere and for any civilisation. Betrayal, treachery, blackmail, sorrow. It is shocking that everyone one of us can be pushed to these limits given the opportunity. Seeing the dynamics of the characters within the film how they have changed by the climax was truly terrifying. It think it exposes human nature and the cause of wars, violence, racism and segregation in our evolution as communities.I saw it again last night after first watching it in the cinemas on it's original release. Once again I was entranced by these characters, taken in by their hospitality and the mysteries that exists behind the walls. The acting by everyone floored me and I was shattered by the end. you can If you watch the film with an open mind, there is a lot to think about and a lot of beauty in the storytelling and design. Take whatever meaning you want from it; the emotions are all there on display. This is a powerful self-reflective experience on society and definitely makes you think about what we are today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will rip your heart out and force you to consider it's content - Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are a true lover of cinema, or rather thought-provoking stories, which is what good cinema is...You must see this film. It has a very unique set-up as all of it is shot on a soundstage with chalk lines drawn to represent a very small town in early 20th century Colorado. So there is a great amount of attention placed on the actors and it is mostly up to them to bring a sense of place to the movie. The cast is Phenomenal and do an excellent job creating the characters and the sense of place and time. There is message about kindness and one's sense of boundaries; where is the line drawn on "turning the other cheek" when others inflict harm on a person? This movie is as emotionally painful as "Breaking the Waves" and as poignant. May it touch you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Von Trier is definitely an artist who works on film and who appreciates theatre and theatre actors. Truly brilliant and great.Dogville is an unrelentingly depressing piece. Using a film studio like a black box stage, the production here is unique, fantastic, and eerily beautiful.Unfortunately, the story makes noir look bright by comparison; with a conclusion that all people are vile and selfish at heart. If you want to convince yourself that now is the night for suicide, here's your film. Any story elements are trumped by the production as a whole, but I get very tired of rape being used as a plot device and a stand in for the ills of society instead of really creating a more full story. Even though I did not like the dark vision, I do expect the author to be true to it, and the end of this film felt like a total sell out. Nicole Kidman, both highly regarded and yet still underrated actress of incredible gifts slinks through the abstract town in a long black cloak like Skeletor. The cast is peopled with big name stars and familiar faces who clearly wanted to do this ensemble piece as a rare chance to flex their legit acting chops, but this would have fared better with stage actors with "unknown" faces who don't carry the baggage of having been on the cover of "Vanity Fair" last month, especially the ubiquitous Clarkson and the always leaden Chloe Sevigny. One joy of watching film is being able to joyfully extol the film you've just seen. I can only recommend this film to two actor friends who like extreme work, and even so, I have to warn them it is a hateful story. It is a real disappointment that our most brilliant artists are focusing with such narrow vision on the worst the world has to offer. I understand this is a trilogy. I'll pass on the other parts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, choppy story line</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will not write a long review about the movie - a lengthy movie deserves a short review. I just watched Dogville on DVD with friends. The fact that we watched it from the beginning to the end without any 'witty' comments shows that we all appreciated the very good acting. It is really excellent. Other reviewers have written in detail about most of the aspects of this movie, so I will not repeat that. The only thing that I want to say here is that the story line shows some annoying breaches. To me it is clear that Grace offers to do odd jobs for the community. But it is not at all clear to me why the people of this town suddenly want her to do twice as much for half the money, after the "Wanted" poster was nailed to the wall. The story suddenly heads in a direction that can not be explained out of the previous behaviour of the people. The same thing happens again when Grace tries to escape. Why was she brought back, anyway? Why does everyone, and I mean everyone, start to take advantage of her? And why does nobody object to that? It's inexplicable. The third breach is in the finale. To prevent spoilers I will not go into detail, but everyone who saw the movie knows what I am talking about. Why does she do that? And why does she without any regret in the end take the side of the man who was the reason for her to flee to Dogville? The change of behaviour is too abrupt; the story did not convince me that these were inevitable, natural changes. It makes the flow of the story line choppy. To bad, because the actors deserved better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stage play masquerading as movie but good ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this film/theater experience, I read some reviews claiming it was anti-American or Americans hated it. But then why were so many American actors in it, including the legendary Bacall and James Caan. After finishing this 3 hour stage play, which concluded with some unflattering depression era photos to the tune of David Bowie's "Young Americans", I found the anti-American sentiment wasn't really justified. The first hour begins with a narrator introducing the town and townspeople of Dogville. Tom (Paul Bettany) is Dogville's spokesperson. Tom meets Grace (Kidman) and helps her escape from some gangsters. He introduces Grace to the townspeople and tells them Grace's predicament. The story then proceeds with overbearing narration, and is told through "chapters", almost like visualizing a book on tape.The movie set or lack thereof is that of a stage. Now, I've always liked theater actors, they're raw and inspired and that's what I liked about the bare scenery in this "film", the actors had to "improvise" their actions, of closing a door, of raking leaves and this is one of the positive things in the movie. But by the 2nd hour when after the "townspeople" show Grace their true colors and they treat her with indifference and humiliate her, including all the town's male population raping her, I started to feel a little bit of that "hatred". It seemed the harassment would never cease and Tom was just a wimp. The only reason for not stopping the film was "Grace's surprise". Indeed, when James Caan, finally appears, and an extremely engaging argument between Grace (Kidman) and The Big Man (Caan) about "arrogance" takes place, viewing Dogville in its entirety became worthwhile. If the United States can be criticized for one thing, it's "arrogance", though in this film the "arrogance" was about people in general.Dogville is a drama on a sound stage and has fine acting from Kidman. Caan was good too but Bacall was underused. The rest of the ensemble cast as standard theater actors, were methodical but effective. Anyone who wants to view a "unique" film, should give Dogville a chance, but be prepared, there is a lot of unpleasantness. 7.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember so long ago my mother's friends gave him two film to watch. one of them was Dogville (and the other Requiem for a Dream) my mother watched them both and said to me (on Dogville) it was very impressive, it kicked me so hard. she spoke of the realities and the facts which the director put in the very language of simplicity in an atmosphere of a little - symbolic, fantastic and imaginary - town. she said it is dealing with human being properties. she said "some men choose to live in a their solitude, in a closed world which they build in their mind and their around because they think this way they would do good, not anymore sins, neither having any temptation... but someday this mind is going to open (something alien will be pushed in there somehow) and it's just then that it began to reveal that all of the considered innocence is just an dead illusion. after that he will fall into the very darkness he was escaping from and sooner or later will the time will come for them to fall dead..." I didn't see the film back then, but i did after a while (I knew the theme of the film, she had told me the story in a way) and I felt bored. Good God, what's the obligation to be so hard about such a manner, in such a complete steady atmosphere. you must be very patient with this movie. i couldn't feel so good after the film: it was a long not interesting movie (you can see "Once upon a Time in America", "Barry Lyndon" or "Cinema Paradiso" to know what a long extraordinary film means) and I'm not very fond of this kind of ideas (I studied them so long ago) but you may like it and may be love it... but be patient with the film. and if you're looking for new ideas in cinematography you can find something new and special here in this movies (not a very good using of such a idea but still so rare and new), a combination of theater, pantomime and cinema !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a 3 hour running time and an unpromising start we nearly gave up on this one, but it is well worth giving the film half an hour or so to explain itself. The set is chalk lines drawn on the floor, and at first you may view this as the emperor clearly parading naked; that this is dogma inspired artistic film flam. But quickly the purpose is revealed; this is a town whose walls are self imposed, where the opaque is made transparent because of collective apathy. The ultimate moral is that morality is a fake, that all that stands between the meek and the tyrannous is the opportunity. It's not exactly depressing though, more salutary - Von Trier's storytelling technique so perfectly captures the theme that it is difficult to disagree with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came across this movie a while back, but I wasn't able to acquire it for some time due to its limited distribution. Finally I bought the movie on DVD, without any thought at all, and I have to say that it was amazing. The writing and the style that was used ie. play like features, had me going throughout the entire almost 3 hour long film.The story of a woman running from her trouble to a small town in rural-town, USA is not new to many of us. But the look upon the effect in which Grace has on the town folk is very interesting.I myself am American and took no offense to the ideas of greed, hate, and downright self loathing of each other. This in a sense is us. America was created by violence and most likely will be destroyed by the same thing. I'm quite interested in seeing a documentary on what Americans believe what the "American Life" is truly about and in turn seeing what non-Americans think as well. This movie is coming from a non-American and its quite obvious how he feels about us.Even then though, the acting is wonderful. The concept is something I haven't seen before. And the writing is as I said before wonderful. See this movie you won't regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I disagree with many of the film critics' comments about this movie. I don't see it as anti-American at all; in fact, one of the characters (Chuck, I believe), says to Grace that people are the same everywhere you go. Presumably, this means it's not just Americans von Trier is condemning but people in general. I've heard he dislikes the U.S., but even if that's true, I don't really care. Everything that happens in this film is real. People can be petty, vindictive, suspicious, small-minded, and just plain mean. The ball-and-chain thing was exaggerated to make a point, but even that isn't so far-fetched--we've all read about parents who chained their kid to a radiator. Roger Ebert says in his review, "I doubt that we have any villages where the helpless visitor would eventually be chained to a bed and raped by every man in town." Well, Roger, the town had only around 15 or 16 people, not counting the young children. Are you so naive as to think that a group of 15 people isn't capable of doing this? I wonder what world you're living in.At first, I wasn't certain that the filming of the movie as a play, the chalk drawings, etc., added anything to the movie. But after thinking about it, I've changed my mind. The stage set made everything seem more closed and gave a very claustrophobic feeling, which has to be what the director intended.The acting was superb, and while I've never been a big Nicole Kidman fan, this is the best performance I've seen from her. Even though the movie was three hours, I wasn't bored. But if you like action-oriented films, don't bother with this one. This film is more about ideas.Dogville is the kind of movie that stays with you. The ending was extremely powerful. Just as I changed my mind about the stagey filming, I also changed my mind about the ending. I initially thought it was impossible that Grace could have reversed herself that quickly. One minute she was talking about the town's humanity, making excuses for their behavior by saying that she might have done the same things, and discussing forgiveness--and about two minutes later, she gave the order to destroy the town. But after thinking about it, I realized that Grace didn't change. She was that way all along. She said she was running away from someone, but that someone was herself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harsh truth about the human condition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is interesting to me that it takes a foreigner like Von Trier or Ang Lee to cut through all the BS and make films that go to the heart of some portion of the American condition. While "Dogville" could have been made about any country in any period, setting it in Depression-era America made it more relevant to an American audience, whether they liked it or not. I liked it.When Grace's father talks about people accepting responsibility for their flaws instead of being given a free pass for them, I nearly cheered. Grace's willingness to forgive and excuse is at the heart of the liberal world view. Carried to extremes -- as Grace has done -- it is a sickness. I was pleased to see her cured. I might have spared the children -- I'm an American; children are held dear and often blameless. It's a flaw, I know, but Von Trier can move beyond it.I sat in my office at home and watched the film from midnight to three in the morning, unable to turn it off or to turn away from the harsh truths on stark display. Everyone in the cast gave praiseworthy performances and anyone who thinks Kidman is just a pretty face needs to see this performance and be proved dead wrong.I'd recommend this film to anyone with a willingness to face hard truths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>gives us a grim outlook on humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/Script: Lars Von Trier, Cast: Nicole Kidman (Grace), Paul Bettany(Tom Edison), Lauren Bacall (Ma Ginger), Jeremy Davis (Bill Hensen), Chloe Sevigny (Liz Hensen), Ben Gazzara (Jack Mckay), Blair Brown (Mrs. Henson), Patricia Clarkson (Vera), Philip Baker Hall (Tom Edison Sr.), Harriet Andersson (Gloria), Siobhan Fallon (Martha), Zeljko Ivanek (Ben), Cleo King (Oliva), Bill Raymond (Mr. Henson), Stellan Skarsgard (Chuck), Shauna Shim (June), John Hurt (Narrator) This very unique and controversial film is a study of human characters. The main character in this film is Gloria. She runs away from her gangster lord father because she does not like the injustices she had seen him inflict on people. Finally free, she ends up at a small village in the Colorado Rockies called 'Dogville'. She is taken in by these seemly hospitable, friendly country folk. They agree to a trial stay of two weeks with the understanding that she will perform simple chores for the town folk in exchange for her stay. What we are shown as time goes on is that these people are no better than her father's gangsters. The injustice they inflict on her is just as bad as the injustices her father had inflicted on people. The townspeople do not know about her secret past. They are going to pay for their injustices.This film is not like any other I have seen. It is not a motion picture but a filmed stage play. As such, it is very plot driven. The powerful performances of the actors makes up for the lack of scenery. It is a film that forces you to use your imagination much like reading a novel. I was thinking about this film for a long time after I saw it. Many people perceive this as an Anti- American film. Lars Von Trier is a Danish film maker and I have heard that he holds anti-American views. The setting for this story is the depression era of the 1930's. As the credits roll at the film's end, actual depression era photographs are shown while the Bowie song 'Young Americans' plays. I actually think the setting of this film is irrelevant. What happened in this town could have happened anywhere in the world. I think what Von Trier was trying to show is that most people are s**t and not to be trusted. The fact that just about everyone in the town exploits her is evidence of this. He does not portray humanity in a very positive light.I thought the performances in this film was top rate. It took a little bit of watching to get used to this style of film making but after a while you get so into the acting that it doesn't matter that the movie is filmed on a stage with simple sets. I actually think it worked in the films favor. This was a very dark film with some shocking moments. It is amazing how Von Trier and all the performers where able to pull it off without all the fancy production. I think Nicole Kidman gives one of her best performances here. Lauren Bacall, a seasoned actress who was very striking in her time, plays Ma Ginger. Other notable actors in this film were Ben Gazzara and Chloe Sevigny. Every actor was outstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look Out Flaubert, Here Comes Lars Von Trier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is everything a Lars Von Trier film should be - experimental, enigmatic, high-minded. Von Trier is one of the handful of today's filmmakers who have the potential to unleash a masterpiece at any moment, and though Dogville may not qualify, it does at least demonstrate that the spark is there, the willingness to try crazy things, to play with form, to break every rule of what is normally regarded as good cinema. Though not officially a Dogme film, Dogville does expand upon one of Dogme's central precepts, the idea that in cinema less is more. Austerity is an unavoidable word when dealing with the stripped-down style of Dogme; though the energies may seem anything but austere in a work like Festen or The Idiots, the means are, and the effect is of a work more pure, less dependent on artifice than your typical film. In Dogville, Von Trier turns this whole notion of austerity on its head, using extreme stylization, extreme artificiality, in creating a new, non-Dogme form of purity, an effect that in one way is nothing like what the true Dogme films achieve, but in another way is a distillation, an intensification, of what the Dogme works were always trying for. The idea was always to go deeper, to get beyond the melodramatic surface of things and root around in the muck, the mire of existence. You can argue all day whether the Dogme crowd ever achieved their objective - it's valid to say that the deliberate rejection of artifice can come to represent simply a new form of fakeness - but one thing is for sure: Lars Von Trier sure knows how to root around in muck and mire.Von Trier has taken a trick from experimental theater and applied it to movie-making; he's eliminated all but the barest essentials from his sets, laying out his setting, a Depression-era town high in the Colorado Rockies, as a diagram on a black surface and adding essential props and other features (mainly things relevant to the story). The walls of Dogville's houses are literally painted lines; the gooseberry bushes that become central to the plot are little puffy outlines like in an architectural drawing, and the bell-tower of the local mission hangs in mid-air, eerily disembodied. About this (mostly) wall-less, roofless "set" stir the denizens of Dogville, a cheerless lot of cast-offs and odd-balls whose daily activities are noted, their characters gleaned from said activities, by the aspiring writer Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), who lives with his hypochondriac father Tom Edison, Sr. (Philip Baker Hall), and pines after the one local flirt, the sarcastic Liz (Chloe Sevigny). Tom fancies himself the town's conscience; he organizes meetings to lecture on morality, the townspeople indulging him presumably because there's nothing better to do (Dogville is basically one road, a shop, a mission, a couple houses, an abandoned mill and silver mine and an apple orchard). The darker, more depressive side of the town is embodied by Chuck (Stellan Skarsgard), a surly apple-grower, who lives with his learned wife and gaggle of bratty kids, but spends most of his time with his apples. The town's most mysterious resident is a recluse named McKay (Ben Gazzara), who hides in his living room so no one will know he's blind - most mysterious, that is, until the arrival of the beautiful and mystifying Grace.The story is laid out as nine chapters and a prologue with headings, giving it the quality of a 19th Century novel; but there are other ways in which the movie reminds us of some classic by Flaubert or Hardy, the main one being the heroine, Grace, who could've been created by one of the aforementioned masters. Grace is a character loaded with all sorts of novelistic contradictions; she's dangerous yet vulnerable, cold yet soulful, submissive yet willful. She's played by Nicole Kidman as a kind of alien intruder; she comes to the drearily predictable world of Dogville and immediately starts stirring up the sediment, muddying the deceptively placid waters. At first the townspeople react charitably toward Grace, allowing her to stay despite the possible danger to themselves from the gangsters who want her; Grace makes herself available to do odd-jobs, and the people willingly partake of this service, but as people's resentful feelings toward Grace emerge, the tasks she's called on to perform start becoming more like trials. Von Trier takes great delight in peeling away the kindly surfaces of the townsfolk to reveal the avarice and perversion lurking beneath. On one hand this is completely snotty, this gleeful unmasking of hypocrisy, but on the other hand it is smashingly entertaining. The engine behind all of it, besides Von Trier's ever-provocative intellect and fruitful imagination, is Nicole Kidman, whose performance justifies a lot of the praise that's been heaped on her throughout her career. It's amazing how complex, how startlingly focused Kidman's acting is. Her intensity seems to burn up everything around her; she sears a hole right through the middle of Von Trier's diagrammatic, vortex-like film.Like a great heroine of 19th Century literature, Grace becomes captivating and elusive, but unlike one of those great heroines she never quite becomes a martyr. She seems on the way to becoming one for awhile, but the story finally turns inside-out, and the inevitable end never comes to pass. In this way the film goes against form; Von Trier begins a film version of a 19th Century-style dissection of society, complete with Flaubert-like peasants and Hardyesque tortured intellectuals, then takes a more sensational, modern sort of turn. Maybe the film doesn't come all the way together in the end - maybe the finale is unnecessary, a concession - but when it hums it really hums, and the way it bores deeper into its characters' souls, into the complex interactions between people with something to hide, is surprisingly worthy of the parallels to Flaubert, Hardy and Eliot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Dogville the other day, actually rather hurriedly, as I wanted to see it before I saw Manderlay (which is reviewed elsewhere) at the film festival here. I had heard so much about this film, I couldn't really wait to see this, as I am a big Von Trier fan. Dogville stars Nicole Kidman as Grace, a woman-on-the-run from the authorities who seeks shelter in a quiet mountain town (no Cartman though). The residents of the town agree to take her in. provided that she do a little bit of community service. However, as more of her past starts to come to light, the community wants more service, sil vous plait.While this is not the top-tier bracket of what Von Trier has done, I really enjoyed this film. Kidman is dynamite as usual, and well, what can I say, Paul Bettany again proves he's one of the best actors around today. Also in for the ride are Patricia Clarkson, Lauren Bacall, James Caan, and Von Trier-stalwarts Udo Kier and Jean-Marc Barr. Definitely not for everyone, (heavens, I didn't even mention the movie takes place on a soundstage, with chalk drawn walls!) Dogville will get you talking, and hopefully hyped for the next chapter, Manderlay (note, don't hold your breath).</fullReview>

That's right, its all shot on one stage and houses, orchard, etc, are made out of chalk outlines - there are no walls or doors. You can see everyone in their houses at all times, though the film pretends there are walls and doors in the way.*End of possible spoiler* I found this bit hard to comprehend at first, plus reading negative opinions by half the people that hated the format, I was about to switch off. But the other half of the people that loved it mentioned the storyline was great as was the acting. Nicole Kidman was indeed brilliant and the rest of the cast did not disappoint either.There was a narrative throughout the film read by John Hurt, whose voice added to the polished finish of the movie. Some places in the movie were starting to get a little tough to digest but there was never a moment where you thought you had to just fast forward to get on with it.The ending was quite decent and the moral of the story stood firm. To be honest the film could have quite easily been shot in an actual depressing, remote shanty town rather than the format chosen by the director (I thought his chosen format was a bit arty farty and probably pretentious for my liking - yet I give him credit for his bravery to try it out). Overall I gave the film a 7 but could quite easily have given it an 8 for the comments in the previous sentence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could be a very strange film to some, considering it is filmed on a stage set and is improvised in some scenes. Please don't be deterred though, this is an exceptional piece of acting and storytelling. The director Lars Von Trier has somehow captured the brutal and sometimes ugly nature of people in a township named 'Dogville'. It could be any town (in real life) for that matter, the truth unfolding as the story is being told of an outsider needing help. As we (the viewer) examine the extent of human nature and the injustice we can bestow on a person, we realize it's not very far from the truth to our own everyday lives. Who know, we could stumble upon a situation just like this in the future? The story is very simple, but the undertones and morality are not. There is a lesson to be learnt by this film, indeed a very soul searching one at that. The portrayal of a township being tested on a daily basis (from the instant a stranger presents herself (Kidman)) for self worthiness to exist. How and why do we judge others??? ?.I interpreted the story basically from a good v evil perspective. The final chapter will certainly leave you wondering. 8.5/10 ?.highly recommended.</fullReview>

If a film is going to deliberately evoke the theater like this, it's going to be held to a theatrical standard.As much as I like the idea of the super-simplistic sets and props used in this film -- at least as an intellectual exercise -- I found it to have been taken to such an extreme that it was distracting. Like most moviegoers I'm willing to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours, but this took it too far, much like some action movies that go beyond improbable stunts and effects to physically impossible stunts and effects. Even as I was engrossed in the plot and the predicament of Nicole Kidman's character I couldn't completely ignore all this.Another flaw in this film is the excessive use of voice-over. Voice-over is used to convey information that for one reason or another is not conveyed through set and dialogue. Some of the voice-over in this movie is justified by the lack of information conveyed by the sets, but too much voice-over means there's something wrong with the sets (already discussed) or the script. I wasn't aware that Dogme allows the use of voice-over (an inherently unnatural and often obtrusive technique), but this film illustrates why a revisited Dogme (05?) should probably disallow it.Having mentioned improbability, let's come back to that. I find it unlikely that an entire town of real people anywhere in America (or the world, for that matter) would behave in the coarse and cruel manner that these people did. I have no hesitation to criticize the coarseness, ignorance and insensitivity of American culture when I see it, but if this was indeed intended as a commentary specifically on America then it simply doesn't work. Does von Trier really think that people in Bangladesh or Slovenia -- or Denmark, for that matter -- are not equally capable of such cruel and insensitive behavior? I certainly hope that the hype about this movie's intent is wrong on this point.The level on which this movie does work, however, is as a morality play about human nature in general. Despite the above criticisms, I really wanted to like this film, and found the story and acting compelling. It could have worked spectacularly if the set issues hadn't been so intrusive. 7/10.So far I like the idea of Dogme, but this one's still too stagey and still too obviously an intellectual exercise. For a Dogme film in which the plot and characters are able to truly flourish within the confines of the genre (at least after the first 15 minutes) I heartily recommend "Italian for Beginners."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I forgot it was a play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first rented this movie, I had no idea it was a play. So when I began watching it and saw the simple stage setup, I was convinced I wouldn't last more than 15 minutes. Three hours later I found myself mesmerized by an amazing movie. After the first couple scenes, I completely forgot I was watching a play. This movie is so dark, and so disturbing, yet so strangely satisfying. A truly unique movie. I'm finished with my review, but IMDb demands that I fill this with 10 lines of text. I don't know why they insist on wasting my time and yours. What else can I say? Let's see. Dogville is cool. Yay for Dogville. There. 10 lines.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seem to be a lot of negative reactions to this film, but I think the fact that it provokes a strong reaction at all is a good thing. I didn't sleep well after i watched this movie; it hit me like a blow to the stomach.Sure, it's long, boring, and depicts humanity in an excessively dark light.But frankly, I think it's a good counterbalance to all the crap films full of one-dimensional characters who are either good, bad, or fashionably flawed. The fact is each of us is equally capable of both kindness and cruelty, and the line between the two rapidly disintegrates when self-interest is involved. The ultra-minimal setting made this film a serious chore to watch, but it put the focus on the characters; I'm not sure it would have worked so well with a more "realistic" backdrop. All in all, this film is well worth the effort. It's not the kind of thing you can watch twice, but both the story and the approach are unique enough to earn my recommendation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In some of Lars's recent films (dogville &amp; dancer in the dark) he doesn't say that they are dome95 films but they follow many of the rules regarding camera use, props and lighting. So is he just trying to make the best movies he can or is he selling out to the typically American ideas of what a movie should be i.e. murder, violence weapons etc. Was "the vow of chastity" holding him back? he started this movement then just shrugs it off as if it were nothing important. don't get me wrong i think LvT is the most important contemperary directors we have, I'm just a little bit confused as to why he made dogville and d.i.t.d the way he did, knowingly breaking the rules of dogme95 but adopting many of them as well. They are both amazing, groundbreaking films nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humanity unveiled??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that just won't leave you when it ends. At first I thought it was curious that the staging was "play-like" but soon had forgotten it due to the story itself. It contains enough truth to keep reeling the viewer in, but is it "The Way Things Are" in the world, or is it only one man's opinion?There is certainly a grain in truth that humans will often press their advantage over the powerless. It has been seen from Selma, AL to present day Sudan. And we are capable of the most evil of behaviors against the powerless. Some people are a little evil, some a lot.The director seems to see men as the most capable of true evil; rape and betrayal unto death. The women smash pottery and are catty at worst, **(spoiler)**at least until "The End". So Grace learns that "Dog eat Dog" or "Tough Love" is the rule of the mortal jungle. The author saying it's really a learning experience for Dogvillians, a clear example as Tom says.What is most interesting about it, was my reaction to it. Although the lengths the townfolk went to were absurd by the end, the tire chain and daily rape and all, I couldn't help by be amazed by the satisfaction I felt in seeing the town "lit up". Why are we so ghoulishly delighted by seeing people get what they deserve? It said more about me than about Grace. Where does this sense of "justice" and "revenge" come from in us?The movie did resonate with me in that I know several Republicans who have expressed to me that the world is exactly Dogville and I am wasting my time being a Liberal. Interstingly, they are all women who have had real-life Grace type experiences, abused, beaten down types, who have learned not to trust the world to give them anything but more of the same. I saw them reflected in the hardening of Grace into her final state. Thus I re-name this movie "A Republican is Born". There is a little bit of each side, the victim and the victor in all of us as Dogville reminds. I did not find it Anti-American, the nature it described was more "human" than American and it could have been true anywhere on the globe. The montage at the end only rips the mask off the prettyness we like to relate to our country tis of thee.Overall I would recommend it to the thinkers and students of human nature. Quite a case study in humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apple Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one my two favorite Lars vonTriers film, as it is as good as Zentropa(Europa). I didn't like Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves to me was not interesting. Similarly to Dancer in the Dark this film depicts a group of somewhat evil Americans who exploit a young woman. In this case the outcome is very different, but I will not give it away so as not to be a spoiler. In any event my interpretation of the film is that Grace is the apple, and Dogville is the Garden of Eden. Nicole Kidman's performance is surprisingly similar to her performance in "To Die For" except that Grace, the character she plays appears to be much more innocent. The film is extremely unorthodox in that it is filmed as if it were a staged play. The dialogue is what is important, not so much the visuals. In any event it is an allegory to me, an "illustration" of the consequences of "arrogance".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am leery of Lars von Trier since Breaking the Waves...I felt revolted by the message of that movie, which seemed glaring to me. Dogville, however, has less of an anti-woman theme than a power-corrupts theme. It was a truly disturbing movie, nonetheless, especially my reaction to the end - i actually supported her decision!!! eek! it is a 'food for thought' sort of flick. however... the photo montage during the ending credits really bothered me - is he saying that poor, ignorant people are all like the inhabitants of dogville? that's just as bad as the need to physically, morally and emotionally rape women in order for men to survive (which is the theme of Breaking the Waves, in my opinion). I can't really come to a conclusion about this movie, thematically, but i can say without doubt it was visually and viscerally phenomenal, with some of the best performances i've ever seen.view at your own risk</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>arrogance, poverty and revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film on DVD last night. I can't stop thinking about it. The thing that brought the starkness of both its message and appearance into sharp focus for me were those closing images from Jacob Holdts' book "American Pictures".Suddenly, the harsh reality that was hidden from us throughout the film, the severe poverty in which these Dogville characters live, is revealed. Although the poverty is referenced many times through dialogue, narration and the dirty faces of the children, the sad desperation is not really "seen" until the closing credits.Perhaps the director/writer didn't want the audience distracted by the shabby living conditions and the malnourished, overworked inhabitants of a true Dogville. Perhaps he didn't want us to feel pity for the inhabitants of this isolated place. After looking at those vivid and disturbing pictures during the closing credits, I realized that the absolute poverty of this place and these people is almost a character in the film. The film is an interesting study in how absolute power corrupts. It also speaks to how a down-trodden community can be lifted up by a good deed, but how fear perverts a once noble common goal into mob mentality.Sadly, Tom challenges to his townspeople to prove they can be a community instead of a group of people who all happen to live in the same place. His high-minded (judgmental and arrogant) plea is cast upon people who have carefully hidden their perversions, anger, fears and insecurities and the pressure of Tom's challenge cracks the thin veneer very quickly and easily.In addition to the themes on arrogance, pride and small town hypocrisy is the an almost sledge hammer message of revenge and the true powerlessness of the everyday person (especially the poor).I enjoyed the "play" feel of the film. I enjoyed the cast very much; the film is superbly acted. The story extremely thought provoking and insightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Our Town" set in the Twilight Zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised that even Roger Ebert didn't like this film. It was so cerebral, I would have expected him to gush. Well, I don't normally like those talky films that get critical acclaim and offer agonizingly slow story development, but once this gets going, it's fascinating.Much has been said of the film's anti-Americanism, or more particularly, how this is an indictment of modern, fascist Amerika. I guess if you read Moby Dick and believed all the college professor's blather about how the St. Elmo's Fire was a homoerotic orgasm, you'll buy into that anti-American schtick for this movie. Personally, I don't see it. Dogville is some little, isolated Colorado town in the midst of the Depression; it could as easily have been any scared little town trying to maintain its existence in a harsh world doing existential battle against it. We've seen lots of scared little towns like this, with scared little people, on The Twilight Zone. It's a flaw of the human condition, not America.The film is somewhat derivative of some of the intellectual conceits in others, particularly "Rashomon", "Woman in the Dunes" and, explicitly at the end, "The Visit." But it still grabbed me and kept me interested for nearly three hours. Really quite compelling overall, if slow to get going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorable, provocative film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished seeing Dogville for the first time. I found the film very moving in its transmission of human behaviour. Three hours is too little time for the magnitude of the subject, and the result only shows the efficiency of Lars Von Trier as Director. LVT illustrates the main male character, Tom, illustrating ourselves through life, the motivations we have for choosing to do one thing or the other, the justification for our acts that we give to others and to ourselves.The imagery (light, darkness, changing seasons) and the use of sounds (bell, barking, gun shots, unidentified sounds) are very Chekhovian. With, of course, the necessary addition of a more active plot in concordance with our times and the cinematic medium. The acting is superb, spontaneous and precise (and masterfully edited). Nicole Kidman as Grace is a gem. I must say I did not realize that Lauren Bacall (Ma Ginger) and James Caan (The Big Man) were in the film until the credits at the end! There is a rape scene, performed within the transparent walls of a house, which is a stroke of grace (no punch line intended) and most illustrative, to say the least. I also enjoyed the whole business of Grace's frustration at not having anything to do in exchange for the hospitality and the solution found to overcome this by doing things that people didn't do because they found unnecessary! My two reservations are the photo montage at the end, and the vengeance/punishment scene firstly performed by Vera, one of Dogville's townsfolk, and then mirrored most violently by Grace at the very end.On the whole, a memorable and provocative film.</fullReview>

I applaud Ms. Kidman for choosing such a project. Her range is quite broad. The whole cast was excellent. Lars von Trier did a great job in it's statement. Now the negative. The presentation would have been the only thing I'd have changed. I would have liked to see it played out in normal scenes and locations. Maybe not a large production but then not so "Broadway"ish. To me it came across as a play and not a movie. Don't get me wrong... there is nothing wrong with that media if your in the audience.

		<fullReview>I cannot truly say that I liked or disliked the film. Lars Von Trier surprises us once again. At least no one is singing or dancing this time. The fact is that I don't think this is a film. It's a theatre piece. It's like going to a theatre and recording the scenes one after the other. Everything is left to the imagination but is that a film? Nicole Kidman is as poor and vague and detached as usual and maybe she just went to Sweden on holidays to ski, who knows. On the contrary, Ben Gazzarra, Lauren Bacall, James Caan and rest of the crew seem to do the minimum but with such a strong charisma that one can endure the experience of watching the story as it unfolds. Actually, the story is pretty ordinary and very dry, almost an in-between 'early Lars' and 'Dogma Lars'. Not sure.... And also, why would anyone want to watch that again? Give me Tarkovskij any day please Lars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking serious theatre.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will spare the reader another summation of the plot. I have personally read several here and I'm sure most have as well. This film is riveting. It was my impression that it was received similarly by the whole audience in the small room at the Carleton Cinema where I saw it. No one left early. The silence at the end was deafening.To those who have expressed concern about if/how/why the director portrayed the American people I want to say that this is first and formost THEATRE. Theatre is a unique medium for social commentary where one could say that a mirror is placed in front of an audience. This mirror may be concave or convex to suit the director's unique perspective. This is as it should be. The medium exaggerates the portrait such that the audience may feel relatively at ease watching.(This isn't really us!)Exageration of a situation is also sometimes necessary to "drive the point home", to shock people into thinking and eventually seeing themselves in the characters and situations.Yes, this could be you, me, us. It is each and every one of us, in a certain measure. Each individual, each town, each community not just in the 1930's but now and perhaps in the future unless we take a stand, recognize our failings and act upon them. Social change is the goal of theatre. It is a slow but effective process. Dogville makes us think, question, analyse and debate our own morality and question our stand on issues and our actions or lack of them. Dogville may be a comment on power, exploitation, corruption, deceit, war... If the shoe fits. that is good. If Dogville can touch anyone anywhere, that is an even better. As cinema, it is certainly daring in that it demands far more of its audience than standard issue films. Is Von Trier attempting to create theatre for the masses when theatre, such a powerful tool for social change, has become elusive to all but the elite?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville is one of the most satisfying pieces of cinema I have seen. It is not for all tastes, but a triumph for the more literate crowd. Some may see it as anti-American. In reality, it is an astonishing examination of human nature with all its fickleness and blemishes brilliantly (and unnervingly) exposed. It could be called the "Anti-Our Town". The length of the film was not an issue with such incredible story telling. The set's minimalism is perfect and enhances the acting. The film is always conscious of being a story, and the narration only adds to its literary dimensions. The cast is stellar and Nicole Kidman's performance is both subtle and devastating.

		<fullReview>There's a lot of speculation about this film being anti-American. As I see it the story could just as well been set in Denmark. It portrays basic human instinct - the urge to suppress and punish those that don't 'belong'. Although I have to say that the story is all the more interesting given the revelation of the American treatment of Iraqi prisoners. Perhaps it's America's current state of fear, paranoia and isolation from the rest of the world that brings on the accusations of anti-Americanism but I don't buy it. To deny that any nation has an ugly underbelly is simplistic. Admittedly one has to put on their intellectual film-geek cap when watching this film. But its well worth it - A solid 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt that L. v. Trier is a directing genius, he knows how to pull an audience into a movie, his way to set up the stage with only outlines of the buildings and streets of Dogville is highly innovative and effective. The performance of every one of the actors is top notch as well. BUT....I am really happy that I do not share Trier's philosophy, which seems to be: leave a group of pretty people somewhat isolated from society and justice and they will automatically turn into stupid beasts, every single one of them. Perfect direction and acting actually makes this message more intense and therefore even harder to bear.SPOILER ahead. At best this movie could have been a good tragedy, but it isn't, because it fails to offer a real catharsis, instead we get a fake one. The decision of Grace to kill all the villagers in the end is the weakest part of the plot and only adds to the impression that the director just wants to slam his negative outlook into the faces of the audience.10/10 for acting and sheer technical brilliance, 1/10 for poor, unreflected cynicism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Simile: "Suffering like the heroine in a Lars Von Trier film" (POSSIBLE SPOILER)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS??? Lars Von Triers returns with more experiments in the dramaturgy of cinema. This time, he casts Nicole Kidman as the hapless Grace, at first on the run from the mob (in the person of James Caan) and the law in depression era Colorado, then happy to be brought into the fold of a seemingly nice little town in the middle of nowhere (by the morally obsessed, but not entirely secure writer Tom, played by Paul Bettany ("Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World")), then destroyed to find herself enslaved to the increasingly suspicious and selfish townfolk (played by Lauren Bacall, Blair Brown, Patricia Clarkson, Jeremy Davies, Ben Gazzara, Philip Baker Hall and Siobhan Fallon Hogan). John Hurt gives a literate narration as the disconnected narrator to what begins as a poor cousin of Our Town and develops into something more sinister, in the end devouring anything that would even claim to have virtue in its' heart. The film was shot over six weeks in Sweden, entirely on a soundstage, and dressed with little more than chalk drawn suggestions of walls, windows, doors and gooseberry bushes on the floors. With this film, Von Triers begins a new trilogy (`USA- Land of Opportunities') with a bang, even if it is one that takes over half of its' 178 minutes to have its' fuse lit. If "Dancer in the Dark," "The Idiots" or "Breaking the Waves" didn't do it, then this one should put a new simile in the language of, at least, film enthusiasts: "suffering like the heroine in a Lars Von Trier film." Hard stuff, but it gets more engrossing every time I see it.</fullReview>

I do believe that human beings are in general immoral, although not cruel, and never all-good or all-bad. It was almost as if Lars Von Trier was borderline and splitting the townspeople.It would've worked better if the town had not entirely died and there had been a few righteous people.Ben Gazzara's character was probably the only decent character in the entire movie, and he wasn't saved. Anyway, I would've liked to have more righteous characters to make it realistic, and I would've liked for the ending to be more in tune with the rest.Basically, I see academy award nominations for Kidman (who should win), Gazzara, Hurt, Bettany, and art direction. I think that overall, it's good enough to see the great performances, and a great conversation piece.I just would've done things differently.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite to the contrary, this movie wants the audience to think . . . and feel. The stripped-down set, reminiscent of the set direction of Our Town, is at once metaphorical in that we're seeing into the characters' real selves and intentions, and allows us to observe, almost as voyeurs, multiple focal points of action and development. This is surely a very cerebral movie, with the twin protagonists of Tom and Grace (aptly named), doing a lot of the work of carrying the movie in their minds. John Hurt's narration is perfect, absolutely perfect. And as we're drawn painfully into the banal evil of the townsfolk -- each of them vicious for their own reasons, be they regret, bitterness, greed, stupidity, perverse desire -- he reassures us to make it through to the end, as Grace must do. Yes, it is at times slow, especially in the beginning, but we need a little patience for the best payoff I've seen since the Shawshank Redemption. For it's the powerful climax of the movie that turns evil on its head, and makes the movie more than worth the ticket price.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic and Thought Provoking Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler My journey to Dogville proved to be a fulfilling one! I've seen a few films this year that constitute as `Oscar worthy'. Most notably Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Passion of the Christ (my least favorite of the Oscar Contenders).This film is most definitely not for anyone. People who enjoy the physical aspects of film more than the emotional will not find it as entertaining. While it is stunning, if not odd to look at, Dogville is rather devoid of sets. I actually found that rather beneficial to the film, though. The film's center was a town and it's people. And while it focused on Grace (brilliantly portrayed by Nicole Kidman), it was interesting to see the goings on of the town while influential situations took place around them-- mostly unbeknownst to them.The plot is surprisingly easy to follow, with dashes of humor and large doses of morality and drama. A beautiful young woman ventures into the town of Dogville, where the people mercifully take her in despite the fact that she is running from the mob. In return for their kindness, Grace begins performing odd jobs and the like for each of the few residents. She soon forms a romantic attachment to Paul Bettany's character, Tom Edison who is the chief moral character of the town. However, Grace's life in Dogville begins to crumble. The police often venture into Dogville looking for Grace; at first labeling her as missing and then as wanted for bank robberies that she did not commit. She is also raped by one member of the town. He continues to molest her and his wife, Vera, soon discovers this. She confronts Grace with other female citizens of the town and they seek punishment, not acknowledging that she is being raped. Her situation grows worse in Dogville and she attempts to escape with the help of Tom, however their co-conspirator in the escape betrays them both and simply returns Grace to Dogville. Also, Tom seems to be doubting Grace and in a way betrays her, as well. She continues to be abused while performing her forced labor until the dramatic and shocking conclusion.Sorry if my synopsis is less than informative, I've always been horrid at those!I would now like to focus on the performances. Paul Bettany was surprisingly good as Tom Edison. He portrayed his lustful respect and adoration for Grace beautifully and portrayed his inner conflicts well. I especially enjoyed Lauren Bacall's performance as a bitchy shop owner who's imperious ways divulged much of the entire town's persona. As usual, Patricia Clarkson delivered a fabulous performance though she had little time to do it. I loved how her character first appeared as kind and forgiving, but slowly manifested into a vindictive and jealous woman. And much to my relief, Kidman lives up to her fantastic reviews. She is able to display Grace's deep emotions without being too overly dramatic. In that sense, Grace seemed very real to me because she was devoid of dramatic and filled with truth. She also underwent a change, from being a virtuous and forgiving woman who did not realize her plight or the fact that she had been wronged to the woman who sought revenge. She delivers a beautiful, Oscar worthy performance. However, I could care less if she wins or is even nominated. In my opinion, her performance is so good that it doesn't need an Oscar to validate it. Of course, I'm sure a nomination or win is welcomed.As for being Anti-America, it depends how you look at it. For some, such as Ebert and Roeper, it is anti-American but I ask why? I think that some people only need a shred of doubt toward America to make it snowball into something it is not, and Dogville has that shred. While it may not portray America in a glamorous light, it's still true to life. There are bad people everywhere, not just in America. I know I'm making no sense, but I can't quite describe how I feel on that subject. Perhaps I should put it this way. Dogville is every and any town in every and any country, and it shows that each place in the world deserved that shred of doubt.All in all, I highly recommend the film! Mostly because it needn't focus on the special effects or elaborate costumes because it has such glorious performances. It is a character study, and a fascinating one at that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to rate this one of the best movies I have ever seen. The simplicity in the way the complex issues are handled is amazing. You leave feeling you have watched a very detailed story when, in fact, it is more nearly a stage play. It is almost too dangerous to say too much as it will spoil the event for others, but I would highly recommend this movie to any serious moviegoer. The basic assumption that we all have some "inner goodness" takes a serious blow, and creates some real soul-searching in the process. In trying to do good for someone, I think we often do them an injustice, which is just what the director has shown here. Where do I sign up for the Nicole Kidman fan club? This is one of the few movies I have seen lately that I really feel I got my money's worth!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars Von Triers look at American customs and its plights is a provocative and moving movie that is spellbinding to say the least .I don't agree with what he is trying to say but I agree that it's a stunning film that does deserve a look. Nicole Kidman is compelling as a mysterious woman named Grace, who stirs up a small down with he abrasive ideology and homespun views on their western customs. The small town is really one huge sound stage that has chalk outlining as its boarders, and the way Lars puts these to used is a good way to comment on how close we are together as people. Paul Bettany is good as Tom, the man who helps Grace in this little town and Lauren Bacall is stunning as Ma Ginger. This is a first in a trilogy by Lars Von Triers, and if any of the other movies in the series is as good as this movie, then we will have a treat in moviemaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word masterpiece is overused especially during the past 10 years. I personally rarely use it and this one definitely deserves it. I have read critics characterizing this movie as uncomprehensible, too long, anti-american, non realistic, hard to believe, nihilistic etc. Well, it seems that these people have never heard of the words allegoric, ironic, parable, theatrical, symbolic etc. Everything, from the symbolisms contained in every centimeter of the setting and the words of the characters, to the acting and camera motion are really splendid. The analysis of the "human" nature (or should I say the modern society's imposed nature?) is very deep and clear. Good people are despised for being better than others; people are prone to mob-like behaviour; ethics are irrelevant when you possess power over someone; power will always be abused if given the opportunity to excersise it; stoicism is a virtue unknown to modern humans; vengeance is way easier than forgiveness; human weakness is certainly an explanation but never an excuse for any pain the inflict upon others and so many other things. For those who find anti-american elements in the movie is clearly because they recognise that the behaviours stated above are met more in this country were individualism and masses-like behaviour as well as revenge is a way of life. That is what I saw in the movie and a lot more. I never thought that I would say this but things change: Dogville is the best movie I have ever seen. Enjoy..P.S. The Dictum ac Factum inscribed in the entrance of the mine means "no sooner said than done" but I still haven't made any connection with the scenario presented.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll keep this short.Clocking in at 3 hours Dogville tells the story about an immigrent coming to America where she is abused by the townspeople. The movie is shot entirely on a sound stage with no props, just chalk outlines for walls and is littered with title cards.What must be said first and foremost is that the director, Trier, has never been to the United States and says he never will. By watching that movie that becomes all too apparent. He stereotypes all Americans as sexual predators and the such with no basis. The characters are all completely uninspired and even at 3 hours very few are even memorable enough to know their name. The entire chalk outline thing is very pretentious and in general the movie is a complete chore to sit through but also an effing embarrasment for any US citizen.Trier should be ashamed for what he has made and maybe research a country when you portray it in this bad of a light. This may come as a big shock but everywhere has poverty and the fact is this movie would've made absolutely perfect sense had it been set in China or Singapore.2 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am surprised at the range of emotion this movie stirred in most of the viewers. I did not have that experience. I found this movie to be interesting, but not captivating. The mythology was founded on an interesting intellectual principle (that humans are above animals, that they can distinguish right and wrong, and should be judged as such), yet I found this piece to be an academic essay rather than a great work of art.I agree intellectually with many of the points in this movie, and was looking forward to the unique Black-Box-Movie approach. However, if that is your gimmick, you must make sure your characters are damn good. I was not sutured into the characters. Their respective plights did not stir my emotions, nor did their interactions seem particularly realistic or compelling. The narrator told us every conclusion (purposefully? pretentiously? comically?) we should make. Additionally, the story arc after a brief uplifting beginning, was entirely downhill for too large a portion of the movie (much like Requiem for a Dream). I feel that when Lars is at his best is when he makes an uplifting comment in the midst of the harsh reality of the world (such as Bjork in Dancer in the Dark).Overall, a good movie, 7/10. Sucks to have high expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DOGVILLE (2004) *** Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, Philip Baker Hall, Ben Gazzara, Stellen Skarsgard, Chloe Sevigny, Patricia Clarkson, Lauren Bacall, Blair Brown, Siobhan Fallon, Zelko Ivanek, Jeremy Davies, Harriet Andersson, Bill Raymond, James Caan, (Narrator: John Hurt) Danish filmmaker/enfant terrible Lars von Trier looks at the underbelly of America in his depiction of a fictitious Depression era town whose community unwittingly allows a stranger (Kidman, in arguably one of her most challenging roles to date) to stay in their midst at first as a member of their close-knit familial enclave and then eventually showing their true darker colors in this parable about the nation as a metaphor for greed, manifest destiny, slavery and misogynistic power. The most noteworthy characteristic of this shrewdly nasty slice of morality play is its bare-bones, chalk-outlined minimalistic approach (the entire action takes place on an enormous sound stage with pantomime and little use of props and sets) and von Trier's customarily trowel-laden histrionics that only leaden the film's three-hour length in its ponderous unraveling of Kidman's Grace with a few sharp twists by the film's conclusion. Make of it what you will and despite political underpinnings the least you can admit is von Trier has his moments of genius (and audacity). The large ensemble is a miracle in this decidedly 'Our Town' on acid approach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes you walk out of an epic thinking this film must be a work of genius or I have just wasted the last three hours. Breaking the Waves was a waste of three hours. Dancer in the dark was incredible. The jury is still out on Dogville. The film is in many ways ingenious and original but the plot, particularly the ending, seemed a little thin. The most ingenious part is the way you a worn down by the reasonableness of the townspeople.Spoilers follow: the initial rape was shocking and horrific, the second was was sad and pathetic but the gradual degradation of Grace becomes almost as reasonable to the viewer as it does to the townspeople, even though you want to be repulsed. The ending was particularly perverse with the audience laughing despite having just witnessed a particularly gruesome twist in the plot.How could "civilized" Europeans and Americans justify slavery? How could ordinary Germans stand by and watch the degradation of their neighbors? How could some Serbs defend the actions of their ethnic cousins in Srebrenica? How could educated Romans defend the butchery of the Gladitorial games? Perhaps this film gives us a few clues.Kidman was brillant and it was great to see Gazzara and Bacall but the real star of the show was John Hurt. Only 7/10 for being an hour too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as wierd and Pretentious as one might expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of Von Tier, but the way in which this film conducts itself is truly interesting. When i saw this film, many people left during the first hour due to boredom. I'm usually not drawn into movies that try really hard to set themselves apart and behave strangely. but the characters and the set up of this film make it unique and watchable.Mr. Von Tier has never been to America, which i think makes me able to appreciate this film more for what it's trying to do. It testament to the abstractness of our ideas about things about which we haven't the slightest clue. He's never been to America, so he doesn't have a clue. but yet, he has the right idea on some things, others he's way off. And he's just a little bitter and close minded like the townspeople of dogville. And maybe that's ok. The film and it's set-up are stunning, and each scene is directed with a purpose. He draws upon many techniques of theatre and Brechtian principles of drama. The end credits did leave a bad taste in my mouth, though.The actors really come into their own. IN each scene, i got a sense of their fear of screwing up or frustrations about conflicting with a difficult director. I find nicole kidman too frail, raspy voiced, and whispery. She's like this all of the time, and acting isn't really pretending to be week. but in this film, in the last hour, she's incredible. I'm a negative person and usually don't like movies and rip everything to shreds . . . but this is her best performance. By far. All the other actors are perfectly cast, and you can tell they fully embrace the set and the style of the film.The set really is Beautiful, and it reinforoces the story. Stunning all around, and worth seeing. Even though its message is highly debatable, it's form is something new and fresh, while building upon the old and refusing to be another gimmicky art movie. See this movie. It actually dared to try something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville. A small American city (well, the truth is, it could be anywhere in the world) in the late thirties of past century: population 15. 15 rednecks. With a friendly faces and evil character. And 1 fugitive. Nicole. And a genius director who provided us the show. Lars. And to tell you the truth, it was nothing I expected. Sure the cast and directing is so good, that you soon forgot that you're watching a theatre play. A play that is becoming a harder and harder to watch. A play that you wish you cold reach out and twist the necks of people that are torturing Grace. Or choose an easy way. To walk out of cinema. But hey, you wouldn't do that, because after all, the stories with such a narrators voice must have happy ending (just remember The Babe). And yet, a revenge is always sweet, here in particular. So, does this masterpiece deserves 10/10. From all point of views, yes, but since it was one of the movies i nearly suffered during the show (meaning 1/10) and promise not to see it again, the only fair rate would be5 out of 10 (plus a "masterpiece" mark)</fullReview>

It's outrageous because no one is able to accept it's own weakness, I wasn't ready to accept that on that screen it was my story, it was my friend's story, it's the ultimate truth about humanity.What stroke me as abnormal in the first place, I realized that it's the normal thing in our society.

And oh, no, it's not about only Americans, most frightening thing that it's really about us - our society, about humans, about our nature and what we do and don't do to protect our small, tiny human being inside ourselves.I must agree it's frighteningly real - so real that in first minutes of last scene I wanted to run and hide.I can give my though on this - as society we aren't doomed, as only as we will continue question ourselves. As Grace said, 'There's no sin of doubting yourself'.This movie changed me already. Fon Treer is one of the directors and artists who simply will push you to think. Either or other way. And thinking people is what we desperately need today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mise en scene d'un dramme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dogville'is a theatrical movie. The action takes place in a closed space and it is divided into chapters which are as a matter of fact scenes.The drama starts slowly and with good premises: a stranger woman arrives at Dogville, a little town, on the run from a gang of gangsters. Her name is Grace. The little community of Dogville, city of dog, not of God, apparently accepts her and just asks her some work in exchange. And this seems to follow very strictly the protestant morality: you must deserve what you receive.But soon afterwards things change: it is clear that people search her very closely, the risk in harbouring her is increased and Dogville asks more and more. Eventually it becomes too much and there is a break. Grace will not accept their vexations anymore and will take her revenge.Unlike other Lars von Trier's heroines Grace will not submit to evil: she will act her revenge in the name of justice and of the rights of human beings.The drama, very well played indeed by any character, is well constructed: there is a quiet beginning, and abrupt increasing of violence and then the turning point. En excellent movie which demonstrates that it is possible to make movies even with small means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably contains spoilers!I don't want to see this movie ever again. One time is enough for such a truly horrible story. I will remember it like I remember the worst of bad dreams. The grandeur of this movie which I rated 10 of 10 lies within the outrageous rate of horror it slowly creates within while the story develops. To me it's the best horror movie of all times. Unlike the cheap masquerades with vampires it really scares. It scares deep because it's real. The worst horror lies within people.Praise for movie crew had been written here already. The moral lessons of the story observed. I would not put it any better.I would only comment on anti-USA topic. I had not the slightest clue who was the director until afterwards. I did not like his previous movies (I saw Dancer and few episodes of The Kingdom). I had no idea of his political agenda until I read reviews.IMHO this movie is about USA as much as The Caucasian Chalk Circle by Bertolt Brecht is about the countries located in Caucasian mountains. Many years ago I saw this drama (which is widely referenced in the movie btw) performed by artists from Georgia (incidentally it's really Caucasian country). I didn't get a single word as it was performed in their language and the only translation available was in brochure, however it was one of the most memorable shows I ever saw. Apparently these people had not got is as major offence that the dramatists selected their country for his story.And now remove the USA from Dogville and place the action somewhere else; say unidentified European country (like the one I am from). What would change in the movie then? Nothing, absolutely nothing. Regardless of creator's intentions this movie has no `geography'. It's about dogvilles in my country and in all neighboring countries.This movie will be remembered for very long time. As long as human nature remains as it is. Not many people like when they are reminded of their own sins that's why this movie won't be loved by crowds.I recommend this movie for open minded folks only. It's not a fun stuff and there is no happy ending and the price for seeing the astonishingly beautiful Kidman is too high. Dixi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>* * * * * * * * CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!! * * * * * * * * * *It's rather a disappointment, or better put - too harsh, too anti-american (even for my liking). The whole element of revenge is a logical thing. You know it way before it actually happens, but it turns out to be more than just simply quoting it as `revenge'. Dogville, the village, becomes an allegory for USA. Of course the word is not used, America is not used, but because it's taking place in the Rocky Mountains and especially with the overly cynical, provocative and pretentious final song (Young Americans), it's clear what Dogville stands for. And with the decision of the now mafia-bride Grace to use her powers, to take revenge, to kill them all, Von Trier went too far. Saying that there shouldn't be any places like Dogville, that people from Dogville should rot in hell, he made a strong and (too) bold political statement. Saying that American are better off dead, is something I didn't expect and actually didn't want to see.For all I can say, I really enjoyed the 8/9 of the film, but the last chapter was too much. I really like the direction, the smart, provocative and brilliant screenplay and the acting. The supporting roles are too small to get any mentioning though. Bettany is perfect as the shamefaced, modest leader of the small village and Grace's loving interest. I have the most admiration for his performance. I had some problems with Kidman, as I think she could've done much better. I'm not saying she's not good. She fits the character perfectly and gives an exquisite performance. Yet when I remember what Von Trier pulled from Bjork and Emily Watson, I realize - Kidman is nowhere near them.Actually, the film is a masterpiece and many will agree on that. I wish I could say that on the whole, but I simply can't. I cannot give support to a film, when its philosophy is something I don't agree on. The technical aspect is excellent - the screenplay, direction, acting, art direction - everything is so experimental, so good, it fits perfectly. But on the inner side (the last chapter with the truth), it stinks. It justifies revenge, the killing, to some extend even genocide. And eventhough the word `American' is not used for the inhabitants of the small, god-awful village, it screams American all the time. So, the Americans should suffer and get killed (just remember how cruel Kidman's character is when she orders how the gangster should kill Patricia Clarkson's children. Awful. Okay, it has a point, but come on!)There's a similar drama/novel, written by a Slovenian author (Slavko Grum), which tells a story of a godawful small town, where people are just like the people of Dogville. I've read it and seen it on stage, so it all was far too familiar seeing Dogville. Eventhough in the end, Dogville is way different than that novel, it has just too many similar elements. And yet, if I forget about this, I there some very irritating scenes. Okay, Grace felt the need to pay the people back, with the work and I completely understand why the men were seeking for physical love, for sex and why they raped her in the end and abused her sexually. This started to bug me, just to find out why Von Trier did this?!?! But then I figured out it's just human nature - and because of this, universal. But the last chapter just proves you wrong and points at one country only. Grace brought new life into the dull village, people started to appreciate her, in a way extol her. But then they realized she's vulnerable, so they started to exploit and torture her - the divine Grace, who suddenly becomes a woman martyr. All for good. She gets her revenge in the end.***1/2 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Similar painfull watching as Lord of the Flies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a similar emotional impact as Lord of the Flies, von Trier takes it a step further. He does not attribute his metaphoric story to children, but lets it play among adults, adults in a society. He applies the societal problem on an already existing society and makes it impossible for the viewer not to cast at least some form of reflection on their own surrounding.From time to time, the movie was predictable and somewhat over-obvious in the onstage plot. Never the less, an important movie. It does not moralize, it does not provide a solution. Hence the beauty of the story. The final chapter gives the plot it's true twist, and here the viewer is forced to confront the dilemma of the characters. Forced. The viewer will pass judgement. Not von Trier. (And despite previous partial predictabilities in the movie the development was the contrary).</fullReview>

The way the movie is filmed, the combination of theater, of an audiobook with pictures, that makes you also use your imagination is amazing. And the story is beautiful, (POSSIBLE SPOILER) the way that shows the human nature; And the way that Grace(Nicole Kidman) shows all that infinite patience, almost a divine grace. And in the end is like a divine justice, almost like all that was a kind of a test on human nature, and they failed completely. And when she lets the dog live, because is the only one that had a reason to harm her (but didn't) because she stole is bone in the beginning. Im writing all this, but to tell you the truth, i dont have the words to express the way i loved this movie.

		<fullReview>It wouldn't have been von Trier, if you wasn't surprised in the absolute beginning. All takes place in a studio. The Dogville village has no real houses. Instead of walls, there are lines drawn on the studio floor.This is definitely good. Nicole Kidman is rather sensational in this drama, which isn't just drama however, but also a discussion about morality and philosophy, sometimes performed only by the narrator's (John Hurt) voice. It wouldn't have been von Trier otherwise. This is sometimes hard to see. After almost three hours you feel really tense of what will happen in the final.But you probably don't have that many thoughts and feelings afterwards that you might have had after watching "The Idiots" or "Breaking the Waves". "Dogville" can't really compete there and definitely not with von Trier's absolute masterpiece "Europa". Anyway "Dogville" is one of the absolutely best films of this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought that a film presented on a bare stage could be so exciting and able to keep you alert for all its 180 minutes. However Lars von Trier managed to make his best film, a film in which the story is used to comment on present-day society (and not only the American society), on its fragile values, fears, racialism and opportunism. With a dense script, excellent direction of actors - Nicole Kidman has never been so persuasive - and excellent atmosphere. A film that shows European pioneering and excellence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film in Paris, when it came out, near the end of my 9-month stay there. At first I was curious, but not too enthused about what was going on. But as the film progressed I became more and more interested and involved in it's story and characters. But I have to say, that it was the ending and the lessons as a whole that really blew me away.Having said that, don't let anyone tell you anything about the film, especially the ending. It will most likely ruin it for you.I think this film does a lot more than say human nature is one way or the other, it shows us a plausible situation and then asks us what we would do in that situation, and why. I think it teaches many lessons, especially since one may start out in the beginning agreeing with certain elements, and by the end be on the opposite side.If you want a movie that will make you think and question some of your very basic moral beliefs, this one is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a movie...Because of skipping the effort of making decors, filming with a background, at first this movie is giving the feeling that you are watching a play on a stage. Soon you will be so deep into this film that the minimal decors and white lines of chalk will not disturb you anymore. On the contrary, they will rather surprisingly maximise the effect...A fence, a car, a white chalk line, all of a sudden they can become extremely threatening. The (excellent) play of all the actors stands out a lot better because of the lack of decor as well...The only minus I could discover, was that a very annoying break was introduced by my cinema. And we can hardly blame Lars von Trier for that, can we?10 out of 10 does not mean a better film cannot be made, but since a 10/10 simply stands for 'excellent', how could I give any other rating...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Dogville' is the new film of Lars von Trier. It's one of the most interesting movie of this year. The story tells about small village in the USA and it's set at the beginning of the XX century. We can show the stars, like Nicole Kidman. The young woman arrives to Dogville. She escapes, because the dangerous gangsters want to catch her. Tom, a young man, who wants to be a writer, helps her. He is going to verify if the people of Dogville will accept unknown girl. At the beginning they are good for Grace, but than their way of thinking and behaviour changes completely.This movie is extraordinary: the scenography is like in the theatre and the camera is moving all the time. In our opinion this is very important film about human nature. You have to ask yourself, where is the line between being victim and oppressor.</fullReview>

A very good, theatrical masterpiece that really felt like a cool spring breeze after watching the latest "masterpieces" like Matrox Reloaded and Kill Bill or whatever "cool"... LOL.A lot of praise has gone Von Trier's way in the past - this was the first movie I've seen from him and now I'm really interested in his previously over-hyped movies. Almost all the way through this was a very interesting one that kept my eyes peeled. The characters were ALIVE and the story was unpredictable, although simple. Might have been that I was so fascinated by the milieu and great acting that I was blinded by the obviousness of it all - now this is a feeling I haven't had in a long time watching a movie.Lars Von Trier and Nicole Kidman deserve Oscars for this, but then again I think all the actors and the whole damn crew deserve them.Brilliant.</fullReview>

Maybe I have ADHD or something, but I basically only enjoyed the last 10 minutes. The rest was boring.

Once the play (which it is) began, I immediately became sucked into the story. To be able to see through a little town like this at any given time, the walls only markings on the stage, was really something.It's a overwhelming movie because this intensity of the story can only be achieved by a play, but you'll never be able to see a play in this detail and intimacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say, I was waiting to see this film more than any other for the past year. I saw it Saturday night, and I can't say yet that I've totally formed my reaction to it. To a certain extent, like McBuff said, it lacked an emotional impact, such as Dancer in the Dark, which leaves you sobbing no matter how many times you've seen it. I've nothing against so-called cold movies, like Kubrick's were often described, but they never sear into your memory as much as the more emotional ones. Also, I agree that the credits sequence, with the Bowie song and the images - those left more of an emotional impact than anything before it. Had the whole film felt like that, well, I'm sure von Trier is capable of doing such a thing. But I also wonder, and maybe he's explained this, why he tacked on these photos and song? I was never bored, and the lack of a traditional set/props while the film still holds your attention is testament to von Trier's story and the amazing performances of the actors. I think it's the most stripped-down performance one could see, in terms of how exposed a story and an actor are. At a play, the fact you are seeing real live people is itself a distraction. In this situation, you are more removed and more able to make a judgment based on "just the facts," if you will. That being said, I thought the movie was hysterical, acting amazing, I loved the set experimentation - it all worked for me. The narration thing was worn well too, helping to create a fairy tale feeling. Hurt's dialogue was funny, it wasn't intrusive or cheap like it would be used in a Hollywood movie. But I was left feeling slightly disappointed. The ending didn't leave me all that surprised, and seeing an ending coming is always a letdown. And finally, other users said this too, if you are looking for a film that's saying, Hey, look how evil or bad all of us are and redemption doesn't seem to exist, there are better films out there that have tackled this subject before.</fullReview>

A narrator that does not shut up for ages, 3 hours of shaky hand camera (make that shaky HD 24p camera with motion artifacts galore thanks to the erratic shaking), a concept as sophisticated as early cinema 100 years ago (but with modern technology and sound) and characters as flat and cliched as a cartoon. Made me smile once or so and be touched zero times. In the end one should feel devastated, I guess. I did not care at all what happened to anyone. The film lost me a long time before that. It's not the cast's fault that this is a prime example of pretentious art house drivel, but neither can it do anything about it. Avoid at all costs unless different means automatically good to you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The term photographed stageplay must have been invented for movies like this. For those who found the Dogme films too flashy and hi-tech, Von Trier has stripped his style down to the bare necessities. Filmed on one set in which an entire village is marked with chalked lines and only a minimal use of props. Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mysterious woman who flees to a small town in the Rockies, Dogville, during the Depression years. At first the villagers are kind and hospitable, but eventually they start taking advantage of her, because of her predicament. The tragedy is inevitable, and the finale violent and surprising. And that's the problem.The film didn't have the emotional impact on me that I was led to believe from the positive advance words Dogville received on the Cannes festival. The bizarrely constructed style and artificiality of the whole thing mute whatever true emotions might have emerged had the film been made "traditionally" (for lack of a better word). All the more so, when the end credits with authentic photographs of Depression-era America accompanied by David Bowie's THE YOUNG AMERICANS, has a far more powerful effect than anything preceding them. First in a trilogy (U, S and A), to be followed by Manderlay and Wasington (not a typo!) Widely praised, and if you buy into the conceit, your rating may be higher. Anyway, it's extremely well acted, under the circumstances. Narrated by John Hurt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was greatly impressed by Dogville, which I consider as a work of art - in the best sense of the word, but also with my eyes wide open to the likelyhood of dissent. Because... as one Danish movie reviewer beautifully put it: "It is a movie that speaks to your mind, not your heart".That, in my view, sums it up. In stripping the set down to a barren "Mutter Courage" meets "Waiting for Godot" setting, and shaving the action to a 2 1/2 hour-long americanised pastiche on "Der Besuch der alten Dame", von Trier has definitely shown us something NEW.Has he also shown us something GOOD? My personal view is that he has: Having used the Dogma concept to strip directors naked - left as they are with only their directing skills to rely on - he now does the same to the actors. How could a mediocre or unconcentrated actor hide on a barren stage where no one ever shouts "cut"? In Dogville we have a movie that for a change puts acting back at the forefront. And the actors rise to the challenge - notably Kidman, who is magnificent.Does that mean, we should LIKE it? Well, we are in the same situation as the art gallery goers were back at the time of the Great War when the abstract artists introduced the non-figurative arts. In truth, only the art pros at first marvelled over the works of Klee and Kandinsky. The rest of the crowd quietly growled "...OK, maybe it's art, but who cares if one cannot even see what it's supposed to depict?".I guess for the years to come Dogville will be loved by those who have seen enough Turners (metaphorically speaking) for a lifetime and who want something radically new. And it will be shrugged off by those who go to the cinema purely to be amused, entertained and feel good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A successful experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today I watched Dogville in a Danish cinema, but I did not know what to expect before I went to the cinema.I was aware of the way the town was build with the chalk lines, and I was very sceptical. I am not a big Lars von Trier-fan, even though I have seen several of his works like Riget (The Kingdom) and Idioterne.The whole town was one big scene, where chalk lines marked the houses, and the furniture in the buildings is there for a reason. Things which are not important for the movie have been let out, so the audience do not get distracted and focus on the wrong things. It is a bit hard in the beginning to watch people opening doors which are not there, but you get used to it after about a half to one hour.When you only have one big scene, then the acting is very important to keep the movie going, and the acting is really superb. I cannot say anything bad about the acting, all the actors really did a great job. Most noticeable is of course the acting by Nicole Kidman, but there are also a lot of really experienced actors like James Caan, Philip Baker Hall and Lauren Bacall. The rest of the cast are also really good actors, I would like to give them all some credit.Visually it is also a successful movie, it is really a great view, when you are watching the town from the overview camera. There are also different times of the year, and you can see from the environment what time of the year it is, once more a point where the movie has been successful.Those were the positive things, there are also some negative things about this movie. I have to admit that the movie was maybe a bit too long, there were some periods where I felt that nothing really happened. The movie also failed to make me feel real bad or sad, I just sat and watched the cruelty without being touched that much, some more music might have helped the atmosphere.One of the things the movie has been criticized for is that it was an attack against USA. I am not anti-American, and I still did enjoy watching the lives of the people in the streets. Lars von Trier will surely try to send some messages with this movie, and I think it is healthy - you have the choice to agree or disagree.Dogville was an interesting intellectual movie, and it makes you think about several things. I would like to recommend it, but I do not see it as a master piece, so I will give it 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Lars von Trier movie I don't like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Lars von Trier movie I don't like, for very similar reason as a recent review I wrote about Manderlay. This movie has an even more impressive cast than Manderlay and the story is less of an attempt at educating the audience to history, etc etc.. It is a pure drama that could have provided me and the general wider audience with an entertaining movie. It is another one of those stage play movies. If I want to see a stage play, I'll bloody pay for it and go see it. I did not stay in my chair in front of the screen to find out the end which I understand was brilliant. With that kind of a cast and story, I would pay to see the ensemble in a real theater.Don't get me wrong, not all stage play movies can work and work well but they have to fit the screen in a way where you believe you're seeing a movie about a great story and with good actors. Two such movies I reviewed this past year are in fact this sort of thing. But they were, essentially two actors, talented ones, in a single room and alike, delivering their lines. I was not frustrated by the stage sets. In Dogville, as in Manderlay, I was distracted by the stage sets and how actors moved about in such settings; I simply could not appreciate the fine work that appeared to be going on. The two stage plays on movie I did liked were: 'The Sunset Limited' and 'Interview'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you're bored with "safe"-feeling movies, this is for you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I was unsettled by the fact that the movie was 3 hours long. The beginning was a little slow in pace, but as the story progressed the time mattered less and less. If you liked stories such as Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery," or "The Wicker Man," then you might like Dogville. I will have to warn you, however, of its emotional extremism. Watching this movie could make you feel like wanting to murder someone because of the amount of injustice it will make you face. At its worst you may even detest humankind in general. But that does not change the fact that it is definitely a must-watch, simply because it is not lukewarm. Dogville is the opposite of innocent and naive. It is there to tear these things apart, to show you trauma, to show you evil, to show you injustice.Definitely it is not boring. But if you're looking for a light afternoon feel-good watch, it may not be the one you're looking for. There is a lot of weight in this story and you will feel it all throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling portrait of human ugliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There probably isn't a lot I can say about Dogville that hasn't already been said, but I'll give it a shot, anyway.To begin with, there's the plot; Dogville is set in depression-era America. The plot concerns a young woman, Grace Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) who is fleeing from gangsters, and arrives in a small Colorado backwater town. She asks to take refuge in the town, but the townsfolk are reluctant to take Grace in,but Grave eventually wins them over by offering to do chores for them. All is well until the local police start asking around about Grace. The inhabitants of Dogville demand more work as compensation from Grace, seeing as her continued presence in the town is putting them at risk. It is not long before the "good" people of Dogville begin to show their true colours to Grace and eventually enslave her completely. As well as being made to work like a slave, the menfolk have their wicked way with Grace. Grace is also made the town "scapegoat" Entually, the townsfolk decide that Grace is becoming too much of a liability to the town, so the local intellectual, Tom Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany) who brought Grace to Dogville in the first place, convinces them to turn Grace over to the gangsters who were looking for her.The stage is set for a shocking ending..............I was absolutely startled by the "minimalist" look of the Dogville set, but as the film progressed, I was so engrossed by the story and the acting, that it soon became irrelevant. In spite of the stagy aesthetics, I could still imagine the set looking like a typical small American town of the period-like the kind you'd most likely see in old black-and-white photographs. This is aided by the inclusion of certain visual cues, such as the bell-tower, various windows and furniture.The performances from the cast were great all round. They actually came across as real small-town residents. The only performance I had any problem with was that of Paul Bettany. His acting was good, but for some reason, I just can't get his character in "Gangster No. 1" (2000), his first major role out of my head. Kidman imbued her character with the right amount of vulnerability-right up until the end.Special mention should go to John Hurt, as the narrator, who was very articulate and well-spoken in his performance. He sounded like some superior deity looking down on humanity as though they were mere insects. The only outright despicable characters were Chuck (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Vera (Patricia Clarkson).I got so involved with this film, three three-hour duration absolutely sailed by for me. The director, Lars Von Trier, racks up the tension to screaming pitch, beautifully in the last 10 minutes, that I just knew something big is about to happen. The horrific ending is, ironically, quite satisfying. As much as I loved to hate her, I couldn't help but feel sorry for Vera when she was forced to watch her children being murdered by the gangsters. As satisfying as it was to see the people of Dogville get what was coming to them, I was forced to question whether Grace made the right decision in ordering the complete destruction of Dogville and its inhabitants, who were "bad" people, but were human like Grace.The song, "Young Americans" by David Bowie, which plays during the end credits, feels out of place. This, too, adds to the "staginess" of Dogville.Ignore the rants of "anti-Americanism". Dogville is a powerful, if unpleasant morality play. Definitely required viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A major triumph.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As has already been said this is a stunning film which deals with nothing less than the "soul of man". I had only seen one Von Trier film previously, "The Idiots", which I thought was interesting and original. However this is a big step up from that film and contains superlative performances from all the main actors. Its real triumph, however, is that it forces the viewer to explore many different viewpoints of both situation and character simultaneously throughout the film. There is no absolute moral standpoint in this film. It allows the viewer to judge each character and event for themselves and attempt to come to some sort of conclusion at the end. This is a difficult thing to achieve given the complexities that are dealt with over the film's 3 hour running time. But it will leave you considering the meanings of words like moral, ethical and what it is to be human in the world today. IMO those who see it merely as an attack on the USA are being wilfully short sighted. It has a universal theme and is not confined to a criticism of modern day capitalism. Overall, I would recommend this film to all lovers of intelligent cinema. A major triumph.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great style, but the movie discredits itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has quite some things going for itself. It's unique style, the voice-over, the structure, the acting.Where the movie fails though, it's the point it tries to get across. It wants to make you believe that the voice-over's point of view (which I would assume is the director's) is an objective analysis what happens.The way it switches the characters from reasonable people to monsters is nothing short of ridiculous, especially the graceful Grace.All in all I really enjoyed the first half, the way the decor (or lack thereof) enhanced the storytelling, the way the movie was set up as a play. I wish I would have saved myself one and a half hour by not watching the second half. It turns into a bitter movie that does nothing but portray a far too one sided image of humanity, which leads to believe the director could do with more fun in his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just plain Dullsville</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm baffled as to how this director has managed to trick people into thinking that he's produced a great film. Okay, it's dark. Okay, it's stark (as in practically no set).Okay, they hired one of Hollywood's top actresses to break into the American/English- speaking market... (If they hadn't it'd be the lowest budget film ever shot).But that didn't change the fact that it was just plain painful to watch this film: way too long, way to little going on... you could say just as much about the sorry state of the human race in a 10-minute You-Tube film and save us the hours of torture and the let-down.I'm well aware, as are most of us, of how messed up America (and the rest of the world) is; I actually like to watch films that "make me think" once in a while... about something OTHER THAN this mono-dimensional bleak outlook on things that Von Trier has. The director is clearly a misanthrope who also hates the U.S. and while there may be plenty in the world to make us feel both those sentiments, this film wasn't any more enjoyable or worth watching for subjecting us to his Weltanschauung. If people dazzled by the names of famous stars and distracted by the high ratings of others hadn't already lifted this well above it's deserved low rating, I might actually rate it higher than one. I truly am baffled by why enough people LOVED this film to give this a better rating than some films that actually ARE good -- Is it just because of the...? (Okay, I won't spoil the ending -- someone might actually still see this old piece of Von Trier garbage, but don't say I didn't warn you). I don't need a "Hollywood ending" to like a film. But this film was just plain boring till it got tedious, painful, trite ... so I'm giving it the lowest rating I can; someone has to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In any country, all towns are Dogville, given the chance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an old story that's been done before, under different guises: a woman on the run, seeks shelter and anonymity in a small town, far away from those hunting for her. Initially, the people of the town are dubious, but at least one person persuades them to allow the woman to stay. At first, things go well. Over time, however, jealousies and animosities surface such that the town's people turn against the fugitive to the extent that they abuse her and eventually give her up to her oppressors.Such a story could have easily centred upon a man on the run, or a small child, or even a couple. Hence, from that perspective, the story is simple. But, that's where the similarities to others end...This narrative is, in one sense, experimental cinema: the entire setting is contained within a large sound stage (somewhere in Sweden); the cinematic and narrative props (houses, streets, interiors, doors, windows, just about everything except cars and trucks) are rudimentary or non-existent. For example, all the 'doors' into the houses are make-believe ? when a character enters a house, s/he makes the motion of opening and closing a door but there is no door, only the sound of the door opening and closing. All the action within the narrative is contained within that large set. All the actors are visible all the time, even in situations where two actors are supposed to be in private ? a nod, perhaps, to the illusion of privacy that is so dear to all. The entire story is accompanied with a voice over (from John Hurt) in nine chapters. So, not only is this film very much like a stage production, it's also a very staged production...So, it won't appeal to a lot of people, I think. But, I was riveted to my seat for nearly the entire three hour run time.Primarily, this is a philosophical treatise examining a moral choice we all face from time to time: to what extent should we, or must we, assume the role of Good Samaritan when a situation arises? Not content with analyzing and answering that issue, the writer/director (Lars von Trier) then continues to explore what happens when the situation is compromised to the extent that the fugitive becomes a threat to the town's assumed safety. What then? There are still moral choices and this director shows what can happen when some, or all of the people compromise their principles in the face of perceived or imagined danger. In doing so, the director touches on the will to power and how power corrupts all; and then toys with Nietzsche's ideas about beyond good and evil in the closing scenes which must be seen to be appreciated for the irony and fury portrayed. Those scenes will stay with you for a long, long time. I saw it coming and I wasn't disappointed.This is a director's film. The actors ? an international cast, all of whom are excellent in their roles ? are incidental to the crucial issues von Trier is expounding upon. There is not much of a musical soundtrack; the dialog is sparse, but incisive; the camera work favors many medium and close-up shots, showing emotion is great detail; and the muted colors and dark shading add to the overall melancholia and depression. In the final scenes, however, red predominates ? horrifically and viscerally.Anybody who is seriously interested in cinema should ? must ? see this film. I cannot forget it. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ash of innocence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first sight, "Dogville" is a Greek tragedy's variant. Same gods, same sin, same fatum. In fact, it is a story about human condition. About freedom and fear, trust and error, punishment and crime. And Grace is only a voice of a very subtle illusion. She is himself's victim, the sign of normal hope and normal waiting. A marble piece who discover the art of some sculptors. Lars van Trier presents the image of same world who lives in everyone. The movie is not a moralistic story, a faithlessness's exposure. It is a slice of reality, basic reality, without lights, speeches or gifts. In fact, only character in this film is the silence. Silence before the words, silence like mask, silence inside the looks. And that silence, soft, heavy, impure is the fruit of a great disappointed. Each character is a victim and her surrender's symbol is the ash of innocence who lives in final scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville hits the target on more than one level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville reflects, in microcosm, the class/caste system of any nation. Grace's first treatment at the hands of the people is merciful and welcoming, though a little self serving and this is like the treatment of the affluent members of any society among the general population. Her final enslavement and abuse is much like the treatment of the poor- illegal immigrants, 'po' white trash', ghetto dwellers etc of any place- and time. It is psychologically telling and more honest in its appraisal of human nature than the vast majority of movies I have seen. The characters are all recognisable and familiar to me. An 'intelligent' movie that is intelligent and not just full of pseudo intellectual posturing! The acting is consistently good too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Combination of drama and tragedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a beautiful fugitive, that finds her way to a small isolated town named Dogville. She is hiding from her gangster father(James Caan)and is befriended by Dogville's self appointed spokesman Tom Edison, Jr(Paul Bettany). Grace ends up working an hour a day for each Dogville family in return for her shelter. As the stakes grow higher for knowledge of her whereabouts, the town decides to double her work hours; if that is not enough she is raped and then becomes the victim of aggravated sexual assault from about every man in town...except Tom, whom she has fallen in love with. Grace is then forced to make a major decision about how she is going to live the rest of her life. She makes sure that Dogville will never again be the same.At times this movie lumbers on its way to the finale two minutes short of three hours. Written and directed by Lars von Trier, DOGVILLE makes use of a noble and interesting cast: Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Skarsgard, Patricia Clarkson, Chloe Sevigny and Blair Brown. John Hurt narrates and at times gets annoying. This movie just seems not meant for everyone...but after watching you definitely know you have seen something with substance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read Roger Eberts review and he gave it 2 stars based on the fact that he didn't care for the director. One of the reasons he doesn't like the director is because he has never visited the USA (due to a flying phobia) and portrays Americans as greedy monsters, etc. Roger Ebert did this also with "The Motorcycle Diaries" because of "who" the main character is. The main character is anti-American. Feel Mr. Ebert needs to take the politics out and review movies for their worth. Mr. Ebert, I am a huge fan of yours and enjoy reading your reviews, after I have seen a movie. I just happened to pick up "Dogville" at my local library. I looked at it several times and finally checked it out. Unlike Mr. Ebert, I could watch it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lavish in detail, original in theme, haunting in nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Von Trier conjured up a real piece of mastery when he wrote and directed 'Dogville'. I am saying this not because of its sheer brilliance of dialogue, its strength of meaning and pure excellence of acting but due to its consummate originality. I, for one have really been screaming out for an end to mainstream cinema's absurd obsession with beautiful sets, gorgeous cinematography and awful lighting arrangements and the constant rehashing of worn-out themes and ideas. Too often directors neglect what the true fundamentals of a film; an intelligent script with discernible characters, an original, yet basic idea which does not need to be dressed up to convey any true power.Von Trier has funnelled his energies into a film that really astounds and disturbs. It does not, like many films, eschew genuine moral revelation. It stays dedicated to its aims, stubbornly refusing to deviate from its purpose.To be more specific; Dogville is a story focusing on the attractive and seemingly innocent fugitive, Grace. She is found one night by a young man who refuses a handsome reward in order to protect this intriguing woman. Consequentially, Grace undergoes various phases to integrate herself into the community of Dogville; and at first it seems that she has succeeded. However, appearances are not all what they seem in Dogville and Grace must find out the hard way how the moral systems and beliefs work in small town U.S.A.Von Trier poses many difficult and elaborate questions to first its characters, and then to his audience. Firstly the moral plethora of small town life would it be in America or in the world; would you be so impartial to actually admit that you would not act in the same manner as Dogville's denizens when they decide to revoke their earlier pledges? Would you be as vindictive and unforgiving had similar circumstances afflicted yourself? Would you not also consider the darkness in the recesses of your own soul and heart? Without impartiality you will never achieve any sort of edification from this film. It is not benign, or unrelenting in any form. Therefore be warned, its coda is not going to ascertain any form of comforting truths of human nature. Disturbing and morbid, yet truly classy and philosophical. Watch it now and learn something about yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comment on a comment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would just like to comment on the comment of the guy from New York City. He is saying that the satire on America is hardly to notice. He's is right about that, but when you know what Lars von Trier stands for: Dogme 95, you know how is making a satire of America. He is doing that through the mise-en-scene, the cinematography, the sound etc etc. Dogme 95 stands for making a film in its purest form. So the film can only be made within a natural environment with natural lights. No props may be used unless they are on location. No artificial sounds and lights may be used. That means no voice-over, no music that has been added. Dogme 95 also stands for not using weapons and not committing murder (in the narrative of the film that is). Also the film must take place where the camera is standing and it has to take place in the here and now. Looking at those rules that have been set up by Lars von Trier and Tomas Vinterbergen and putting those next to the way Dogville has been made, then you see in which way von Trier made a mockery out of America. The entire film takes place in some sort of hall. It is not a natural environment. Also the lights are artificial. There is no mise-en-scene which means there are no real houses and furniture: they are painted on the ground. It is as artificial as it can be. That is also the deal for the sound: there is a voice-over in the film and music has been added. There are also superficial actions taking place. That means murder and weapons. The narrative of the film does not take place in the here and now and sometimes you hear the story taking place without seeing the people that play out the story. So the film doesn't always take place where the camera is standing. Personally I think that von Trier made the film in anti-Dogme way to point out that America's way of making film and therefor way of life is anti his way of life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing film that bucks convention and stabs you where it hurts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's film "Dogville" is longer than your usual fare. Yes.The situations in his films get worse two or three times when you think the film is supposed to end. Yes.The lack of sets and the allegorical Grover's Corners-like nature of the storytelling in "Dogville" require more suspension of disbelief than your usual movie. Yes.And all I have to say to these "critiques" is SO WHAT? It's a fantastic movie that has done nothing but stick with me since the last credits rolled and the DVD copyright warning label came up at the end of it. I didn't want to turn it off.**SPOILERS THROUGHOUT**What I find fascinating is that many people view the lack of sets and say to themselves "How am I to SEE this film?" From the people up, that's how. It's exactly what many modern movies lack, the trust that the viewer can use his/her imagination, and that the imagination can quite often be sharper than being shown everything on film. It's the cut-away of the camera when the cop's ear is sliced off in "Reservior Dogs" that resonates, isn't it? The viewer's "job," much as he/she doesn't want to do it, is to see the choices a film-maker has made, and then try to understand WHY that choice might have been made. Several critiques listed here describe the lack of walls as a way to put everything that happens in this film, good or very bad, into the middle of the street, and see how everyone in town fails to react when it's right in front of them. My mother was abused by her mother and stepfather for many years, virtually until she married my father and got the hell out of the house, and the presence of walls did absolutely nothing to make anyone do something about it. The neighbors, the family friends, the townsfolk might as well have been in Dogville for all the good they did. That's allegory at its best. And Grace's lack of scars was all the more heart-rending, because the townspeople would never have to "see" the effects of the harm they caused, or have any proof that harm was done at all, which of course enabled them to continue doing it. The scars were all taken internally, bottling up until the film's conclusion.One of the things I found interesting is that Von Trier was successful in vilifying human nature in a very American setting yet making it universal in scope, removing cultural and racial circumstances from the picture. The black woman and her crippled daughter were just as callous, just as demanding, just as enslaving as their white neighbors. They live there by the good graces of the town elder, Dr. Thomas Edison, and the black mother is a cleaning lady herself, more apt than anyone to understand and empathize with the plight of the servant, and yet she's just as horrible to Kidman's character as everyone else in town. Add the time-frame of the Depression era to the picture, and you see an entire population of people in hard times, marginalized by "society" and a victim in one way or another, and yet so easily willing to take their hardship and thrust it at someone else: all the bile, all the hate, all the jealousy, all the violence, all the meanness.Then there's the absence of religion in the picture, which I find very interesting as well. The town preacher had left, and no one would be coming to take over the parish, leaving the townsfolk to "moralize" themselves. It was an excellent way to illustrate the short-comings of morality as a dogmatic instrument without putting it in the hands of Christianity alone, making the allegory, if you wish to call it that, more universal and cross-cultural.Then there's the return to focus on America's short-comings as a generous and moral nation during the closing credits, which evoke such anger and resentment from American viewers. As an American, it was hard to sit and watch the end of the film because I knew the finger of blame was shifted from a universal meditation on human nature and placed squarely in my face. But it's nonetheless fitting in its own way. America is the richest country in the world, the most powerful country in the world, and we talk about how oppressed we were by the British 200 years ago and how we somehow still represent the meek as a result. We haven't been the meek in quite some time, and it's time we admit it. We have more capability to combat poverty than any single nation, and we don't do it. Not REALLY. We are all Toms, including myself, black and white, immigrant and "native" (and there are statements about what has happened to the true Native Americans that can be put into this dilemma as well), seeing the problems and feeling awful about them, but not doing anything about them for fear that we will lose something, like Tom's allowance from his comparatively wealthy father. What better period to put at the end of Von Trier's sentence than that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yesterday evening, I saw "DogVille" for the first time. People around me were very enthusiastic about it, and so was IMDb. That's why I had great expectations of it.But after three hours, I was totally disappointed. And though the plot outline was interesting to me, I couldn't deny having the feeling of wasting three hours of my life. And I tell you why.First, the cinematography was completely annoying. Useless camera moves, almost amateur use of zooming and twisting, and, most of all, distant and cold. The editing was painful for my eyes; fast, uncompleted - sometimes I thought the editor did never finish his work! The end was suddenly awful, and it didn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie. The music of the credits showed me a lack of taste; how can someone play such happy music after an awful scene?! And I didn't like Kidman's role; it simply lacked some credibility. Why did she stay in such a horrible place? And why didn't she tell the people of Dogville that she was the victim? That's why my mouth fell open when I discovered by who she was being chased...Though, I really liked the idea and the production design (beautiful minimalistic). But it isn't enough to save this movie. Simply a waste of a fine cast.Mister Von Trier, this could have been so much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dogs of Dogville (Reflecting on Dogville)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't remember the last time I watched a film as provocative as Dogville. It had a good premise, out standing acting and an extremely satisfying twist. A cross between theater and reading a novel, Dogville traces the tragic experiences of the fugitive, Grace and the events that take place when the town of Dogville takes her in. Moments of the film were devastating, not surprising from Lars von Trier but unlike Dancer in the Dark, the film was not only shocking but oddly satisfying. I couldn't help but smile as I watched revenge at its best. However, more profounding were the messages the film sought to raise. First of all, Dogville completely blew the phrase "oh its only human" out of the water. Being human is not an excuse for behavioural flaws, injustice and negligence. In fact, by being human, one should have the will and conscience to mend their personal flaws as opposed to just sit on them. Further more, the film raises the idea that we are utterly, obliviously immersed in our own ego. Grace felt that her own ethical standards were higher than that of others and in her arrogance, she was willing to forgive people for actions she would not forgive herself. The inhabitants of Dogville represented every thing that wasn't human which resulted in bloodshed as Grace came to terms with her arrogance. She swallowed her petty pride and unleashed revenge as opposed to the unconditional and undeserving forgiveness we are all so accustomed to. Grace realized that "being human" was no justification for the inhumanity and degradation of Dogville. The truth was, the people of Dogville deserved very bit of punishment Grace was willing to inflict. It is not human to succumb to temptation, it is not human to have no self control and it is not human to betray trust. The so called humble town which represented every thing our twisted morals saw as human and good turned out be the greatest tragedy of them all. And the bitter irony echoes through the final scene with a bark from the last inhabitant of Dogville. The only person who remained true as a human, the dog of Dogville. We would force a dog to be human so that we our selves can be dogs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A statement on morality, or our lack of it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once again, Lars Von Trier, has presented us with a thought-provoking and disturbingly honest account of the human condition. To my mind, the main message related to the incredible amount of cognitive energy we humans will expend in attempting to prove to ourselves that we are not subject to the 'hard wired' behaviours that make us human. Some will go to great lengths to avoid seeing this in themselves and in others, and will justify behaviours that they believe are immoral and unethical on the basis of causal life events.At times, it is necessary to state that something is just not acceptable, and to hold others accountable to the same standards to which we attempt to strive. This involves making a personal decision regarding what will be tolerated, an action that requires courage and honesty. Although we differ with regard to how much of our 'true selves' we are prepared to display, and some will require extreme provocation before they will 'revert to type' (Grace, for example), in the end we will behave in a self-centred and ultimately self-sustaining manner.It seems that we just can't accept that we, in the same manner as all other species, will ensure that we always have our needs met. Morality may simply be an acceptable word for the attempts we make to have others conform in a manner that meets our needs. Who can say? Each time I watch one of his movies, I think that he will never be able to make a better movie next time. And he always proves me wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Dogville, Depression describes not only the economy but the psychology. The implication is that without its material wealth, life in America would be as cruel and inhumane as in much of the "developing" world. It must have been intentional to present this with an uninteresting script, childish dialog, and mostly flat performances (the empty sets was obviously intentional). Maybe it all helped highlight the inhumanity (Grace displayed only childlike kindness). Skarsgaard and Sevigny were apparently allowed to use their considerable talents. Eliminating the entertainment seems to require a little too much audience participation in the misery.</fullReview>

It is a gripping portrayal of how humans take advantage of one another, and how greed and selfishness can affect people. The acting in the film was absolutely BRILLIANT. Nicole Kidman's beautiful and nuanced performance is NOT TO BE MISSED.It is the best one of her career (followed closely by THE HOURS and TO DIE FOR). Kudos also go to Paul Bettany, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Sarsgard and Chloe Sevigny for absolutely pitch perfect performances. The concept of the film was also brilliant. The use of minimal set and putting the whole thing in the chalk outline of a small town gave it such an alienating quality that was absolutely gripping. It is a cinematic Our Town, only darker (if possible).Something must also be said for Patricia Clarkson's performance. I cannot believe I forgot about her earlier. WOAH!!! Amazing. The Best Thing I've ever seen her do.I cannot tell you how wonderful and brilliant this movie is. It's three hour running time was the best Three hours of my week. I cannot believe that this film was not recognized by more of the mainstream awards in the US. Especially the Best Acting Ensemble award at the SAG's. The ensemble of this movie was STELLAR.

		<fullReview>I can not get the movie Dogville out of my mind. I loved it. It was beautifully written and acted. I escaped, at one point in my life, from a town like Dogville, called Lakehills. I have tried to explain to friends how that town was, now I may just tell them to watch Dogville. I wish that film makers would make more movies like that. Dogville explores the human soul at length, for better or worse. It was a beautiful portrayal of a girl growing into a woman and leaving her naiveté behind. Yes, there are people like Tom and Chuck and Vera in the world. Quite a few. But there are many kind, beautiful people like Grace out there also. The trick is for the Graces of the world to recognize the Chucks and steer clear. Many women are battered because they forgive their attackers. Please make more movies like Dogville. Please.

		<shortDescription>Slightly at Odds Idealisms</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My initial slight objection to this brilliant effort by von Trier and, especially, Kidman was that the dark change in the middle chapters comes too easily or too abruptly. It feels "written," rather than lived. So does the grand, brilliant change in Kidman in the final chapter feel "written" and "acted." But Dogville was, of course, both written and acted. None of the actors ever quite hides foreknowledge of the script's later turnings. I don't think von Trier wholeheartedly meant them to. Even if they'd been able to, the gaps between von Trier's ten chapters, smoothed by sardonic narration, absorb some of the jolt.All through, even at the very beginning, Grace's submission to Tom carries a hint of condescension. She is after all a city girl, a moll of some sort, so they think, their inferior perhaps but not exactly.In the end, but no less at that very beginning, Dogville is about, and Dogville's citizens witness, condone, and abhor the clash between Tom Edison's and Grace's at least slightly at odds idealisms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happens when there is power without forgiveness?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times I thought this movie was long and that the main character (Grace) had an unrealistic lack of backbone but later I learned that it was all to set the stage for a beautiful work of film art that is most worthy of attention. The whole story centers around a misconception of the main character who is in every sense a Christ-like being. I believe that most people who have seen the film have taken it the wrong way. They see it as a slam on humanity. It's not. It's the negative of the picture of Christ's story.There is the myth among the townspeople that the one who is the weakest and most in need is the least powerful. They begin by treating her well. Later, familiarity breeds contempt and in the end they treat her very badly. It's hard to watch all the mistreatment inflicted on her. Still, just enough balance is applied that in the refreshingly unpredictable ending you can still feel sorry for the horrible townspeople. Grace decides that she will use her power to destroy. There is no last monologue where all is settled to the betterment of humanity. There is only brute force and destruction. She allows only a dog to live. What happens when there is power without forgiveness? This question can be applied in many places. If one takes the current situation in Iraq, if one looks at the retaliation that followed September 11, 2001. One can even look at their own life and remember the times when they have had the power to destroy within reach.I'm very glad to have seen this film. It's made me realize the value of forgiveness by pointing to a lack of it.</fullReview>

This brilliant, unique work has Nicole Kidman in one of her most memorable roles ever. The build up and the climax are beyond description as the emotions rip your innerself apart as the conflicting fear, happiness, suspicion, and anger are mix together and by the end of the movie its impossible to really explain what happened and what it means. I consider this film a masterful work of art...with solid acting (both film and stage) and the cinematography and camera work, and sound effects, direction are amazing and must have been quite complicated. This fusion of sight and sound - presents the audience with a new experience with new critical moral thoughts and raises questions of the most deepest kind. An important work that I hope will stand the test of all time. Ten out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the time the town begins to brutalise Grace, I became increasingly alienated from characters, like Tom, that I hoped might overcome their self-centred desires. I guess I couldn't understand how they could stop seeing her as another person. But the conversation in the car at the end on Graces arrogance made sense of it all. By setting herself higher moral standards than everyone else, she was guilty of a greater arrogance, and a refusal to take some personal responsibility. That is why, when she orders the massacre of the town, I felt a sick sense of satisfaction. Not only was she enacting retribution, but she had realized the source of her weakness, her victimisation. Dogville is a masterful example of sophistry. It's painful to watch and leaves a dirty taste in your mouth.

		<shortDescription>Oh, I think you have plenty to offer Dogville.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. While I am normally a man of words with these reviews, all I can say about this film is 'Wow'. After a very fast three hours, I was surprised, shocked, amazed, and excited about what I just witnessed. Film God (if you don't mind me calling him that) Lars von Trier has done it again. With each film of his that you watch, you can only be more and more impressed with the level of intelligence and passion that he has for his films. Breaking the Waves was Trier's first film I ever saw, and I still think his story of unbounded love is gut wrenching. It will make any grown man or woman tear up. He successfully redefined the musical with Dancer in the Dark giving a platform for singer Bjork to show her talents. Now, he has come full circle and directed a film that touches such a variety of different topics. When you watch this film you will see images of women's rights, rape, slavery, depression, poverty, hatred, and justice. For those of you weak of heart, Trier does not sugar coat anything. He gives us such a powerful stage to watch these actors do their trade that we cannot help but get caught up in everything that they do. Dogville is a cross between 'Our Town' and The Godfather with a twist of Trier's other films. It gives us the story of a woman, passionately played by Nicole Kidman, who chooses to live in a town of corruption because she believes in the human spirit. The human element is stronger than any evil. Kidman, literally, gives the performance of her career proving yet again that she is not afraid to tackle any female role. Her work has continually proved that women can be a dominant force in cinema. This film is no different. Add to the mix a powerhouse of independent players like Patricia Clarkson, Chloe Sevigny, John Hurt, James Caan, Lauren Bacall, Jeremy Davies, and Ben Gazzara and Trier's stage-like film is easily transformed into the cinematic event of the decade. To add to the superb acting, you also have the most creative eye in Hollywood today. The silver screen could not be what it is today without the work of Lars von Trier. His talent far exceeds anyone else in Hollywood. If I could time capsule any film in cinema for others to find later, I think it would be Dogville. From the delicious opening scene to the ending credits which will literally blow your mind and make you see true images of this nation, Trier does not hide anything. If there is one director on the planet that I would like to meet, it would be him. I hear he is such an ogre when making these films, yet the finished product is always nothing short of a masterpiece. I still have those images and song ringing through my mind when the final credits rolled. It was a completely different atmosphere than the rest of the film, but yet it worked and completely blew my mind. Trier is the Picasso of the film world. His art will challenge and destroy any preconceived notions while all the same making you look inside of yourself.This was the best movie made in 2003 with no further doubts in my mind. To have a canvas that not only allows independent thought, yet covers a topic that is feared is a feat not taken enough in Hollywood. The acting was phenomenal, the direction was crisp and focused, and the story was disturbing and powerful. This film broke all other film boundaries. While I still have trouble understanding every issue brought forth in this film, I cannot wait to watch it again and experience small town America. Bravo to everyone involved with this film.Bravo, Lars von Trier, Bravo!!!Grade: ***** out of ***** (The best film of 2003!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville is Great!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies like Dogville don't come along very often. Some will say `Amen' to that. For me, Dogville is the reason I love film, and go to the show. Dogville is a work of the highest imagination and art. I could say there is great risk taking here but von Triers knows exactly what he wants and it is here to see and experience, love it or hate it. Many reviewers point out, some gloat, that von Tiers has never been to America. How can he know enough without having been here to make a film about America? 'People are the same all over, greedy as dogs' a character states. This is about the human condition so it could be set anywhere. But coming as it does, at this time in our national history, it is indeed a comment and judgment on America and Americans. Is there anywhere in the world where people are not exposed to the culture that is America? We need to see how we are seen and experienced around the world.Dogville is a film about hope and dreams and about smashed hopes and dreams. The acting is incredible especially Nicole Kidman's work. She is not afraid of risk. She makes the scene at the end with her father and the transformation involved completely believable. The rapes scenes carry such impact because of her ability show us how crushing such acts are. Here we can witness, in some small way, what mass media is hiding from us on a daily basis. Paul Bettany's Tom, the town philosopher, is a rich, complex character not easily understood but the more fascinating for that.The actors have to compete with the set which seems odd given there's almost no set there. But presented with the minimalism of the town of Dogville I felt empowered by the director. The set exists as a kind of opposition to The Matrixes, The Lords of the Ring, and other films where the special effects provide the imagination for us. Here we're allowed to create along with von Triers. And finally yes, this is a pessimistic story. But have you noticed what going on in the world today?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>spoilersI've briefly skimmed through other reviews and most of them arebrandishing the 'anti-American' sword. I watched Dogville lastnight (and I'm going again tomorrow) and I have to say that treatingit as anti-American is one long stretch! This seems to reflectsparanoia more than anything else. Although set in Depression- era USA, I don't think it was supposed to portray a typical Americantown in any way; it was rather supposed to trace the twists andturns (and ugliness) of human nature.I haven't seen many of Lars Von Trier's movies, but I have seen"Breaking the Waves," and I think that the two are very similar in theway they present a situation that turns around itself at one point todepict the exact opposite of what it has hitherto represented andstood for. It was somewhat also very reminiscent of ShirleyJackson's short story, "The Lottery," where a town organizes alottery once a year, where the winner gets stoned by the rest of thetown.With this perverse mood lurking in the background, "Dogville" is adisturbing movie, yet incredibly amazing. It should not be takenliterally. I missed the first ten minutes, so I don't know if there wasan explanation given as to why the town is called Dogville, but itdoesn't take long to find out why that would be. As the sayinggoes, homo homini lupus, or "man is wolf to man," and this isexactly what Dogville (the movie and the town) is about. In theconversation Grace has with her father at the end, they talk aboutacting within one's nature and how condemnable that is. Up untilthen Grace is too graceful, but she finally gets it, and although thelast ten minutes are violent, it really is the best thing she's done inthe movie.So instead of being anti-American, this movie is rather anti-blind- Christian-charity. Grace (what a name!) takes everything in andforgives everyone, until she realizes that it's ridiculous to put upwith what one does not have to put up with, and that there is noreason for some people to get away with things by depending onothers' good christian sense.The setting was surreal. Despite it one still falls for the story anddisregards the fact that it's a set, that "Elm Street has no elms,"and that even at the end of the movie it still felt weird when peopleopened and closed doors. The acting was excellent, thephotography sublime. Without reservation, I give this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

Can anyone walk away from this movie and not mourn the decline of American society - and American film? Over the last few years some wonderful films have been made, films that are very moving, or very poignant, or very sad, drawing the audience in, leaving the viewer feeling flattered by the director's sharing of his or her compassionate vision. "Station Agent", for example. But "Dogville" is something peculiarly disconnected from the viewer. Rather than wanting to win the viewer over, this film places you in "Dogville", a member of the community - for a time. Then suddenly, before you have time to "figure it out", you are ripped out of the community...you are part of the death of the community. Are these the only choices we have? Is all of life merely about the wielding of power? Killer or victim? And how can such a bleak vision, so abstract, so god-awful, be so uplifting, so intoxicating? I guess that's where the magic comes in. The harshest truths, when conveyed in a completely original "language", leave one dazed.</fullReview>

It also features a brilliant, thought-provoking storyline made possible through some of the finest performances from some of the premiere actors and actresses working. Set aside any controversy you may have heard about director Lars von Trier's alleged anti-American undertones. Also, be prepared for the long haul- the movie runs close to three hours. But Nicole Kidman, who gets better with every role, and her fantastic supporting cast, led by Paul Bettany and Lauren Bacall, make this one of the more rewarding and refreshing movies you will ever see.

		<shortDescription>Great theater, but is it great cinema?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would not expect from Lars Van Tier a conventional movie. Since 'Kingdom' and 'Breaking the Waves' each of the director's movies was different, and his creative research and his lack of continuity are part of a great creator and innovator profile. So the fact that 'Dogville' is different did not came as a surprise to me.Actually the problem that I have with this movie is that it is too similar to another genre. If you are a theater fan, if your read and watched enough plays by Berthold Brecht or Henrik Ibsen, the formula used by Van Tier will seem very familiar to you. Yes, this looks exactly like filmed theatre. great theatre, original, strong, enrolled in the good way, as the two great masters of the social and moral theatre have defined it. Still, cinema has its own rules, and by cinema rules 'Dogville' misses being an enjoyable experience. It lacks both dream or realism which are at the basis of a cinema experience and it lacks the visual quality of a cinema work of art. It is also too long. What are we left with? A strong moral message, a sharp critic of the capitalist system, of the lack of sensitivity and the rule of mob that is hidden in the community life led by artificial concepts instead of human solidarity. We are also left with many questions =- do the characters deserve their end? is the film anti-American? these are left open intentionally, but a good piece of art needs not answer such questions.Nicole Kidman's acting is superb.I wish I have seen this work on stage. As a film, it is hard to forget, but it lacks top cinema quality. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was a "love it" person</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I went to see this movie, I read that it is either a "love it" or "hate it" movie. I like all kinds of movies, from popcorn flicks to art house, from mindless to thoughtful. I was curious as to which side I fell into. I LOVED it. I don't know what more to say about the movie that others who loved it didn't already say. The only practical advice I have to give is this: please stay and watch the whole movie, no matter how difficult it gets. The hand-held camera made me nauseous, but after a while I got used to it. von Trier's intelligent camera work makes up for the sparse setting and it surprised me to note that though the movie was on a sound stage, with the mere help of light and sounds, there were so many beautifully "scenic" scenes. I realized also that though the setting was so basic, I believed that a town existed and could think of several towns that I have been in that "looked" like Dogville. No review would be complete without mention of the awesome cast and acting. You would have to have AMAZING acting for such an experiment to work, and it was the acting that brought it all together for me. I have always been a fan of Kidman, but she amazed me even more here. There was one scene in particular in which her acting convinced me that she is indeed one of the most talented actresses of our time. I knew a lot about this movie before I went to see it and was afraid that my knowledge would ruin it for me...make it boring.

		<shortDescription>Dogville is a masterpiece, Ms. Kidman shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is a classic and a masterpiece. Despite its three hour run, this film is a triumph. This film is not anti-american at all. Nicole Kidman delivers another luminous and great performance. She should get her second Oscar for her portrayal of Grace. Nicole is truly one of the great actresses of our time and is comparable to the great actresses of Hollywood's Golden Age. it's sad to say that this kind of film never gets any mainstream success. the oscar voters should keep this film in consideration. Even though it is shot in a bare soundstage, this film will amaze you in its storytelling and its acting. Open mindedness is the key to be able to admire dogville.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your money or time on this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to a preview screening of this movie in LA this weekend. And, I must say this is one of the few times people in the audience openly booed at the end of the movie, particularly loudly when the Director's name appeared on the screen. What's wrong with it: First: it's too long, I don't think anything was edited out of the film - it should have been only 90 minutes long, not three hours. Second: While the acting by nearly everyone in the film is excellent, the plot was ridiculous and unbelievable - and at the end of the film you realize nobody in the film is an admirable person in the least. Third: Initially, I was impressed with the staging of the film, assuming it was a prologue to the actual movie. But the staging looses it's appeal after about 30 minutes, and becomes trying and tired. As I was leaving the theater I mentioned to the two friends who joined me (that will probably NEVER let me choose a movie we see together again) "This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time" people walking out around me actually gave me the high sign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing bare-bones character study.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is an astonishing piece of work. Essentially a stage play with no sets and very few props, the film demonstrates that with a good story, interesting characters, and great performances you don't need anything else to be wholly satisfying. I found myself reflecting on the film a lot after viewing it. Specifically comparing the actions and attitudes of the characters in the film to the reactions of the audience with whom I view it. I couldn't help but be disturbed by the bloodthirsty audience relishing in the revenge tale set before us. While it's not a film I could watch over and over again, I still plan on adding it to my DVD collection the second it becomes available. I think it's that extra-ordinary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is your darkside too !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier shows us the dark side of humanity, it's not just about Americans, it's about people in general. Just like the people in Breaking the waves and Dancer in the dark, main characters in Dogville are normal people as you can find them everywhere, but under curtain circumstances they change, the nice neighbour becomes a murderer, a thief or a rapist. You and I might react the same way, in the same situation. And to be honest, wouldn't you take your change, when you are the master in a master/slave - relationship, wouldn't you abuse a beautiful woman if you're almost curtain that no one will ever punish you for your crime. Then there is a young woman, almost a saint, she forgives, she carries her cross without hesitating, until the moment when she breaks. The good Grace dies, and she is reborn a disappointed woman (she lost her belief in all that's good, in humanity in general), full of hate and wishing for revenge. No mercy for the people of Dogville, only for Mozes - the dog , cause he is the only innocent being in Dogville. The world sure is better place without Dogville. The world would surely a better place without humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Spirit of Dogme Applied to Stage Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dogme Vow of Chastity states within it, "My supreme goal is to force the truth out of my characters and settings." While the Dogme Manifesto insisted on location shooting with only local props, the spirit of Dogme was film-making in the raw and that certainly occurs in script and staging with DOGVILLE.Lars von Trier wrote, directed, and worked the camera on this film, and used an outstanding cast of accomplished actors to achieve was is ultimately a morphing of a minimalist play brought to heights that only cinematic efforts could achieve. It brings the story to the bone, and bares the bones of the most human behaviors. There are few props and less set pieces to assist the actors. Most of their physical guides were chalk lines on a black floor, and each other. The hype about it being an exhaustive experience for Nicole Kidman is very believable after experiencing the movie.Kidman stars as Grace, a woman who suddenly appears in a remote mountain town, which hides her from her pursuers at the behest of a self-appointed philosopher and spiritual leader of the town Tom (Paul Bettany). If she proves herself, they'll do for her, if she'll do for them. At first, she wins them over, but eventually things begin to change.Be warned; it's a haunting work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Commentary on American Slavery?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can add me to the list of people who find DOGVILLE an extremely powerful movie. I have just seen it at the Florida Film Festival in Orlando, Florida, where some people seem to have hated the film but where I found it to be one of the most important films I have ever seen. Why do I consider it important? Because I think it deals with very large and crucial ideas for our extremely troubled times. If it is true that von Trier is examining America in his latest films, I believe that he is serving a very important function in our country's awareness of itself. It seems to me that DANCER IN THE DARK finally metamorphoses into an indictment of capital punishment, an institution that some might say has no place in a highly civilized society. What does DOGVILLE seem to be about? I think it might be von Trier's attack on the history of American slavery. I don't know if what follows should be considered a spoiler, but, to be safe, I should warn that I am about to outline what I think the ending of the film is about. It is clear from the beginning of the film that von Trier has American issues in mind, not only because he sets the film in America but because he mimics Thornton Wilder's OUR TOWN, a classic text of literary Americana. Grace arrives in Dogville mysteriously and her father, at first, appears to be a villain, and the town, at first, appears to be her savior. But after Grace survives initially by giving the townspeople her labor, she becomes increasingly exploited until she is literally put in chains. The progression of Grace's exploitation in the town and the film's use of chain imagery is too striking to be an insignificant detail in the film. Grace's docility under this enslavement is only broken by her father, who turns out to be not a villain but a liberator, a brutally honest man who helps her see her captors more clearly. Grace comes finally to see herself not as a noble martyr but as a cleansing agent who will bring hard justice to an arrogant community. She spares the dog, who is not a rational animal, because it cannot be blamed for simply following its natural instincts. The townspeople have no such excuse. As creatures capable of rationality, the citizens of DOGVILLE have a responsibility to lead rational lives. Thus, DOGVILLE is a wake up call for a nation that often fails to see itself honestly. For hundreds of years, America violated its own Constitutional principles by refusing to recognize the humanity of its dark-skinned people. Now, in its continued arrogance, America generally sees slavery as an irrelevant problem of the past and considers affirmative action a new kind of injustice. For centuries, America refused to recognize the equality of women and now blithely considers sexism a dead issue. But as we enter a new century, America is once again refusing to recognize the basic human rights of a large portion of its citizens, its gay people, and once again this blindness is perpetrated in the name of tortured logic and tawdry Christian principles. America needs effective gadflies, even if they turn out to be Danish.</fullReview>

Some acting is technically very well, but never it succeeds in sucking me in the story. This movie was certainly a very big disappointment to me !!

		<shortDescription>Lars Von Trier the misogynist returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the possible exception of THE IDIOTS, every film I have seen by Trier has been pushing a really disturbing female stereotype.The women are universally portrayed as Martyrs whose self sacrifice is the only option available to them. But their martyrdom is never for themselves but always for a male who directly or indirectly benefits from their stupidity and self sacrifice. In Breaking the Waves and Dancer In The Dark both main female characters allow themselves to be tortured and killed in order to benefit the men in their lives (BTW her husband and DITD Selma's son.)The fact that both sacrifices are completely illogical is ignored. In fact in Breaking The Waves the rape and murder of the main female (Bess) is actually shown to have had the beneficial effect of letting her husband walk again after a terrible accident. in Dogville it seems like Trier has realized this and is willing to look at it. In Dogville he seriously questions these portrayals of self sacrifice, of forgiveness and looks to see where they come from. The final conversation between Grace and her father illustrates this idea beautifully and finally the female archetype, which is essentially what Trier is writing about rather than the female character, acknowledges that these tendencies which society has tried to push upon her and which has given her a false sense of place, security and most importantly superiority, is self deception and leads to her enslavement.But don't be fooled. Von Trier has not turned over a new leaf...Grace is ill used by the townspeople, made to be a sex as well as labour slave and yes Von Trier finally allows her to toss away her martyrdom and enact revenge on the townsfolk who have used her so badly... but.. why... is it for her own empowerment? No. In order to do this Grace becomes the one thing she was running from in the first place - the pawn of her father. She sacrifices herself to him as surely as Bess and Selma sacrificed themselves to their male family members. So the message has been refined not changes - women should find the power to fight against the slavery brought by society but not that by the men in their immediate lives.In BTW and DITD both Selma and Bess also stood up to the cruel bigoted and corrupt men in their society - Bess the church, Selma her landlord whom she killed. But like Grace, once placed in a position where they were asked to surrender to their family they did so willingly.Lars Von Trier is a good technical filmmaker, the form is always interesting, whether using "dogma" or Brechtian styles. But h e uses the form to gain comment and the appalling content and theme is often completely ignored. He's a master manipulator but probably not a very nice human being. she doesn't just offer herself up as a sacrifice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I like Lars Von Trier and I'm a big fan of almost all his films I've seen. Even "Dancer In The Dark", being more the Bjork's showcase than Trier's masterpiece, still bears a stamp of genius.However, here's an absolutely different story. While "Dancer..." has been a wonderful and pretty controversial attempt of making people seeing the film look as the Pavlov's dogs (can one keep from weeping watching Selma's death I wonder?), "Dogville" tries to elicit the same hysterical reaction from the average beholder, but fails to do so. Perceiving this movie as a simple debunking of rotten American life would be too narrow and stupid, but as a global philosophical issue about putrescense of human civilization it also looks rather trite and undeveloped (Ulrich Seidl's "Hundstage" is the best example of this kind of social pamphlet). So where's the idea? I'm afraid that nowhere at all. I'm not insisting that any film must have a philosophical point in it, but since the director conciously gives up any special effects or decorative grandeur (narrowing the scene to a rather schematic little city), he must offer something instead. In this particular case Trier's formal minimalism gives no dividends on a compositional level. And the final realistic close-ups with bleeding children and screaming women look like a part of another movie. Not only "Dogville" lacks integrity and sense of proportion, it most of all lacks creativity and thus turns out a strong disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastical And Critical Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Dogville" every action has a strange reaction, and the acts and thoughts are really like a boomerang: they always find a way to return to the place where it was thrown out. Nicole Kidman plays Grace, a woman running away from the mob who is reluctantly accepted in a small Colorado town named Dogville. In exchange, she agrees to work for them. But when the police starts to show up questioning the habitants of the town about her she finds out that their support has a price. Divided in 9 long parts (almost three hours of film) and a epilogue, and narrated by John Hurt in a bookish way, Lars von Trier's film is a great and original work of criticism, art, and perhaps of shocking realism despite the lack of scenarios might distract some viewers. "Dogville" the first part of a trilogy about the United States, is a concept film. There's a non subtle and powerful message towards acceptance, and how people are in America and their estranged behavior towards outsiders (the unknown you might call). But it's not just a critical film, it is a experience to be viewed, very different of everything you've seen. The director didn't built a set for the city; it's only a stage with chalk marks on the floor delimiting the spaces along with few objects on scene, and the actors were required to imagine/create the doors and walls for this fictional American city of the 1930's. I don't want to spoil the fun of viewing this masterpiece and I won't tell what happens with Grace during her stay in Dogville but I must say a few things about the aspects of the film that were harshly criticized or over viewed as prejudicial and/or controversial. This movie was called of Anti-American by some people and even reviewers. It is an Anti-American film? Not so much. It criticizes all the posture adopted by U.S. after the 9/11 attacks, making difficult the acceptance of foreigners in the country: A serious look towards other nations along with the eternal suspicious on other people acts. When Michael Moore showed us in "Fahrenheit 9/11" the thinking of some Americans about people who don't live in their country and happens to be "in one of those little town similar to Dogville" they say to the camera how they receive foreigners with lots of suspicion. This is a general picture, the usual portrayal of all the Americans? I don't think so. After all there's good and bad in every one, in every nation, but the director/writer wanted to tell a story that took place in U.S., but it could be placed everywhere. An ensemble casting from around the world compounds the Americans of Dogville (Paul Bettany, Stellan Skarsgard, Zeljko Ivanek) and some American actors too (Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Jeremy Davies, Chloe Sevigny, Patricia Clarkson, Blair Brown, Philip Baker Hall). Every single performance in this movie is perfect, although some performers should have more time on screen, more dialogs also. The most notable performances comes from Kidman, Paul Bettany and Stellan Skarsgard (very strong and scary acting).The epilogue showing pictures of the poor people living in America mixed with the great song "Young Americans" by David Bowie (closing credits) is the highlight the summarizes the film, wonderful and shocking. By that time if you didn't get von Trier's idea or find the film boring you missed a huge deal and a great film. Excellent, excellent, excellent! 10/10</fullReview>

It's a movie that looks like a play, yet has few props. Heck, there aren't even walls. This is good. This is good because instead of critiquing clothing, sets, gratuitous sex, and action, you can totally wrap your head around the characters, their actions, and their commentary.Dogville is gritty and real. It's about people you know; it may even be about you. It's about men and women who refuse to look in the mirror, or take responsibility for their actions. It's about the crap people dish out, and the crap that people will take. It's about how, over time, that crap can affect people. It's about the dark side of people. It's about their many inhospitable layers.Dogville's ending is perfect. Finally, a movie that ends the way it should! Also, what a nice (and brilliant) surprise to see James Caan in the back seat of that car! So, while watching Dogville, you recognize that your boyfriend degrades you, or that you take advantage of people, or manipulate them with words, or that you're turning your child into a vulgar copy of yourself, or that you're abusive - do something about it; instead of sticking your head in the sand like Von Trier's characters. Because the bottom line is: watch how you treat people. Especially people you think are outcasts. Your treatment just might came back to bite you in your ass. It usually does. That's Karma! That's Dogville, baby!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I try to watch anything by Lars von Trier I can get to. He's an unconventional film-maker, and one of the too few who challenge what the medium is and what it can be, where the limits go. Yes; the houses in this are chalk outlines. It is a very bare set - at points it made me think of theater - and no, that does not make for a "pretty" movie. This isn't really meant to be a people-pleaser. It is quite brass, and delves into unpleasant themes. For the record, I don't see the reason(well, I see it, but I don't agree with it) for this being accused of being anti-American. What, because it's set there? The plot is engaging and involving from start to finish. While it is excellent, I'd say an excessive amount of emphasis has been placed upon the twist; this is about the journey, and not the destination(in spite of it being amazing). The characters and the interpersonal relationships are entirely credible and well-done. This is brilliantly cut, creating and maintaining the mood, and the cinematography, if limited, is marvelous, as well. The acting is flawless and impeccable. Even the children are astonishing. The script is impressive, and scenes and dialog are realistic. The well-written and rather verbal narration is used well and John Hurt is perfect in his delivery. Set during the 1930's in the US, a young woman on the run from the mob finds a small town, and this chronicles the developments that follow. Funny, tragic, cruel, deep and emotional. There is a lot of disturbing content including physical and psychological abuse, some violence(brutal in tone, if not in its depiction), and very infrequent mild language in this. The double-DVD holds an interesting selected commentary track(with the director), 7 compelling interviews &amp; "confessions", four featurettes(three of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), Cannes footage, a trailer and posters(apparently boasting no less than 198(!) minutes worth of documentaries). I recommend this powerful drama to mature audiences, not put off by the length(trust me, it's worth it, and this isn't boring at any time). 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tremendous achievement. Von Trier is a true artist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier has proved he is the anti-mainstream filmmaker. He shocked and disturbed me with his controversial and powerful Antichrist, so I seeked this film out. Dogville is a true achievement in the film-making medium. Directed, written, and acted to the highest level, it has originality and skill. The minimal use of set gives the film the tone it wants- one of unrelenting imprisonment. The ensemble cast is willing to do the film Trier wants them to. Nicole Kidman is a very strong actress, and she proves it again and again. Since the sets have no walls, whenever one actor is on screen, the rest have to be in character going along with their usual business. This must have been an extraordinarily difficult task to complete. Although the film is close to three hours long, and even there is only like one set for the whole film, the film is never dull or boring. The reason is because Von Trier engages the audience and has us asking what will be the ultimate circumstances of the film. The film ultimately asks us about human nature and morality. Lars Vin Trier definitely has proved he is one of the most talented and imaginative directors working today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful work of art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never fond of Nicole Kidman as an actress as I find her stunning beauty seriously distracting. That being said, she was magnificent in this movie playing a frail, idealistic and stoically beautiful fugitive. Yes, there is a touch of anti-Americanism in this movie, but it doesn't detract from its poetic portrayal of small town human weakness at its worst. The lack of traditional sceneries is initially unsettling, but ultimately adds to the narration throughout. It's a very differently made film, and every line, every scene, every expression, and every character is carefully, beautifully crafted throughout the film. This is what you feel watching this movie- that this is truly a treat to watch, a brilliantly thoughtful and non-overacted film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love it although the ending is brutal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a very huge fan of Nicole Kidman, and i bought this DVD 6 weeks ago. I had saved for my solemn because i found it pathetic to share with that, weird, isn't it? But today i'm not in that mood but i'm bored so i watched "Dogville". It's totally wonderful, although it's more a play than a movie but that aspect shows up all the things in Dogville barely, And that's just what we have to see in this one. Nicole Kidman did a terrific job! I was bursting into tears when i saw the parts the Dogville residents treated her, the parts that she was raped, the parts she was chained but the scene makes me weep and also be shocked is the last one, when Grace and her father were watching the whole town in fire, deaths... That proves me something... This girl, Grace... She is too merciful but not routine-mind, but the choice she chose was against all. And that's rational... I think i have to re-watch this movie (or play) more to understand the ending. It's a pretty long one but it worths my re-watch forever! If u haven't seen this, just go rent or buy the DVD now. By the way, Nicole looks really simply beautiful in this one :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful film... don't really think there is spoiler material here but am being cautious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came by this film a bit late; my reluctance to see this stemmed from the discomfort I felt when watching both 'Breaking the waves' and 'Dancer in the dark' by the same director. In each case, I questioned the necessity of the suffering the women protagonists were subjected to. I am prepared to consider I might be wrong but it was a gut reaction.Dogville is a movie that that I consider to be masterpiece standing but I can also appreciate the comments of those who found it inaccessible. For me it was engaging,thought provoking and emotive, touching on some uncomfortable truths about human nature, the behaviour of groups and how we sometimes justify our exploitation of others.The device of using a theatre format rather than a 'realistic' set is no gimmick. It adds so much, showing us the ugliness of a scene in parallel with the everyday life continuing its course. It is symbolic of not only what we do not see but also of what we choose not to see.Possibly the finest performance I have seen from Nicole Kidman who plays the enigmatic Grace. She stumbles into town on the run and has a secret that makes her vulnerable. Grace's would be saviour and 'champion' Tom, is a writer-in-waiting, a dreamer and the self-proclaimed philosopher of the little town of Dogsville. Mired by his own self-obsession he sees the town and their visitor as something for him to manipulate for the greater good. It is his own cowardice that gives him the most problem; he cannot face the human in himself or bear to consider that he is flawed. When he is forced to question his motivations, carnal desire and integrity, it seems to him that he has to cleanse himself and the town of the problem.Grace does not question the mistreatment she has experienced at the hands of the people of Dogsville; she is empathic, understanding and clings to her 'new' life despite hardship. However, Grace's past is in hot pursuit, forcing her to wrestle with her own nature and the balance between justice and forgiveness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the sad tale of the township of Dogville. Dogville was in the Rocky Mountains in the US of A, up where the road came to it's definitive end, near the entrance to the old abandoned silver mine. The residents of Dogville were good honest folks, and they liked their township. Or at least, that is what you are led to believe in the beginning of the movie. The residents of Dogville come across as congenial and likable, although slightly reserved.Starting here, the town's newcomer, Grace, initiates an exploration of the residents. Do they like their township? Are they good honest folks? Are they willing to shelter Grace, the fugitive? In order to convince the residents of Dogville to shelter her, she offers to work for them.Initially Grace has nothing to do, because every resident she offers help has nothing that needs to be done.Later on, one of the residents suggests that maybe there is some work that they do not need done, but would like done anyways. And Grace accepts. Suddenly, all the villagers realizes that they indeed do have work they do not need done, but would like done either way.This movie explores the possible outcome of a situation in which a group dominates an individual who is not in a position to say no, for Grace has nothing to barter with. Nothing at all. She is a fugitive on the run from gangsters. She depends on shelter in this distant little village. She has no option but to accept the conditions put forward by the villagers of Dogville.Do the good honest folks of Dogville have the moral standards to protect Grace in her moment of frailty? Does Grace exhibit sufficient respect for her hosts? Dogville runs at almost 3 hours. It is possibly the most powerful movie I have seen in years and it stays with me. It uninhibitedly explores the darker sides of human nature in it's purest form and arrives at a less desirable conclusion.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With this complex movie, Lars showed us a broad spectrum of saturated human emotions (rangeing from children-naive safety to sadistic pleasure).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These few words from me are not intended to be a classic movie review, I just wanted to share some of my impressions of Dogville with the world. :) I got this movie by a pure coincidence:local DVD-rental was going out of business and they were selling dvds for nothing - I got Dogville for a shameful 4 US$. I expected to spend some time with yet another piece of simple(very polite way to say it) Hollywood entertainment. Instead I got a 3hr of drama, emotional and philanthropic(?)sickness, sociological dissection and a thrilling be-there experience. My afternoon was getting better and better...With this complex movie, Lars showed us a broad spectrum of saturated human emotions (rangeing from children-naive safety to sadistic pleasure). Buy this movie, take 3 hours just for yourself, turn off the phone, adjust the temperature in the room, get some fine wine, shade the lights, relax and enjoy the insight in human mind.Art really enlightens...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I finally finished the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many months ago I told this forum that I had walked out of the theater 20 minutes into Dogville. I failed to be entertained by a filmed stage play that seemed to subject us to the same smug, dull, vague preaching given the townspeople by young Tom Edison. As I promised, I rented the DVD, given the opportunity to while away hours while my wife is studying in Thailand. I am happy to reassure angry Euros that this originally disappointed American enjoyed the way the film picked up once Grace began to interact with the townspeople. Although I anticipated displeasure at the advertised mistreatment of Nicole Kidman's character, the lingering photography of her in better moments made up for rage at Tom's impotent courtship and at the other townsmen's abuse. The moment that sticks with me is the climatic conversation in the car between Kidman and Caan regarding judgment and standards. Do I hold others to the standards of behavior to which I hold myself? If not, why not? What does it say about me if I don't? And what does it say that Von Trier's denouement is so satisfying to most of us?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So sorry if you didn't get it!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I found the movie to be brilliant and engrossing -- mostly an examination and indictment of human nature, but with a definite critique of America's particular weaknesses. We were so glad to have seen it with no preconceived notions. If you've not seen it yet, I'd recommend avoiding the rest of this review -- some spoilers.I feel sorry for most of the negative reviewers here, who have expressed disappointment that the characters weren't realistic, that the plot needed help, etc. Do these folks get upset about "unrealistic" mythology or complain that Jesus couldn't really have turned water into wine?The characters could have been written to be more well-rounded and realistic. Some could have been admirable and others evil, allowing us to identify with the good guys and feel superior to the bad ones. That's the American way. But Von Trier decided to show each character's weak side; each character's propensity to rationalize bad behaviors; each character's willingness to degrade and destroy Grace out of fear that they could never live up to her beauty, empathy, and high ideals. And he decided to show these things in slow, measured detail, giving his audience ample time to marinate in our discomfort.This film raises myriad philosophical questions relevant to modern-day Americans, and others. How much human suffering do we rationalize away for selfish reasons? Is vulnerability inevitably exploited once it becomes exposed? Does capitalism in particular promote such exploitation? What is the essential difference between democracy and mob rule? At what point do our intensely self-interested attitudes and behaviors start to measurably degrade the quality of our society and its claims to moral superiority in the world community? Is cognitive dissonance emerging between our own idealistic vision of America and the world's perception that we've become a different sort of place?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece that is not for all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Me: Avid movie goer. See 2-3 films in theaters a week.This is a different sort of film which asks a lot of its audience. Several of the people in the theater where I viewed the film walked out after the first 1/2 hour or so.The previews that I was exposed to for the film did a very poor job indeed of preparing me for what I was to see. For you see the the things that one expects to see in a typical film remain unseen in this one. Usually the scenery and location of the film are used to help tell the story and to add context and meaning to the background of the story.Not here.Here there are just the very bare essentials of props and scenery used, less even than most live stage performances. It is a bit shocking and mind-blowing to realize all at once that the entertainment is going to be constructed entirely of dialog and acting. I'm sure it is something like what the first art-patrons went through when subjected to the first bits of minimalist art. At first there is shock of what isn't there. Then there is even grater shock at how it brings more clearly into focus that which is (if one can get over the initial shock that is).As we are drawn into the story however little by little we no longer care about the way in which the film is constructed as the story itself is compelling and interesting enough by far on its own merits. I will not go into the story other than to say it is something of a tale of the human condition from all points of view and a lesson in what morality really is. It has the ring of truth and is therefore compelling.In short I would recommend this film very highly but with a warning that one must go into the film with an open mind. If you do so I believe you will be richly rewarded.Cast: OK. No stunning performances but each cast member does their job well.Cinematography: Excellent.Story/Plot: Interesting, entertaining, and well thought out.Editing/Direction: Very very well done. Always at a good pace which doesn't sprint or drag which is a good thing indeed for a 3 hour film!Overall Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the beauty of being free-thinking creatures in the universe is that we are allowed to interpret anything we saw in our own way. Film is a very private journey for me, it reflects and reveals your inner self like no other medium. We walked out of the theater with our own impression of what the movie is all about. We live in the world we created which is composed of nothing more than our perception of reality. What kind of world you rather live in? One with hatred, doubt, anger or one with acceptance and love? (This is not a rhetorical question when you come to think about it.)I love Dogville. This film is daring and challenging to watch. Not because its length, but its rawness that breaks the traditional perception of movies and therefore cross the safety line that protected us audience from reality complication. Maybe that is why Lars made film in this format, after stripping off all the distraction and glamour of movies, what is left is just bare human emotion and a question - how you are going to deal with this?In this film, there are many close-up with no dialog, you are forced to watched the emotional transition without the assistance of words, again I think is another reason this movie is powerful, while Lars explored his actors emotion, he did it to us as well.The acting is unbelievable, what a difficult piece to perform. The set is so simple, camera is right in front of you, there is simply no place to hide. Nicole Kidman has grown into an outstanding actor. This is one of her most challenging roles, both technically and emotionally, and she handled it with grace and honesty. Lars had an interesting idea and a very creative way of presenting it, but it??s the acting in this film that delivered the explosion to our hearts.The ending, hmmm?­ the ending is very interesting. (if you haven't seen the movie, stop reading here) Lars being Lars, had to throw this curve ball at the end, just when you think you got it. When Grace watching ,in tears, the massacre she ordered, you wonder if she is killing her dreams or she is ever determined to up-hold the dreams ?­ I guess Lars is not done telling his story yet?­</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame that this movie is so slow moving. The cast is wonderful, and I love Nicole Kidman, but even she could not save this film. Most of the acting is very good, except for Cloe Sevingy who seems too modern for this part. Unfortunately, good acting cannot save a boring story. The story is told in chapters and when we read that the last chapter was beginning, the audience cheered that this torture would finally end. I watched this film in a full theater and about 50 people walked out. My friends asked me to walk out with them as well and I was very tempted to do so, but I stayed, just hoping it would get better. Don't make the same mistake; You would just lose 3 hours of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you'd like a theory of what it's all about before seeing the movie, read on. However, I'd strongly recommend that you NOT read this until you've seen the film.But know this: Although there might be a hint of anti-Americanism in there, it's by no means the central theme of the film. And those who have written it off as a simple-minded stab at small-town Americans are way, way off mark.** WARNING: SPOILERS **I'm very surprised that no "professional" review that I've read mentions this (and I've read quite a few), and only one or two IMDB-users below. But to me, it's obvious.Main character, Grace: First, the name is no coincidence. Second, consider this: after being regarded by each individual as a liberating force, even providing sight for the blind, she is then brutally betrayed and abused by them all, and still she's endlessly forgiving. She tells her father, although not in these exact words: "Forgive them, father, for they know not what they do." Can there be any doubt as to who this is supposed to be?Second character, Tom Edison: Again, the name is hardly a coincidence. "Man of Reason." The one whose relationship with Grace is of the deepest significance.The village dog is Moses, and is at one point saved miraculously. Still any doubts?Grace's father is all powerful, but no human can see him even when he's close (he has reservations about revealing Himself to them). Everyone's fate is in his hands. Grace is uneasy about having a part of His power. Contemplating an important decision, He advocates an eye for an eye, Old Testament style, while she is inclined to forgive, New Testament style.I think it's pretty obvious. Dogville = Godville.And let me add that I'm not a particularly religious person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece that should and will go down in history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leading a strong year of films about to be released, Dogville was one feature I saw at the New York Film Festival in October of 2003, it was the most incredible film I have ever seen, it is a masterpiece in every aspect of film, and an accomplishment that no one except Von Trier and his brilliance could achieve, this man not only knows how to change every rule in film, and succeed at creating his own medium, but he is able to touch the soul of everyone human who lets this film sink into them. Not only has he shown his strength as a director but also he has brought out the best in every cast member, and goes far beyond making his actors become the characters. Nicole Kidman reaches a level performance that is unparalleled by any other performance ever put on screen. She will be remembered for the rest of her life and after she dies, for this performance which defines her not only as an actor, but as a human. Her performance in this film is the best ever put on screen by any actor, and it is with the help of Mr. Von Trier that she is able to create this story. The rest of the cast is superb, and these are career performances for the likes of Paul Bentenny, and Patricia Clarkson, who makes your bones chill several times during this film. The soundstage, which creates the intimacy between the characters and the audience, could not work any other way, and Mr. Von Trier has succeeded beyond the expectations of any film ever made. This is truly The Masterpiece! *I cannot even rate this film for it is on a level without numbers</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars von Trier is rapidly becoming one of my favourite directors. Dogville is one of the few films around that grabs hold of you within the first few minutes and doesn't let go until the end.Nicole Kidman gives an astonishing performance just like Bjork and Emily Watson did in 'Dancer in the Dark' and 'Breaking the Waves'.Personally I feel that Von Trier is making fun of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and Matrix, which both cost 100's of millions of dollars to make. Instead of focusing purely on the aesthetics of the film he concentrates on the characters and their emotions. I agree that for some people who don't like to have to think during films (and I'm not saying that as a negative thing) will find Dogville a terribly boring film, but for any film buff, you will find that Dogville is a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of social behavior and human psychology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning : SPOILERS AHEAD !!I found 'Dogville' very interesting. It is one of the few long gloomy movies I have liked so much. The most interesting part is the turn of events. How a small town in equilibrium gradually reaches catastrophe is shown marvellously, with everything happening very much according to human needs and psychology. An immigrant into a small town slowly finds her way into the people's hearts. But, in such a situation, everyone could not be satisfied for long. Things begin to worsen, which has been shown really well, starting from a child to an adult to an old man. Conditions are put forward for the safety of the immigrant, which brings us to the another very interesting part of the movie. How an immigrant who shall emotionally feel more secure at a new place as time passes is demanded of more, has been shown in a way, which looks very natural and thus appealing. One of the best scenes of the movie is towards the end, when Tom is shot by Grace herself. Tom was subtly responsible for all the miseries Grace had to face at Dogville, though he was the one to save her. One can argue on this matter, whether he was a criminal or not. I would term Tom as a criminal for being so nonchalant to the exploitation of Grace by the people. This is a powerful movie which shall definitely leave an impact on the world, before it is, if ever forgotten. I give it a full score for the direction, acting and the story which are all equally wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps if the DVD box had warned me that I would be viewing a "teleplay" instead of an actual movie, I might have approached it differently. As it was, the bad cuts (for example, Kidman is lying down one second and suddenly sitting up the next) were very disruptive to me getting anything out of the movie, as was the lack of scenery and props. But most of all the movie was much too dark for my tastes. While the adult citizens of Dogville may have deserved their final fate, the children did not (with the possible exception of the one bratty boy who wanted a spanking). That part of the ending at least was not something one would have expected Nicole Kidman's character to do, even given what the adults had done to her.All of that said, I will admit that Nicole Kidman acting shone as brightly as ever, as did Lauren Bacall's and a few of the others. But I couldn't help wondering what in the world would have made them be a part of such a movie. Maybe Bacall's opportunities to act are fading with her advancing age. But Kidman owes it to herself and her public to hold out for roles and movies of a much higher standard than Dogville.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never mind the controversy surrounding VonTrier's apparent disdain for the United States. I will even discard his unobscured hatred of women. Why hasn't anyone said anything about how the ending of this film says absolutely nothing at all? So Grace is this apparent stoic and bars herself from any sort of reaction to outside forces. She takes this to a totally ridiculous extreme, and in the end condemns mankind for it. Here it is. People do bad stuff to Grace and Grace takes it. Grace gets discouraged when no one has any compassion for her, and when she has the chance, kills all of them. What sort of resolution is this? I don't think it is necessary to have a message, but if obscured it should be done in an interesting, provocative, etc. way. And this movie didn't. May I also say that the "five obstructions" or whatever it is called seemed equally ridiculous. The two men are completely self obsessed and obnoxiously passionate - not thoughtful, about their work. Why is it okay for that white-haired dude to go on and on about the red light district in Bombay being hell? Whiner!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another lesson from Hans Christian Andersen -- the Emperor has no clothes on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Dogville' is certainly an interesting experimental movie, shot entirely on a large soundstage with minimal props. However, when one mentally reviews what transpires in the 3-hour story, it is one of simple revenge, with no clear moral and no sympathetic characters. It is more likely von Trier's comment on his Danish upbringing than anything else. Perhaps his way of showing us what he secretly wished to do to all the students and staff at his grade school, where he apparently experienced intimidation and mistreatment at the hands of the more forceful students.On the positive side, the very thing that first bothered me -- its being filmed entirely on a large stage with props and painted lines for streets and walls, and even the dog! -- was not a bother at all after a while. On the negative side, as one professional critic wrote, the movie is "a compelling bore." The acting is good, especially Kidman and Bettany in the leads, and the set is very effective after one overcomes the initial feeling of being "cheated." The movie at 3 hours is far overdrawn to tell its story, and its story is not particularly interesting or shocking. It is not a very meaningful movie, except perhaps to von Trier.The rest of my comments CONTAIN MAJOR SPOILERS so anyone who has not yet seen 'Dogville' really should NOT read the rest of this.The story is given over two and a half hours to build up. An otherwise closed townspeople in the very remote mountain town of Dogville take in this stranger (Grace) who seems to be fleeing danger, but the townspeople become increasingly cruel to her, to the point where she ends up in chains to make sure she doesn't run away. Even the man who professes to love her, turns on her. Then in the last 20 minutes, we learn she really was the daughter of the gangster hunting her, they take revenge, kill all the townspeople, burn the buildings, and she makes the final shot through Tom Edison's head. Just a simple and ugly revenge movie. Some may argue that it is allegory in clever disguise. If so, it is a very poor one. For me it is just another lesson from Hans Christian Andersen (review 'The Emperor's New Suit'). When I look closely, the emperor (von Trier) has no clothes on. "Dogville" is stylish and compelling to watch, but simply not a particularly good movie. I am glad I saw it all the way through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>oh my!! i had no idea what this one was about - just knew that Nicole was in it and was listed as an 'independent'. This goes to show that not all independents are good and just because it's indie does NOT mean it's 'deep and meaningful'. uggh! this was just stupid! how much did they spend on the set? $100 bucks maybe? some chalk, a couple of thrift store props and I don't see the drab, depressing wardrobe winning any costume awards. I normally love Nicole and think she picks good roles - but she was (i agree with another reviewer) robotic. None of the other actors stood out either - they were all pretty robotic and without individuality.I tried to like this film at first, I really did. Once the senseless rape and torture started - i was just p****d. I wish I would've left the theater, but I just couldn't imagine a film getting any worse. it did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extraordinary but half baked movie experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't work out what director Lars von Trier was trying to achieve. My own impressions at his entirely studio-staged movie (with no set save those that were necessary props) is that he wanted to (i) concentrate on the characters and (ii) produce a symbol for transparency and blindness: moral blindness, voluntary blindness ? the blindness that comes with dealing with perception rather than actuality.This film firmly labels itself as a morality (play), which is a little stifling. To this end I think that the transparent-set symbolism has legs ? but not in this film. Alas, von Trier undermines his own ideas. I watched the first rape scene, incredulous that he should have so many perspective cuts (presumably to give the impression of time having passed). He is such an uncompromising director ? I've only managed half of his coruscating moral examination Breaking the Waves ? yet here he doesn't seem to want to make full use of the intentional incongruity of a private violation occurring with the entire cast being able to physically see the crime. Maybe it's a practical compromise to do with having children on the set during the sequence.Ultimately, I felt like I'd watched a stage play filmed. Paul Bettany's acting was certainly stagy, putting him at odds with the rest of the cast; but I couldn't work out whose method was the most effective. Above all else, I am still trying to assess what it's all about ? I assume it some sort of extemporisation on the disingenuity of the multicultural/liberal society; the difference between real acceptance and its cosmetic face. Anti-American? Not really, although the US is the most obvious model (and of course the setting and dialogue of the film are American). Such a modern moral conundrum needs its dissectors, but it ain't achieved in this film. 3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Turgid film from a biased director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>American filmmakers have filmed stories dealing with the exploits of Nazis in Germany and of the French in terms of colonialism and other unflattering events in history and while everyone has their own agenda I feel that the director in this case suffers from both paranoia and from living a completely sheltered life. The film is set on a soundstage with very little props and chalk lines on the floor to show where buildings are with sound effects added when characters pretend to knock on doors. The story is about a woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who during the depression stumbles into a Rocky Mountain town called Dogville after fleeing some gangsters and immediately meets Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) who helps her with the other residents.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The people of Dogville agree to let her stay for two weeks which turns out well for Grace but things get worse when the male residents start forcing themselves on her. After a failed escape plan Grace is chained with a metal collar and raped repeatedly on a nightly basis until one day the gangsters that she was fleeing show up headed by The Big Man (James Caan) who turns out to be Grace's father!This is the supposed first film in a trilogy by Lars von Trier about capitalist America and one has to wonder if the next two efforts will be as slanted. I personally don't care if a foreign film director is anti-American as long as their open with their ideologies but von Trier publicly beats around the bush and it's obvious he has more resentment towards America than he's letting on. With that, I did find several things to admire and Kidman's performance is not only pretty good but at times it can be described as brave especially with her character's treatment in the rape sequences. The only part of the film that I really questioned was with the character Tom Edison and I'm not sure if audiences understand that this character was as much a scumbag as the others. I know he's portrayed as trying to be helpful and sympathetic but the truth is that he had no intention on helping Grace get out of Dogville and really wanted her to remain there. This film is interesting in terms of it's artistic integrity and I've always favored films with a Brecht-like approach (hear that Hollywood?) but one can't help but sense von Trier's hostility and anger not only with his views of America but with his actors who have all mentioned his bad attitude towards them. I'm not going to say that this is a bad film because it's not but it is one that has a definite slant in it's story and while I greatly admire von Trier's talent as a director his personal conflicts have interfered with this effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>audacious failure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier's "Dogville" is "Our Town" for the clinically depressed, exploring the dark underbelly of rural Americana in ways that Thornton Wilder never even imagined. Like Wilder, Von Trier utilizes a fictional small town to reveal profound truths about human nature, although Von Trier's revelations are far more sinister and despairing than any Wilder came up with.Dogville is a sleepy little hamlet nestled high up in the Colorado Rockies. The simple folk there lead lives of humdrum monotony, undisturbed by the troubles and vicissitudes of the outside world. One day, a mysterious and beautiful young woman - allegorically named Grace - is found wandering in the town. When it is discovered that she is fleeing some mobsters, the townspeople reluctantly agree to hide her and let her become a member of their community. At first all goes well, with Grace winning over the hearts of the citizens and even bringing a measure of previously unknown joy into their lives. However, slowly the mood turns sinister, as the denizens begin to exploit, then sexually and psychologically abuse the delicate young woman. Von Trier makes the case that even the most seemingly benign, mild-mannered individual will, if given half a chance, lord it over someone who is weaker and more vulnerable than he is. The final hour of the film has much of the feel of Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery," as Grace becomes the expiatory sacrifice for the sinful folk who live in the town - until, that is, the tables are turned on them.Because the story is essentially a morality play and a parable, Von Trier has chosen to make the film on a stark sound stage, with chalk lines substituting for walls and only the barest minimum of décor suggesting an actual town. Only the sound effects - such as the opening and closing of invisible doors - is entirely realistic. (A TV movie version of "Our Town" in the 1970's utilized this same technique).Although, as a conceit, "Dogville" is intriguing enough in its early stages, after about the first hour or so - and it runs for almost three! - the movie begins to severely outstay its welcome. Once the novelty of the stage-bound approach wears off, we are left with a pretty silly story in which the characters act in ways that are not merely inscrutable but downright maddening. We begin to wonder what the point of it all is after awhile. If Von Trier is trying to say that small town Americana is really not all Norman Rockwell sweetness-and-light, that theme has been explored countless times before, and in works far less contrived and pretentious than this one. The tone of self-importance that permeates the film is reflected in the dividing up of the tale into nine "chapters" - replete with fancy title cards - and the use of a droning, hoity-toity narrator (more shades of "Our Town") whose main function seems to be to point out the obvious.As Grace, Nicole Kidman does an effective job portraying an essentially passive victim, although we spend most of our time wanting to see her deck all those sadistic idiots with whom she comes into daily contact. The other actors are fine as well, though such stalwarts as Phillip Baker Hall and the ageless Lauren Bacall are left hanging around in the background with not a whole lot to do."Dogville" is, I suppose, an audacious attempt at something different, and for that at least it should get some credit. But I doubt that most people will have the patience to see it through to the end.</fullReview>

The presence of an inventive and original setting involving a delusive town with imaginary doors, walls and chalked gooseberry bushes doesn't make up for the disconsolate nature of the pathetically narrow-minded antagonists.

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films of all time, or just of 2003? (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is "known" to be an anti-American. I am not judging the film by the personal likes and dislikes of the director but simply by what I saw, interpreted, and thought of, after seeing the film.Dogville is filmed with, what appears to be, a MiniDV camcorder (the worst in the market) and instantly flashes the idea that Lars Von Trier did not want to take the film seriously; professionally.Dogville stars Nicole Kidman, in a rather gutsy performance, and places her as a woman named Grace who is chased by gangsters into a small mining village. The village is called Dogville; no doubt named by a Native American. Dogville is quiet and contains average and everyday people who own separate businesses and have never in their lives seen action before. They all eventually decide to take Grace under their warm wing and to get her to become one of them, so that they could like her and want her to stay (indefinitely) beyond her 2-week probation period. Things eventually turn sour, due to a few male residents of Dogville and Grace is accused of everything: beating children (that asked and blackmailed her into beating them), and having infidelities with some of the husbands in Dogville. The village-folk fasten a chain around Grace's neck, rape her every day, break the porcelain figurines she worked months to be able to afford and purchase, and contemplate even worse prospects for her.I will leave the last half hour (of the three hour "saga") to your imaginations and curiosities.How can such lovely and quiet people actually think of such things? And if Grace is a gangster's woman/daughter, why does she not (simply) open her mouth and let everybody know of the truth?Human emotions are, apparently, present in this monstrosity of a film and not a single "actual" human thought is being presented.This movie is a mockery of film-making and an insult to others who attempt to reach originality, and to portray the truth behind human nature.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's like a dull knife that just ain't cuttin'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set implicitly around the 1930s in a small town, Dogville, which is represented by a single minimalist stage "arrangement", the film begins with a prologue introducing us to Dogville's residents. Shortly after, Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) hears gunfire in the distance and Grace Margaret Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) comes running into town. Tom gives her shelter and hides her from gangsters who drive into town only minutes later. The town is suspicious of strangers, so Tom suggests that Margaret should help everyone out for a couple weeks before they vote on whether she can stay or not. She's successful in her bid. The film concerns her evolving relationships with the town's residents, most of which begin as positive blossomings and eventually turn sour. All the while, it is made periodically clear that the persons searching for Margaret are not giving up--they instead seem to be increasing their intensity. How will everything be resolved? I know this review is likely to further my reputation as something of an incorrigible contrarian, but what can I do? I have to call 'em as I see 'em; I'm not going to praise the films I'm "supposed" to praise and damn the ones I'm supposed to damn just to fit in with the right crowd or have the right people think that my opinions are respectable. My sole concern is to try to give every film as fair a shake as I can, and then report my honest views on its merits or lack of the same, whether everyone else likes the film or no one does. And as I saw it, Dogville is a failure.It begins with at least one promising idea--the minimalist "set" is an interesting approach and is visually arresting to an extent. It's primarily a large, empty stage, with homes and public buildings represented by outlines of their shapes on the floor. There are words on the floor to identify many objects or structures, from streets to home ownership to the town's dog, Moses, and scattered props and pieces of sets here and there to represent things like the door of the general store, characters' beds and chairs, the church bell tower, and so on. However, Dogville also begins with narration that sounds immediately pretentious, atrocious performances, and a script that could hardly be more banal. Director/writer Lars von Trier writes the narration and dialogue in a style superficially reminiscent of 19th Century American literature; it's not entirely dissimilar to, say, Mark Twain (a fact he references by the character Tom Edison Sr. (Philip Baker Hall) reading Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer), except that it has none of Twain's wit or wisdom. In fact, until its last couple scenes, when it becomes a bit sarcastic, Dogville is almost completely humorless, and that's just one of the many things that make the film not "ring true".Most of the performances are remarkably bad. Except for a couple cast members, everyone sounds like they are doing a first read-through of the material, with an emphasis on reading. The primary exception is Kidman, who does an admirable job with this less than stellar material, and a number of smaller parts, played by Baker, Patricia Clarkson (as Vera) and a couple others. Bettany was particularly annoying, although James Caan was good once he finally appeared, despite having to engage in atrocious, overlong dialogue.I also found myself frequently annoyed by the cinematography, which was primarily (if not completely) executed with hand-held cameras. This fact was emphasized by shakiness, awkward pans and far too many fast zooms. It's not that I dislike any hand-held work--far from it. But there didn't seem to be a particular reason for the style of hand-held cinematography that's in the film, and the repetition of affected camera movement became grating.But what about the plot and the subtexts? Well, first let me say something positive. Once things began to turn sour between Grace and the residents of Dogville, I started enjoying the film more, and I actually loved the ending. I was very tempted to give the film an extra point for the outstanding climax, at least until I reminded myself of what a chore it was to get there! The film lasts nearly 3 hours. Two of those hours are incredibly dull. Even once the improvement set in, it took an hour to get to the climax. Maybe if von Trier would have compressed Dogville into a running time of, say, an hour at the most, I could have given it a 6. But just maybe.The first two hours are about uninteresting people doing uninteresting things. We learn about them, but we don't care about them. It's as engaging as two hours of hearing about Joe Average's typical day on the job as an accountant, or at a bottlecap factory, only we have to hear about it with that poor, humorless approximation of the 19th Century literary style, largely from a narrator, and with nearly everyone reciting lines as if they're 11 year olds trying to read Heidegger out loud.As is made all too obvious by the ending credits, von Trier intends the film as somewhat of a scathing "satire" of America, seen through the eyes of small town life. Only, that goal doesn't come across unless you force it (and even then it doesn't work very well), because one could hardly call anything about the story realistic, even taking it as a parable and just considering whether it shows anything realistic about "human nature" and relationships. It doesn't. On the whole, people don't behave that way, talk that way, and so on. Not that I'm looking for realism; I'm much more a fan of fantasy, surrealism, absurdism, etc. But I'm not exactly looking for fantasy about a blowhard droning on and on about doing chores or someone pining away to buy Hummels from a general store, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Rotten......???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It just gets more complicated the more I think about it. And, I have thought about it almost constantly!! I agree the film is mostly about power and corruption and corruptibility. BUT, I do not agree with the idea that had we been in any of these characters' places we would have behaved in the same way. Not one of them had a redeeming feature... conscience..compassion?shame! And that includes Grace, who, despite her meek almost saintly exterior, turns out to be the most corruptible of them all.The townspeople of Dogville misuse power as only those who are already corrupt can. They were already in need of moral correction in one way or another, as the narrator tells us in the prologue. Almost every one of them is hiding some moral flaw, or practising some deception, whether it be on their neighbours or on the outside world. In fact, as Chuck says, the town is "rotten from the inside out" when Grace sees it as a pretty place.Later, she finds he has been right and that this idyllic exterior hides a totally evil reality. Not one inhabitant shows pity for her in her predicament, but instead, each of them in one way or another uses her situation to demonstrate their increasing power over her, until ultimately she is reduced to a thing, to be used indiscriminately, according to the individual's whim. All the basest features of humanity emerge: greed and lust in the nightly rapes by the male population, and bullying and petty vengeance from the females. And there is no exception. Not one person displays even a hint of shame or remorse at their behaviour.I am offended at the idea that given the opportunity all males would behave as they did in Dogville. I am offended at the portrayal of women as being victims of society, and shallow, petty and vengeful towards one of their sisters. Most of all, I am offended that Lars Von Trier expects us to accept his bleak and warped view of human nature, which to him is completely and irredeemably immoral. If there is any mistaking this, the end of the film will ensure we are in no doubt of his message. Even the long-suffering and angelic Grace, when given the promise of power, swiftly forgets any thought of forgiveness and exacts the most terrible and vicious vengeance for all acts against her.Thus, Von Trier is saying to us that under a thin veneer of civilisation, mankind is essentially corrupt, and power in our hands will reveal this. Yes! In some peoples' hands! If Dogville is to be seen as a microcosm of humanity, then every one of us, without exception, is susceptible to the corruption that power over our fellow man brings. According to LVT there is not a good apple in the crate! (I believe apples and crates were symbolic of this among other concepts)Sorry, Mr Von Trier, here's one apple that believes there are certainly many bruised apples and several rotten ones in our crate, but who won't take your desperately pessimistic view of wholesale rottenness seriously. What was that quote from Hamlet??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only a handful of movies are capable of evoking any sort of response without the use of elaborate sets and special effects. Dogville, although it almost lost my (MTV/ADD) interest in the very beginning due to the lack of anything, focuses less on aesthetic externalities and keys in on using the true batter that any good movie is made from and that is equal parts great story, superb acting, and an ending that summons the audience to take a moment and absorb. I certainly absorbed as much as I could the first time through and like other classics will be able to pick up nuances each time here after. I can go on, but why?

		<fullReview>My one word review:Dogs**tTo elaborate:You know that "state of suspended belief" that Grace was in when things started going South in Dogville? That's how I feel after having watched it. No, it's worse than that. I feel like she must have after the trucker raped her in the back of the Model A. What a pretentious, empty, monotonous, poorly lit, ugly, overlong waste of time. I have never hated a movie so much, so much so that I had to join this forum just to vent. I want to find the guy who directed it and kick his ass. It can't be that bad, can it? OK, let's review:1) The "stage". Cute device, for about 5 minutes. Does it advance the story? No. Does it make the movie's 2+ hours any less painful? No. It is distracting. It is repetitive. It is depressing. 2) No character has a single redeeming quality. Every character is so flat, so obviously allegorical, that I could never ascribe human emotion or motivation to any of them. It wasn't the actors' fault, they just had nothing to work with. They look as bored and as uninspired as a dentist's waiting room. 3) Better motifs in a Jerry Bruckheimer film. Only the cars were real. Oooh, what a scathing comment on American society. The thorns and the flowers on the imaginary bush. The shifting light on the characters and the town. All of the dog allegories; Grace's collar, the name of the town, the discussion of human behavior at the end of the movie, the dog surviving at the end. The figurines. And playing "Young Americans" at the end with the pictures of the underside of American society? Sorry man, I wasn't paying attention for the last 2 hours because you bored me to sleep. What were you trying to say again? 4) Tom is a bad writer and an insufferable moralist that bores his audience at the meetings? Unfortunately, that was the only metaphor that worked in the entire movie. If you are going to depress the hell out of the kids in the movie house, it doesn't hurt to have something original, interesting, or even coherent to say. Here are a few good movies about the dark side of human nature that aren't exactly brass bands either:Das Boot, Dog Day Afternoon, Carnal Knowledge, Blood Simple, Cool Hand Luke (better use of Christ imagery by the way) Miller's Crossing, Blue Velvet, The Last Picture Show, Crimes and Misdemeanors,It's not that depressing movies are bad.

		<fullReview>This movie seems to be fairly well reviewed on this site, which is surprising since it is absolutely dreadful. Lars Von Trier, an interesting director without question with some very good films under his belt, decided to make a movie like a play, or something like that. So all the characters act out this movie pretending to open doors and walking around chalk outlines intended to be furniture or whatever. I have no idea what the point of this gimmick is. If you want to do a play, then go ahead and do a play. I have no clue what Von Trier was thinking with this abysmally boring movie. It is three hours of lifeless, self-indulgent nonsense.I've heard the movie is somehow supposed to be anti-American; I didn't get that. Perhaps I didn't notice that theme because I was too busy wondering aloud how a movie with such a good director and great cast could suck so remarkably. I'm American and I more or less detest the present course the United States is on as much as the next reasonable person, but if this movie is trying to say something about America or society or the state of nature or anything else remotely deep or interesting, then I'm afraid whatever theme it's going for is completely undercut by the fact that the movie is interminably boring.This is nothing more than a three-hour gimmick. I implore you not to waste your time. If you sit through this entire movie, you will end up weeping for three hours of your life irretrievably lost for nothing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fall from Grace: Lars Von Trier and the method of poetry through cheap imagery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard before-hand that I was supposed to either love this film or hate it. I also heard that this was one of the best stories ever put on screen. That this movie is a take on human nature and its immanent cruelty, of its inherited perversion. Boy was I taken for a fool... This was one of the few movies I watched without before having a look at the users reviews on this website, and I'm actually glad I didn't because it would probably have made me even more disappointed by the end of it. Now, I'm not disappointed for the fact that this movie is not good (as my grade shows) but I'm disappointed, and frankly a little upset, at both extremes this movie seems to divide: I'm utterly ashamed for the people who despise it, as well as embarrassed for the ones who find it a MASTERPIECE. This movie possesses great assets. As a matter of fact, I shall say that this movie barely has any flaws, but I think it hardly that either its die-hard fans or virtually blind detractors have any true grasp of what this movie means to achieve. Either viewers hold it in a not so deserving lofty regard or they plain give it no regard at all. And that is, perhaps (to no fault of Von Trier as far as I'm concerned), the ultimate responsible for the movie's fall from Grace (no pun intended).CHAPTER 1: In which the author finds something strikingly odd and is later pleased by itThe first thing to take note whether you like(d) it or not is the scenery. Dogville's scenery consists of what it doesn't consist, which is actually a lot. The movie is entirely set in a studio with black walls and dark floor. The streets and houses delimited by chalk- drawn lines on the pavement. They have no walls, no doors and no other props except for the household items inside them. What this setting proportionates is the sense that you're watching the tape of a recorded play. A sense further increased by the hand- held camera filming, fading lights at the end of scenes and chapter division with the use of epigraphs describing the scene about to take place. Now, as with any sort of recycling of one media into another, this feels weird and misplaced at first but, once delved into it, the feeling takes a turn into fascination. Von Trier helps on that with an admirable good taste in his cinematography, especially the lighting, as he does a great job of using it in benefit of the script and dramatization.CHAPTER 2: In which there was a tap on my imaginary doorThe sound in the movie is limited to sound-effects: doors being knocked, doors being opened, dogs barking, etc. Since there's not much use of it, there's not much use in talking about it.CHAPTER 3: In which merits are given where merits are dueNow let's talk a little about acting. More precisely, I would like to talk about the difference between an uninspired performance and a solid one. Among many misconceptions this movie seems to create, acting is surely one of them. People always seem to get easily driven to either laud or depreciate the actor who receives the most screen time in a movie. That is a mistake in itself, but it is also usually coupled with a bias in direct proportion to the film's quality. You rarely see someone praising an actor for his work in a bad movie. That rareness intensifies itself when said actor is the movie's protagonist (poor Hayden Christensen). That being said, you have probably read on reviews of people who found Dogville to be a masterpiece that Nicole Kidman gave the performance of her career in this movie. It probably didn't stop there and was followed by the case that she displays the best acting overall. That, my friends, is just criminal. While Kidman does give a good performance, she is far from being the best person on screen. Her performance is at best solid, and in that regard alone, her supporting actors did a far greater job. James Caan (whose position as a character I saw coming from a mile away) received very little screen time but presented a vaster variety of nuances in its character in minutes than Kidman did in hours. Considering Grace's experiences and transformation, Kidman could and should have externalized both in a more proper manner. Instead, Grace is left speaking with the same soft whispering voice whether she is the naive woman of the beginning of the story or the one she becomes by the end of it. Her character is numb most ways. Some might interpret this as a trait of the character itself, but to me, it shows as a trait of an uninspired performance. If you watch the scene where Grace is first introduced in the story and then skipped the whole movie all the way to her last appearance, you wouldn't wonder what happened for her to act in such a way, you would simply think that she was like this all along. On the other hand, Paul Bettany, Zeljko Ivanek and Stellan Skarsg?rd not only give solid performances, but like Caan, deliver on the nuances aspect as well. Bettany essentially carries the movie forward whilst in the shadow of Kidman while Zeljko Ivanek and Stellan Skarsg?rd give portrayals that show a terrifyingly deep character study.

		<fullReview>The setting of the film is such that it almost looks like a stage play. Starting out, I even felt that what I had was a certain version of the original film and had to check on the internet to see whether that was the case. Initially I couldn't see the point in choosing to make a movie like that. But I was sure Von Trier had a point. And he did have one!The bare minimal setting allows us to focus on the more important things. IMO the setting signifies how the townspeople always considered themselves right but at the same time were always exposed in their heinous acts. The character development is excellent specially for "Dogville" is full of shallow and narrow minded people.I saw the end coming though I am not sure I just wanted it or expected it. As Grace suffers through the film so do we. Throughout the film Grace tries to uphold her beliefs and seeks validation from the people of Dogsville. In the end, she lashes out with vengeance realizing how wrong the townspeople were. Kidman's work is commendable. The movie's a bit long but quite gripping. Overall, I would give it 9/10 :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>out of the norm in just about every way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this film is out of the norm in just about every way. the narrative work in Lars Von Trier's Dogville is unique and special; told in the form of a prologue and 9 chapters, each inter-title gives away the general idea, in turn showing creativity, versatility and great confidence in raw storytelling ability. provided the setting, which could be a little off- putting at first, this might work brilliantly as a play, but it has everything in it to make a great film of itself.the film is notable for the way it is told and portrayed. the plan to use a theatrical scenery and capture the whole story in one place, makes the film provoke in the viewer a very basic curious sense, and challenges his imaginative capacity and intrinsic perception. the excellent cast faces an unusual task to act naturally around invisible walls and manage to create an engaging environment. thematically, the minimal staging, only reinforces the discomfort and becomes a basis to communicate the film's thesis.Lars Von Trier is a director who's no stranger to controversy with his films and not all people like what he has to say. here, the story is slow paced and lengthy, but it's so compelling that it doesn't matter, because the viewer stays focused, though never trapped.. besides the narrative creativity, Von Trier seeks to meddle in human behavior and cruelty, ultimately bringing the worst out of him. it's a frightening and uncompromising demonstration of the human condition; charity is linked with greed, benevolence with suspicion.. the film argues that there's definitely a limit to selfless generosity.the script is extremely well developed and treats the characters carefully, especially the main character Grace. besides making me fall in love with her, Nicole Kidman is brilliant in her role as an introverted and submissive woman suffering numerous setbacks. pretty much all the rest of the cast is spot on.Dogville is very literal, which makes it seems as if one was reading a book, in terms of conscious involvement. layered and excellent script, with a disturbing ending that is thoughtful and consistent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville is a truly unique presentation that can hardly be called a film but rather a representation of the human condition. The film starts with Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, stumbling into a small mountain town in Colorado in efforts to escape her gangster family. Tom Edison, played by Paul Bettany, finds her and offers her shelter and safety in the town of Dogville. After convincing the rest of the townsfolk to let her stay, the citizens begins making Grace perform tasks around the town in exchange for harboring her. But after a series of extremely odd events, personal sexual attacks, and a general mistrust among the people, Grace decides to try and run away with the help of Tom. Unfortunately her plan is foiled by the freighter, Ben, and she is sent back to Dogville to be chained in order to prevent another escape. Ultimately, Tom calls the gangsters who are looking for her to the town to take Grace away but she convinces her gangster father to burn the village and gun them all down.The underlying theme of the piece is quite evident in the title, Dogville. As humans we are nothing more than dogs "obeying our nature" as Grace says. We can only go so far with out eventually reverting to our primal nature in means to survive. This characteristic is hidden to us on an everyday basis, shielded behind large curtains, but when we pull back the curtain the ugliness and true nature of humanity is exposed. We can not truly see our world until we choose to push the curtains away. This aspect of the human condition is perfectly exemplified in the way Von trier decided to present the story by planting the actors in a world without walls. The entire film takes place on a sound stage with only chalk lines drawn on the floor to separate the different areas. This helps to unify the human condition by not setting the story in a specific place but rather a more general experience that would cross borders, both physical and social. Essentially, we are mere dogs that will be put down in order to propagate the survival of the rest of the planet.Along with the philosophically important themes, Dogville comes to life with extraordinary performances from the cast, most notably, Nicole Kidman and Stellan Skarsg?rd. I've never been a huge fan of Kidman but this film changed all of that. After every crippling defeat in the story she remains a quiet and controlled woman living among animals. Her low and soft voice really connected me to her and I felt that I needed to mentally support her throughout the film. I thought a film on a sound stage with no walls would take me out of the story but the opposite happened. It allowed the actors to explore their space and that let their performances really shine through without muddying it up with outside distractions. To contradict Kidman, Stellan Skarsg?rd plays the true "human" in the film. A real dog with survival ultimately guiding his way. He is a cold, almost emotionless animal that perfectly exemplifies the film's themes. He is the first of the town to obey his primal nature which begins a tailspin of incredibly deplorable acts from the rest of the townsfolk. Of course Kidman and Skarsg?rd are supported by the rest of the ensemble but their two performances really stood out for me.The only true gripe I had with Dogville was it's lack of Dogma 95-ness. It took place on a sound stage, with artificial lighting, and professional camera moves involving jibs and cranes. Now I don't believe taking away those elements would help the story, in fact it would do the opposite, but coming from Lars Von Trier I wanted to see a true Dogma 95 film. The film wouldn't have had the same effect of course but I just wanted to point out the fact that it broke many of the rules Von Trier helped establish. But what the film lacks in some areas of the Dogma, it makes up in a huge way. The bareness of the set is the real star of the film and in my opinion is the overwhelming factor in it's uniqueness of how to tell a story. So in that respect, Dogville aligns with the Dogma rules and uses them in such an eloquent way that it amazed me throughout the entire length of the film. The themes presented, along with the stunning performances and use of the Dogma 95 rules, Lars Von Trier's beautifully scripted and performed journey into what makes us human changed my entire perception of what a film could be and do and showed me the importance of pulling back the curtain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a pretty original movie, mainly because of the setting and premise of it all. I personally didn't think it was a true achievement in the film-making medium, but it's still a compelling story although sort of dull at times. The movie is written pretty well though and the acting is pretty good for the most part. What made this movie stand out is how in Dogville there is no walls, in fact it's basically has invisible walls for the audiences that are watching but there is walls for the cast and they had to act like there is walls. Although there isn't any, but the characters had to act like there is a wall and goes along with there usual business in the movie. The movie is really long and the whole movie takes place in just one setting, so it may get a bit dull at times. Since the dialogue is sort of dry and so is the setting and the premise of it all, although it has it's originality to it. The movie is basically about human nature and morality and it's pretty engaging in some parts, I wouldn't highly recommend this film to anyone but the movie does has it's target audiences. A lot of the characters seemed one dimensional and there dialogue didn't go anywhere sometimes and without it, it would have at least shorten the movie to a decent length.7.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viewer's Beware......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the trailer, okay. So, anyone who appreciates that, along with a good story, will undoubtedly find *something* to like in Dogville... but for myself, and after a rather misleading idea of it actually being a 'typical' film, meaning good cinematography, locations, sets, etc. and not seeing that right off, without any type of warning... well, I lasted 3 minutes before I wanted to quit.However, I stuck with it after skimming the reviews, and I'm sort of glad I did.This is my tip to surviving this movie: fast-forward the heck out of it.Honestly, all the parts that looked boring or when I knew there was unnecessary narration or patterns that I didn't feel like watching in regards to character interactions, I just fast-forwarded it. Even if I might have missed some stuff, I inevitably saved an hour out of the 3, and I still got to enjoy the overall story. The performances at the end, after I had gotten the gist of the first half, were really moving, especially Nicole Kidman's. I really enjoyed the cyclical aspect of the narrative, and once I understood what was happening, the lack of set design didn't bother me too much (although I think it'd be that much better if it was on-location).Anyway, it's worth watching if you want to try something a little different. It certainly has a theater-feel to it, but the performances make the film, and the themes can be looked at on a deeper level, so to the skeptics: I wouldn't overlook it entirely. Not my favorite film in the world, but interesting nevertheless.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the director of The Idiots, Lars Von Trier (nominated the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm award for this) is an inventive and stylised film that really challenges you imagination. All buildings and landmarks are suggested by outlines, sound and props on a single sound stage (no real sets), which is the town of Dogville, based in the Depression era. Basically, Grace Margaret Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) arrives in the isolated town on the run from gangsters, led by The Big Man (James Caan). After some persuasion Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), the town decide to help her hide, and in return she works for them, even if they "don't need help". As time goes by, and they get to know her, searches are going through the town, and the people have suspicions and assumptions of poor Grace, and she finds out the hard way that goodness is relative. But she does have a dangerous secret, and the gangsters do eventually find her. Also starring Harriet Andersson as Gloria, Lauren Bacall as Ma Ginger, Jean-Marc Barr as The Man with the Big Hat, Blair Brown as Mrs. Henson, Patricia Clarkson as Vera, Secretary's Jeremy Davies as Bill Henson, Ben Gazzara as Jack McKay, Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as Tom Edison Sr., Forrest Gump's Siobhan Fallon as Martha and narrated by John Hurt.

		<shortDescription>A must for film fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you first begin to watch Dogville it does take you back, it is shocking that the whole film will take place on this sound stage where the buildings are made up of white lines on the black stage floor. The first shot of Dogville the town in like a map, we look down on it from a birds eye view where we clearly see the road running up the middle (clearly named as Elm Street with the letters painted directly onto the floor) and the houses that surround it. There are no doors except one, very few walls except the one on the church hall which is still only 2 metres wide and even a dog is portrayed by an outline on the floor.This type of staging is interesting at it is visible Trier has been highly influence by the playwright and theatre director Bertolt Brecht. Brecht's techniques were to alienate the audience and it is clear that this is Trier's intention in Dogville. Even though the acting in extremely natural and even the sound effects of doors opening and closing can bring a fresh look at film making today.Trier is very daring and i believe that the film is stunning and the set designer (even if it is Trier)should have received more recognition. It is unlike any other film you will see (other than Manderlay) and a must for all film fans.Myself being a film and theatre student, i found this film extremely helpful in understanding Brecht. Forget the effort of going out the the theatre for the night, rent this DVD and you will be instantly educated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville Comment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is superb and it does take time to get used to the setting. But, with the special effects and scenery stripped away, the setting fits with the underlying meaning in this movie: that there a million Dogvilles in the world. The scenery is harsh and bare just like the people in Dogville. I think it makes us realize that all kinds of people can be cruel. Not only are the rich capable of doing horrible things, but also the people that have very little in life. Perhaps, this is what all human beings have in common. And perhaps we are not much better than dogs, because even though dogs are just animals, they will still treat you with respect when you are good to them. By taking a closer look we will realize, WE are the real dogs.</fullReview>

Can any other independent feature be anymore rich in stunning actors?

		<shortDescription>Synopsis of the American tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is perhaps the greatest movie I've seen in many years. The director seems to have a profound understanding of the American culture which, I thought, I was the only one to share. Here is a town which people live in peace but in a very boring way. The young intellectual of the town realizes that Dogville needs a gift to give it a soul. Nicole Kidman shows up on the scene as the personage of "Grace." Grace is pursued by the mob and finds safe haven in Dogville. In return, she offers her devoted services to the town. The town now seems to have a soul; "complete power" over an outsider in which no accountability is required. Little by little, they take full advantage of Grace, simply because they can. Even the black maid and her crippled daughter cannot resist the temptation of hurting and exploiting Grace. This is a picture of America who has been tremendously blessed to be a beacon of light to the rest of the world. The more America becomes powerful without no other nation to oppose her, the more arrogant, selfish and cynical she gets by "drunkenning" herself with that power. America exploits without mercy and does it covertly. The end of the movie in Dogville was so needed and so imperative; would America meet the same end after fattening herself with its avarice toward wealth, materialism, selfishness and complex of superiority? I prayerfully hope so.</fullReview>

Everything is in relief, stark, relentless. Casual cruelty and duplicity are the norm. It's how people "get by" and "entertain themselves." Nearly everyone in the story is a cunning animal squirreling away nuggets and crumbs of whatever they think is valuable and exclusively theirs. Everyone hoards. Everyone is looking for a "favor" but when they get it they are always disappointed. It really is dog eat dog in Dogville.

Fantastic script on the double sides of human nature, with a colourful cast (Bettany shines!), effective narration and a climax of biblical proportions. However- I just can't help thinking what a truly great movie this could be, if it was made as a full outdoor production. I don't think it would take the edge off the story itself at all.

		<fullReview>I've never seen any of Von Trier's movies in the cinema, but almost reluctantly been invited to watch them by friends or chanced to zap through the channels and chance to catch a screening. My growing love for this directors work is much like discovering that you've fallen in love with the girl you keep running into at the grocer's. "Breaking the waves" left me with the feeling of having been beat up emotionally, and every Trier movie I've seen have moments when it feels like a hand tears open my chest and pull my still beating heart out. The snapshot "Dogville" offers of human frailty and cruelty fueled by fear resolved heaps of unsolved questions left by four years of studies in the time it takes to get through three lectures of philosophy, psychology and sociology. It's good to see the betrayal intellectuals are committing every day towards the oppressed that trust them exposed in a movie for once, although Von Trier hints at the dubious connection between himself and himself just to prove how hard it is to tell. It's been said that the trilogy by Von Trier is an exploration of the Christ-figure in a near-contemporary setting, and I'd dare say there's a better introduction to religion in this movie than in the bible itself. After all, doesn't the gospel have a similar ending? And it left me thinking about one big question: Where does mercy end and justice start?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairly interesting movie, a little overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Typically interesting film from von Trier, who always takes big risks. No exception here. "Dogville" is basically a stageplay. Strange girl wanders into a small town, is the welcomed by the town, then exploited by the town. The "town", which we never leave the confines of, being nothing more than a bare soundstage with chalk marks for houses and streets. A brazen idea. Something only a European filmmaker would attempt. I could just see a Hollywood director trying to pitch the idea to the studio heads at Columbia Pictures (yea right). The miraculous part is that it never grows boring. It's a three hour movie, but it only sags at the very end (and then only slightly).Nice performances all around. Kidman is excellent. Unfortunately, there's not a whole to say otherwise about the movie. It's stating a "truism" about human nature (from a pessimistic viewpoint, remember), but big deal. I'm not saying I disagree with his viewpoint, I'm just not convinced von Trier knows exactly what it is he's trying to say. What are you left with? A number of striking images (not many though). von Trier is a wild stylist. A total risk-taker and this is just another one of his wild ideas. Not saying it doesn't work. It just doesn't work as well as "Breaking the Waves" or "Zentropa" or even the equally overrated "Dancer in the Dark".What the film reminded me of a little is some of Sam Shepard's writing. In particular, the novelty of Kidman chained to that wheel. In fact, her having the cowbell around her neck is kind of a rip-off of the story in "Paris, Texas" (written by Shepard) that Harry Dean Stanton tells about the guy who tied the cowbell around the girl's neck so she couldn't run away. Same mental image.Good movie, just not one of von Trier's best. Check out "Breaking the Waves" or "Zentropa".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie Ever Made On The Human Condition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this film Lars Von Trier surpasses and exceeds the standards in independent film-making which he set with his Trilogy of "Breaking The Waves", "The Idiots" and "Dancer in the Dark".It is, quite simply, like no other movie which you have ever seen. The sparse scenery of the studio where it was filmed not only fill you with wonder and awe originally but also emphasise the latent talent of the acting on display. Having not been a huge Nicole Kidman fan before the movie, I no longer need any convincing that she knows how to act.The film has so many allegorical references and such a tight, succinct script that on each viewing you can discover new possible meanings or discover a new telling facial expression on one of the characters.The beginning of the film is, admittedly, fairly slow moving, but the way the film is shot to near perfection creates the perfect rose-tinted view of life in a rural mountain village before the picture is gradually distorted and ultimately ruined.Although the movie is set in America and plays with some American values the messages within the movie definitely have universal rather than specific meaning. The power politics within relationships and the temptation of abusing accepted human ethics when the chance arises, especially when living in a despairing town without hope could strike a chord with any country.After seeing the movie for the first time everyone in the cinema looked stunned. And so was I. I couldn't sleep for about a week or so because the issues and questions it raised about the human condition were so poignant and probing.Without question you must watch this movie. But don't think that you won't see the world in a very different light afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not that many a time , I would sit down to comment on a movie so soon after watching it(1 hr) as i need some time to digest, re-digest everything that happened to the movie and myself. But this is one movie that grinds you into it from the very start.*********Spoilers***************************** I thank god for one reason that i know one or two spoilers before i actually started watching the movie. My friend told me that he wasn't able to finish the movie. At many point of time I contemplated the same thought only to give in to the curiosity that how mature the movie is going to develop from that point of time. But I'm sure the way everything developed is a pure candid representation of the thought process of humans and though the dark nature of us is always apparent to us in many forms, nothing can make you prepared for when you confront it at that moment. More than Grace's character, Whom I loved the most of is Tom who reminds of myself and many others more than other characters that no matter how much intellectually inclined you think you are, we are all the same because the nature called pride which everyone holds it close to their heart in one way or other and when that is threatened we panic.Even though i was taken along the mood swings of Grace when she confronts her father and herself, I felt the actions weren't justified initially. But I do realize that we act at some point of time during our confrontation and in this case I'm confronting even after Grace has acted upon it.This is my first viewing and sure my views are gonna change after the second because it will reduce a great percentage of the shock. But sure its a tough job to go back for one more viewing (the same problem I had for Wild Strawberries).If you haven't seen the movie hope the Spoilers will make you better prepared and if you have already seen it you know what I'm talking about.</fullReview>

After having watched the movie, especially the last scene, I was deeply impressed and it let me thinking for quite some time. Each scene fits to real life human relations, everything fits just perfectly. It is about dependence, about how it comes to exploitation. It fits to everything, it explains antisemitism etc. It reminds me on Berthold Brecht's works. I cannot understand why American wannabe patriots hated it, why it was called 'communist' or 'anti-american'. USA was taken only as an example. That is what real cinema is for, to affect thoughts, to explain human behavior, not only for cheap entertainment. I hope that there'll be more big parables or fables like this.

		<fullReview>This movie took me by surprise because I didn't expect it to be so amazing. When the film first started I was kind of disappointed because the set was comprised of chalk drawings and few walls so you could see through every thing. But this worked to the film's advantage because I had to imagine those things and it helps you concentrate on the characters actions. This film felt so raw and honest but it was also disturbing because of it's portrayal of human nature. When Chuck is talking to Grace about the Town fooling her with it's exterior goodness he is foreshadowing the evil that will eventually reveal itself from each town member. Tom who appeared to be her only friend in the town of Dogville is the worst offender of them all because his deception is sneaky. He pretended to be her friend even when he was plotting behind her back. He couldn't even betray her her face to face like all the others until the very end. In the end of the film when Grace decides to kill everyone in the town I rejoiced because I felt they deserved it. Even when Grace says she wants Vera to watch as her children get shot I still didn't have any qualms with her actions. In fact I think that Grace let them off easy by shooting them. They deserved as much pain as they have inflicted on her. I am a person that does not agree with revenge or the death penalty because I don't think humans have the right to play God. And I know this is just a fictional movie but nonetheless it does address the reality of human nature and against my beliefs I could not help but to side with Grace at the end. This film will be one that resonates with me because of the powerful acting and unconventional set!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Message That Is Difficult To See, But There If You Look For It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is certainly a different film when compared to most we see, but it is the eccentricities of this film which make it work. The set design is phenomenal, with the town essentially a large theatre stage where the power of imagination is required to envision pretty much everything. However, the minimalistic design is done with purpose, to highlight one of many themes running throughout the film; that of a small-town mentality, where everyone knows (and can see) everyone else's business, where it is all transparent, or "see-through" (to quote the film), yet a blind eye is turned in favor of harmony amongst the neighbors.Speaking of themes, many of the comments regarding Dogville speak of an anti-American sentiment, as well as a message supporting the justification of revenge. It is understandable how one can make such an assumption, yet when looked at more deeply, the film offers far more overarching messages than simply America=bad and revenge=good.As far as the anti-American sentiment is concerned, it is entirely possible that America was what the director had in mind. Every storyteller does have an inspiration point, after all, and certainly the end credits, as well as the town being set in Colorado, suggest that the director was perhaps commenting on something he felt he saw within American culture, or at least a particular segment of it. However, the message that is sent about culture, that being that human beings are inherently selfish and greedy, focused on their own desires ahead of everyone else's, can be applied in virtually every society, and thus the message of the film spreads far beyond simply a statement about America to a larger, more general statement about humanity and the darkness that resides within. We are all guilty of pursuing our own desires at the expense of others from time to time, and the indictment of that part of humanity, played out by the townsfolk in their exploitation of the character of Grace, their own search for a sense of power, is a piece of the message of this film.Grace represents the other side of humanity, the side that has hope, the side that is beautiful and idealistic and believes in the good of all, the side of humanity that will sympathize with the wrongdoers and absolve them of their actions, finding reason where there is little, no matter how horrendous their deeds. Is it no coincidence that the character is named Grace, the very act of compassion and mercy? But what happens? If you've seen the film, you know the ending, which I won't give completely away other than to say a certain revenge is enacted. Is it a justification of revenge itself, to say people deserve what they get, and thank you and goodnight? No.The message given by the ending of the film is one of forewarning. Not the forewarning that revenge will come to the horrible people. Because Grace herself is not an innocent in the end, returning to the life from which she had run, which pretty much blows that message out of the water.Rather than a justification, the message is an indictment. The message is, simply, "look what someone can become". Grace's idealism, her hope, her mercy, are all destroyed by the time the film reaches its climax, replaced by cynicism, anger, and her own quest for power. The film drives home the point that the exploitation of the goodness of others for one's own selfish gains only serves to destroy that goodness, and potentially replace it with something far more menacing: hatred.Grace's revenge is not justified; were it, her character would have escaped to the idyllic life she desired, and not returned to the life she had longed to escape. Her own punishment is the loss of her idealism, and her goodness, along with her resignation to a life she had so desperately tried to leave behind.Frankenstein created a monster, and paid for it with an unjust punishment, reaping the very seeds he had sown. So too did the town of Dogville, in this exceptionally well-crafted, and well-acted, film about the dark side of the human mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"'Dogville' makes it's point, while nearly going to the dogs"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dogville" is a sprawling tale of a woman on the run. Nicole Kidman who gives a strikingly reserved performance is Grace, a girl with a secret on the run from gangsters. She seeks refuge in a small Colorado town called "Dogville." Many of the townspeople fail to welcome her with open arms. For her to stay, she had to work tirelessly for most of the townspeople. Grace's one protagonist is Thomas Edison Jr, (played with sensitivity by the talented Paul Bettany). Thomas serves as an solid bridge between Grace and the rest of "Dogville," as he looks out for her and the needs of town simultaneously. This union proves to be unstable, resulting in an emergence of harsh situations. "Dogville" is an overlong film that may not be for all tastes. Running at an exhausting 2 hrs 57 min, which includes a snail's pace prologue, this story could have been told in no more than 2 hrs 15 min. However, the film's goal was to give a detailed analysis on every facet of the story. It did achieve this on occasion, however during other times the flow of the story became muddled. There were however some good points. Lars Von Trier's direction was very organized, considering the amount of characters. The cinematography is striking. And the sets or lack there of establishes the town setting very well as a well-adapted stage play. However, unless you have an appreciation or a divine love for the theater, the overall presentation of "Dogville" could easily be painfully dull for some. While "Dogville" does have its fair share of flaws, it is an interesting display of work that is not seen too often.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville is Our Town. Time has passed. Our Town looks a bit shabby these days. The set is still sparse. We're more realistic. Maybe we were always more realistic.Our Town is covered in Blue Velvet nowadays. There are dirty little secrets inside. On the surface, we are nice. We will help a Jew, even an immigrant, if they are legal and they don't cost us much. They did no harm. They weren't criminals. We knew that. And so, we let them stay with us. We hid them from the authorities. All we asked was a little something in return. A little labor. They were glad to apply themselves, if we would save them and hide them and shelter them. After all, it wasn't much work and in the final analysis, work is a fair exchange for the wages of fear.Grace (Nicole Kidman) gets wages; well not much, but Dogville's citizens build her a house to live in. One couldn't ask for much more. And Grace is grateful and obedient to a fault. One feels free of the demands of the outside world when one is working. The people who run Dogville don't really need her labour or her skills. After all, they can do their work themselves. They have been doing it since before Grace arrived.Hidden Grace is discovered by the idealist of the town. He is the writer. He is the dreamer. He is pure. He is trying to shed light on goodness. He loves the poor, the unwashed, the hard working citizens of Dogville. God provides for those who take care of themselves. They are His obedient servants and He loves them. Not the writer. He is not God. He is also one of God's obedient servants. I mean, God loves the citizens of Dogville--even if they resemble "frogs with dirty little lips". They are good and generous and they help Grace.They have Grace. Grace is theirs to kill or love. Grace is their servant..well, of sorts. They love her. Well, at least, they like her a lot. They let Grace do some of their lighter chores. Grace is obedient. Grace does her chores well. The town seems pleased and begins to brighten as time goes on. From a winter of depression-era discontent, the town passes into a spring, then a summer of cautious, good humour. And Grace? She's grateful.But, the authorities press their case for finding Grace. The town's members begin to feel uneasy. They are, after all, law abiding citizens and they wouldn't want to do anything wrong. But they are also just and as just citizens, Dogville comes to terms with ignoring the policeman's public pleas to pass on any information on the missing Grace to the proper public authorities, by exacting greater toil from their servant. Justice, after all, has to be measured and meted out fairly and crime is in the air. Certainly the citizens of Dogville are not guilty of the crime and Grace is the focus of the missing person's posters and so crime must be followed by punishment. Everyone knows that. Even a child, like the one who pleads with Grace to spank him, knows that. The child has behaved badly and knows that for this crime, he must be punished. Grace reluctantly complies and spanks the child. Thus justice is meted out and the delicate, balance of power between dominance and submission is maintained.Submission is good. Any good ideologist will tell you that. The Good Idea should dominate the human being. Tom Edison (Paul Bettany ) will tell you that as he wanders the streets of Dogville or at the meetings he organizes or in the books he plans to write. And Grace is submissive. As pressure and the promise of reward from the authorities grow, the balance of power between Dogville and Grace has to be adjusted.Time passes.....It is winter. Grace has been obedient to every man in town. Power must be serviced. Dogville's bitches don't like her much for that and the temptation to use their knowledge to turn her out of their Eden grows with every day and night which passes, until finally the deed is agreed to.But not before Herr Edison declares his undying love and Grace consents to submit to him in more ideal circumstances. For now, the reality is her chains, complete with a cow bell around her neck for she has had the temerity to attempt an escape. Sure, Tom tried to help by stealing money from his father. Fortunately for Dogville's citizens, there is a Judas around and it is during and after his betraying kisses that she is raped, more or less at will. Sex will not come to the pure of heart though and Tom decides that Grace must go. It's either her or his ideals.Snow falls. Moonlight glows. The authorities arrive. Dogville's citizens have been obedient. Theirs is the power and the glory forever. Our Men....led by the father of Grace give them their just desserts. Even the one-time wage-slave Grace, relishes her new found political power as it comes out the barrel of gun and into her Idealist Lover's skull."Take a day and walk around. Watch the Nazis run your town. Then, go home and check yourselves. You think we're talking about someone else. But, you're plastic people.........oh baby, now you're such a drag." lyric from Frank Zappa's album "We're Only in it for the Money".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it a good movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever i tell people about 'Dogville', they always ask me whether it is a good movie or not. That is a question that cannot be answered, and that is exactly what von Trier intended. You can't rate Dogville with an amount of stars and whatnot, Dogville just....'is'. I'm not going to tell you too much about the plot, but i will tell you some of the underlying things about the movie. von Trier uses a big black sound stage with chalk outlines for houses. This is not to save money, but it is a Brechtian technique of isolation. Accompanied by the seemingly 'shoddy' editing, von Trier doesn't want the viewer to be sucked into the filmic fantasy side of the movie, he wants you to understand the point he is making, and is almost slapping the viewer on the head every time they don't concentrate. This is effective, because Dogville is far more than a sad tale about Grace getting picked on, it's about how when people receive power and authority, how they take advantage of other people in a less fortunate position, therefore directly taking a stab at capitalism in general. There are also many religious parallels in Dogville, some may say that Grace is the parallel of the kind and merciful Jesus Christ. Finally, many people believe that Dogville is strongly anti-American, i can say that it is not, because von Trier seems to show a much deeper anger at the whole of mankind. How? You'll have to see for yourself! This is one of the bravest, and best movies i have ever seen, and i look forward to the rest of von Trier's movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is by far the richest movie I have ever seen. It never stops to puzzle me how many angles you can attach to it. This is a tale about human weakness in face of temptation (mostly of doing evil when you are given the opportunity to), about human society and the morality of its collective judgment, about idealism vs. practicality (see the struggle in Tom Edison's mind), about the birth of America or of any good society as always regenerating from the ashes of a society which was a bit worse (see the ending and the song that runs as backdrop to the credits). It is also a tale of human destiny ruled by chance (see the ending when Grace's change of heart is spurred by a "sudden change of light" as the moon emerges to the sky). A tale about arrogance, about the contrast between appearance and essence and I could go on. Besides being rich in meanings - without actually leaving the viewer in a deep ambiguity, which is quite an achievement I believe - this movie is also very meticulously done. Almost nothing is left unused: the light, the set, the characters' names, their speed of movement on the set as well as their casual ideologue are all there to support the main story or to tell a smaller story of their own. Just to give an example, Grace's little "adventure" in Dogville runs along with the change of seasons. She appears in town in early spring, gains acceptance from the towns' people in full spring and lives her happiest times in summer. The downside of her experience, or the decline of Dogville starts at summer-end and continues degrading throughout the autumn and early winter. The ending comes as a circle that closes, with the judgment night that is performed in a full winter night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece which left me with hundreds of thoughts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're reading this before you have seen the movie STOP. Not because of possible spoiler (I'm doing my best not to write any), but because you should watch this movie before reading anything about it at ALL. Forget everything, and watch! My spoiler was as little as this: I read a line about this movie which contained the term "anti-american" in it before I saw it. That statement was already a spoiler for me, because I couldn't stop thinking about it while watching the movie and trying to figure what could be that actual a-a thing. I would rather have seen it without having known that, so I could figure it out myself. I wouldn't call it that anyway, I would rather call it an eye opener.Anyway, the movie it self is absolutely wonderful. I started the movie not knowing what I would get (except for the a-a part) and was surprised by the scene setup. Since I was expecting something really heavy and serious I didn't know what to think of it first. That just lasted a minute or so, and then the movie had already captured me... Really captured me... First it was the astonishing acting, the realness of it. Later on it was just the wonderfulness of that little world and the characteristics of the people and the community. After that it was the story which hit me hard. Sometimes I even had a hard time staying in my seat. It really got to me. The crazy part was. I haven't seen a movie in quite a while which felt so real; the stage didn't mean anything.And when it ends.. It leaves you with a lot to think about.. And I'm going to think about it, if I want it or not :) ..I just hope that no one will just draw a quick conclusion about the ending.. I don't think you can really conclude.. So many things seem right, so many things seem wrong.. from every side..I don't have to say more about it. My sincere compliments to everyone involved in creating this movie. I will remember this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting, brilliant cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Dogville started I was skeptical since I was watching it on the treadmill where I prefer a good old-fashioned cinematic narrative. But the combination of a fantastic script, stunning acting, hypnotic pacing, great camera-work that makes the most out of a brilliantly designed set, and luscious layers of metaphor make this one of my favorite movies of the past 10 years. If nothing else, Dogville makes me realize that Tom Cruise is a bigger idiot than I thought he was, as Nicole Kidman is so luminous, intelligent, and downright gorgeous in this that it's amazing she hooked up with Planet Sci-Cruise in the first place. That aside, everyone is fantastic, including Gazzara, Bacall, Blair Brown, and James Caan. I saw the movie, on one level, as a metaphor for the worst of America, as well as a meditation on the way the movies have dealt with the Depression and our history in general. Kidman's name - Grace - of course, gives it all a nice theological touch - a sort of gnostic fantasy, and the dialectic debate towards the end of the movie (not a spoiler although it would be if one names the characters who conduct it) is powerful not just for the content and the acting, but the context and outcome. The consolation of philosophy! I'm not surprised it received so many 1's in the voting - if the movie doesn't grab you, it can really turn you off, but if it does grab you, you're in for a riveting experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not at all prepared for this movie and knew very little about it. I have seen all of Von Trier's other films, and loved them -particularly Breaking the Waves. This film is different again in its use of elements of theatre. Set on a stage, there is little to distract the audience from becoming deeply involved with the narrative, characters and dialog. I found it extremely compelling in the same way that a great book is hard to put down. I have watched this film 4 times in 24 hours and I almost can't bear to leave the emotional space in which it has put me. Many film makers have attempted to put forward similar viewpoints of America, but few have achieved it with such simplicity and clarity. It is a perfect 'illustration' .</fullReview>

Lars Von Treir offers a truly disturbing world-view in this, his best film.One of the criticisms leveled at this film is its perceived "un-Americanism". However, the film is less an indictment of American culture than an illustration of the perhaps inherent corruption of human nature.The final scene is shocking and confronting. It will leave you reeling with questions not only about humanity as a whole, but about your own ineffable, unacknowledged desires for justice and vindication, even at the expense of your own morality.Not to be missed, Dogville is a journey to hell, and maybe just some of the way back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A uniquely layered, intricate film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A gradually but inevitably onrushing tidal wave of emotional content, this film is far more of an emotional ride than any number of so-called thrillers or romantic comedies.There has been some excellent analysis in previous comments - and some fairly shallow criticism, some of which comes from people who didn't even watch the whole film - so I won't try and dig deep. I also won't retell the plot or comment on the (excellent) presentation of the plot.However in the few pages of comments I read, I didn't see one specific point mentioned fully, so let me make it here. If you subscribe passionately to the worldview that humans are basically good, then you will not like what this film will show you. It portrays humans as essentially bad; people only do "good" things to keep up appearances, and either turn swiftly to evil when they can get away with it, or at least do not have the courage of their convictions (e.g. the Tom character).The one potential exception is the girl Grace. She is tirelessly, self-sacrificially good, even when the entire village turns on her.What I see here is a surprisingly clear Gospel parallel. In a place where people seem to be quite nice, a perfect (supposedly) person is placed. Measured up against her - even though she does not come and judge them - suddenly the badness inherent in those around her is revealed. They eventually revolt against her completely, and utterly humiliate her.The part where the parallel ends is of course the end of the film. Grace is, after it all, only human. Christ, at the point of utmost humiliation, under the most pressure imaginable, where stress and irritability in anyone else would have reached titanic proportions, simply cries out in love, "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do." Grace cannot do this, and although the sudden, avenging end of the film violently and wonderfully opposes the gradual pathos of all of the previous events, I am left with the sense that even Grace, for all of her goodness, is still not able to match what Christianity claims Christ did.von Trier has certainly constructed a complex, layered masterpiece, of which I think this is a significant facet.Oh, and go watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw Dancer in the Dark, I saw it just because Björk appeared there. However, the movie turned out to be one of the greatest I had ever seen; so when I heard about this new movie from Lars Von Trier, I thought that I just had to watch it. Specially after seeing the trailer because it seemed really clever and original to use that scenery.At that time I had heard some comments about the movie telling that it was "slow", "boring", but when I saw it, I didn't find it boring at all. As a matter of fact, it's one of the best movies that my eyes have seen (it is even better than Dancer in the Dark) and I think that everybody (mature enough, of course) should see it. It gives you a lot to think about, and the end it's the most surprising thing ever. I'm not going to ruin the end for those who haven't seen it, but I can tell it's going to shock you. Besides, the movie is filled with different emotions and even thought its duration is longer than two hours, the way that the movie is told makes it so impressive.So this is a 10.BTW: Nicole Kidman is an awesome actress</fullReview>

I don't think that it received all the festival acclaim just because of Lars but because it was one of the most original, brilliantly constructed and acted film that I've seen in years. Nicole Kidman was, as usual, at the top of her game. This is a piece of fiction and as much as anyone in the US would hate to admit, could or has happened. It captures the essence of American greed and self absorbance. Although a bit too long at around 3 hours, it's never dull and with each chapter, it leaves the viewer wanting more. This is one I would recommend to anyone and will make sure to add to my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***Possible Spoilers*** A lot of critics loved this movie, just as a lot of critics hated it. I was drawn to this movie because I had heard that it was Nicole Kidman's greatest performance. I heard this not from a movie critic, but from a Nicole hater. The Nicole hater was right; Nicole Kidman delivers what, I believe, to be one of the greatest performances by an actress, ever. She is close to tears throughout most of the movie, just as her character, Grace, would be.The movie is about Grace, who flees gangsters and ends up in a small town, Dogville. At first she is greeted with kindness-townsfolk refuse to allow her to help them work, they give her gifts upon her supposed departure, etc. It is, however, only a short time until the townsfolk bare their teeth. They exploit her, abuse her, even force her to walk around with an iron chain attached to her neck!The movie is beautiful, perfectly acted, and wonderfully written. John Hurt's narration is not obnoxious as in other movies, but quite endearing. You may not like this movie, but it is worth seeing.</fullReview>

"I think the world would be better without Dogville". At least we've got some movie which typically reflects the Danish sense of tragedy... A movie following a 100% modern Hamlet vein.

The see - through scenery, the moral discussion, lusting human nature - everything finds it's right place in this top - of - the - art movie. Because watching the final forty - five minutes of film with my eyes, mouth and ear wide open is not something that would happen to me every day.

		<fullReview>*******SPOILERS*****First time I saw this movie I had no idea what it was about. I had not seen the trailer or read any reviews or even knew about the 'location'. I had seen the DVD for sale online and liked the blurb and heard the name 'Trier' a few times and loved Kidman so I decided to rent this. I loved it.First of, the first thing you'll notice is the setting. With the DVD menu and opening few seconds I thought it was a CGI gimmick to introduce us to the town so I skipped a head a few chapters. After the initial shock I got used to it and fell totally in love with the way this movie was shot. It is so perfect, even now I can't believe that they actually made this move and they made it like they did. It is perfect in that way.The story is very very good, always affecting and sometimes disturbing and 99.9% well acted. Often during the movie I thought that the character changes were radical and too quick but looking back they seem just right, normally in a movie when a character changes you think, what a bad script. But in this movie it seemed to me that Grace (and Kidman) seemed to change back and forth with ease. The abuse of Grace is very emotional and very frightening (it makes you want to question yourself). The first rape scene and how she 'takes'(sorry) all the other rapes and abuse just makes you so angry at her and to sympathetic to her.Edison on the other hand.... I hated him with a fiery passion from the start and especially nearing the end, how can he say that he loved Grace when he let all the men of the town (including his father) rape her on a daily basis, how could he let the abuse happen at all. He is ineffectual and annoying but he has to be for the film and plot to work right.The message of the film is about good and bad people most agree and depending on who you are what you get from it differs but what I thought was that people are at nature bad and as much as they cover it up, given the chance they will exploit and abuse when they no there will be no blame.Overall: 10/10 - the set is AMAZING and worth the 3 hours just for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like watching a brilliant novel...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the only way I can describe a movie like this. To me, the best movies are like watching novels. In some ways, this can be detrimental, and at times, I did indeed find myself disconnected from the movie.However, therein lies the redeeming value in "Dogville." Like a great novel, its nuances and details develop slowly and become intertwined with the underlying message within this film. This movie forces you to pay attention to the story at hand. It's sparse of scenery and locale, yet if you're willing enough, you can fill in the details if you want to. The lack of scenery forces you to focus on the characters and the slow deterioration of their human sensibilities.It's a movie that, like all brilliant movies, has themes that transcend into society as a whole.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliant. Just brilliant. Slightly predictable ending but I couldn't wait.(i was waiting for a Tarantino-like finish, and was not disappointed.)What's with Nicole Kidman these days? She's actually doing some really good indies and is much more impressive in indies than in mainstream.This movie gets a 10 of 10 for its simplicity, starkness, complexity, insights, conclusions, and David Bowie singing through the credits. Just see for yourself.And what's with this ten line minimum? I said what I wanted to say in the first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've done it again, Lars. A fantastic, disturbing and thought-provoking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier is one of my favourite art-house directors. He has made consistently great films throughout his career and this is no exception.The filming is interesting enough. I don't really know how to describe it, but it is certainly experimental.The basic storyline is of Grace (Nicole Kidman), who runs to the town of Dogville to get away from 'gangsters' in the city. She wants to stay, so she gives the town two weeks of work before they decide to let her stay. Even after that, she gives all she can to the town, who seems to love her back. That all changes fairly soon.It is a film that is pretty harsh, not because of the scenes, but more because of the concepts. It presents the human race as being brutal, uncompromising and selfish and by the end of the film, I was questioning the way our race acts on Earth.Words do not do this film justice. An easy 5/5 from me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cynical yet very sincere story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this is an analysis I wrote right after watching the movie, so it might sound a bit raw, since I felt hysterical and numb because Mr. Von Trier really knows how to push my buttons. After "Dancer In The Dark" I vowed to myself that I will never be the same again. I also vowed that to myself after "Dogville" and "Breaking The Waves". Go figure. Anyway, maybe the following has been brought up before, but this is my perspective.totally felt some Bible allegory going through the movie. Grace (thus the name) resembles Christ, tempted and thrown out of Paradise for arrogance. From now on I'll simply refer to Christ as Her, to solve misunderstanding between sexes. Grace ended up in Dogville, a quiet little town which describes the Earth best. It features every single aspect of humankind with its flaws and virtues through each and every person. Grace came as a gift from up above, she "gave" the blinded man his eyes, talked to people in need of communication and helped folks with their chores. As time moved on, people discovered that Grace's obligingness is easily abused, so they took advantage of her and how much didn't they make her work or used her, Grace never got upset. She even repeated, that nobody's doing anything wrong, even after she got her "cross to bear" - the chain around her neck.It appeared that James Caan's character a.k.a Lord had put Grace in Dogville for certain reasons, for her to understand the malignity of humankind. Notice the way Grace talks to him, simply referring to him as "father", not using his real name, which God doesn't have as we know. Also notice the submissive tone in her voice. When her father explains her the reasons she got thrown out, he demands not to open the curtains of the vehicle. This could be translated as "one cannot see the face of God". The point is, the curtains could be opened only after the townspeople were killed one by one and the city was in flames. A little bit of Judgment Day there. God was intimidated by the malice of people and sent his son on earth to explore the "real" life. Son in the form of Grace continuously tried to understand what people did to her, but at one point she also realized that world has turned into a place, where morality remains nothing but a word. She decided to destroy everything. In the end, notice that the only survivor is Moses. Open the Holy Book and draw your own conclusions.10/10P.S. Great he used a theatrical set, it wouldn't have been half the movie it was if a normal set was used.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only saw this film last night and I am still mostly overwhelmed to find any other words but trivial superlatives.In all truth I saw the Prologue and decided to just send it back to Netflix, only to (luckily!) decide to finish it few hours later. If you are there like me, stuck at the Prologue and surprised to see sets and no real exterior- DO finish it! All else will become secondary to powerful storytelling and the intense observation of human nature- well acted and well scripted.Like other posters here I am not sure why this film is so slated to be a comment on America- I can only see that as being plausible if only America is a country populated human beings and all others- by fancy robots (with European accents, hehe)If Lars Von Trier himself is making such a distinction, then he is belittling this film and I would be very disappointed at such a whiny and bitchy attitude from an intelligent (i'd think) director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far better than the critics opined and the source of very divided opinions of those who saw it. Some of the naysayers didn't appear to understand it. Highly controversial and therefore worth seeing-a bit like "Leaving Las Vegas" in that way. Outstanding acting, meaning that it was well directed, with an interesting storyline. One of Nicole Kidman's best performances. That the movie was completely overlooked at Oscar time was no surprise, due, no doubt, to its supposed controversial anti-American topic. Frankly, this movie has no such bias and I wonder who decided that it did, spreading that opinion-perhaps maliciously. Considering the tripe that usually wins in the best picture category, it is really no surprise that such original films are ignored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewers are really missing the point if they think this film is specifically anti-American! That thought NEVER entered my perception at least. You Americans are just too SENSITIVE! Get a life!This film is about being human, with all its frailties and mystery. It is an unusual film. I personally didn't find it boring (quite the reverse) or pretentious. I was fascinated!Overall it can be seen to be a sad film. However, maybe it's all too realistic and therefore that feels uncomfortable. Would people really react like that-taking advantage of another human being knowing they could get away with anything? I don't think it takes much for people's shadow to emerge. After all look what happens when there's a riot? Aren't there looters? What is that but downright theft of others' property.This film has left a mark beyond its hours. I need to reflect some more as I feel there's unfinished contemplation on its merits and implications.My only reservation was with Nicole Kidman-I don't know that I felt convinced by her acting. Was it wholly believable? I know I would heartily defend myself had I been in her shoes. Why did she so willingly accept her fate at the hands of these townsfolks who turned on her so viciously, especially when they had made some wrongful conclusions.But boy, didn't karma (cause &amp; effect) play its hand! There is a moral to this tale if nothing else-beware of your actions lest they come back to haunt you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new technical production for a new morality?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The staging with marked lines and a few significant props focused the whole attention on the script and its interpretation. The plot moved with the perfection and inevitability of a classic Greek tragedy to its conclusion. After the shock of the massacre at the end, with the clearing of the fog of violence, the necessity of the destruction of the town became evident. The father's use of the word "arrogance" to his daughter in her apparent forgiveness of faults in others that she would not tolerate in herself cut through the hypocrisy that decades of "political correctness" have used to blur morality in our society. The 'dogme' ideal of filming from beginning to end, of no special effects blended beautifully with the sound track, use of voice-over and mounted cameras to give a new standard to film. Since seeing Dogville I have found everything else contrived, artificial and forced. I feel I am doomed to watch Dogville over and over for the rest of my life, faintly hoping that there are other film-makers who have been inspired by Lars Von Trier. And how much of the film's brilliance came from one mind being writer director and cameraman, I wonder?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you believe that movies should be first and foremost for entertainment, read no further. Why? Because "Dogville" is not an entertaining movie by any stretch of the imagination. It's a disturbing, emotional masterpiece. I know this word is overused but I can not give another definition for this film but a masterpiece. As you probably have read in the other reviews it looks like a play, the houses don't even have walls and are just chalk lines on the ground. Strangely enough, that is actually a plus for the movie as it allows the viewer to concentrate his entire attention to the story and the actors' performances. And the lack of walls intensifies the feeling of community which the Dogville residents have (in a sense that everyone is aware what the others are up to) which is very important for the idea of the movie.And talking about acting, here is where "Dogville" really shines. We have Nicole Kidman who lives up to her great reputation and delivers an awesome performance as Grace, an innocent and naive woman who hides from some gangsters in the little town of Dogville. Never overacting or taking all the attention upon her, she totally nails the part. Her face and especially her eyes give a perfect representation of the pure and all-forgiving woman Grace is meant to be. She is supported by a group of some very talented actors like Paul Bettany who is nearly perfect as the all-knowing but doing nothing, philosopher Tom. Anyway, there are a lot of good movies who rely just on the actors brilliance to mask the poor plot. Not the case here. It's a very symbolic and engaging tale, the film is nearly three hours long but I hardly noticed that when I watched it for the first time as it never drags. The ending is very controversial and has kept me thinking about it in the few days since I watched the movie. But not with being unclear - it's very clear and seemingly easy to understand but it's really open for interpretations from a moral point of view and can inspire a lot of interesting discussions and thoughts. It has also one of the most unforgettable and thought provoking dialogs I have ever seen on screen followed by one of the best scenes I have ever watched. You need to see it to believe me. From a purely cinematographic perspective, there is the audacity of Lars von Trier to shoot the movie with a hand-held camera. But nevertheless it has some truly breathtakingly beautiful moments despite the lack of proper sets - Grace laying in the back of the truck comes to mind. The important thing is that it totally works unless you care for the perfection of the vision more than for the idea and message of the film.I was really amazed to see a lot of people who attack the movie as being "anti-American". That's not the case, it has clearly a lot more to do with the decline of the human society as a whole than with attacking the American way of life. What makes this movie special apart from the philosophical questions it boldly raises is the level of emotion. I can only speak for myself but I have never hated movie characters more than some of those in "Dogville". They develop all the time and the fast and easy way in which a human being can lose its whole humanity and turn into something deserving nothing but hatred, given the right circumstances and victims, is both very disturbing and realistic.Just see this movie with an open mind. You will probably either love it or hate and judging by the very high rating it has on IMDb, chances are it would be the former.:)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great play, not so great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally, I thoroughly dislike plays, I hate the artificial feel of it, but this movie has to be the best play I have ever seen. That is not so much criticism as observation. Every scene takes place on one indoor set, the size of a stage. This set houses the complete village of Dogville. The set is like a blackboard with the set pieces, from a dog to whole houses, chalked on the floor as if it were a map. There is only the occasional real set piece like a chair or a piece of wall. This makes the little village transparent. The black background makes the village look like it is alone in the cosmos. If all of this is meant to convey that this is a small, cramped, isolated village where little goes unseen: then it works. The price might be too high, though, for it feels very artificial and you are aware of it much to often. One, especially annoying, example of this is when actors have to open and close non-existent doors. Where I questioned the need for this mime, I hated the sound effects that went with it. The story is about a young, beautiful woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) seeking refuge in an isolated and small village (about six houses and a church) during the depression. She claims to be sought by dangerous men but refuses to say anymore. ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS The town reluctantly adopts her as she turns out to be charming and willing to work for all of them. It is only when the village finds out that Grace is wanted by the police that they realise exactly how weak her position is. The people from the village start to exploit her, Grace has to endure this because she has no where else to go. END OF SPOILERS*** This movie is about power and the corruption that it brings. Just about all the individuals in this movie get, at some point, tested with an unhealthy amount of power over another individual. The question is how these individuals will hold. One gets the sense that the writer could have named this movie Ratville, as well. Indeed, he or she might have even called it Humanville thinking that would say more than enough, because this movie does paint a bleak picture of humanity. At this point I would like to say that before watching this movie I had heard that the director (Lars von Trier) had said that this movie was some comment on the US. The story is situated in a village in the US and that is how specifically American it got; the village, the people and their behaviour could have been anywhere. Von Trier obviously just yanked the chain of the Americans. If he had said this movie was about human nature nobody would have taken notice, by saying this was a comment on the US he made a big market curious. Because of the time and the country we can think von Trier hinted at the foreign policy of the US, in particular the invasion of Iraq, which for some made little sense if exploitation of its vast oil riches was not taken in account. Fact is: he could have said this movie was a comment on any country at any given year and we would have found a reason why that would work at some level. To think that this movie is about the US is to be ignorant of other cultures, countries or just humanity as a whole. In the end, and I mean after you have seen the whole movie, it is not without satisfaction. The actors are great and so is the story. Extreme and even shocking things occur but you as a viewer get the chilling idea this is exactly how things could have gone. On the other hand, you have to wait almost three hours for this story to unfold and you could be excused for giving up on it half way through. The form in which the story is told is very daring (to have the magic of cinema at your fingertips and then to just chuck away half of its function is either brave or stupid). I can respect the experiment but I can not escape the feeling that it could also be a gratuitous show of rebellion by the director. As an experiment I can not say it was a success for I felt the form was too dominant, it is up to the individual viewer to look beyond that and some people might be better at it than others. I must come to the rather peculiar conclusion that, in the end, it is quite a good movie but I could not really recommend seeing it: 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nicole Kidman is the greatest actress of the 21st century and Lars Von Trier is the most challenging and visionary film artist since the times of Goddard. Together they created a critique of the protestant morality and a bomb to the western way of thinking. Echoes of Brecht and his circle of chalk overshadow this black tale of exploitation, naivety and cold-hearted revenge. The most striking postmodernist film ever made, already famous for its sarcastic take on the american dream (which is not so accurate-the film had a much broader vision)has been deprived of its chances to artistic recognition, first at Cannes film festival and now by postponing its American release until next year. It must have caused great fear indeed!</fullReview>

Acting is superb, and the dialogue in the car between Grace and her father is for me one of the most striking scenes in the film history. The narrator (whose English accent is very conspicuous) reminds me with his revealed cynicism of the narrator in Kubrick´s Barry Lyndon.

Until 'The Hours' I thought her one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood, but she is rapidly turning into one of those performers whose latest film I will want to go to see as soon as I hear that he/she is making it... Of course, I would have gone to see this just on the strength of Lars von Trier's name - he doesn't show any signs of slowing up either with this offering, which is something like a cross between Our Town and Bullets Over Broadway, stretched out over a sprawling three hours.Von Trier has definitely gone out on a limb here, but as far as this reviewer is concerned, the branch more than supports his weight. If this doesn't win the Palme d'Or that it's up for, then there's even less justice in the world than the parade of photographs of poverty-stricken folk in the US that is the background to the final credits would lead me to believe...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a film about human nature. The dark shadows inside every and each one of us that we don't acknowledge and would rather believe don't exist.We, as a specie, are quite simply the worst and most evil form of life that has ever existed on this planet. The things we do to one another as individuals and groups would make the most vicious of predator animals run scared if they could comprehend our handiwork. We lie, cheat, mass murder, rape, start wars, and eliminate entire groups based on skin colour or religion or ancestry. You are probably saying "only criminals do that, I would never...". Well, and how do you know? Are you really a refined and decent creature, or you're just acting right because you can't face the consequences? You don't know, and you will not know until you are in a position where you know that you can do evil and there will be absolutely no consequences for your actions. Having absolute power over someone and fearing no consequences could release the monster inside you. Why else would the Russian solders, originally peaceful farmers, fathers, and husbands, rape 2 millions German women and children in Berlin in spring 1945? Why else did Turkish soldiers enthusiastically carried on the orders to eradicate the Armenian civilians just before the end of WW1? The residents of Dogville acted as kindly as you'd expect from any nice folk living in any town. But once they knew that Grace was theirs and that they would not face any consequences for their actions, the dark shadows came out. Watch it and don't convince yourself that it's just a movie to feel safe. Life is much worse, and if you don't believe me just google for "Channon Christian".The director chose to accuse the Americans of being the ones more likely to commit the despicable atrocities. Well, I don't really blame him. As evil as human beings from everywhere could be, the Americans have always managed to to break new grounds in ugliness and sink lower than any other people. Which people built their country on the extermination of the original people by bullets, poisoning the land, and infecting them with smallpox? Who pretended to be so offended by Hitler's racism in the 1930s, yet 40 years afterwards people of a particular skin colour still rode at the back of the bus in their own country? Who dropped two atomic weapons on the Japanese civilians in the worst textbook war crime in history, yet they somehow took offence when someone did the exact same to them on 9-11? In what country do millions of homeless people eat from garbage while hundreds of billions are spent on the military and foreign aids to friendly dictators? In which country are people denied a global health care system because of greedy insurance companies and their lobbies?The list goes on, but I think the point has been made and we can't really blame Lars Von Trier for choosing to make America the stage of his trilogy. At the end we see a brilliant argument about how it's condescending to consider people unfit to facing the consequences of their actions. The argument that it's not as much an act of revenge as it is something you owe to the world is as mentally stimulating as anything you'll ever hear. I watched an excellent program called "Nice Guys Finish First" when I was young, have lived by it since, and this is why Dogville rang true to me.It's more than a film. Rather a fantastic study of the human psyche and a constitution by which one should live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville - where humans ... and others...discover their inner beasts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most interesting films I have seen in a long time. The director, Lars Von Trier, is a founding member of the DOGMA95 group, and although he breaks his rules in this film, he does manage to make a movie that is minimalistic, yet potent.Dogville is the story of Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her falling out with her father, The Big Man (James Caan) over the people of Dogville. We discover that Grace believes that the people of Dogville are inherently good. How wrong she is.The film starts out by exposing us to the inhabitants of Dogville. We are introduced to the town through the eyes and thoughts of Tom Edison (Paul Bettany), a man of ideas that does not have any. We meet the people in his town and are granted an insight into their fallibility's.Then we meet Grace. She tells us that she is running away from a very powerful man. Tom misinterprets this as to mean she is running away from a gangster. He offers to introduce Grace to the town as he believes that his town will accept her into their fold. Instead, the town concludes to give Grace a trial period and Tom induces Grace to attempt to spend time with all the inhabitants so they get to know her. She promptly agrees and sets about meeting the town folk. The town slowly come to accept Grace and at the next town meeting she is allowed to stay.Then a lawman arrives and posts a missing persons poster. The town now have their misgivings and again Tom induces Grace to help bypass this misgiving by doing work for all the inhabitants which she again does promptly. He calls it Quid Pro Quo. Again a gently peace comes over the town as they accept Grace.The lawman returns and this time posts a Wanted poster. This again disturbs the town people and Tom convinces Grace to provide more of her time and less of theirs. He tells her it is the only way the town will remain mum over her stay with them. Here the film takes a nasty turn with Grace being raped by one of the men in the town, Chuck (Stellan Skarsgard). Grace quickly becomes the doormat for the town where she works longer hours for less pay and getting abused by more and more of the men in town. Tom attempts to 'help' Grace escape but the attempt fails and he blames her for theft. The town responds by bounding Grace to a heavy weight and chain.At one point, Vera (Patrica Clarkson), the wife of Chuck, discovers that her husband has been raping Grace and takes out her rage on Grace. Grace had been saving her money buying overpriced trinkets from Ma Ginger (Lauren Bacall). She proceeds to destroy the 7 trinkets explaining that since she had taught her children about stoicism, if Grace does not cry, she will stop smashing her trinkets. But Grace can not stop and all 7 trinkets are destroyed.Finally, the Big Man comes to town. The inhabitants, including Tom are expecting a reward. But not quite the reward they get. Grace agrees with her father that she erred and the townspeople are not worthy of life. The town needs to be put out of its misery before it creates even more misery. Grace now becomes a vengeful angel. She gives the town her Quid Pro Quo. She orders Vera's seven children to be killed one by one and the killing would stop if she displays stoicism. She then personally shoots Tom Edison in the back of the head.The one living inhabitant of Dogville that survives is Moses, the dog.The film is a powerful fable about Gods, forgiveness and responsibilities. The ending is a photo montage with David Bowie's 'Young Americans' in the background.A tale about a town near you, and about people we all know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deconstructing America?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Deconstructing" the allegedly idealized American life in the suburbs and small towns is an old and recurring Hollywood idea. Blue Velvet, American Beauty, and Desperate Housewives are just a few examples of a subgenre of the larger "indicting America" motif. It specifically targets the lifestyle of most Americans, one that is most far from Hollywood people and most "intellectuals". In that subgenre, suburbia and rural areas dwellers (presumably Republican-voting) are shown as twisted, sexually perverted, women-hating and cruel hypocrites. There is nothing so outrageous you portray that will not gain appraisal as "making one think about who we really are". It actually makes people who already think one certain way happier about themselves. Dogville, directed by a Danish US-hater is more of a European highly stylized version of that subgenre than a look at the US from the Old World. Even the idea of making rape as a secret central feature of American lives is reminiscing of No Down Payment, the grandfather of the above mentioned movies. Still, there is something incredibly deeper about Lars Von Triers's take that makes Dogville, as well as some of his previous works, such as Dancer in the Dark and Breaking the Waves, more than a failed indictment: religious symbolism. It is the recurring pattern of putting a scapegoat of the collective sins and evils at the center of the story: the conversion of each inhabitant's aggression, in the form of physical violence or spite, towards a Christ-like figure ? inevitably a woman. The scapegoat has always something different that makes it stand from the other citizens. In his previous movies, it can be just some strangeness of behavior, like the Bjork character in Dancer in the Dark. The scapegoat is not only rejected, it is the object of something like a religious sacrifice ? it is collectively massacred. In Dogville, however, the Director goes one step further: Kidman's character arrival from outside the town is shown as the arrival of a strangely sacred figure, utterly pure and mysterious, whose treatment must determine how everyone who encounters her will be judged. If that is not enough to make you understand that she comes from heaven, the woman is called "Grace". The treatment is predictably harsh and thus so is the punishment. Heaven is not only the source of graces, but also of judgment. For some time the town's fate hangs in the balance, because the massacre is not absolutely unanimous ? there is one righteous who will stand for angelic being. Once he turns on her, and becomes the priest who will use the knife upon the sacrificial victim, hell breaks loose and Dogville receives the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. They didn't understand who she was. The anthropologist Rene Girard, in his investigations on the origin of society, said that every religion begins in the first sacrifice, when men stop fighting against each other and converge their violence into a scapegoat ? possibly a person. The process is then repeated, and thus ritual sacrifice is born. Western religions, however, condemn the sacrifice, specially human, strongly, and thus the operation must go wrong.The problem of showing a modern society in such a "state of nature" is that, well, they already have a religion. It is hard to imagine a community exercising such treatment without some restraint from their moral commitment. Von Trier's answer, - and I wonder how many people have noticed that -, is removing the Church from the small community's life. In Dogville, there is a church building, but no pastor. In the end, this movie, like some of LVT previous, proves the exact opposite of the indictment on America: what it would be without its beliefs, and not what it is because of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing but deeply flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setting of the movie was refreshing and simple. It allowed the audience to use their imaginations. The movie started out well but by the end of its 3 hours became quite tedious. The acting was good but the style of the film was disjointed, which hurt the overall flow of the film.The film is a thinly-veiled pessimistic, cynical, and depressing commentary on humanity and specifically the U.S. What is almost laughable, however (if it wasn't so sad) is that the writer and director of the film so completely misunderstands the U.S. as well as the rest of humanity. The sociopolitical commentary is as one-sided and flat as the stage the film is acted upon. In the end, the film turned into a preachy lauding of the supposed virtues of moral relativism.Early in the film I thought how wonderful and refreshing it was; however, those thoughts quickly faded away as the message of the film was bludgeoned over and over while the film turned more cynical and depressing (I don't mind a good depressing movie - this movie just wasn't that good). So, no matter how much I really want to have liked this movie, I can't bring myself to like it very much. I gave it a 6/10 for the play-like scenery and good acting, without which it would have fared much worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguided dull acting from Kidman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kidman plays a gangster's (James Caan's) daughter, who is surrounded by criminals and so wants to escape the vicious side of life and live in peace and quiet in the country. But once she's gained 'refugee status' in Dogville by working hard each day for the townspeople, Grace is soon being taken advantage of by the poor country folks, who slowly become a replacement for the criminals. Grace's problem (and she gains a few dilemmas over the weeks) is that she does not set her boundaries or demand justice. Even refugees have rights. Her voice is very well modulated and the girl never raises her voice, except once when she yells at Vera's young son stating that she will not physically spank the boy (and then she does hit him!). Bad move Grace. This bad action is supposed to show the townspeople that Grace is immoral and not trustworthy and so this automatically opens her up for further exploitation and degradation, which includes being used for sexual relief by all the men in town. (Thankgoodness the women are not lesbians.)So, now we see who's trustworthy, truthful... and what's immoral. But Grace just lies back and takes it! WHY? I feel she should get a bit angry but doesn't seem to show any reactions till the end.Actually, I dreaded watching Dogville because I do not feel that Nichole Kidman has any right to be accredited as a leading actress, in the category of Liv Ulman. In Dogville, Kidman is a pale insipid disappointment and so was James Caan as her gangster Daddy. They are obviously only worried about showing their good side to the cameras (Kidman's wispy hair was a worry!) and they were not able to bring out the truth needed to portray the underlying faults in the characters.The script was ably supported by the other lesser known actors and even the great actress Lauren Bacall looked scruffy for the part.This movie was supposed to be a representation of a stage play on screen so what's with the user comments about "where's the scenery?" For goodness sakes- grow up people! Dogville should be watched as a film about justice, trust, trustworthiness, assertiveness, conscience and faith in humanity, which is what you see in any Shakespeare production so maybe HEY!... Dogville's script is up there with the best? And it's good because IT MAKE YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WE ATTAIN A Truly MORAL SOCIETY GUYS.I reckon they should make Dogville again without Kidman and Caan and see what happens. It'll open your eyes and your hearts for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting themes, terrible film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING: Contains a couple of references to the ending of the film.It's often said by many fans of cinema, rather casually, that most people never go and see genuinely interesting films, they only like to watch trash. With Dogville I can see why this might be the case, as it conforms to almost every cliché of "art" films without actually providing anything that someone new might be able to grab hold of. It's not a problem when a film is difficult, it's a problem when a film is unnecessarily difficult, which is what Dogville makes itself.Dogville takes a very interesting topic, the right of a person to make a moral judgement about others, and raises some very interesting points about this topic. This lofty aim is what is good about the film, and it succeeds well if you just watch the last ten minutes.But what's bad about the film is the way these important questions are buried so deeply, and so obscurely, that very few people will have the time or inclination to get far enough through the film to encounter them. At film festivals, maybe, but the vast majority of people nowadays see films at home, usually on television.The 3 hour running time, often justified in films and plays, isn't justified here. It makes very little difference to the final outcome whether you've seen all the details of the townspeople's life or not, and as films like this are usually shown very late anyway you'd have to either be unemployed or extremely willing to go without sleep to struggle through to the end. There's very little to help you along the way, and its apparent message that all humanity is animal-like scum doesn't exactly help matters."You're evil deep down, go on, admit it or you're deluding yourself!" is hardly the way to get people to think about life, and it's not a million miles away from priests bellowing "You're sinners ye all!" at schoolchildren. The mistake made by Grace that the film highlights is similar to the mistake the film itself makes, it assumes an arrogant aloofness from other mass media, and unnecessarily shuts itself off from anyone except dedicated film goers.I've heard this is supposedly an attack on certain political viewpoints, but to be honest how effective is an attack if the only people who are going to watch it all the way through are likely to be the kind of people who already disagree with that viewpoint? If it is a political attack, it's preaching to the converted, a pointless exercise which only seems to entrench views instead of shaking them up.It's also inaccurate in the way that so many academic and media reports on life are: it assumes what's true of many is true of all. Most of us will never invent anything, so there will be no inventions, is the kind of logic they employ. The flaw in it is that there WILL be inventions, with total regularity throughout history, even in the least enlightened corners of the world, bright sparks have risen which manage to spread influence far beyond their numbers. Interesting ideas, interesting philosophies, interesting inventions can all pass into popular use as long as we don't deny their existence or usefulness. Yes, most people never come up with them, but who cares? Most people will never write a song but most people want to listen to music. That's not parasitic or hierarchical or anything negative like that, it's purely a reflection of the rarity of good ideas and talent.In the film, most of the town is animal-like, so the entire town is animal-like. Most of the outsiders are violent gangsters, so all outsiders are violent gangsters. But that's never ever true in real life, there are always exceptions, always freaks, and it's often these freaks who see their society's problems and ways to deal with them.Slavery was once proclaimed a completely indestructible evil, but it was (mostly) abolished, because certain people dared to take a more optimistic approach to life and follow it through.The characters in Dogville are clearly symbols of various groups or philosophies, but nowhere is there a symbol of moderation, nowhere is there a character who does not harm anyone. Go anywhere in real life and you'll see these people exist, but because they're not killing or raping anyone, because they're not interesting dramatically, they never get mentioned in Dogville. The two characters even vaguely near the centre ground, Tom and Grace, both end up doing something very nasty to each other and reveal their true mercenary characters when they feel threatened. Not only does Lars Von Trier inevitably kill off almost all the main characters (this is an art film after all, can't have optimism here), he also thoroughly assassinates their characters.Are absolutely all people like this? No. Does Lars Von Trier care? No.He wants to paint a picture easily, he wants us to believe the majority represents the entirety. Figureheads become a substitute for populations, individuals simply become part of a greater whole with no value in themselves. The fact that nations and movements can wink into and out of existence, or merge and split, seems ignored in this kind of world view. One exceptional person is always insignificant, essentially, because they're in such a small minority.But this can never be the case because it is often from some unnoticed minority or unlikely individual that real advancement (moral, political and technical) comes. As long as an individual can make a difference, it's factually incorrect to say they're insignificant. Ignore them at your intellectual (and physical) peril.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a rule I want people to remember, Art-house movies are art-house movies because they don't appeal to everyone. A movie that one person loves might be hated by someone else.Dogville is a movie that will appeal to a small group of people, but generally speaking it was a disappointed, overlong and too simple a movie to really be considered worth it.The great analysis of the American dream, a woman stumbles into a small town fleeing gangsters. She is taken in reluctantly and while the town initially warms to her they later exploit and reject her.It could have been interesting especially with the high standard of acting this movie contains, but for me it was a dreadful failure.The first problem was the use of stage type scenery in film. I have never scene a film that does this that works. I love the theater and I love to see this type of scenery and lighting in the cinema, but on screen it looks dull and cheap.But because the director never really believed in this technique he decided to spice up the shots by using the classic NYPD Blue jerky camera to give it a documentary look. Separate both techniques are bad, combined it is terrible.Most importantly it can either overwhelm or under support the great acting in this movie.These are only minor points. The characters are overly simplistic and most reflect a single shifting view point, rather than reflecting a diversity of responses. It is like the script writer only had one weak idea and decided to put it into several characters to try and convince people it was a strong idea.The story is too long and takes too long to get anywhere to make the half a point that is contained in this film.An interesting effort, worth checking out, and loved by some, but probably should be avoided by anyone with half a brain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to America!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The race riots of the early 90's startled the majority of Americans. Why should citizens of such a great democracy want to destroy it? However, what I personally found surprising about the whole situation was the aftermath of the violence, and how nearly all the commentators failed to realize that implicit racism was at the heart of the problem, and while the American Dream may be open to some, to most it will remain just that, a dream. Put simply, if you marginalize and exploit a minority, should you be surprised if it begins to feel disenfranchised, and acts accordingly? The narrative style of Dogville is like a storybook, with dry observations from the commentator. It's very reminiscent of Animal Farm too. What Orwell did for the USSR, Von Trier does for the USA. But whereas Animal Farm is all about the exploitation of the worker, Dogville is about the exploitation of the minorities that make up the underclass in America. Which, of course, is what Grace (Nicole Kidman)and her increasing oppression at the hands of the Americans represents. As a political allegory, you can't pay Dogville any higher compliment than a comparison with Orwell. Although Orwell was primarily a political writer, you never feel you are being preached to in his novels. And you get the same feeling with Dogville too. It's only with the 'subtle change in light' when Grace finally sees what a rotten place Dogville is and allows her Godlike father(James Caan)to act accordingly.It's interesting that it takes a Scandinavian to see America for what it has been, and to some extent, still is. Perhaps this film is the powerful wake up call America needs. Perhaps the next time there's a 'subtle change in light' there will be a similar change in political thinking and institutions. And the use of Bowie's Young Americans in the closing titles, to pictures of the oppressed through America's recent history, clarifies the point that no matter how bad things are, even during the Great Depression, there is no excuse for exploitation. This film should be compulsory viewing for schoolchildren everywhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville is unpleasant but then again Pleasantville in art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yo, Dog! You might agree or disagree on my insights for the film "Dogville". However, one thing is for certain that the "Dogville" framework will be unparalleled by other films this year. Not so much for its positive attributes but more related to its architectural design. "Dogville" stars Nicole Kidman as Grace, a desperate fugitive who inhabits the small rural town of "Dogville" for immunity. Paul Bettany co-stars as Tom Edison, the complaisant Dogville resident who takes in Grace and eventually falls for her. Their performances were superb in their own unruffled approach. Kidman as Grace was the saving grace of "Dogville", and Bettany as Edison lit it up. Initially, the residents of Dogville were somehow reluctant in welcoming Grace. They feared she might be a disgrace to their town. They eventually do utilize her for labor, care-taking, companionship, and guidance. Things do get a little "doggy-poo" when police inquiries cause the Dogvillers to be more suspicious of Grace, and the Doggies inevitably dog Grace in devious ways. The men rape her (obviously doggy style), the women humiliate her, and the children ruse her. Chloe Sevigny, Lauren Bacall, Ben Gazzara, Stellan Skarsgard, Phillip Baker Hall, and Patricia Clarkson execute doggoned ravaging performances as the community-orientated Dogville residents. Director Lars von Trier constructs the town of "Dogville" in a stage design reminiscent of a play instead of the more formulaic film field setting. Von Trier's dissenting messages about small-town America can be controversial but then again it is a frightening reality. Von Trier's "trier by error" directorial approach always pushes the envelope, but it should be commended for its valiancy. He is the antithesis of the feel-good director because the thesis of his films deal with: deprivation, desperation, and humiliation. I do warn you that "Dogville" runs for 179 minutes, which can take a good chunk of your dog day afternoon. To keep on describing the numerous theories of "Dogville" would be an exercise in futility. Nevertheless, "Dogville" does take a bite out of hospitable small-town America. **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville, the most stirring movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I once saw Trier being interviewed by one of the most lovable and humoristic journalists in Denmark. Trier, however, appeared very hostile and unsympathetic, but at the same time brutally honest. He seems to be a person who don't try to please you, and he always has this kind of devilish smile on his face, which indicates, that you're in for some more teasing and provocation.To me Dogville reflects Triers opinion on human nature. There is no difference to the human being whether you're living in America or any other country in the world. Under the same circumstances people react in the same way, and history repeats itself. It's a shame, that so many people, only see this movie as a plot against the USA. However, I do acknowledge the fact, that a genius film director from a country that is so overwhelmed by the American culture and who has no power in worldwide politics, sees a chance to knock off America from it's pedestal. And in my opinion he is entitled to, because at the same time he has made a movie that disturbed and questioned my view on myself as a member of the human race. I was both horrified and amazed to discover that even though you feel for the character Grace, you know, that had you lived among those people, you would have been just as cruel and evil to this vulnerable person.It's not that I haven't thought about this before, but Trier truly made me realize, so deep that I felt it in my gut for days: We all have it in us. Perhaps Trier want to make us aware of the fact that we all hold evil as well as goodness, and maybe this will be the first step to control it......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Lars von Trier wrote and directed this fascinating study of human nature. With the feel of community theatre, we witness how even the best intentioned "good people" can quickly assimilate to taking advantage of another person's weakness. Paul Bettany ("A Beautiful Mind") and Nicole Kidman are both outstanding in their lead roles. Kidman has truly developed into the Meryl Streep of her generation - and I don't say that lightly. "Moulin Rouge", "The Hours", "Cold Mountain" and "Dogville" are 4 sterling performances that will stand the test of time. As great as the leads are, the rest of the cast is every bit their equal. How wonderful to see Ben Gazzara and Lauren Bacall (almost 80 years old!) each steal their scenes. The always terrific Patricia Clarkson continues her string of perfect performances ("Pieces of April","The Station Agent" "Far from Heaven") and there are just too many others to name, but trust me, you will recognize most faces and be touched by the amazing performances. The basic stage set allows us to really concentrate on the character of the characters and feel their pain and experience their changes. I truly LOVED the ending, but do not let anyone tell you much about the story before you see it. You must go through the process with this story to gain the full effect. This is an art house film so don't expect "Raiders of the Lost Ark" or any other special effects. The music, score and lighting combined with the exceptional performances are all the mood and setting this one needs.</fullReview>

Nicole Kidman does a good job, but it isn't sensational. The setup is somewhat interesting at first, but the pace is too slow and after awhile I was hoping for something to happen, a new scenery, something.

		<fullReview>As a stage play 'Dogville' might have more impact; however, as a movie it fails to deliver a coherent narrative despite its political ambitions and Sadeian big finish. Despite its dramatic allusions to Berthold Brecht and Peter Weiss "The Persecution and Assassination of Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade', the storyline for Dogville is a predictable, misogynist polemic against America's post 9/11 Neo-Macarthyite paranoia. While the acting performances are solid, and in some cases inspired (this may be Nicole Kidman's best performance to date), the pace of the filming and editing is so slow that for the most part the film is tedious in the extreme. On stage one would feel the immediacy of the actors' performances and therefore be more engaged by the intellectual ambitions of the piece; however, on screen the words seem as if they were written with lead not ink. As a result, 'Dogville' like Tom its protagonist fails politically and artistically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film appears to have been made purely to elicit all of the right responses from self-important critics, and fails completely to actually deliver a film worth watching.*POTENTIAL SPOILERS FOLLOW*All of the right ingredients are there - the idea and the cast is very good. Unfortunately it is bogged down by a turgid and tedious script which tends to cause laughter at inappropriate times due to the appalling dialogue - at times I felt like I was watching outtakes from "Waiting For Guffman". The narration is probably the most ghastly aspect of it, as it fails to add anything apart from droll exposition. The voice-over during the 'porcelain-smashing' scene was simply an insult to all screenwriting.Added to this terrible script is abysmal direction - the jerky camera work and dreadful edits are useful in a tense psychological script, but using it during an inane "I love you - well I love you too" scene was just embarassing. The purpose of a cut mid-sentence during a Kidman monologue eludes me completely. I'm a big fan of technical devices, but only as long as they serve the story. Here it reeked of "look at me - I'm being radical!"While I can see the parable aspect, the drastic transition from "town full of lovely simple close-knit people" to "town full of lying, raping, sado-masochistic psychopaths" was way too extreme and hence just rendered the whole scenario as absurd. This film could have been very good - it was a story worth telling and it featured a cast that were more than capable of telling it. But the dreadful and pretentious direction and appalling script ruined it. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof That There is a Reason for Traditional Aesthetics.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Grace Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) is on the run from the mob in the Rocky Mountains. When she stumbles upon the tiny village of Dogville, a town of fifteen, she seeks refuge among its citizens. The town, however, is skeptical of harboring a stranger. In an attempt to win them over, she visits with each citizen every day and does whatever chores they have for her. This campaign succeeds and she is accepted by the people of Dogville. When the police start looking her, however, and wanted posters start showing up, the secret of Grace's presence weighs heavily on the townspeople, who begin to lash out at her."Dogville" is an obviously experimental film, radically abandoning tradition Western film aesthetics in favor of minimalistic, theatrical ones. The film is shot entirely on a bare sound stage. Instead of physical buildings or landscapes (trees, bushes, etc...), everything is chalked out and labelled on the ground like a to-scale architect's blueprint. The four walls of the sound stage are stark white during day scenes and muted black during night scenes. There is no non-diegetic sound (such as background music), save for the fact that the film is narrated by voice-over (John Hurt). Furthermore, the film features jarringly non-traditional editing, in which cuts are unexpectedly rapid and characters - without any indication - have changed location between shots (such as a sitting character unexpectedly moving to a standing position since the last shot they were in).I will admit that I am in the critical minority when it comes to "Dogville." Despite a solid story, capable acting (particularly from Nicole Kidman, Stellan Skarsgard and Paul Bettany) and a few brilliant moments (particularly when Grace is raped by Chuck behind closed doors, which in Dogville is in plain sight of the entire town), the film is ultimately a failure. The total abandonment of traditional, Western film aesthetics, while an interesting directorial decision, was ultimately damaging to the film's overall presentation. In fact, many of those consciously neglected aesthetics (realistic sets, realistic lighting, realistic landscape, non-diegetic music, smooth Hollywood-esque editing) would have greatly amplified the film's quality. The lighting, in particular, did little more than hurt my eyes from constant exposure to it over the course of the film."Dogville" is not nearly as interesting as the inevitable discussions that it will spawn. Fans of non-traditional cinema (which is to say non-mainstream cinema) will love this film. Film students should see this film for its radical departures from traditional aesthetics. Other than that, however, I fail to see this film garnering a large or even moderately-sized following.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoughts on Grace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the movie progressed my attitude towards Grace changed as well. At first I was a little skeptical of her, but then I saw she was both sweet and sensible for helping the other villagers for their risk of hiding her. As the villagers took advantage of her more and more (raping her, accusing and framing her, alienating her, abusing her), I wasn't only becoming disgusted at the villagers, but I was becoming frustrated and incredulous of how forgiving and "nice" she was. I know she had faith and forgiveness for people, but honestly, what was her limit? Did she even have one? Or would she just stand by until someone got so jealous or angry that they killed her as easily as they raped her? I kept thinking she should just defend herself, for Tom or anyone else wasn't going to.When the cars came, I wanted the villagers to get some sort of punishment and retribution. I wanted Grace to stand up for herself. I know other people watching wanted that as well. The ending, however, which consisted of everything burning and everyone being shot, was definitely not the type of punishment I had wanted for the villagers. I was shocked at how suddenly she changed and let power consume her and how quickly her whole personality and philosophy of faith and forgiveness just snapped. In the end I guess it made sense. She realized her limit when her dad talked with her, and she just snapped. I was proud and appalled at her by the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville is hard to care about. (Spoilers, maybe?) Despite a deeply empathetic performance from Nicole Kidman, I had no idea what von Trier was after. He brutalizes an actress, exposes the duplicitous, greedy underbelly of a town of small-minded inbreds (that not-so-clearly symbolizes 'Capitalism Run Amok = Slavery!'), then condemns his entire universe of characters ? those who survive, anyway ? to a future of amoral hopelessness.His version of America? Who cares. All of this is surrounded by John Hurt's extraneous, should-have-been-deleted narration, which again and again tells us 'what's really happening' but never 'really' does. Other distancing (Brechtian) techniques abound: i.e., a marvelous town 'setting' which forces the audience to imagine time and space, yet the set is poorly, monotonously photographed, and ends up meaning nothing: we would have concentrated on these actors' faces regardless of the abstraction surrounding them. Re: the camera work: The famous 'Kubrick pullback' is used again and again, yet no von Trier pullback reveals any hidden truth or meaning at any given moment. So?. von Trier is no Bertholt Brecht and certainly no Stanley Kubrick, but neither is he Friedrich Dürrenmat, whose plot of 'The Visit' Dogville is clearly lifted from. But there's no harm in derivation if cleverly done. Unfortunately, von Trier mires himself and us in murky political euro-symbolism that fails to illuminate his plot. There's a nifty revenge twist at the end, but it seems to have nothing to do with what's come before. Dogville may be disturbing and memorable, but it's a sophomoric effort at best. I'll watch von Trier in the future, but he's never been better than 'Zentropa (Europa)' ? and that was a long time ago. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicole gives 'Dogville' its name...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not, and despite this mostly negative review, that is one of the more positive things I have to say about this movie. The story is divided into nine parts (and a prologue) which are each followed by a (too) detailed sentence which explains what major event will happen at that section of the story. Then you have to sit through a depiction of what you were just told, which is the equivalent of reading a review by Ebert before seeing a movie (pointless). The narrator sounds like one of those book-on-tape voices and he talks through nearly the whole three hours. I generally didn't have a problem with the overuse of the narrator (because of the lack of props, he is needed to explain important details like how plump the gooseberry bushes are, etc.) but when he has to describe the emotions of the actors on screen, there is something wrong... In fact, the actors' dialogue is so awkward at times, I wouldn't be surprised if the whole movie was ad-libbed as they went along (this one speech about arrogance goes on for like five minutes). Because of the absence of details in the background, the narrator's voice creates the disturbing impression that you were watching a (more adult) version of 'Winnie the Pooh' (giant letters on the ground with names like The Old Lady's Bench don't help either). The digital camera work is horrible, especially as it swoops back and forth in a blur at the 19th town meeting (at least it felt like that many) to show the reactions of the town people (usually bored, what a surprise!). OK, this kind of minimalist movie making has never been done to this extent before (and now we know why), let's never do it again, Lars (I'm referring to 'Mandalay'). How do I explain the movie's place in the Top 250 (currently #100)? I figure people who didn't see it gave it a 10 because it was by the guy who did 'Dancer in the Dark' (although I know that a lot of people didn't like that movie either, so now I'm really confused...). Yes, I wasn't the only one who was floored (pun intended) by the final image of the 'true' Dogville, but did it need to take three hours to reach that conclusion?</fullReview>

You hate all the towns people and you get a small thrill out of watching them die, but it is not enough. Everyone in the film sucks and it leaves you with an overall feeling of disappointment with the human race. The camera work makes you nauseated because it is so unsteady and choppy between shots. The rapes add to the nausea one already feels, making this movie even more intolerable. The only redeeming quality was the last chapter in which the movie ends. I wouldn't subject my enemies to this movie, I would rather shoot them in the head. This movie is not deserve did not deserve a "st..." let alone a "star".

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this one. The whole film, shot in one studio with minimal props and set decoration, sounded like a fantastic, experimental idea, but turned out a great disappointment. All through the film (wich is way, way to long - and I love long films, if anyone...) there is an obviousness to everything, and a taste of nothingness (imagine eating chocolate with the taste of nothing). You can feel what direction the plot is going and nothing surprises you, even the least. A note on the style of shooting, the so called dogma-style, is in my opinion not suited for full-length-projects. It's visual style has a feeling of unprofessional-ism over it, especially when it's constantly shot with a vibrating camera. I have seen work done in the HDV-format and there is nothing wrong with that, but Von Trier f**ks it up. In my opinion, he is just lazy and cheap.In short, Von Trier is the arrogant one (and all his work has a grown more and more pretentious and uninteresting), and it shines through the entire project. Mostly i felt bored, and like I threw away almost 3 hours of my life on this dung.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AKA - 3 Hours in Which Lars Von Trier Loses His Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being an admirer of Lars Von Trier's past work, I will be generous and say that maybe Dogville warrants multiple viewing in order to be fully appreciated and understood. But how on earth could anyone be expected to endure this film more than once?Dogville is a long-winded, heavy handed and puzzling. The sarcastic voice over becomes quickly annoying, as does the pared down theatrical set, the stilted dialogue and robotic acting. Nicole Kidman is completely ineffective and the conversation between her and James Caan in the car had to be one of the most badly acted pieces of drudgery that I've seen in some time. Arrogance, forgiveness and human nature are among the big concepts explored but what the real point is is quite difficult to discern. Von Trier's suffering female martyr theme is wearing a little thin. In both Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark the heroines are given to saint like sacrifice. We go even further here with the character of Grace being some kind of representation of God.The best thing about Dogville is Paul Bettany's performance. The worst thing about Dogville everything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pseudo-intellectual trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie is like eating a bread as its separate ingredients before they are mixed or baked. It's only because the director's name is Trier that he can get away with this. Making a movie in a studio without a set may be a different idea, but it's not a good one. Intellectually refreshing, perhaps, but very boring, and the whole thing drags out for too long time. The actors don't seem comfortable doing this either, and the dialogue and acting have an artificial 'feel' throughout. As for the plot, it's nothing special at all. Throughout the movie, I waited for something to make it a worthwhile exercise, and for a long time after having seen it, I continued searching for that 'yes, got the idea!' feeling, but it never came. To be fair, I avoided posting an opinion for several months. But it's the Emperor's New Clothes (which is written by a Dane, Hans Christian Andersen - Trier is Danish too). Trier is not stupid and he must have had a purpose making this. I can see two potential purposes: 1. The irony of the Emperor's New Clothes also being written by a Dane. 2. Trier being amused by pseudo-intellectuals praising this trash to the sky, well knowing that it really isn't good, and waiting to see if people can figure out the Emperor's New Clothes connection.</fullReview>

The town starts to be rude to her,and some strange psycho kid wants to be spanked by her.Next every man in town rapes her,even the old blind man.And to cap it off they chain her to a tire with a bell and break all of her belongings.All she had to do was speak out or go back down the hill,because the problems with her father were nothing compared to being raped multible times and physically abused.Its just stupid,he should have called it "Jewish Women Goes to Naziville" Watch Dancer In The Dark same movie except with Bjork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is me reviewing one of my first movies ever on IMDb and am glad it's Dogville I put myself on the task of analyzing. It has so much to offer, with a 170 min or so running time and an almost Theater- Movie juxtaposition it's quite a humongous task to keep the audiences engaged through out. Dogville is not really a movie rather it'a design, design that unravels slowly and gradually. It takes us on a journey which exposes human frailties and how difficult it is for us to come face to face with our own weakness.This movie epitomizes the fact that even today, after we have achieved such ethereal feat in movie making techniques and visual styles and effects, the true essence of film making lies in the SCRIPT. The one thing that makes you sit there and watch this film without even a moment of ennui is the Script. It takes you on an emotional ride, where at one point you are sympathetic with Grace and at the other angry with how "arrogant" she is or how perfect.Here we embark ourselves on a journey of how the residents of Dogville (which is metaphorical really) the law-abiding, socially and morally correct people acquiesce a mysterious girl in their lives. This gives a budding writer and a morally ideal man to turn her into one of his Guinea Pigs, so as to dig deep into the soul of his town folks. To begin with she turns out to be a gift in disguise, helpful, sympathetic and a nice change from their routines.Now, the flip side, slowly and gradually as they get used to her, as she becomes a part and parcel of their daily chorus they take her for granted and that's when they are most dominating. It's quite true of how humans can show their true colors if they don't have anything to account for and that's when the story gets darker and scarier. Mind you there are no ghosts here , its just humans who are afraid to confront their inner demons. Humans who would prefer extinguishing the very light revealing their blotches instead of addressing their own pandemonium state. The movie is a critical commentary on human psychic and the moral standards being faked. If you can sit through the first three chapters, its quite a ride you would be in for. It's a brave attempt and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville was filmed in a studio with a set that most of the time looks like the players are standing on a school blackboard with definition lines in chalk. Although this film is set in a small town in America it could have been any town, anywhere in the world; as I believe that the emphasis is on the dark side of human nature and not any form of critique on the American 'way-of-life'.On the run from a group of gangsters, Grace (Nicole Kidman) arrives in the small mining town, the townsfolk take her in and make a deal with her; if she will work for them for nothing, they will offer her sanctuary. Grace agrees to the terms and meets the locals; however their demands are ever increasing...Lauren Bacall and the rest of the cast give good performances but Nicole Kidman excels herself, in this, what I believe to be one of her best. The narration by John Hurt is captivating.A must see for Art House and Lars Von Trier fans, or like me; just lecherously watching the svelte Nicole Kidman swan about the screen...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lars Von Trier has a tendency of showing critics at their most embarrassing. His films retrieve mixed opinions, shamed by some, adored by few. This says more about critics than the quality of Von Trier's works, because what film critics apparently don't understand is that Von Trier's films must be seen as works of art, more so than classic storytelling. Dogville tells a fascinating (and terrifying) plot, centred on the ancient Greek philosophical question: "Is man capable of being good?" To illustrate and investigate this banal, skinless question, Von Trier creates a banal, skinless scene. No walls to fog the people of the landscape, only what's relevant is shown: The people. Throughout it's 178 minutes playtime, Dogville takes the viewer through disappointments, agony, greed and grief, only to erupt in the most beautifully satisfying ending a movie has ever shown. I'm not implying that that "other films" aren't art. I'm not implying that all critics are incompetent. I'm encouraging sceptics of Von Trier, and this film in particular, to try and watch this as art with a shining moral, more so than just a story. There are a couple of contenders, but i wouldn't feel bad calling this the best film i've ever seen. Now, this is of course the tip of subjective but if anyone denied the films genius, i wouldn't hesitate calling them ignorant. Anyone may dislike it, but denying its genius is ignorant. asked me to suggest a film, whether good, great or astonishing, i would probably pick this one.In short, hopefully you'll enjoy this film. Even if not, at least it may spawn some debate in the living room...</fullReview>

Suddenly arrives Grace who is running from some gangsters, the town gives her shelter in return for favors and appear pleasance and then? You have to see it, the tension builds and builds and leads to the best ending I ever saw in a movie, just because the character development made me clench my fists..Lars Von Trier uses a lot of symbols and throws questions right at your face while keeping the story rolling at good pace.There are no ceilings, no walls, but the doors open, you have to see it to be fascinated by such a bold attempt, many people complain this movie to be anti-American but don't American make European satires, I request everyone to see the movie with an open mind..Regarding the acting, though from a movie which assembles Nicole Kidman, Stellan Skarsgard, Paul Bettany, Lauran Bacall, Patricia Clarkson, James Caan and many others would be thought as a typical emotional Drama, but von Trier doesn't demand much from his characters except from Nicole Kidman who was outstanding for her portrayal of Grace..If you have patience for movies with plot development but with rewarding outcome, no one should miss this Masterpiece..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Picture of a small North American town.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been trying for several years to find something that eclipses this film in honesty, wit, intelligence, drama, and tragedy. To date, nothing really quite achieves the kind of ethical brutality that Dogville does.Having spent much of my life in rural North Dakota, I feel that I'm qualified to state that this film accurately describes life in a small North American town. These are places where passive-aggression is a way of life. This community functions because everyone knows the weaknesses of everyone else, but no one says anything for fear of being damaged themselves. In a place like this, the only power one can have over another is information (read: dirt). This power can only be exercised through proverbial blackmail, something that passive-aggression thrives upon.When a stranger enters this community, they become the focal point of the entire community's passive-rage. In an attempt to appease this rage, the newcomer (Grace, an appropriate name) volunteers all of her weaknesses to the town in exchange for safety. Rightfully, the town asks for some sort of compensation, and Grace becomes a sort of public servant. At this point, everything appears to be going well. As the case with anything "public", everyone wants more than anyone else, and the tug of war begins.With the mention of "each giving according to their ability" regarding Grace's payment (does anyone remember Atlas Shrugged?), the story becomes the prelude to something very sinister. From there, it doesn't get better.It is not my intent offer a complete explication of this cinematic wonder, merely to give a gentle nudge in one of the directions that the story goes. If you like this film, a nice companion to follow it is Manderlay (which is somewhat close to a sequel).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film does re-define the craft of film-making in a way but I found it really tough to sit through it completely. In fact I haven't got through the first 20 minutes in my few attempts of watching it till now. Dogville is a film that is completely enacted out on stage just like a play. The movie begins, the characters, places etc are introduced but I can't feel a thing. Nothing seemed real because everything is happening on a stage. However much I tried to persuade myself to watch it I couldn't connect with it at all. I know Lars Von Trier makes his movies that in some way or the other shake the insides of the audience (I've seen Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the dark and I doubt there are many film-makers who can not only make the audience feel the pain of the characters but also carry it with them long after the movie is over. Its like - if I want to depict how much pain one can undergo I might as well go the whole way to show it. In fact more. It's torture in a way). But Dogville in a way is making me question my interpretation of what a movie is; or rather should be. This is a remarkable achievement on the part of the film-maker, but does it work with the audience? Not so, at least in my case. But I am so surprised that so many people have embraced the film so willingly. As for me, I guess I should watch it sometime.</fullReview>

It's a film in which everyone has their very own share of guilt in the EXERCISE OF ABSOLUTE POWER, including the 'innocent infant', the 'crippled, helpless girl' and the apparent victim (or 'martyr' as some preferred) ... in Dogville, innocence and good intentions are nothing but thin layers of face powder meant to hide your true self.This is not a film with the slightest intention of being a study about human nature ... it's about the many levels related to the EXERCISE OF ABSOLUTE POWER ... be it personal, communal or encompassing an entire society, culture or mankind. According to the film, as to what concerns human nature ... given the right conditions, it's damn rotten (to which, in sight of personal previous and present experiences, I totally agree) - but don't get me wrong - I'm quite aware (also based in my personal life events), as Trier surely is, that human kind is capable of the most undeniable evil and greedy acts in the world ... just as it's gifted with a spirit of compassion, tolerance and general good will ... otherwise we would have undergone a self-destruction process thousands of years before our present times. For not so obvious reasons, such point of view has been understood either as misanthropy or as Lars' inherent 'early age acquired anti-Americanism'. I've never heard of an anti-American Dane ... but whatever, we are living in a very strange era ... and since we, as a nation, are above judgemental procedures, I hope his 'early age acquired anti-Americanism' is used as a valid argument to invade Denmark ... who knows, maybe he's keeping some of Saddam's WMDs hidden in his tailor made trailer ... maybe it's there where Osama has been hiding all the time ... we must check and see ... I'm volunteering.Now I ask you, are we, American citizens, 'xenophobic, mobbish and brutal' ?!!! ... of course we are ... as most immigrants have painfully learned, the famous inscription in Elis Island has little more then face value ... we all know that this beautiful country of ours is filled with people from Poland, Germany, Africa, Russia, Ireland, Latin America, India, Middle East, China, Vietnam and who knows what else ... obviously, for all these nationalities, and many others, there is an offensive term to characterize them ... which have been avoided by this humble reviewer in conformance to IMDb's automatic censorship. According to Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo we're 'idle and brutal' ... and according to some other war prisoner facility in Iraq, so are the British ... our 'vague wars' in the Middle East. And we must not forget that we, self-acclaimed liberators of the world in WW2, back in those old days of fame and glory were still allowing the KKK to do whatever it felt the need to be done. Must I remind you that this great country of ours, based on the First Amendment, condones racism and racial 'hate-mongering' ?!!! With Dogville, Trier forced us to take a good look at the mirror ... and none of us liked what we saw ... some of us preferred to fight against the mirror and took the easier way accusing the Danish director of being an anti-American ... some of us are still thinking about what they have seen. But hot-dogs, we are proud Americans ... that's how we are ... totally averse to criticism. We are almost perfect ... 'and there's so little to do'. Must I remind you that, instead of Italy, our country is where Mafia gangsters achieved cinematic glamor ?!!! In corroboration of this 'mirror theory' of mine I would like to highlight the strange contempt a certain reviewer felt in relation to Jacob's Holdt's photos shown at the end of the film ... I remember, in college, browsing his book, American Pictures ... the impoverished, the 'dirty-faced children' and 'drunkards' he photographed are the Americans we willingly have chosen to obliterate. One more thing, Dogville has been misleadingly accused of being like 'televised theater of the 50s'or even of being something like 'a staged play' ... such claims are pure nonsense ... it's cinematic to the core ... Trier just undressed it.Finally, I would like to make a demand to IMDb's administrators and page editors. If you take a look at Lars Von Trier biography you'll notice the sentence 'Has never visited the US' ... so, based in this little piece of useless trivia, I demand either its removal or the addition of this very same sentence in the biography of all movie directors, actors and script writers who have never 'visited the US'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Von Trier's most problematic and masterful cinematic allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Shirley Jackson's classic short story, `The Lottery,' a seemingly benign town is gradually revealed on a festive day to be renewing its annual stoning of a townsperson selected at random. With characteristic understatement, Jackson states that `the whole lottery took less than two hours, so it could begin at ten o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for the noon dinner.' Lars von Trier's (`Breaking the Waves,' `Dancer in the Dark') `Dogville' evokes a similar ironic sweetness and malevolence, his most problematic and masterful cinematic allegory.`Problematic' because the allegory is multileveled with no pat interpretations, and it is almost 3 hours of slow-paced, stylized setting and dialogue. That `Dogville' is unlike any other film in this century should satisfy the cinephiles looking for a unique and challenging experience. I am moved by it; I will never forget it.Because Jackson's masterpiece explores the underbelly of communal America, Thornton Wilder's play, `Our Town, ' is remembered better for its optimistic view of life in America. Undoubtedly many see `Dogville' as the antithesis of that play. But both have the all-wise narrator and stilted speech to tip off the audiences to the allegorical underpinning. In Wilder the simple life is affirmed; in von Trier life is dominated by original sin (apples abound), fertility rites, and the almost admirable control of gangsters in America's Depression Era.`Dogville' depicts the arrival of a gang-related beauty (Nicole Kidman) to the town of 15 people. Like Flannery O'Connor's outsider, the displaced person, she changes things, first with her industriousness and then with her revenge. The town itself turns into a gangster mob capable of rape and slavery. The possible correlation with contemporary America in Iraq and elsewhere is not a stretch-there is the destructiveness of rabid ideology and groupthink. In the end, the powerful force of Darwinian survival with `nature red in tooth and claw' satisfies me that von Trier is channeling humanity, not just America.Von Trier's stripped down set and dialogue give the thoughtful viewer a chance to ruminate about the possible levels of meaning rather than marvel at the great American FX. Another challenging film has arrived at the same time: `Kitchen Stories' has von Trier as script consultant. The characteristic minimalism of a Dogma founder is there as well as the dry irony.For those complaining the director who criticizes America has never been there (he also set `Dancer' in the U.S.), remember Stephen Crane (`Red Badge of Courage') never went to war. Human nature these artists do know, regardless of their travels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nightmare On Elm Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The master of deep symbolism, Lars Von Trier, never betrayed to his proprietary style. Every his work ? is a thoughtful and subtle concentration of morality's ideas, principles, manifestations of human nature. Each movie of LVT can be cut out into many pieces and consider each separately, explore, analyze, discuss, learn. And you can just understand that fact, that Von Trier's movies ? are grandiose cinematographic paintings, touching upon a range of philosophical questions and surveys, written in a unique style with the help of a profound acting.«Dogville» - is shockingly aesthetic product with deliberate asceticism in the narrative, with the multifaceted semantic loading and deep expressed symbolics. The Author, without false scruple, literally turns inside out the conceptions of morality, good and evil, justice and freedom. All these conceptions coexist in each of the Dogville's characters so distorted and bitty way, that those initial personality's manifestations of each not only aren't true, but, turns out, are its complete antithesis.«Dogville» makes you think about a lot of things: about the nature of good and evil, about the true purpose of sacrifice. This movie uncovers America: it's far from wonderful and carefree world, where all dreams come true, it's a world, absorbed by a Great Depression, where people have lost their ideals, and the reason for this ? irrepressible lust for power. The temptation of power - is one of the leitmotifs of the film. The person, having felt even the slightest superiority over others, feeding his self-esteem, seeks to suppress all who even a little weaker than he. The director gives us food for thought every time, showing that there's a limit to everything.The ascetic minimalism in scenery is used by the director not as an original move. This is not a creative lugs. It's a deliberate art outline for this story. The absence of traditional decorations, half- empty hangar with layout on the floor instead of houses, atmosphere's theatricality only at first sight arise sensation of closed and artificial space. In fact, this is a very precise godsend, with the help of which, firstly, director presents the story as a parable, demonstrating the story as an example only one of the many abstract fantastic stories. Secondly, this method perfectly reveals structure of the city, where everyone's life passes in full view of others and, it would seem, it's impossible to hide anything. It just and awfully! Everyone knows the secrets of each of the neighbors, everybody see everything, that is happening in every family, and all they are strikingly similar to each other. And, thirdly, the absence of a familiar scenery does not distract the audience's attention from the main thing, and vice versa, concentrates it on every detail, that is a very important part of the whole plot twists.This movie is about the animal essence, that civilized man so thoroughly suppresses in himself. Dogvillers irradiate warmth and integrity. Their hospitality is towardly, because good will save the world. But the masks come off, and we see the true guise of these compassionate and friendly townsfolk. This is a bunch of hungry dogs, who are patiently waiting when somebody will throw a fresh bone to them. But the main question is put as the curtain fell of the picture. The owner showed up, and the victim, putting upon and tormented for months, finally found her freedom and unlimited power. This victim was full of nobility and forgiveness for a long time. She endured all the torments in the name of good, her ideals were unshakable. Her altruism bordered on egoism. And Grace understood that she was not all forgiving the savior, but the same person, thirsting for revenge, allowing to take shape of her desire to destroy all this miserable town of bottlers and nonentities. And she makes her revenge, reveling in the newly acquired power. She kept alive only a dog, being convinced, how mean and lightweight person in comparison with animals. But who is she now? The same animal. «Dogville» - it's not just a story, happening with a particular person, this is a movie of each of us, about behavior's psychology, about unfoldment of our true identity. This is a film about human cruelty and hatred. And how we can fight it, not to be tied to the chariot of our emotions and preserving human form, humbly accepting injustice and aggression from the side of others, no answer evil for evil. And the ending of the movie, just demonstrate to us the most primitive, almost animal way of resolving the problem. But, unfortunately, many of us elect it as an equitable and only right one. And each of us will independently choose the answer, of course, to very difficult question, which Lars Von Trier raise before us.</fullReview>

The strong survives, the faster comes first, more assertive one succeeds faster and so on. What else? These situations actually represent and answer to another question - why the good apples are eaten by pigs (this is the original poster of the film, showing the beautiful and seductive Nicole Kidman lying in a cart full of apples)? The entire film was shot on a set no larger than the size of a school football pitch. It presents a small district in the style of colonizing America, all lined with chalk in places where there are houses and streets. This effect allow the monitoring of each of the characters whole the time.

		<shortDescription>Dogville</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film stars Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany and James Caan among others. The entire film is set on an actual stage without any walls: the houses are marked with white chalk lines which are drawn on the floor with the house's names written within them. The film is divided into nine chapters with each chapter having its own title. There is also a narrator (John Hurt) who comments on the thoughts of the characters and on the things they say and/or do. This narrator makes the film seem a bit like a novel.The film Dogville tells the story about the fictional town of Dogville, which lies in the Rocky Mountains in the 'US of A'. Dogville has fifteen adult inhabitants and about four children who all appear to be normal and friendly. One day, a stranger ? a beautiful woman named Grace ? arrives. She is a fugitive who is hiding from the mafia. The villagers decide to let her stay. In return, Grace helps them by doing odd jobs for a small wage, like cleaning and babysitting. Grace is a very friendly woman and she tries very hard to gain the villagers' trust. At first, the villagers act tolerant and distant toward her, but eventually Grace manages to befriend most of them. However, as Grace's stay in Dogville prolongs itself, Dogville starts to bare its teeth. Grace, on the other hand, has a secret of her own, a secret which may cause Dogville to wish they had never turned against her.The film starts with a bird's eye view of Dogville. Before we watched the film, we did not know about the 'simple' setting and we were therefore quite surprised by it. Even though there are no visible walls, the houses, with very little furniture, are described as 'wretched, more like shacks' by the narrator. The doors are not visible either, but when people walk in or out of a house, the sound of a door opening or closing is heard. This fits the movements of the characters, who pretend they open or close an actual door. However, as there is clearly no door, we cannot find these movements and sounds anything but unrealistic and ludicrous. Moses, the dog which Dogville was probably named after, is another unrealistic part of the setting. It is only a drawing (drawn with chalk, of course) of a dog with the word 'dog' written under it. Despite this drawing's inability to move or even live, barking can be heard at the beginning and at the end of the film. The drawing also transforms into a real dog during the final shot of the film, though we cannot see the meaning and/or need for this change.The costumes of the actors are old-fashioned, which is a good thing because it clearly shows that the story is set in the past and not in modern days. The lighting in the film is another slightly more realistic aspect of the setting because there is an obvious difference in light between night and day. The visibility of the weather is mostly left to the imagination ? with the exception of one scene in which the town is covered by a layer of snow - but it is described by the narrator. For example, the narrator says: 'it was a cold, rainy night', but there is no rain on the set: one is supposed to imagine it.The setting is an essential part of a film but in this case ridiculous: the chalk lines and written words definitely do not come off as serious, yet the acting suggests otherwise. It is very convincing, but the setting simply ruins it. The sparsely furnished set is supposed to draw the viewer's attention to the characters, but these characters are not very pleasant to watch. First of all, they are very pretentious, at first acting like the innocent villagers who selflessly help out a complete stranger, but later on turning into rapists and/or backbiters who are, on top of that, just not interesting to watch without any realistic surroundings. A film consists of sounds and visuals: If the visuals of a film are not sufficient, it is not an enjoyable film to watch.As we mentioned earlier in this review, the narrator makes the film seem a bit like a novel. This has some positive sides as it clarifies the thoughts of the characters when these are not spoken out loud, but sometimes it is very irritating and illogical. The narrator may say for example: 'then she said: ' "this has to stop." ' Immediately after the narrator's words, the character involved speaks the words which have just been quoted by the narrator. This seems very pointless and illogical to us because hearing the words once is already more than enough. We could only respond to this sarcastically - any other response was simply impossible to us.We could not take this film seriously despite the convincing acting. If the plot had been used in a film with actual sets and more props it might have turned out okay. However, as we have stated before, the setting ruins the entire film. It failed to keep our attention focused by itself ? we only kept watching because we had to in order to write this review and hand it in as a school assignment ? and all it managed to do was annoy us. The chalk lines, the drawings, the fake door sounds, the very, very long runtime of the film (close to three hours); all of these things and more prevented us from enjoying this film even a little bit. Many other reviews have stated that Dogville is a 'love it or hate it' type of film. As we have also found very positive reviews about this film, we agree, but if we had to choose between loving it or hating it, we would most definitely choose to hate it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something's Rotten in Dogville</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "Dogville" is told in nine chapters and a prologue, totaling about three hours. It is a "sad tale" about a typical small town "in the Rocky Mountains in the US of A," according to the significantly British narrator John Hurt. The sets are done in the sparse style of Thornton Wilder's stage play "Our Town". The town's buildings are simply drawn as chalk shapes on a giant board. Props that are necessary are included, like a bench to sit on. But, most are left to your imagination. Paul Bettany (as Illuminating Tom Edison Jr.) is the most important character introduced in the story until? Movie-star beautiful Nicole Kidman (as Amazing Grace) arrives in town, apparently running way from gangsters. She needs a place to hide from the men chasing her, and the relatively isolated "Dogville" looks like good place to hide. The townspeople vote about helping Ms. Kidman hide from her pursuers. Mr. Bettany falls in love with Kidman, and is he her biggest supporter. Stellan Skarsgard (as Chuck) is hardest to convince, but he comes around. Bettany proposes Kidman pledge to work like a dog in each "Dogville" home. A "shocking revelation" occurs late in the film.Profoundly obvious, this would've worked as a Wilder-styled variation of "The Lottery" for PBS-TV, with a less wobbly-camera.*** Dogville (5/19/03) Lars von Trier ~ Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, John Hurt, Stellan Skarsgard</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is way too long, cramped, visually unexciting, brutal, disgusting, and has some awful dialog. The filmed-play thing gets old real fast, and then you're stuck with it. The Dogme shaky-cam and lunging zoom is a very weird juxtaposition with the artificial set, and is eerily reminiscent of a bad videotaping of an amateur play. The dialog frequently sucks. Nicole Kidman stumbles through the entire movie in a drugged stupor, only apparently reviving somewhat ten minutes from the end. The whole plot, such as it is, is flatly unbelievable, as are the characters. Perhaps the single worst element is the wretched, bombastic voice-over. Why, in the name of all that is holy, is this movie presided over by a smirking English accent? I like experimental movies, I sometimes like Lars, I sometimes like Dogme 95, and I frequently enjoy cruelty, sadism and violence, but this film was just really difficult to watch. At almost three hours, it seemed a deliberate assault on every normal concept of pacing. All in all, a sadistic experience to inflict on moviegoers. But. The brief dialog at the end, along with the climactic conclusion, somehow made it almost worth it. I guess Lars felt that we needed to be physically uncomfortable and angry to really appreciate the genius that is Lars. Insufferably arrogant, indeed, like all of the main characters in the movie. I screamed "about f$%*ing time!" when the chapter 9 notice came on informing me that the movie was almost over (watching DVD at home, of course) but the ending was pretty satisfying, all in all. I could get into a metaphorical exposition of the ending, but I'll leave that to the adventurous viewer who actually dedicates three hours of his or her life to sitting through this thing. Suffice it to say that I found Messianic overtones.I can't say I'd recommend it, but it might be worth watching with some artsy friends in search of conversational fodder. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, and you have a deeply masochistic streak, you might even enjoy this overblown, overrated morality play. If not, there's a peppy song and soulful photo montage at the end, perhaps inserted there at the behest of the executives, in order to keep angry patrons from torching the theater in tribute upon exiting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could not resist to write this review. I could not believe that so many people rated this "movie" so high! Actually, it is not a movie at all. There would be no difference between reading the story and watching this "movie". This is just one step beside audio book - "video book". What Lars von Trier tried to accomplish with this? "Look what artist I am!"; "I am so different from Hollywood!"; "Admire me!"... Actually he has degraded the movie art by excluding any visual enjoyment. One who likes to read (and I do), will take a good book to read. But one who likes movies (and I do), expects something else, not just story - to visually enjoy also. And Lars decided that it is not needed. Reason? I can't see any other beside "I am so different!". Yes Lars, you are, but in which way? Will you enrich the movie art with your difference as Lynch and Kubrick are? No, I don't think so... Actually I am sure you won't. And my only explanation why users rates this movie so high is: "I haven't enjoyed, but it is obviously 'artistic' movie, so rate it high..." Said.</fullReview>

The performances are wooden in the extreme - possibly deliberately so as a (pointless) stylistic device. The voice over narration gets increasingly irritating and self-satisfied. The dialogue is hopelessly intellectual. The characters are completely detached from their reality. Even the predictable ending which should come as a relief and catharsis is shot in a distant way to ensure the viewer has no emotional contact with the film at any point throughout the whole dreary overlong movie.

		<shortDescription>Pious Moralism with Arty Pretensions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dogville is a pseudo-Brechtian film that gives itself a lot of formal airs (although mostly of the familiar "filmed play" sort rather than anything cinematic, despite the de rigueur jittery camera-work) but then boils down to a theological commentary on good and evil, on "grace" and retribution, that only gives people the "moral" satisfaction of walking away thinking, "Yes, it's so true that there are simply good and bad people in the world--and I want to see the bad ones pay!!" No complexity there.As for the anti-Americanism, von Trier can't really redeem this kind of simple-minded moralizing just by running damning photographs behind the end credits, when nothing in the film has established any political relevance beforehand. (And given the racism condemned in many of the photographs why on earth does he have to turn the black mother into a parody of Mammy in "Gone with the Wind," right down to the "jis' ain't fittin'" dialogue?) None of this succeeds in disguising the fact that, like Hitchcock, von Trier is basically just filming a beautiful blonde being abused, without even the self-deprecating wit that makes Hitchcock's films readable as commentaries on blondes being abused, not sneaking celebrations of it. Letting the blonde take bloody revenge at the end (with her daddy's power) hardly turns this into a feminist fable.So you'll spend a lot of time watching compelling acting (though the heavy-handed "irony" of the voice-over gets tired very quickly) that adds up to very little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Dogville as a complex political allegory. I'm just not sure of the details; I'm still thinking about it. I think Ayn Rand could have written a hell of a review. There is self-hatred evident in the characters as well as hatred of anyone seen as more successful or more desirable than the residents of Dogville. Dogville is very abstract. What it means will likely depend on what filter the view applies to it on a particular viewing.My working interpretation is that the Dogvillites (Dogs?) represent collectivism while the mobsters represented fascism. The open sets, to me, represented the lack of privacy that destroys individualism while aiding collectivism. Kidman's character represented a new generation being asked to choose between collectivism and fascism when the two really aren't that far apart in their mechanisms.</fullReview>

While a bit of a knucklehead, Von Trier can usually pull out some interesting performances. The abundant narration found here poorly compensates for an underdeveloped cast. What's even more baffling is the film's length, clocking in a hair under 3 hours. This film, so dedicated to breaking down the proverbial 3rd wall, offers characters all following the logic of slasher film and looney Tune fodder.

		<fullReview>Dogville is a well made film, but that just makes it all the more vile because the sentiments expressed in it are evil. True, Dogville exercises Von Trier's freedom of expression and he may not intend that any of it should be taken seriously, but so what? Von Trier crosses a line in Dogville that should not be crossed. Claiming that his freedom and his sense of humor trump his indecency is a kind of thinking that is evil in essence. Like involuntary manslaughter, Von Trier's crime is still heinous even if it lacks premeditation.Von Trier has made a movie that invokes a feeling of cold, detached hatred for human beings. A feeling of being superior and "above them." A feeling of pitiless detachment from the "insects" (no longer human) squirming about on the screen. Those silly "things" squeaking and rolling in the dirt. Those "sub-humans" who hurt and rape and maim, and might even hurt or rape or maim you and I (!) if they aren't "controlled" by eugenic policy or some other final solution.It's a good feeling, isn't it? Hate, like a soft little worm coiled up in your heart, while you enjoy imagining how those "Dogville" inhabitants should be treated, and then watching them get just what they deserve!It's practically orgasmic.But it's hatred that you are feeling. In the 1930's, in Germany, The National Socialist Workers' Party used EXACTLY this kind of "ironic" hatred to take control. Most of their enemies were taken off-guard. Many said "they can't be serious" and the intellectuals (who would go to the concentration camps) laughed at Hitler. They thought it was all so amusing, at first.Don't believe me? Google it! Look up Joseph Goebbels' speeches on YouTube and watch him grinning while he uses the word "propoganda" and listen to the audience laugh! It was all so funny! At least it was for a while...This movie is full of Nazi ideas and, while I don't blame ignorant people for falling into his trap, you won't BE ignorant after you read this. You'll know. Nazi ideas can be expressed "ironically" and they have exactly the same effect. "Irony" is not a defense nor an explanation for promoting the savagery in this film. Von Trier has spent a great deal of time and money promoting these ideas. He may not even know that he's repeating the work of Goebbels and Adolf Hitler. But that's not an excuse.Nazi ideas work their evil even if they are not to be taken seriously. That means that some thoughts cannot be portrayed, even as abstract exercises in stagecraft. If that sounds like censorship, then you will be unhappy to know that much of world has outlawed the swastika, and hate speech, and holocaust denial. Yes, that is censorship. But the Nazi menace requires censorship. "Free speech" does not apply to Nazi ideas. I wish it weren't true--oh how I wish that Hitler and his creations never existed. But they did.And if you disagree, you'll probably find this entire little essay to be comical. So go ahead and laugh at how silly I am. Just like they did so many years ago, in Germany.SUPER SPOILER WARNING (This gives away the "surprise ending")Finally, for those who just don't get where I'm coming from, I'll spell it out. The citizens of Dogville seem like "hillbillies" but they represent "The Jews." They are exploiting a "fair blonde maiden." They are exterminated at the end of the film by machine guns. The town is burned like cities in Poland. The motive for this crime is not revenge, it is portrayed as the eradication of vermin. Deliberate cruelty is portrayed as a kind of catharsis. Get it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art or not, this movie is like watching a slow moving play.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is more like watching a play that has been filmed. To call this a motion picture, or movie, is a misnomer. The camera work is horrible. Like a 90 year old man with Alzheimers trying to hold the lens still after downing four cups of coffee.Ultimately boring and extremely frustrating to watch. Imagine sitting through a 3 hour long play that never changes the set. Staring at a black stage with chalkboard outlines of houses all throughout. This is like the plays you used to put on with your siblings when you were 8 years old. In fact, 8 year olds could probably have made the set more interesting and watchable if not more colorful. The mind-numbing experience of having to 'imagine' doors and walls. This is supposed to be a FILM?! More like a game of CHERADES! I really thought it was a joke in the first 10 minutes or so ... sort of a "practice run" if you will, of actors on an empty Hollywood stage.Terrible movie. It should never have made it to DVD. Maybe it would work on the Broadway stage, IF it had any music. Also the voice over was annoying ... that guy's accent is untolerable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd been looking forward to this movie for months, but soon after it started, I couldn't wait for it to end. Yes, Dogville tries to examine interesting issues and explore intriguing moral questions, and it's good to see a movie do that. But it's also pretentious, dull and heavy-handed. There are some good performances here, especially Bettany, and I suppose the lack of sets is novel (though I thought it got old, and worse, distracting)... but ultimately, do you have to sacrifice any and all entertainment value to make your bombastic point? And someone should tell Mr. Von Trier that the first time you see the main character get raped onscreen it's disturbing and upsetting, but by the fourth time, it's just bleakly repetitive. The ending was waaaay too long in coming. I didn't think this movie was especially anti-American - and hey, I dislike humanity as much as the next person. But this movie didn't move me, or engage my intellect... mostly, it just bored me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best ending ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies and movies. Some are seen just for fun while others can change your life. This is a movie from the second category. Let me warn you about this movie: * It's about 3 hours long. * It builds up really slow. * It's disturbing from an emotional point of view. * It's unconventional. * It's not the ideal movie for your movie night.Now let me tell you what's good about this movie. It's like an exercise in psychology and human nature. The ending is THE BEST EVER I ever saw. The movie builds tension again and again and the last 30 minutes are a complete release to it. What's even better, you can't blame her. There is a sense of satisfaction for the dark ending. Watch this movie. Once. Twice. Three times. Or simply read the Wikipedia summary and then watch the ending. For me, the rest of the movie could have been summarized in 10 minutes. But the ending, the discussion, the fact that it actually made sense on a deep philosophical point of view, is perfect. I wonder why this movie never got an Oscar. It deserved it. It's one of the deepest movie about human nature I ever seen, far deeper than Fight Club or Good Will Hunting.Please keep in mind that there are mature themes in this movie. While there is nothing especially graphical, no implicit nudity or violence, there is enough of both of them in a stylized manner. Add it to your library near "The Count of Monte Cristo" and keep in mind that it's not an easy watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too ambitious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lars von Trier always worried about the problems of good and evil in our society seems to try to give a final general answer to them with this movie. His ambition is too great and notwithstanding the fact that he made a movie that rivets our attention from the first to the last scene, he fails his aim partially by losing himself in scenes and dialogues of confused philosophy and ending the movie in a very pessimistic way revealing he doesn't believe at all in mankind and human beings. He tries to reproduce society in a microcosm represented by a small village whose scenery is shown like in a theatrical play (the house walls, the roads, etc are drawn on the ground and not built). The people who lives there are presented as nice, simple and good in the beginning but end up by revealing themselves as bad, mean and disloyal as the gang of bandits that is after the girl (Nicole Kidman) who escapes his gang boss of father with a very dangerous secret. A few scenes are very touching as the ordeal that the girl begins to be subjected by the villagers from a certain moment on. But the movie's final message turns up to be a bit confusing and short of reaching fully its proposed aim. In conclusion we could say about this movie what some critic already said about some theatre play I cannot remember now: it has good and original things. But unfortunately the good are not original and the original are not good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imaginative, original, but unambiguous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The modern-day film-maker has a panoply of accumulated conventions, tricks and wisdom from the history of cinema to draw from; but perhaps the easy use of familiar techniques merely enables directorial laziness. Lars von Trier's methodoloy of film-making involves the creation of arbitrary constraints as a way of forcing freshness. Thus he formulated the "Dogme" creed for minimalistic movies; and in 'The Five Obstructions', he documented his attempts to persuade his friend Jorgen Leth to make the same film under film different, completely arbitrary, sets of restrictions. Now, in 'Dogville', he has basically restricted himself to filming a play. Often, filmed plays seem boring, just static, wordy movies, but von Trier has re-invented the concept of filming a play by eschewing physical realism and sticking to the minimalist sets, and sound effects, of budget theatre; but with a trick, for on a giant wall-less set, the entirety of the small town where the events of the story take place is in effect on camera permanently, so we see the townsfolk in the background while the drama centres on a single location. It's certainly distinctive, and the emphasis in filming is very much on the characters' faces, especially that of star Nicole Kidman, who shines luminously throughout the film.The story itself is a "Lord of the Flies"-style parable of the depths to which humanity will sink, given appropriate circumstances. As ever with von Trier, there's a measure of gratuitous excess (though necessarily muted in its presentation), and also the strange decision to have the story heavily narrated. The narration moreover has a (deliberately) oddly comforting tone even when describing the worst atrocities; and more disappointingly, tells the viewer exactly what to think. The result is a beautifully constructed but fatally unambiguous drama: it may be subtle, but its relationship with the audience is not. It's also very long: in fact, I found it more absorbing as it progressed, but the early stages certainly drag, and emotionally it's dry compared with von Trier's other work.I'll finish with a couple of comments about how the film relates to the rest of von Trier's oeuvre. The degradation of women appears to be a recurring theme in his movies, perhaps unhealthily. It's also strange that he seems so keen to make movies about America, without actually ever having visited that country. But just as with his portrait of the west coast of Scotland in 'Breaking the Waves', his ability to create an country of the imagination that makes sense in itself and still connects to reality is outstanding. 'Dogville' is not wholly successful; but few directors can match von Trier for ambition and vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie for the intellectuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the movie,I nearly turned it off after 45 minutes even though I knew it starred Nicole Kidman.But after reading the reviews in this IMDb webpage,I continued it again and was very moved by the ending.This movie has a powerful ending,one which teaches an important lesson to mankind,that forgiveness has its limits and we as a human race must learn to contemplate our ways or otherwise we will suffer the same fate as the people of Dogville.I think if God were to make a judgement today on this world,he would probably say that to end the world would be the only way to solve the suffering and injustice that exists in this world.I think this is the sort of message that Nicole's character gives in the movie.I also read somewhere that the director is anti-American and this is a portrayal of the American society.Having gone there and lived there for a short time,I can say that Dogville is a fine example of an American society where greed,malice and ignorance prevail.Anyway,a great work by the director,this movie ranks as a classic for its honest portrayal of mankind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting solution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite an interesting solution to the troubles of small-town, rural America in the end there. It takes a bit of getting used to the stark set, but the minimalist approach to the lowest common denominator in human behavior does work after a while.Nicole Kidman executes her role with admirable precision, although the final scenes appear to hold the middle-ground between being contrived and looking for a quick and dramatic finish after two hours of walking pace. I don't think I was the only one who suspected that there was more to the gangster story that brought Nicole to town than 'just an occasion to get her there'. The movie managed to close the circle, but with a bit of a clank. Or with a bell, to remain in style.The display of basic human avarice, meanness and lack of self-restraint is presented in a convincing way by the rest of the cast.One thing that did bother me quite a bit was the uneven camera work. In a (somewhat overestimated and overused) attempt to pull the audience into the scenes by becoming 'their eyes', a lot of nervous and shaky images, especially present when performing fast 90-degree pans and when trying to keep up with a moving actor in close-up, presented at least me with a mild, but annoying headache after a while. I would have preferred a more smooth, 'steadicam' approach to this embellished (and slightly long) stage-play. After all, when I look at something up close, I don't usually shake my head all the time, nor do I rotate on my heels to look behind me. This is a dead and dull town; it doesn't need a speedy, giddy treatment.Anyway, interesting exercise, captivating set of circumstances, and fuel on the fire of the misanthropists, who know they're right in the end. And who would have loved to re-enact the last chapter for real, had they not been kind fools at heart, and hating themselves for it.8/10</fullReview>

And if not for the actors, who are actually very good, we should have a childish school play, including cement mountains and invisible doors with their "very creative" knock-knock-knocks.The first third of the "film" lead us to a kind of a business administration training video on group theory or sort of. And the rest is a social degeneration of human trash parade. And if you're looking for this subject, just turn on the television at Chechenia or Bagdad or Palestine news. They are so common as this "film".It's not a case of lack of spirit. It's just poverty of spirit.

		<fullReview>As a stage play 'Dogville' might have more impact; however, as a movie it fails to deliver a coherent narrative despite its political ambitions and Sadeian big finish. Despite its dramatic allusions to Berthold Brecht and Peter Weiss "The Persecution and Assassination of Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade', the storyline for Dogville is a predicatble, mysogynist polemic against America's post 9/11 Neo-Macarthite paranoia. While the acting performances are solid, and in some cases inspired (this may be Nicole Kidman's best performace to date), the pace of the filming and editing is so slow that for the most part the film is tedious in the extreme. On stage one would feel the immediacy of the actors' performances and therefore be more engaged by the intellectual ambitions of the piece; however, on screen the words seem as if they were written with lead not ink. As a result, 'Dogville' like Tom its protagonist fails politically and artistically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dogville is a very strange movie. It is set like a theater production than a movie. There are no sets to speak of where people pretend to open and close doors (this gets annoying after a while). Nicole Kidman plays a woman who is hiding in a small town from mobsters. There she is put to work for little pay by the town like an outsider (read: immigrant). The biggest problem with this movie is that it is incredibly boring. Whatever point the director is making about America, he makes it early and often. We know from our history books how Americans treat outsiders so we don't need to spend nearly three hours watching this movie to know that. The fact that the director doesn't live or work in America shows great ignorance on his part. There is prejudice all over the world, America should be the last place he targets. Kidman and Paul Bettany try hard but the rest of the cast, particularly Lauren Bacall, play such unlikable characters that we don't care about them. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen `Dogville,' I have thought about `Dogville,' and now I am ready to comment on `Dogville.'But first, let's go back three years ago when I saw `Dancer in the Dark.' This was my first Lars Von Trier film and I loved it. I loved the way he merged a dogma film with a Technicolor musical and surprisingly, made it work. I loved Bjork. Her performance as Selma was brilliant and her haunting musical numbers embedded themselves in my mind forever.The fact that Lars set that film in the U.S. didn't bother me. After all, the scenes of the American judicial system were so fictitious; it was impossible to take them seriously. Also, `Dancer in the Dark' was part of a trilogy that also included films set in Scotland (`Breaking the Waves') and Denmark (`The Idiots'). But Lars apparently did have a problem when some U.S. critics questioned why he set the movie in the U.S. - a country he's never been to and says he's afraid to visit. Lars, in response, decided to make a new trilogy called `U.S.A.: Land of Opportunities' and `Dogville' is the first in this trilogy. I remember him saying that the Americans made `Casablanca' and never went there. I don't know how true that is but `Casablanca' wasn't a movie about Morocco and its people whereas `Dogville' is about America according to Lars Von Trier's imagination.Like `Dancer in the Dark' and `Breaking the Waves,' `Dogville' has an innocent female (Nicole Kidman) persecuted by the people around her. But, the comparisons stop there. Unlike the previous films, `Dogville' is pretentious, overlong and just plain unlikable.The story concerns a beautiful fugitive (Grace) who seeks refuge in a small American hamlet called Dogville. A no-talent philosopher/writer named Tom Edison convinces the close minded, dumb townspeople to let Grace stay and in exchange, she'll help everyone out with various chores. When wanted posters go up, the townspeople decide to up their demands on Grace and soon she is turned into a slave. The townspeople later proceed to rape, scapegoat and degrade her. Grace is a good person and continues to forgive their brutality until the end when judgment day arrives. This narrated fable stretches out for three edious hours on a nearly bare soundstage.On the positive side, the soundstage is a nice technique. Having a small town represented by chalk lines and minimal props is an interesting way to show the claustrophobic nature of hamlets where everyone knows everyone and everyone's business. Also, sacrificing sets and locations did allow Von Trier to afford an impressive cast including Nicole Kidman, Lauren Bacall, Stellan Skaarsgard, James Caan, Patricia Clarkson and more.On the downside, the actors' time is wasted on long-winded, pretentious dialog. Surprisingly, other than Stellan, the rest of the acting isn't very good. Scenes that should be emotional or passionate are just monotone. Even Nicole seems bored with her role. The camera work is lame and irritating. Worst of all, the length of the movie is inexcusable; there is no reason why this movie needed to be three hours!As an American, I have to speak up and say that I took offense to this film. I've read in several publications where Lars is now saying this film takes place in America but could easily take place in any small town, anywhere in the world. This is a contradictory and a cowardly thing for him to say; Von Trier took every step to make sure this town was American. This movie is nothing more than a mean-spirited attempt to paint the United States and its people as hypocrites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie was over I thought to myself "The clock says three hours has passed, but in my mind it feels like it has been 3 years." Dogville was a horrible movie and there is no question about it, nothing will EVER make me want to see this movie again or think about changing my mind. Here is the plot, Nicole Kidman enters this town of Dogville or as I like to call it: A stage with chalk all over it, that has sound effects for doors and dogs. Anyway, Nicole Kidman (who cares about her name in the movie) enters the town of Dogville for protection and as a hiding place all with the help of her new friend Paul Bettany (once again who cares what his name is). There is only one problem, everyone in the town except Paul either hates her or doesn't want her there, but they do let her stay if she completes chores for the town. Nicole never reveals her secret to the town, all they know is that she is wanted by the police. Finally, when she begins reading to the blind man of the town, you think she has someone on her side. But if you thought this you would be wrong because eventually he RAPES her. And if that wasn't enough the whole male side of the town has a go with her as well. So now, all the males are raping her through black mail (the classic: I'll give you too the police, if you won't let me rape you!) and all the females are destroying her beloved little figurines (that serve no purpose) because they think if my husband raped you well then it is your fault and you are a hussy! So that goes on for about an hour, until she thinks she is escaping out of the town by one of the townsfolk, but as her luck would have it they were really just turning her over to what she was running from in the first place! But wait it gets even more ridiculous, what she was running from and why the cops wanted to find her is (drumroll)..........................Her DAD IS A GANGSTER AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE APART OF IT ANYMORE!!! When you hear this a lot of questions come into your mind like: Why was she letting herself get raped if it was just her dad? Is this the dumbest movie ever made? The answer to your first question is because she is an idiot and the second answer is "you betcha ya!" Oh and if you want to know how it ends, Nicole makes her gangster dad (James Caan) light the entire town of Dogville on fire and kill everyone in it. Now I am not kidding when I tell you that Dogville is the worst movie I have ever seen so far in my life. Was it worse than Valley of the Dolls? Oh yeah! Howard the Duck? You can bet your life on it! It was worse than...dare I say it? Yes, I dare. It was worse than Ishtar! To sum everything I just said up: The acting was lackluster and tired; The directing was really simplistic because it was on a stage; The writing was over-the-top and terrible and finally lets not forget the stage and the chalk. The stage with the chalk is like a 3-hour movie where Nicole Kidman lets herself get raped and harassed for no reason.</fullReview>

I didn't leave the room in the hope that as the film went on it would improve and take a fast pace, but man was I wrong.I'm not keen on Hollywood blockbusters (Most of which are lame) but neither am I on endless drags like Dogville. I may like independent stuff as long as it's visible, but this eternal piece should be recommended for people suffering from insomnia. If I had known this movie is totally filmed in what looks like a typical theater stage I would've saved four ? or used them to see something better. I don't doubt the people involved in its filming and playing have done a good job, but the whole thing seems too weird - come on, a town in the middle of nowhere with no landscape in sight but darkness, etc...I won't carry on as not to spoil it, though I think readers will know what to do by now.In a nutshell, and using a typical Spanish saying, this movie even puts the sheep to sleep.1/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Breaking the Waves, Dancer in the Dark and Dogville are three Dogme films, directed by Lars Trier in the English language. The lead roles in these films are doting, stereotypical female character. Why is Dogville Trier's best film? It isn't. First of all, Trier's choice to film Dogville on a stage makes for a very Brechtian experience, sans the alienation. Dogville attempts to be as alienating as the aforementioned two, but rests on its laurels for a good portion of this overlong film. Many interesting themes are explored throughout the films three hour duration: Christian guilt, entitlement, dehumanization. In the end, you feel, not unlike its protagonist, raped, taken advantage of and chained up like a dog. The film is shot on a stage - sets are indicated by chalk markings. It's also shot in HDTV. In this sense the film feels like nothing we've seen before. Although Peter Greenaway (sort of) took a stab at the filmed-play format with Prospero's Books, Dogville being on a stage makes it all the more limited and claustrophobic. The story doesn't have any comment on these themes I've mentioned. It's just a neverending downer with no true purpose except an arena for Trier to punish his weak female characters. The town slowly turns against Grace, and soon they are torturing and raping her. Confused, ignorant, immature, jerks who, we are supposed to believe in our heart of hearts, feel they are completely justified in their actions. Men are portrayed as cruel polymorphously conniving cowardly crafty and evil subhuman. Women are portrayed as stupid, confused, overly possessive, insecure, vacuous, equally cruel, bullying and matriarchal. I try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'm trying to prove a point here. I might be mistaken, but I'll take my crack at it. I think, at first we're supposed to believe that these people are good. Grace enters their simple world and finds a safe haven, a pure simple kind of life - a departure from whatever horrible, living hell she emigrated from. They show their teeth, and at the end, hell opens up and they are judged. The ending is so a-bit-much, violent, disturbing, unsettling, gut-wrenching and just plain VILE, but is such a fitting conclusion for this film. It's almost as if Trier creates these evil characters, and destroys them - but attempts to make this more than a revenge pic. Sad but true, he does depict these evil characters as victims of their own nature. We understand their behavior, but we cannot forgive them. Trier is manipulative, but at least he's good at it. At times he thinks he's channeling Felinni and Bergman with his unapologetic depictions of desolation, hopelessness, loneliness, emptiness and sadness through the ridicule of his characters, but he's too angry, he's too disturbed. There is little grace (no pun intended)in the way he stresses these messages. The problem is, he's overintellectualizing them. He's attempting to show us that people really are treated this way. I'm not sure if he's using this film as a One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nestesque metaphor for society (in keeping with "USA" trilogy) or creating an arena to showcase his internal anarchy or ferocity. It isn't clear if he just wants to make us feel bad as him or as bad as we should. Any way you look at it, this is the sort of film which can't be deemed good or bad. Then again, in this case, textbook filmmaking techniques have been eschewed in favor of a minimalist, theatrical approach. Without the frills of a major motion picture the focus is on the acting and story. The acting is a mixed bag: Chloe [name I can't spell], Philip Baker Hall, Stellan Skarsgard and Lauren Bacall deliver lame performances, while Nicole Kidman, Paul Bettany, Patricia Clarkson and [the guy who played the mayor on Oz who, in Dogville, plays a miniature version of Lenny from Of Mice and Men] steal the show. The dialogue is very well-written. The structure of the screenplay is difficult to judge because it is mostly a catalyst for Trier to play out his ugly fantasies. This isn't a review, but if it was I would say see it, one thumb sideways, N/A+ and see it for free if you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville equals Scientology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key to understanding the meaning of Dogville lies in one scene in the movie. In the scene when the wife is breaking the porcelain figures that Nicole Kidman had developed an emotional attachment to she says "if you really believe in stoicism you will not cry when I break these figurines". Nicole Kidman cries and at the end of the movie retaliates with revenge Quid pro quo (children are used instead of the porcelain figurines).This scene about stoicism is central to the meaning of the movie. Stoicism is also central to the philosophy(religion) of Scientology. Although Nicole could not cry out against Scientology in public she has found a way to tell her story through film.Bravo, Jack</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*****SPOILER WARNING, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS THE ENTIRE PLOT OF THE MOVIE, BUT IMO IT'S NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE ANYWAY***** I have to start by saying don't let my rather damning review of this film discourage you from seeing it. I know people who love it. I, however, did not. If you're curious then just watch it.It's about a small town in Colorado that receives an unexpected visitor, on the run from gangsters. After some discussion this quiet, small, conservative town collectively decides to harbour the fugitive. Their initial insistence that she is welcome to stay without any form of repayment is gradually eroded until she is reduced to the status of a slave/beast, and eventually is turned over to the gangsters by the one resident she had come to trust the most. The gangsters arrive, their boss is her father, and after a discussion with him about the inherent difficulty of ethical behaviour in humans (and a brief moment of clarity on the part of the fugitive) she swears allegiance to the father she was running away from and orders the gangsters to massacre everyone in the town and raze it to the ground.The plot's reasonably interesting, but my problems with the film are mainly the thematic jumble and confused message of the piece. The film is about trust, betrayal, tolerance, loyalty, friendship, love, sex, abuse, isolation, revenge, compassion, the baseness of human nature under certain circumstances and...oh god, just too many other things.It feels to me as if so much has been crammed into one film in an attempt to make it interesting to everyone, completely missing the point that if a universal theme is well explored then it WILL be interesting to everyone. We don't need a dozen themes thrown at us all at once.This is reflected in the acting, which, despite being top-notch from all concerned, is distracting. The film doesn't work as an ensemble piece. Perhaps if the focus had been more heavily on Kidman's fugitive it might have held my attention a little more, but as it is I didn't know which characters were protagonists and which were antagonists, at any point. This might work in a murder mystery, but this film is resolutely anti-genre.In a way it is also rather anti-film, being filmed as it is on a blandly furnished sound stage, with chalk marks on the floor delineating buildings, plants, street edges etc. If this neutrality had been carried out throughout the rest of the piece, then the device might have worked, but it's (quite emphatically) set in Colorado. After 90 minutes (another thing, 150+ mins is just too long) I was yearning for some cinema, to see those mountains the characters keep on talking about.There is so much potential squandered in this film that I resolutely watched the conclusion, hoping for some redeeming features, but to no avail. But as I always say, just watch it and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew that "Dogville" was either much liked or much hated...put me in the latter category. Where do I begin? 1. Incredibly long...the first hour or so was excruciating. 2. What was the big deal with ALWAYS opening up the "pretend" doors? We get it, OK? 3. I think one of Paul Bettany's greatest assets as an actor is his voice/British accent. Giving him an American drawl took that away.It would be nice if Von Trier could move on and be a little more diverse in his film making. Like "Breaking the Waves", "Dogville" shows you what happens when a tight, closed community turns on you. I appreciated "Dancer in the Dark", even though it's one of the most depressing films ever made. This film was a piece of pretentious crap that broke no new ground. The "Young Americans" ending brought home the distinct anti-American slant, but that was just the cherry on the whipped cream...I pretty much hated this film.As I said in my Title line, someone either needs to medicate Von Triers, or better yet, please stop funding his films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I appreciated the highly staged and play-like nature of the film, it failed miserably. The film continued along, monotonously pounding the same uninspired thought again and again as the film progressed. It is possible that people who enjoy Lars van Trier's other films will find something more in this film, but there is no nuance for me. There is nothing but a sledgehammer. No interesting use of language. No use of the abilities of the actors. Wretched, honestly. It seemed as though a 13 year old wanted to tell a story and didn't have the tools in order to add complexity or honest human experience to the tale. van Trier continues his misogynism in this film as the female characters seem to act without any thought to their future, their surroundings or any possibilities. Very sad indeed.I'm also amazed by the pretentiousness of people who commented on liking the film. I totally don't understand it. Have they never seen a well-crafted film before? This film had no more than 20 minutes of interest before it dissolved into a class project. Uncreative. Boring. oh...and pretentious.Abusively uncrafted films such as these should not be even reviewed by more than the teacher of the class.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to vote-stacking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry for the spam, but this film is classified as being voted highest by the 18-29 Male/Female brackets, and in the under-18 brackets. Isn't it strange that this movie was rated highest in the demographics that are of most interest to people that fund these movies? However, I have yet to meet a SINGLE 'average' person who liked this movie. And I worked in a video store. In fact, the demographic I found most likely to dislike this movie...was 18-29 year-olds. And my 15-year-old son and his friends laughed when I tried to put this on. I did tell them that it was highly recommended by others in their age group. I believe the group consensus was 'No way. Total junk'. They turned it off after 10 minutes. I have an incredibly hard time believing that ONE child under 18 has watched this movie all the way through, let alone almost a thousand. Like my title says, a tribute to vote-stacking.The only thing I can say about it, was it must have been cheap to make. Like other reviews have said, it is very much 'art theatre'. I think the point of this movie was supposed to be to show off the acting talents of fairly big-name actors. What I don't get is...why would anyone except casting directors watch it? Its a 'movie pretending to be in a theatre', without anything but a blank warehouse for a set, and lines drawn with tape on the floor. I thought movies were supposed to be a visual medium? Heck, there is even written text telling you what is supposedly the point of the scene. So, the producer thinks the audience won't get it? After reading some of the other comments on IMDb, I am willing to concede that this movie MAY have a good plot. Somewhere. But its ploddingly slow, and I'm sorry, my life is too short. A totally disappointing movie. To bad I own it. I've tried to give it away, but no one seems to want it, go figure. Even the pawn shops won't take it...they have too many copies already.</fullReview>

If anyone can offer me reasons as to why I should give this movie another try, please give such suggestions. There must be some reason to watch it. IMDb users (near 45,000) have rated it almost an 8. SCREENIT, my all-time favorite movie review site, rated it a 6/10. And, as I recall, Rottentomatoes also praised this movie, giving it very high ratings. I don't know. I'm a curmudgeonly movie-goer, perhaps. But that doesn't mean I'm closed to the abstract. My point: "Dogville" did not appear abstract. It came off like a behind the scenes view of a play rehearsal.

I read a spoiler saying Nicole Kidman gets spanked and raped which could dramatically help a truly hideous beginning. What the hell is the "film?" The town is a stage, the people live in chairs, and some gangsters just roll through looking to massacre Nicole. What the hell is she even doing in this film? And Paul Bettany, Ivanek from OZ, and other very good actors such as Lauren Bacall. In conclusion, Dogme is garbage and this is a perfect example of why that is the truth.</fullReview>

Confronting this so called reality - a dark, obscure, absurd, evil, cruel, meaningless, selfish, monstrous world - gets you closer to the truth?Maybe, for some people, getting in touch with the horrible aspects of the human kind, can provoke a reversed reaction, by making them feel more noble, or less repulsive.

He wants to make us believe he's actually saying something but he's NOT. It's the worst screenplay I've ever seen. He shouldn't write his own movies, actually he shouldn't direct them neither. What are Lauren Bacall, John Hurt, Nicole Kidman, James Caan doing there??? I don't understand how he manged to fool so many people (and many critics, especially at Cannes) pretending to make art. This is a masquerade, a pure imitation of good cinema (and not even a good one I can tell you), a empty box. Don't waste time on this ...., watch a good, healthy, poetic Ingmar Bergman movie.

		<fullReview>I rented this movie last night, expecting a masterpiece. It had very high ratings, (currently is the 218th highest rated movie of all time on IMDb), an interesting plot, and not to mention one of my favorite actresses, Nicole Kidman. It also got rave reviews at the Sundance film festival, and usually they are dead on. Let me tell you this. The "setting" of this movie is something that may turn off a few watchers right from the beginning. I almost dismissed it, but decided to give it a chance. The story became slightly enchanting, and about an hour into the film, I decided that the movie was worth my time. But then something shocking happened, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I then knew what this movie was ultimately going to be about, and I was right. The movie endlessly went on for another 2 hours. The depiction of the average, common man (Americans)in this movie is far from accurate, and is despicable. It even had a surprise ending, but it left absolutely no satisfaction. The acting is average at best. I believe the high ratings are due to the films originality and "hidden meanings". I picked up on these, but in no way did I find it entertaining, or mind-enriching. This film just simply should not have been made. I hope my vote of 1 takes this movie down a notch, and hopefully this movie will eventually find its way off of the Top 250 list.</fullReview>

Patricia Clarkson is almost always disappointing, and Chloe Sevigny is almost always in need of a bath. When combined, even in old-fashioned clothes, they are more than a person can be expected to handle. And the underdeveloped setting did not achieve the effect of making the town into any town. It became no town at all. Something so foreign quickly becomes irrelevant. And it was long, like "Dances with Wolves." But there was no dancing. There were no wolves. No Indians. Nothing.

		<fullReview>First of all, I would not call this a film. It is an experiment gone bad and an insult to real cinematography. Actors walking around on a soundstage, houses marked only with white lines on the floor, and on top of that - a narrator explaining with a stern voice what is going on! What an original approach... Obviously only the sublime mind of self proclaimed connaisseurs is meant to truly appreciate this landmark in style and substance! I still wonder why Trier didn't go further and discard all the superfluous clichés the mediocre audience is used to e.g. why see the actors all the time while he could have shown only their shadows instead! This would have meant a new level of symbolism and caused all the jaw dropped admirers to tremble with pleasure.Some of you might think of Lars Trier as a genius and deem the so called Dogma 95 an ultimate achievement in creativity and imagination. I don't. I would rather consider the Dogma 95 and the above film snobbish pseudo-elitist mental onanism that serves mainly one purpose: giving a group of opinionated so called "intellectuals" a self-validation tool which has to prove their mental superiority "You - unlike us - don't understand deep art..." I don't mind the fact that he chose to focus on the dialog instead of the scenery - Sidney Lumet ("12 Angry Men") has shown us that a film can be set in one single room and still be grasping and intriguing. Ettore Scola ("Le Bal") proved that a film does not even need any dialog and still touch you. And Lars Trier amply demonstrates that he can have a great cast and storyline with a potential - and produce nothing but huge flatulence. By the way, I recommend re-reading "The Emperor's New Clothes" - ironically, written by another Dane...</fullReview>

Of course, some of you defend him because you are also anti-American. But since you seem so uninformed let me inform you....these are direct quotes from the jerk himself. #1, for those who think the movie wasn't targeted at America, jerkboy says this about the movie "Two things inspired me to write "Dogville". First of all, I went to Cannes with "Dancer in the Dark" and I was criticized by some American journalists for making a film about the USA without ever having been there. This provoked me because, as far as I can recall, they never went to Casablanca when they made "Casablanca". I thought that was unfair so I decided then and there that I would make more films that take place in America. " #2 "Dogville" takes place in America but it's only America as seen from my point of view" Now, I ask you, how informed is his point of view when he has never even BEEN here? Anyone who would even have this type of point of view while having no first hand knowledge is simply a bigot, and it's as simple as that. #3 , the jerk continues with his America bashing... "In addition to the countless American programmes on Danish television, there is also a lot of news because America is the biggest power in the world. There's a lot of criticism, too. In my youth, we had some big demonstrations against the World Bank and the Vietnam War and we all turned out to throw rocks at embassies. Well, at one embassy? But I don't throw rocks anymore. Now I just tease. I learned when I was very small that if you are strong, you also have to be just and good, and that's not something you see in America at all" Get it??? He threw rocks at ONE embassy. And, of course using his workds, being just and good is not something he sees in America. And finally, " What can I say about America? Power corrupts. And that's a fact. Then again,since they are so powerful, it's okay to tease because I can't harm America, right? So there you have Lars, in all of his small minded glory. So those of you who care if this jerk is a bigot or not, there you have it.....And those of you who don't care, well you are entitled to your own opinions....</fullReview>

The camera angles shifted from close ups to long shots as if it were a documentary, which was immensely distracting. When I saw the trailer I thought it was a suspense drama, exciting, suspenseful, full of twists and turns. Boy was I disappointed. The only good part of this film was the acting.

		<fullReview>What crap. People make anything in the name of movies nowadays. I pity all these morons giving this crap movie a glowing review. I actually thought it was a theater play or something. The sets are ridiculously cheap and seedy. Plus there are no nude scenes of Nicole Kidman. Honestly who finances these kind of movies? After 30 minutes or so I got bored and walked out. My dog can make a better movie than that Lars Von Turd. Avoid this movie like plague. Instead of spending 9 bucks on this movie, I would rather buy three McDonald's cheeseburgers, get cholesterol and die. Go watch Superman or something. Do not waste time on this movie. Anything but this rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dogville or Springfield? Swings Either Way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a couple of drinks, and so was able to sit through Dogville. In my semi-addled state I thought I was watching a rejected episode of The Simpsons. But a half hour into the show, something told me I wasn't watching any crackpot NBC cartoon at all. Why? Because I was hard pressed to identify any Marge Simpson character. Well one can argue that the Paul Bettany character is somewhat similar to an unconscientious Marge, but I digress, because: WHERE THE &amp;#%$ THEN IS BART AND LISA SIMPSON, HUH?Well I still enjoyed the show, if only for the performance of the actors all across the board. The camerawork however, put me in a virtual shitstorm. I thought I was reliving Die Hard III, which to me was nigh impossible for anyone to sit through. That is, unless motion sickness makes you go "wheeee" or "yee-haw".[SPOILER ALERT] These days, any two-bit hack television writer can work out character development. That's only primetime drama. But this is the big screen. It takes a writer with real cajones to come up with characters you can simply switch off your EQ for. But for whatever the middle portion lacks, it's more than made up for towards the end of the show, when--like a sendup to Star Wars Episode 1's "Wipe them out, all of them," down comes an Armageddon, the likes of which can only be found in the Persian Gulf. Blowing things up makes people happy. So that's a no-brainer.No doubt the effect is supposed to shock, abhor, or for the deadened or hardened, vaguely titillate. But to me, it's good enough to be another filler episode of The Simpsons.No stars. I don't believe in rating shows in reviews.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a movie or what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think about it: Harold Lloyd, Chaplin and many others made great movies in twenties, despite of technological limitations of those days. Nevertheless they knew what a movie is or should be. They had a clear idea of a movie in their minds. That was the main thing: To understand what a movie is. Many other producers, directors etc. understood the concept as well. Akira Kurosawa got excellent shots with very minimal equipment. And so on. They understood movie and their audience understood them.Then I bought a ticket and went watching this Dogville thing. I went to a movie theater and paid a decent price because I expected to see a movie. Instead of a decent movie I saw lines painted on the floor, also a dog that was not actually a dog but just lines on the floor. Have you ever seen or heard about dog actors? I have. I suppose that shaky picture was intended to make audience seasick, and it almost did that. What about the sound space then? Narrator's voice tried to patch with words this unimpressive, boring, shaky and overpriced film. It also lasted too long. It could have been compressed into 15 minutes without losing anything essential.One star is quite enough for Dogville.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be the most boring movie I've ever seen! At the end one can only agree with Jimmy Caan. I knew my Godfather buddy would come and save us all.I mean the idea of using a stage with a village painted on the floor and with an artificial dog is great. Very refreshing. But that's it. I mean, after 10 minutes you got used to it and then you only wait 163 minutes for Jimmy Caan.Lars von Trier made wonderful movies. This is not one of them. I cannot understand how it could get so many rewards. 178 min. of my life went down the wastebasket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film for Europeans that love to hate America</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has two parts?the first half is creative and intriguing. The second half is ridiculous and cliché. The movie is about 1.5 hours too long. It is a view of America from the eyes of a Dane (the Writer/Director). It has nothing to do with America?only clichés of America?right down to the mob and America's sexually repressed citizens. The movie made only $1.5 million in the U.S. and 5 times that amount in the U.S. bashing continent of Europe. It won every European film award and wasn't nominated for an Oscar or Golden Globe. This is a hateful, Euro-trash look at America. The concept was exciting and original. The story deteriorated into the usual sexually deviant, violence loving European monologue on America. While in reality?the America portrayed in this movie only exists in the minds of a culture that loves to hate America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why must a morality tale be so hard to digest???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Thornton Wilder OUR TOWN approach to staging a small town cross-section of townspeople using a stylized approach (few props and bits of scenery), has been used again sixty or more years later for DOGVILLE. However, I found the results stagnant and artless, instead of artful.No doubt the pseudo-intellectuals will pounce on this sort of disagreement and proclaim the film as some kind of masterpiece. It all makes as much sense as the seven figurines in Ma Ginger's window.Dialog is supposed to move a plot forward--but not in this case. It crawls through so much pretentious prattle in examining why NICOLE KIDMAN should stay or leave Dogsville that it is stultifying in its emptiness.To put it kindly, Kidman's performance adds nothing to her stature as an actress. Her work can best be described as tentative. PAUL BETTANY, on the other hand, rises to the occasion with an earnest performance as her best friend in the village.The bareness of the staging is equal to the bareness of the plot. Very disappointing to watch people like LAUREN BACALL (totally wasted as Ma Ginger) and BEN GAZZARA (as the blind man) in such sketchily written parts.Summing up: Definitely not my cup of tea. Even morality tales should make their point by the time the story is halfway over. The over-the-top ending with the entrance of JAMES CAAN can only be described as deplorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoying and irritating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to deal with Lars Von Trier once and for all, by seeing DOGVILLE, the first Trier-film for me. The idea of using a minimalistic setup is truly original, but it never gets catchy; It is a failed attempt to bring theater to the big screen. Actually it is just extremely irritating! The story is okay and is meant to show the true identities of the American people, though I doubt the real Americans act so cruel as the characters in the movie. Judge for yourself.Unless you are a 100% Lars Von Trier fan, I recommend you avoid this annoying movie.I therefore give DOGVILLE 2 out of 10, 1 for Nicole Kidman's great acting, and 1 for the just as great acting for Paul Bettany.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Nicole Kidman can do no wrong, and was brilliant herself in her role in the film, the movie itself was terrible. The drear stark set was insulting to the senses. It was painfully, painfully slow. But I stuck with it. As the whole town became corrupted (absurdly so) by the power they have over the woman they chose to protect, the story becomes just more and more absurd. The viewer is asked to go beyond reasonable suspension of disbelief as the film maker tries to prove a point, but it doesn't work. As the townies begin to institutionalize their brutality and cruelty (supposedly symbolizing the US, or the US citizens), and the victim (symbolizing other countries or people over which/whom the US and US citizens would supposedly have power) allows herself to be humiliated constantly, with no end in sight, the viewer is struck by this point -if the film is making a statement about the heavy hand of the US, it has to be equally about the complicity of the 'victim'.The best part was the end when she allowed her father's thugs to kill every last horrible stereotypical inhabitant of this ridiculous town.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasted a whole hour of my life watching this poor excuse for a film before gratefully accepting an offer to leave the cinema by another bored to tears viewer. This is a film I wouldn't even wish for my greatest enemy to suffer watching.To make matters worse, the film is divided into 9 chapters- each one mentioned just to remind you how much more you have to suffer if you are to watch the rest of the film. If I had wanted to see a play, I would have gone to the theatre!!I cannot express enough how appallingly boring this film was, during the hour I was unfortunate enough to be in the cinema, a constant flow of people left the film at different intervals. Need i say any more?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie should come with a disclaimer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I chose to watch this film based on an intriguing plot summary and the presence of Nicole Kidman, who is clearly one of the more gifted actresses in cinema today. Little did I know (nor was it mentioned anywhere in the promotional literature) that the director's vision was to produce a play and then bring his hand-held camera onto the stage to film it. Why bother with shooting on location when you can simply create streets out of chalk, mountains out of cardboard and buildings out of papier mache? In fact, why bother splurging for actors at all -- they might just as well have used puppets. Apparently, the Blair Witch Project had a bigger budget than Dogville.This atrocious, overly hyped, self-indulgent waste of celluloid lumbers along for THREE hours, purportedly with some vague social message about Americans and Americana. Fortunately, I realized where things were heading in the first fifteen minutes and fast-forwarded through the rest to save myself any more tedium and frustration.What was the director thinking? Either create a play or film a movie, but don't mix the mediums. It simply doesn't work. Dogville should have come with a money-back guarantee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible pretentious swill!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is an example of movie-making at it's very worst. This is what happens when you put together a bunch of pretentious, artsy, egocentric actors and director with no real script or shooting location. The movie looks like it was filmed in a high-school gymnasium and indeed I have seen better performances in high school plays than in this film. All the actors stand around and stare at each other like deer in headlights waiting to deliver their next empty-headed lines at one another. There is also a ridiculous narration in this film that reminds me of something from an Ed Wood film. The movie drizzles on for almost three hours because the people who made this are so in love with the smell of their own crap that they can't bear to flush any of it down the toilet where it belongs. Complete trash posing as an art film. To me, movies are supposed to be about effectively telling a compelling story with good acting, dialogue, and visuals. This movie has nothing, but three hours of self-indulgent rhetoric. Enough said...it's just plain awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Absolutely Sucks. It could be the worst I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This horrible display of evil assumed to be in every American is terribly portrayed and horribly put together. The writer/director of this movie should face a similar punishment to that befallen to the characters at the end of the movie for forcing me to sit through such a wretched piece of garbage. This movie attempts to convey a certain evil in all mankind, a lack of justice in all mankind, and a certain understanding of a culture this writer obviously knows nothing about. The only thing men can do is Rape. The only thing women can do is scream about their men sleeping with other women. The only thing society wants is its own slaves. In this movie's world, no one stands up for justice, or liberty. No one takes to heart the suffering of the innocent, or does anything to stop it. I find it I ironic that the writer meant to criticize American society in this movie. America, where the first notions of free, democratic society took place. America, which exported its ideals of justice throughout the world. America, whose founding fathers were able to stand up for justice and liberty. And yes, I know of all the bad things this country has done to, but America is no Dogville, and the writer of this movie should wake up and realize how much worse life could be if the British, Romans, Greeks, Mongols, Nazis, or any of the other previous world hegemonies influenced the world today. Screw You, Lars Von Trier. Get A Life. -A Liberal American.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very sorry to say I wish I'd not been duped by the trailer.The trailer I saw, (understandably), chose not to show any scenes from the actual movie. That's a first in my book.Is this the movie version of the 'Emperor's New Clothes' ?? I cannot believe the score this film has received. I'm sure the acting and the plot are great...If you like 'that sort of thing'. However, if I want to see a 6th form amateur production of a stage-show then I'll wait until my local church puts one on. Sorry but this film was mind numbing 'codswallop'.OK, that was judged on only the first 15mins and a swift scan through each scene selection on the DVD but...the clue is on the reviews on the box. Beware of 'awards' from pseudo-'international Directors !! JM70</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>CRAPVILLE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll bet there are a lot of people, like me, who loathed this movie, but just don't take the time to comment on it. That's why the comments index is full of praises and sparse with negative feedback. As always, I didn't know what this film was about before I sat down to watch it. I just knew that everyone seemed to adore it. When the picture first came on, and the caption read prologue, and the scene looked like rehearsals for a major motion picture, I thought, What the hell is this? Did I press a "behind-the-scenes featurette" instead? I just hated it, the whole way through. I give credit to the director for being innovative, but it's not my cup of tea. I'm the only kid on the block who despised "Crouching Tiger" too. Give me a real movie with superb acting and a runaway script any day; I'll fall hook, line, and sinker every time. And what's with the shaky hand-held camera all the way through? My advice to the world: if you want to see a great recent Nicole Kidman film, see "Cold Mountain." I'm still thinking about that one.</fullReview>

I remember that the movie was broken up into chapters... and when the "final chapter" came up, there was an uproarious cheer as if to signify that the end was in sight.What is hilarious is to watch as the artistic community falls over backwards for this movie.

		<shortDescription>Unwatchable and, apparently, overrated.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this overlong film completely unwatchable. The lack of sets may work on stage, but it's utterly unbearable on film. I could only handle about 20 minutes before scanning ahead and quickly realizing that the scenery NEVER changes. Eject.It appears that a lot of people liked this film, but I can't understand how they sat through 3 hours of an unchanging set. It became distracting to the point where any merit the film may have had was masked by the fact that the visual elements were the equivalent of staring at a dot for three straight hours; it's like making a movie by filming pages of a book; why bother?Dogville should only exist as a play; it'd be much easier to avoid.2/10, because 1/10 is probably ignored.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is total crap- hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. Terribly boring and the plot is nonsensical. Don't waste the rental fee; Gigli would be a better choice than this stinker. I have absolutely nothing else to say about this terrible movie but for some inexplicable reason I can't submit my comment unless I have 10 lines of text. Maybe this was von Trier's problem- he thought he had to pad the movie with hours of useless and painfully boring dialogue culminating in a stupid ending that made absolutely no sense whatsoever in order to reach some sort of three hour minimum length. What a waste of a movie and of the talent of some usually decent actors.</fullReview>
