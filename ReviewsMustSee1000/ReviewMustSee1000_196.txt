		<shortDescription>Excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed to learn that this movie was only going to have a limited showing in the US, only one or two theaters on either coast. My wife and I both enjoyed "Flags" and were pleased when we learned that Clint Eastwood made a second movie, this time telling the story from the Japanese perspective. As luck would have it, we going to Japan for the holidays so we decided to try and see the movie in Tokyo during our trip. We went to the Ginza area of Tokyo and, to our surprise, the movie was completely sold out. We needed to buy tickets at least one day in advance. Further, we learned that the movie was currently number 1 in Japan. Wow ? that's impressive that an American made movie would become number one in Japan! Way to go, Clint! After a little extra planning and some adjustments to our schedule, we bought advance tickets and came back the next day.We completely loved it. We were moved and stirred with many emotions including anger, anger over the horrors of war. We actually liked it better than "Flags of our Fathers". The movie was in Japanese and, as near as we could tell, Japanese appears to be the native language of the film. There were brief moments of English, American solders talking, one flash back scene before the war during a foreign dignitary dinner, and of course the credits at the end. The movie would have to be translated and/or sub titled to English in order to have half a chance in the US. Frankly, I think translation would take away from the movie's beauty and meaning. I understand a limited amount of Japanese so I could follow most of the story. The theater was very big and packed. I was a little uncomfortable at first; I may well have been the only American in the place. My wife (who is Japanese) and I sat next to an older couple. At several points during the film, I thought I noticed the man from the couple crying. When the film ended, my wife talked with the couple and learned that the old man's father died in Iwo jima. Later during the trip, speaking with Japanese friends and seeing the Japanese news, stories of lost loved ones from the war were common and this movie for the Japanese people has brought many of these memories out in the open.To the Japanese, Iwo jima was a part of their homeland where a foreign invader was going to land and begin its invasion on Japanese soil. Throughout all of recorded Japanese history, never had a foreign invader prevailed in war against the Japanese on Japanese land. The imperial Japanese government of that time used this when they sent fighters to Iwo jima. These fighters were to ordered to "fight to the death" defending their country. That to loose and not die fighting would bring disgrace to self and family. They knew that America was planning to send an overwhelming force and they knew that they were being sent to die. For Americans, Iwo jima was just another far away place and different point in time where American boys were sent and where, unfortunately, some lives were lost fighting for freedom. My god, have we become that blasé about the wars our sons and daughters are being sent to fight in? My wife and I are unique, not typical American movie goers. I'm American, my wife is Japanese. Together, we've visited and cried together at the A-bomb Dome in Hiroshima, and again at the Arizona Memorial in Hawaii. I have relatives who fought in the Pacific, she also has family who fought in the war and who lived in Hroshima. I have two sons now serving in the US Marines. Together my wife and I watched and enjoyed both movies. The movies really didn't bring anything new, historically, to us about Iwo jima. But, the movies did do an excellent job reminding us that the ones who pay the price for war are normal everyday people. People who really don't understand the reasons or the politics behind why they are being sent to die. People who live, love, and are loved by family and friends. People with dreams and ambitions. But, for some reason when called by the leaders of the time, they go forward, obey orders, and do their duty. Sometimes, paying the ultimate price.I've grown up with Clint Eastwood and it has been a wonderful entertaining journey. These two movies are, in my opinion, his best. Not because of the action, or the drama, or any of the other things that Clint Eastwood is known for, but because he's given us two interlinked stories about the affects of war on the people who are called to pay the ultimate price ? people like you and me. We may be from different cultures, eat different food, speak different languages, prey to God differently, but we all have things in common. We all live, love, want to be loved, and we dream about and long for peace. And, sometimes we are called to serve and pay for the opportunity. Thank you Clint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did it really last two and a half hours? It felt felt a lot shorter than that.No, this is not an action war film with nonstop blood baths. It is a film that pulls the humanity out of the monster that is war.This is one of, if not the best, movie ever directed by Clint Eastwood. I usually have a hard time following plots with many characters because they make me lose focus on the general story, but this one is done well. Not only am I engaged, I also become attached to every character and feel and understand their conflicts.It does not matter who fights on the right or wrong side of WWII. This film goes beyond that. It is about what is right or wrong for the individual human being. It excels as a story about the human heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this film twice already this week (first week of release here in Japan). I am an American living in Japan for the past twenty two years and have yet to see such a strong performance from an (almost) all-Japanese cast. This movie draws you into the caves and makes you a part of the Japanese soldier's life. The main characters all have an interesting story to tell. But in the end the message is clear. War is futile.The strangest part of all. Clint Eastwood has made a Japanese movie that the Japanese should have made. There is almost no way to tell it was a "foriegn" production until you see the credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't listen to the people who call this movie inaccurate or revisionist history.The movie is accurate. There were people on both sides of the war who at times showed kindness.Labeling all the Japanese soldiers as people who tortured POWS would be like saying all American soldiers in Vietnam killed and rape innocent Vietnamese. Or all American soldiers in Cuba tortured POWS from the wars in the Middle East. You can't group people together like that.This movie shows better than any other film that there's really no good guys or bad guys when it comes to war. War is just pointless.The movie is not supposed to be a documentary so the people who bash it for little details should go rent a documentary if thats what they want to see.Also, Clint Eastwood deserves major credit for telling both sides of the war. Too many war movies always show the enemy as "heartless monsters" when it reality its never like that.This is without a doubt the best movie of the year. Make sure you go see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest War Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the second half of "Letters from Iwo Jima," a group of Japanese soldiers find an American who has been badly wounded and take him into their cave. Their general speaks English, so he begins talking to this soldier, whose name we later find out is Sam. Although the two men should be sworn to kill each other, they are able to have a connection in the one conversation they have. A while later, the general comes back into the room only to discover that Sam's wounds have killed him. He searches him for a while and discovers a letter written by his mother. The letter is full of words that truly come from the heart of this kid's mother, and by the time the general finishes reading the letter, every soldier in that cave has realized that Americans aren't these savages; these hate-driven murderers. No, they all realize that Americans are exactly like they are, and that they don't want to be there and want to return home safely just like their enemies. I believe the point that Clint Eastwood is making with his Iwo Jima saga is just this: these two enemies were far more alike than they had imagined and they were both fighting only in hopes of returning home safely to their family. As for the specific film itself. In just about every way imaginable, this absolutely brilliant film is a step up from "Flags of our Fathers" (which is not something I say easily, as "Flags" is a terrific film in my opinion). From the acting of the incredible ensemble cast (most notably from Ken Watanabe's Oscar-worthy performance), to the film's delicate but powerful script, to the beautiful imagery of the film (the color distortion could not be any more brilliant than it is here), to Clint Eastwood's absolutely perfect knowledge of film and what works in a film like this. Many people are wondering whether this will be able to compete for Best Picture at the Oscars this year. It is true that just about all of the film is spoken in Japanese, but the truth is that Eastwood has created nothing short of a masterpiece with this work, and a foreign language doesn't even come close to making that extremely obvious. I think that this film is very comparable in quality to Steven Spielberg's (who is one of the producers of the film) "Saving Private Ryan." Although Spielberg's film has more entertainment value (as it features more action) and has an opening scene that cannot be contended with, Eastwood sends out an even more powerful message about war than Spielberg did, as it turns out that watching soldiers battle with no way out makes you feel the pains of war more than watching the soldiers on the invading side of the army. The fact that "Ryan" was able to strongly compete for Best Picture (and just about win the award) makes me very certain that this film has great chances, even if Martin Scorsese seems to be tough to beat at this point. What I think allows this to compete with "The Departed" is the fact that this film doesn't take the "cool" route that Scorsese took, which isn't something that the Academy has honored in the past. The score, written by Kyle Eastwood (Clint's son), captures the feel of the movie better than any score written for any movie this year. It is very quiet music, but listening to it makes you think about all the people that die as victims of war. To sum it all up, "Letters from Iwo Jima" is one of the greatest war films ever made, and is easily does the best job of depicting war as something that harms all involved that I have ever seen. Clint Eastwood has, with this achievement, engraved his name as one of the greatest American directors in film history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unlike 'Flags', this time Clint Eastwood's war epic has more cohesion in its complexities, and a stronger punch with its theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was worth it for producer/director Clint Eastwood to tackle on a second part to his now two-part duo of Iwo Jima movies. With Flags of Our Fathers Eastwood tried for very ambitious ground in covering what it's like for Americans to fight a war worth fighting for but with life's value undermined in the scope of preserving the 'grander' scheme of things like the flag on the mountain. Unfortunately, the screenplay with that film was also muddled and denied Eastwood's usually assured hand as a storyteller and conveyor of proper moods. But with Letters From Iwo Jima, a slightly radical departure from the usual American-directed war picture by showing the action totally from the side of the "other", there's a stronger sense of what it meant for the Japanese to fight this war, and the nature of sacrifice and what it means to oneself in relation to one's society, national pride, and to one's mind-set. And, this time, the screenplay doesn't do TOO MUCH of a jumping-around method with the narrative. It's visceral in scope and personal in tone, and there's always an assured hand in dealing with the performances and characters.We're also shown, unlike in other war films, how the home-field advantage doesn't always yield positive results. Even though the Japanese had Iwo Jima, and had the capabilities to defend it for a little while, without reinforcements it would be all for not (this is compounded with some of the most tragic irony when towards the end the General Kuribayashi listens to a radio broadcast of children singing a song meant for hope of success in a battle that those on the mainland have already abandoned). No matter what though Kuribayashi believes in his men, no matter how in spots morale is already low when the digging on the beaches begin. Saigo, a lowly peasant, is a part of the fight, and for chunks of the film we see the battle from where he stands, even as he doesn't look on it too optimistically. Plans are made, the General orders for tunnels to be dug in the center of the island against advisement (though under good thought to do so), and then even before the ships and huge fleet of troops land comes the bombs from the air. The desperation, as the battle continues and trudges on, becomes almost too crushing for the weakest of the soldiers, and soon all thoughts of cohesion within the ranks breaks apart.It's in many of these scenes that Eastwood garners his most dramatically charged moments in either one of the Iwo Jima movies. Maybe it's almost too easy though- when seeing this movie, taking out of context what was shown in 'Flags', one might think that the Americans had the battle on a silver platter. But taken back into context there's a greater sense of loss on the enemy side, not just of life but of what it means to fight for a cause that is never totally explained, to an Emperor practically all of these soldiers wont see or meet, and that to kill oneself is a brave act against the odds. The scene where many soldiers in the cave kill themselves with grenades- and then with two of the soldiers finally deciding that this is insanity and fleeing from the bodies- is very affecting. Then added to this, we see the letters being written, how the humanity of these people can never be denied no matter how hopeless their situation seemed to get. Sometimes we're also provided with flashbacks for some of the characters (some, like a man talking to his unborn child in his wife's womb, are too atypical, but there is one that leaves a very lasting impression involving the murdering of a dog- a scene that left people in the theater gasping even after so much battle carnage already happened).Though mostly we're stuck in these caves and tunnels with these soldiers- one of the exceptions of this, Shimizu, was in said scene with the dog- there are other small vignettes, like the lieutenant who decides to break away to strap some explosives on himself to blow up an enemy cannon, only to fall asleep, and once awakened forgetting the whole act. And, of course, the ones who could not think of any other way- in fact seeing it treasonous otherwise- than to not sacrifice oneself for the homeland. All the while the acting is always competent, sometimes even ranging into the brilliant, and with Ken Watanabe delivering some of the finest notes of emotion (and also holding back emotion or hiding a real emotion) that I've seen from him thus far. And as far as the technical side, Eastwood and his crew have created an appropriately very dark looking picture, with the color desaturated so as to look like it's not really black and white but as if the life has been sucked out so as to look terminally gray (if that makes sense), with the battle footage somehow even more convincing than in 'Flags'.So in the end, the two Iwo Jima movies bring up a lot to ponder about what it is to fight in war, what it means to be akin to the varying degrees of nationalism, and how it affects the psyche of people who were plucked from very normal lives into circumstances of perpetual death and, if one lives, the memories. While one doesn't really need the framing of it being 2005 at the end and beginning of the film, there's enough here to mark it as a significant, fascinating achievement for the filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood Has Done It Again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the age of 74, Clint Eastwood became the oldest person to win the Best Director Oscar for "Million Dollar Baby". With his new movie; "Letters From Iwo Jima," it looks like he might set the record even higher.In "Flags of of our Fathers" we look into the horribly graphic War World II from the American point of view. In the movie which was filmed back to back with "Flags of our Fathers," in "Letters to Iwo Jima" we see it how it was for the opposing Japanese side.Letters from Iwo Jima is a truly incredible, yet horrifying experience. The film seemingly pulls the audience into the middle of the war, with explosions and bullets going off everywhere, and disturbing screams of agony coming from the wounded soldiers. The film can be confusing at times, with the Japanese language and sudden attacks and explosions, but things are all cleared up at the end.Eastwood has really outdone himself this time, at the age of 76 years he has created one of the best (if not the best) war films in history. During the two and a half hours not once did I look at watch, nor did the film begin to drag. Letters from Iwo Jima is a true masterpiece, possibly even the best film of 2006.9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not since Akira Kurosawa's "Rashômon" has anyone attained such exquisite insight into the human condition, having read "Flags of our Fathers" and growing up, having veterans tell me of their experiences on Iwo Jima,I would look back at them in awe at the fact that they were here sharing their very own story,and many times they to could not believe they were alive.It is amazing to see the sensitivity that Mr.Eastwood imbued into both tales. The scriptwriter Iris Yamashita brought me to tears only at the end of the film with the conundrum we still live with today.Peoples dreams are both sacred and profane and lives are cheap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The landscape of war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The companion film to "Flags of Our Fathers" shows the battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese point of view. Starting with the building of fortifications, hiding from relentless bombardment, and fending off an equally strong attack as American troops land on the island."Letters from Iwo Jima" just like "Flags of Our Fathers" is a first rate war movie with a relevant message with its critical nature. "Flags" showed the selling of war and "Letters" does the same, albeit with a different mind-set. Japan was an empire governed by a monarch back then so the military mentality was quite different, but it is also important to note the similarities. Especially at the base of the social pyramid where it is quite apparent that people are people no matter where you go.Virtually all of the uber-patriotic tendencies that were rampant in Imperial Japan during WWII were also in Nazi Germany and, as both "Flags" and "Letters" demonstrate in the United States as well. People were used for the purpose of the government and were fed propaganda just the same. Maybe a different in a different form, but in the end it is all the same.Ken Wantanbe is the film's highlight as a military man torn between his sense of duty and his inner feelings. As commander of the island he sees amongst his men the fanaticism, the pacifism, the "just do our job" crowd, and many other configurations of thought in between and mixed with the others. Even strange that some men initially want to fight and are proud to serve in the military and what's shocking is that some of their wives and mothers believe the same.That paints a landscape of war as something amidst all of the stereotypes that have been made of it. Since that is where the truth usually lies, amidst all the gray matter. --- 9/10Rated R: war violence/carnage</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film hits in almost every aspect, except it misses in??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?? the entertainment aspect.While "Letters from Iwo Jima" is truly a great achievement is several ways, the script is powerful, the production is superb, all the technical departments almost perfected their jobs, there is some really good acting as well, and Eastwood's touch as a director is very visible, and its beautiful, it flaws almost flawlessly in this regard.Well, what's wrong then? It simply lacks what makes it a really interesting movie. "Letters" starts with a present day scene of excavators digging up remains of the war in Iwo Jima, and finding letters in a cave that were written by Japanese soldiers and officers during the war on Iwo Jima island, it then travels back in time to WWII and story revolves around those whom their letters were found during the dawn of the American invasion on that island. Slowly, the movie loses its grip over its audience, becoming something closer to an audio book, and survival becomes a repetitive process!!!Everyone seem to be praising the film for being told from the other side, and its true you don't see that many American film makers do that, and although the film didn't just speak Japanese, it lived and breathed Japanese, it couldn't escape the limited framework of Hollywood, this is very visible through the "good" characters, all the good, honest or lovable Japanese characters were either American sympathizers who lived in the US for a while and kept saying how a great nation the US is, or are Japanese people that do not care for the Imperial system and would not mind handing over the island to their rival Americans. On the other hand, all Japanese loyalists were mean American haters. Even the resolution of the strict Imperial soldiers was that the Americans were not as evil as they were told. But still, everyone was very fond of the fact that the movie was told completely from a Japanese point of view. However, just because Eastwood is an American film maker making a Japanese-point-of-view movie, doesn't make the film any better than what it really is, the film's ratings seem to be getting higher just because there is an American film maker behind it and I disagree, it is what it is regardless who the people behind it were.The film was also highly praised as a companion film to "Flags", and while together they form a great duo, on its own, "Letters" does not achieve greatness.Why did Eastwood and Spielberg decide to make "Letters from Iwo Jima" this calm instead of making an adrenaline-pumping film? My guess is that they did not care about the average audience and the commercial success as much as they did care for the story's integrity.Majd Selbi</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I couldn't talk for an hour after seeing this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My family went to the movies every week back in the 1940's when I was a young kid. Before each movie there was a newsreel. One newsreel which made an indelible impression on me contained footage of the battle on Iwo Jima. It showed terrifying images of U.S. soldiers using flamethrowers, aiming them in the caves the Japanese soldiers had hidden in. When a Japanese soldier ran from the cave, his hands up, his whole body engulfed in flames, the audience in our theater applauded and cheered. I was horrified and have never forgotten the awful feeling I had then. I was only nine.When I saw the same scene enacted in "Letters from Iwo Jima", I was taken back to that time so long ago and I relived the extreme sadness I felt then, but even more so. Tears flowed during the rest of the movie. I couldn't talk for an hour afterward as I was grieving so.This movie is honest and truthful, a must see for those who feel that war is the answer to anything.I used to think Clint Eastwood was a "crybaby" when I watched Rowdy Yates in the first episodes of "Rawhide". Now, I believe Clint is one of the best things to come out of "Hollywood" ever!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Foreign Movies Can Do if Funded Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so good. Probably even great. Like other movies it shows the horrors of war. Letters From Iwo Jima gives a real genuine feeling too it. You really feel scared for all the characters involved. By no means is it stating something new by showing the negatives of war but what it does have that other anti-war movies don't show well. It is realistic more than anything, it shows the past lives of the soldiers briefly yet it feels like you know so much about the character. This movie is the Platoon of this decade.The directing was great in this movie. Clint Eastwood does such a masterful job here. Showing landscapes of the island, the incredibly large fleet of the U.S. He really is able to teach you some history in this film without having to state facts. Usually subplots of characters in these war movies spin out of control and just confuse or bore you. This movie is done just right because of the directing. Eastwood does not put too many characters yet he is able to show the responsibilities and feeling of certain ranks from the general down to a simple private.All of this has to do with great editing. This movie could have easily fallen into a 3 1/2 hour novel/soap opera. Instead the movie jumps from scene to scene so fluidly and consistently that you want to see more and more.The acting was great. Ken Watanabe led a pretty much unknown cast(at least to me) giving great conventional yet original portrayals to their roles. The acting made it so easy to get into this movie and the characters. Ken Watanabe was fantastic in here perfectly displaying the pressures of a general. He is able to show how their needs to be some sort of hope to survive, no matter how bad times can be.The music was spectacular. It stuck out so much and gave me as mentioned before such a genuine feeling. Every part of this movie was great and in my opinion is better than some recent World War II such as Saving Private Ryan, A Thin Red Line or anything else that I have seen from the past 10-15 years.You could see that this movie was done so well and with so much feeling. It was not made to impress people but too make a real statement. That is what makes the movie so great. You can see that well funded movies can still be powerful. This movie is a sign of hope from the movie industry that has seemed to become more and more commercial. I know I'am repeating myself but that is because this movie reminds me of such great war movies such as The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Born On the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now and The Killing Fields. These were all powerful movies and this has go to be right up there. Just shows the power of foreign movies when they are actually noticed and somewhat funded. Remember this movie by no means had a big budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Eastern Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to write that "Letters from Iwo Jima" was the perfect bookend to "Flags of Our Fathers" only it isn't. It's MUCH better than "Flags" (even though I liked most of that too). Buster Keaton knew "The General" would be a better movie and he would get more sympathy if his character was on what we knew was the losing side and that goes for "Letters" as well. All along as we meet these interesting characters (well played and well directed) we know that in the end, despite all their efforts they are doomed to failure and most of them will die, with very little chance of survival (the Japanese casualties on Iwo were some 95%). One can't help but sympathize with the baker and other characters whose culture values death before surrender.Eastwood does a marvelous job telling his story with pictures, subtitles and occasional flashbacks. Ken Watenabe is terrific as the island commander. I don't know if a lot of people will see this film (not that many saw "Flags") but they should. It's a great war movie, told from the side of a doomed but courageous enemy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute must see, simply tremendous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After much anticipation I was finally able to see Letters from Iwo Jima. I had left Flags of Our Fathers with a smile on my face saying now that was a great war film and it would be hard to match. Letters from Iwo Jima not only matches Flags of Our Fathers but also surpasses it and went on to tie Saving Private Ryan as the greatest war film I have ever seen. I sat numbed after viewing this film and look forward to watching it again.Unlike its predecessor, Letters from Iwo Jima follows one story line set on the island of Iwo Jima. Saigo is a baker who was recruited into the Imperial Army of Japan and is stationed on Iwo Jima. General Kuribayashi soon arrives and takes command of the poorly fortified island. Tensions develop between army commanders and Kuribayashi as he fortifies a plan to defend the island. Soon the battle begins when a massive American Fleet arrives planning to take the island within 5 days. Kuribayashi is determined to inflict as much damage and loss of life upon the American's before he will give up the island. The whole while Saigo and his comrades write numerous letters home in the hopes of getting some sense of what home is.The film is terribly realistic and loaded with violence. However, in no way does Letters from Iwo Jima glorify warfare. Eastwood portrays battles for what they truly are bloody and horrific. We are shown everything from men being lit on fire to being blown to bits to suicides by grenades. We are shown the true futility of war and how each side understands so little about the other. The film is a great message of anti-war just through showing what war truly is: bombardments, death, destruction, and bloody.Kazunari Ninomiya to my big surprise is a member of a Japanese boy band. When I went to read through the profiles of some of the actors I expected to see a long list of films but was amazed to only find a few films and the bit about him being a member of Arashi (the band). Ninomiya does a fantastic job. We really feel for him but he is not made out to be entirely sympathetic. He shows much disdain for some people around him and occasionally runs his mouth toward fellow comrades, especially Shimizu. Saigo is a very believable character and Ninomiya portrays him quite well. I applaud his performance.Ken Watanabe gives perhaps the performance of his career. His stunning deliverance of lines and the sheer look of him on the screen is enough to make a viewer sit up and listen to everything he has to say. He gives off the true sense of a man who is a great military commander but also a human being. We are shown him writing home and also told of some of his past. It is quite moving to hear his views on the war, the battle, and of his men. Kuribayashi is one of my favorite military men in history and Watanabe did a great portrayal of him.Ryo Kase closes out the lead actors. He is a silent fellow who is looked on with much disdain from Saigo. Saigo believes Shimizu to be a member Kempeitai (the very strict and often corrupt military police of Imperial Japan). This story is eventually expanded on later in the film. I felt the most sympathy for Shimizu for he had no intention of coming to the island, is not liked by anyone for an assumption by two fellow soldiers, and represents some of the ignorance that was put into soldiers back in World War II, viewing the enemy as savages though he later states "he knows nothing of the enemy."What the movie does so well is its portrayal of humanity and the ignorance that is at the root of international conflicts. The film portrays both the good and the bad of the Imperial Japanese Army. The good side being Lt. Col. Nishi and the bad being Lt. Ito. We come to realize that most Hollywood films that make the Japanese Army out to be savages are dead wrong and that both sides on a war are very much human. The most poignant scene by far involves this when Nishi cares for and speaks with a dying Marine. It shows that understanding must occur for anyone to have peace with another in the world.Letters from Iwo Jima is a powerful film. We are shown the good and the bad of both sides. The film is about 98% in Japanese with three or four scenes spoken in English. The cast is all Japanese which was a must for the film giving it a more authentic feel to it. The battles are gritty and real and will shake you up. By far a tremendous film with an amazing message of humanity and survival. The one message I got from it the most was, as spoken by Lt. Col. Nishi: "Do what is right because it is right."5/5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the conclusion of the film a person behind me said, "Incredible," twice. Another person followed with, "A masterpiece." I would concur. Perhaps it isn't a perfect film but it is a movie with great impact. I find that it is a testament to the skill of Clint Eastwood as a director and Iris Yamashita as screenwriter that some of the scenes that had the greatest impact were of minor things?a letter read out loud, the way someone saluted, a tear, a song...There were no clear cut heroes or villains beyond "war" itself. I'm reminded of that saying, "No one wins a war. One side simply loses more than the other." War diminishes us all. We must learn to turn our backs on such endeavors even if it means that the military/industrial death merchants take a cut in profits or that they truly learn to hammer swords into plow shares.If the film were to depict the battle in a manner that was realistically experienced by the soldiers the film would be unbearable to any viewer. One must see the battle and history as a kind of allegorical backdrop to a story about the utter inhumanity and futility of war. As a film it had to illustrate the overall societal insanity of war through a human lens, and it did this in a deeply moving way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kuribayashi's Character is Nailed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because my late father fought on Iwo Jima, I have always been a student of the battle. I've studied the character and tactics of General Kuribayashi since elementary school and Eastwood's film and Ken Wanatabe's portrayal have embodied every notion I ever had of the general. I loved "Flags of Our Fathers" and plan to own it when it becomes available, but "Letters" is a better film. In spite of the English subtitles, "Letters" flows on screen more evenly than "Flags" and exhibits an equal dose of individual human emotions. The plight of the individual soldier in war is universal regardless of the evil or good his leaders exhibit. While some soldiers are unusually cruel, most just want to go home in one piece. This film teaches that beautifully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo JimaThere is only one word to describe this movie: INCREDIBLE. I am a huge Martin Scorsese fan and I thought he deserved Best Director. However, Letters from Iwo Jima deserved Best Picture. This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Anyone who has a heart will feel a bit of sympathy for the Japanese. This is one of the few movies I've ever seen that brings a tear to my eye.Plot: This movie deals with the Japanese side of Iwo Jima. It shows how the Japanese army fought and shows how they suffered probably more than any military in the entire war. The Japanese were dedicated and probably the best fighters in the entire war. Except for a few scenes the movie is all in Japanese but that doesn't take away from the power and impact this movie has.Acting: The acting is great. Ken Watanabe gave a fantastic performance as General Kuribyashi. The one who played Saigo gave just as good if not a better performance making a sympathetic character who just wants to go home.Genre/Quality: This is probably the most emotionally effecting and powerful movie I've ever seen. Never has a movie effected me like this. Never has a war film shown the horror of war like this before. The music was the same throughout the entire movie but it had a great impact. They had a piano and trumpet version. It sounded like a funeral which fit perfectly because Iwo Jima was lost before it even started. The sound editing is great (won Academy Award). The battle scenes are very well done. The only flaw was that they didn't show a timeline. The Japanese held the island for 36 days but it seems like 5. The only other flaw is that they don't make clear exactly how many men there are.This is probably the most emotionally powerful movie I've ever seen. It has a greater emotional impact than any movie I've ever seen. With a strong story, great acting, and a good message against war, this is a must see movie for everyone.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new kind of war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know Flags of our Fathers sort of went out with a whimper and wasn't entirely well received by critics and audiences despite the hype and anticipation after Eastwood's last string of movies, but I personally liked it ? a lot, even. I thought it was a brilliant study of heroism in wartime as the American people see it as opposed to what true heroism in the immediate reality of the battlefield. It served both as an intricate study of the affects of post-war heroism as imposed on three people just because they lifted a flag, and also as a detailed and fascinating account of US Army politics during World War II and a chronicling of the legendary battle on Iwo Jima and the subsequent media frenzy over the photograph taken there. I'll admit, though, the film suffered from some flaws, one major one being a total lack of deep and interesting characters, which in turn kept us the audience distanced from the events unfolding in the film. And then Eastwood hit us with his companion piece, Letters from Iwo Jima, which chronicles the same battle from the Japanese side. And with Iris Yamashita's beautiful and resonant screenplay, Eastwood makes up for all the flaws in the previous film and fills in the gaps ? If anything, Letters from Iwo Jima completes and deepens Flags of our Fathers, but also, and perhaps subsequently, improves upon it greatly.Truly the greatest asset of the film and the one that really separates it from Flags of our Fathers is its emphasis on the human angle. The film truly is a fascinating character study, with emphasis on General Kuribayashi, Saigo the baker, and others. Their characters are so well rounded and fleshed out it's practically impossible not to feel an immediate connection, which, as I mentioned, I felt was the biggest flaw in Flags of our Fathers. These aspects come out in full force in Iris Yamashita's brilliant screenplay. Eastwood and Yamashita take such delicate care to develop these characters and round them out, it's impossible not to be affected by them. We are treated with flashbacks that further detail how some of the characters arrived on the island and what they were like before, and we see perfectly just how deteriorated they are after being sent to war. Alongside the characters' stories, though, we are treated with the chronological unfolding of the battle on the island from the Japanese perspective. As an educational tool and an historic chronicle, the film also works wonders, as it taught me a lot about the Japanese side of the battle and just how they were prepared and conducted.The acting is truly phenomenal. All of the actors do incredible, extraordinary work, although I must single out two actors in particular who really blew me away. The first is Ken Watanabe. I haven't seen any of his native work, but I can safely say based upon his American studio work (The Last Samurai, Memoirs of a Geisha and of course this film) that the man is a force to be reckoned with. I simply hope that he is not reduced to roles in vain of Chow Yun-Fat or Jet Li in their American films. He adds such an atmosphere of wisdom, intelligence and determination ? quite the opposite of how the Japanese enemy is usually portrayed in WWII films. His character is entirely human and not reduced to a suicidal, angry general type, which is probably what many people would expect. The second is Kazunari Ninomiya, who plays Saigo. What a heartbreaking performance this actor provides. He is small, scrawny, not built for war. He has trouble fitting in. His expression is that of constant exhaustion. But his determination to live and to honour his general over himself is touching and fascinating to watch. His delivery and performance in general is absolutely stunning.In terms of themes, the most intricate and important aspect of the film is its examination of the psyche of the warfare itself. In Flags of our Fathers, like in his earlier films such as Unforgiven, Eastwood portrays an examination and dissection of heroism and what it meant both for those who are labeled heroes and those who did the labeling. With Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood studies the exact opposite of the spectrum; glory. It's almost as if Eastwood is more fascinated with the Japanese comprehension of heroism than the American one. The Japanese soldiers in the film don't have such a thing as heroism to begin with. What they do have is glory and honour. They accept their clear and present defeat with humbleness and modesty, perhaps too much so as they rather take their own lives than fall into the hands of the enemy. If Flags of our Fathers was a criticism of wartime splendor and heroism, Letters from Iwo Jima is a modest glorification of these elements.In all, with Letters from Iwo Jima, Eastwood creates a new kind of war film that stands quite apart from its counterparts both because it portrays the side of the enemy but also and especially because it takes extra special care in emphasizing the human aspect of the soldiers it depicts, humanizing and characterizing them to endless extent. As a psychological study of warfare and as a history lesson, Eastwood has crafted a truly masterful and meaningful piece that's riveting and fascinating as it is intricate and complex. One of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Eastwood Holds Up a Mirror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite how embarrassing and condemning it may be, I am going to honestly explain how I felt while watching this movie.About a half hour through, I realized, with some horror, I really didn't care about any of the characters. It wasn't that they were portrayed poorly, they were plenty convincing and even interesting. I was certainly curious about what was going to happen to them, but curiosity is where it stopped. I shared no emotional or sympathetic bond with any character, I did not need for any of them to survive, I did not suffer when any fell. I'm not entirely sure why this is. Is it because of cultural differences? Is it because they were speaking another language? I think it must be that somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew I was watching the enemy. These people were in situations, at least sometimes, I could sympathize with and displayed extremely admirable qualities, I just couldn't invest emotionally in anyone. It wasn't until an injured American made his way onto the screen that I could feel my heartstrings being pulled. Granted, that may be because it was the most amazing scene in the movie, but I think it's really because they started speaking in English and talked about places I had heard of before.The film is truly remarkable what it put me through. I've never watched a war movie except through a Western set of heroes and they are generally the victors. Eastwood made me examine myself more thoroughly by being placed somewhere so foreign. I'm not saying my default attachment watching the Japanese is necessarily wrong or immoral (who knew I was so patriotic?), but it was certainly there with me in the theater. I thought myself more enlightened, more a member of the global village. This movie revealed that perhaps I am not. A lesser film, I don't think would have allowed for so much introspection.It is an American that commits the most heinous acts in the movie. The most amoral thing I might have ever seen done on film, and I'm shocked how quickly I thought, "Well war does terrible things to people." If the Japanese had done something comparable (as they do in the companion piece FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, I probably would have thought instead, "What a messed up culture."Why none of these fine actors were nominated for an Academy Award, I don't know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If ever you needed any confirmation on the lack of collective wisdom the AMPAS has, then you only need to see this film and wonder why they let that overrated, overwrought Scorsese gangster flick take home the Oscar for best director.Perhaps there's something exotic about watching a film that veers away from a culture that we are so habituated to watching, well... especially in the context of the POV of a war film.LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, just like "Flags of Our Fathers" excels in portraying humanity in the context of the perils and desperation of war, but this time from the Japanese point of view. It even has one of the most powerful scenes Eastwood has ever put to film in his career, call it "hand grenade hara kiri" or whatever; but that scene is probably what puts the nail in the coffin in my decision to call IWO JIMA a better film than "Flags." Combine that with his minimal but effective use of CG in capturing the epic scope of the battles, and IWO JIMA is an instant masterpiece. Like most of Eastwood's films - IWO JIMA is ultimately a tragedy... a tragedy of human frailty and our limitations, our need to reach out... and perhaps our need for salvation. But it is not a sour-tempered tragedy because it portrays humanity very accurately and matter-of-factly.So indeed Eastwood, despite the AMPAS giving him more than one win of that golden trophy - was still robbed of the Oscar this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece of American cinema (yes, American)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters was brilliant. Letters was almost entirely in Japanese. Letters starred Japanese actors, including the excellent Ken Watanabe. But it was an American production, directed by Clint Eastwood. Set as a Japanese view of the invasion of Iwo Jima, it is the companion film to Flags of Our Fathers. Though Flags was very good, it seems like Eastwood got a better grasp of the setting when he shot Letters. The story was far more convincing, dark and moving. Letters captured the horrors and even boredom of warfare masterfully. The film worked best because it didn't gloss over the Japanese Bushido Code of Warfare, but it also didn't make you feel any less for the main characters. To me, it seemed that the mission of this film was to get western audiences to understand the Japanese view of the Second World War, without apologizing for it. Letters succeeded in this with magnificence and showed the true terror and hopelessness of the Japanese cause by the time the invasion of Iwo occurred and yet had a poetry to it. It was almost as if Eastwood channeled the spirit of the late master of Japanese film, Akira Kurosawa and directed more than a movie, he directed a bleak yet beautiful film. This film was more than just a war film, it was a work of art. It demonstrated the oneness of humanity in our most barbaric and tribal setting. Mr. Eastwood, this was your finest hour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint, you have done it again! Letters from Iwo Jima is a different war film that separates itself from any other war films that is a guaranteed terrific rating. In high school, I wrote a paper on Iwo Jima, it's a war that is very over looked, especially by Americans, all we mostly know is that Iwo Jima is known for the famous image of the American soldiers planting the American flag in victory. Unfortunately, due to the monstrous image that we have created of the Axies powers in WWII, I feel that we have overlooked their history as well, Letters from Iwo Jima captured the "in the other person's shoes" perspective perfectly.Japanese soldiers are preparing for a strong battle to come onto the land of Iwo Jima, defending their land that is about to be invaded by the American troops. It's not a matter of taking sides, but what these soldiers were going through, knowing that they were sure to have a strong chance of death or extreme injury. For a country where pride is extremely precious and if you come off as a coward, you are a traitor to your land, we realize the terror not only from where the Americans were standing, but also the utter feeling of helplessness that the Japanese soldiers were feeling. Wanting to survive, some feel that they may have to just swallow their pride while watching their best friends and family die in front of their eyes.Clint captured perfectly how every side has a story; I am an American, I have extreme pride for where I come from, just like the Japanese did and still do. Both sides have extreme sympathy and hatred from the audience, showing human emotions that everyone could relate too. This film has terrific acting, beautifully disturbing scenery, excellent sound, and just a heart wrenching story that I guarantee if you enjoy history, you will be very proud of this film.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite simply one of the best movies i have ever seen. It left me speechless and in tears. A genuine masterpiece, beautifully shot, beautifully cast, wonderfully acted. There's not much more I can say right now, but I urge you most strongly NOT to miss this movie. Eastwood's direction is impeccable; he quietly and unerringly leads us through the developing crisis of the American assault on the island, and the desperate Japanese defence. There are so many fine performances here, so many unforgettable moments. A measure of the quality of Eastwood's direction is that although the dialogue is almost entirely Japanese supported by English sub-titles, by the end of the film I had entirely ceased to be aware of that fact. This is a really wonderful film; please don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Do not expect to return home alive."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm trying hard to recall the war movies I've seen that offer a balance between the humanity and atrocity of two opposing sides the way "Letters From Iwo Jima" does, and I can't think of one. That is where the film excels, and if one has trouble calling it an anti-war movie, at least it's a pro-life one. The film surpasses Eastwood's tandem effort, "Flags Of Our Fathers" in my estimation, but then, they are two quite different films, even though they have the same historical battle at their core.What's difficult to understand, even as the movie makes clear, is the average Japanese soldiers' willingness to die in battle for honor and duty to the Emperor and homeland. My summary line above was spoken by a Japanese officer, stated without reservation or with intimation of victory or defeat, but as a matter of fact. It's hard to imagine that an entire nation operated on that principal just a little over a half century ago.The vignette pieces of Eastwood's film serve the story well, as the backdrop of the invasion creates a realization that Iwo Jima will fall without additional Japanese troops or air cover to provide reinforcement. Perhaps wisely, the statistics of the thirty six day battle in March, 1945 are intentionally left out. They are grim, of twenty two thousand defenders on Iwo Jima, only 217 prisoners were taken, the rest fell in battle or to suicide to avoid the humiliation of capture by the enemy. American casualties topped six thousand, with another nineteen thousand wounded, requiring the use of whole blood and plasma on a scale never utilized in combat before. Reflecting on those numbers is a totally inadequate exercise and virtually impossible to comprehend, and yet this was a single battle field in the Pacific theater.If you care to learn more of this battle and the war in the Pacific, an excellent resource is the documentary series "Crusade In The Pacific", utilizing film footage from cameramen on both sides of the War. One of the episodes deals with "Bloody Iwo", and the viewer will be stunned as I was to see how closely Eastwood's depiction of the landing, invasion and ensuing battle resembles the real thing. Both the documentary and "Letters" will leave you with the impression that our global leaders still haven't gotten it figured out yet, that war is devastating and senseless, and we never truly learn from the mistakes of the past.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeing both sides of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With "Letters from Iwo Jima" Clint Eastwood completes his diptych presenting the WWII siege and defense of the strategic Japanese island from US and Japanese points of view. Since the two films are meant to comment on each other, it's misguided of some critics to say Letters is disproportionately superior to its predecessor. We need both. Seeing the war from both sides is radical, even if some of the statements made, especially in the second film, are conventional. And an American film made in Japanese about Japanese soldiers must be pretty unusual.Apart from the difference that the Japanese were defending a losing position and the well-equipped Americans were on the march, the two films approach their subjects with different aims. Flags of Iwo Jima exposes the ad-campaign falsification of warfare by honing in on the way the iconic flag-planting photo was used. The approach of "Flags" seems especially relevant to Americans in this day of big media manipulation and elective war. There's also plenty of breathtaking battle footage, especially surrounding the medic played by Ryan Phillippe, but this is an unusual kind of war film, with its ironic contrasts of heroic promotional images with the grim memories of the actual combat."Letters" has personal digressions but its main focus is combat throughout. Officers (Ken Watanabe, Tsuyshi Ihara, Shido Nakamujra, Hiroshi Watanabe and others) and footsolodiers (Kazunari Ninomiya, Yuki Matsuzuki and others) are seen from setup on the island to defeat there. The letters come in voiceovers, and a cache of them is seen being found much later, having been buried by the omnipresent Saigo (Ninomiya), a boyish baker with a pregnant wife back at home. Saigo's importance in the film is a victory for the little guy. He's not especially brave or anything but his sheer survival leads the general to call him "a good soldier." Among the higher ups, there's much attention to conflicting outlooks on how the defense should be mounted and, as defeat approaches, how individual soldiers ought to behave.Unlike the Americans, the Japanese went to war fully expecting to die, and conditioned to believe it noble to do so. Since their situation is already beginning to appear hopeless, that viewpoint is not unfitting. Ironically they seem far more formidable at the early stages of the American siege seen in Flags than they do in the second film: their emplacements are high and concealed, and the Yanks can't get at them or even spot them at first. But the Japanese in "Letters from Iwo Jima" see themselves as trapped in "caves," and when they can't get reinforcements, they are doomed. The conflict is between traditional soldiers or officers who simply want to stay and die nobly, and the more modern and American-oriented general Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) who wants defeated units to regroup in new locations."Letters from Iwo Jima" was based in part on a book of found letters, but written in collaboration with Paul Haggis by a Japanese-American, Iris Yamashita. Except for brief dialogue with a doughboy prisoner from Oklahoma, the film is in all in Japanese, but perhaps understandably the screenplay "cheats" on us by weaving American points of view into the story in ways that would be unlikely were this a strictly Japanese production. The lieutenant general has fond memories of time spent in the US, and he chooses to move defeated units to new locations on the island, opposing more traditional officers who want to stay in place and die. Likewise the Joe-soldier character, little baker boy Saigo (played winningly by pop star Ninomiya) is horrified when, convinced that their position is lost, half a dozen members of his unit blow themselves up with grenades in an improvised version of Japanese ritual suicide. He, as the general would wish, moves to a new location. And Saigo is the ultimate survivor. He's not noble; with his pregnant wife to go back to and support, he's just the symbol of life going on when war is over.The strongest moment in the film, perhaps, in taking an unexpected point of view, is when an American soldier does something quite dastardly to one of the Japanese soldiers we've come to know. Except for that chilling moment, it would be difficult to forget this is an American movie, however original it is to shoot about the Japanese experience.In the end, this isn't really an anti-war diptych, but one that sees war as a profoundly ironic affair full of moral conflict in which duty and principles are out of sync. It's spelled out at the end of Letters through the somewhat over-explicit, but nonetheless effective moment when the general translates a letter from the Oklahoma prisoner's mother, that people are people, and Saigo says he's realized the Yanks weren't evil brutes as they were told. And war is hell. The soldiers get fed up with it.But when soldiers behave nobly and bravely, is that an anti-war message? For me a more effective anti-war film is Bernard Wicki's 1959 "Die Brücke," whose adolescent German platoon at the end of the war is so clearly canon fodder: not much of a chance for bravery and when there is any it's foolish. "War is hell" isn't an original or an especially pacifistic angle. Maybe it's only by seeing narratives of a particular war in a large context that this stance can emerge clearly. In that sense it was essential for Eastwood to tell the story in English and Japanese and he's approached an understanding that the creation of an "enemy" is a manipulation of the people by the powers that be. Letters is conventional, but in both films Eastwood has done something original. He may not have achieved greatness, but he has maintained high quality, and the double-barreled approach is impressive and achieves something of a revisionist look at WWII</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually we see American made films and they follow a certain pattern, while foreign films seem to us being from 'left field.' This film was more foreign, not because of sub titles and language, but of HOW it was made. We are seeing the characters though eyes that we are not used to seeing from. This is quite similar to "All Quiet on the Western Front" in how we are sympathetic to the principals.One is glued to the screen from EVERY scene. The 'reality' of the action is very strong and moving. We almost feel what it is like being Japanese.The sound quality is superb! When the bombs are falling from planes it is like being there, having been a veteran myself.This movie should be nominated as best picture at the Acadmy Awards.

When you re-enter yourself, you feel immersed in this spectacular movie-making glory, and sit to watch the credits to take it all in. I do not speak Japanese, but the power of this film made me forget, and I have never experienced this before.Clint Eastwood is clearly the mastermind of modern movie-making, and I hope he continues his work with war films.

		<fullReview>Although I enjoyed Flags, it really is, to me, just a companion piece to Iwo, simply to show the battle from the American side.From his entrance, Ken Watanabe is compelling and charismatic as the doomed commander of Iwo, who despite his considerable military skill, knows the battle, and indeed the war, is over. Yet for his family and for his homeland he will fight and die.Ken Watanabe's portrayal of Kuribayashi was spot on - I really liked his walk around the island when he first arrived, in particular the order to move the artillery etc off the beach. And his telling them to hold their fire til the beach is full...the smart thing to do, I mean, why not? The Americans were hardly about to turn back...In fact, that is where this film draws its power - the fact that we know the Americans are there to take the island and they are not leaving til it's theirs. The weight bearing down is evident when Saigo ventures outside to see the "30...maybe even 50" American ships, and once he's outside, discovering there are a whole lot more than 50...I particularly liked Saigo's journey from Suribachi to the north tunnels. The flashbacks to Saigo's family life were genuinely moving...you could see why he was so keen to stay alive! This film is shot in a washed-out sort of colour that gives it the look of that rare colour footage from the war...adding a kind of documentary realism.The battle sequences were also filmed very well. Unlike Flags, there was never really a "big picture" view of the battle itself, we simply see it through the eyes of the various protagonists.Far from being the "greatest war movie ever made", Iwo is definitely well worth a look.You don't need to have seen Flags to appreciate or understand this one, so my advice is if you are not generally a war film fan but are interested in these films, make Iwo the one you check out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartfelt, well-judged and an incredibly moving piece of work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The sister movie to Clint Eastwood's Flags Of Our Fathers, Letters From Iwo Jima tells the parallel to that story, from the point of view of the Japanese troops. On paper it looked like nothing more than a straightforward war movie, with nothing terribly fresh to say about the WWII conflicts that hadn't been dealt a few screen blows before. Instead what we have an incredibly visceral, grimly foreboding but intensely moving film, that depicts the often overlooked "faceless" Japanese.Whilst the movie has several character strands, it focuses mainly on the journey of two soldiers: a grunt called Saigo (Japanese pop star Kazunari Ninomiya) who has been drafted against his will, and General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the honourable leader of the platoon who is given the task of strategising against the impending American forces. There is some doubt as to his allegiance to the Japanese imperial forces, as he once travelled to America, and became acquainted with the way of life there, making many friends in the process. He instructs against the soldiers building trenches on the beaches, and orders caves to be dug in the mountains. His contemporaries are weary of him, but his soldiers admire him, particularly Saigo, whose life he has to save on more than one occasion.Letters From Iwo Jima works better on a conceptual level then Flags Of Our Fathers because of the protagonists of the film. There is a moment at around the half-way point where one of the soldiers has to come out from his cave in order to empty the waste bucket, and just happens to look out to the sea. And to his utter astonishment, the sea is frightfully littered with the biggest fleet of ominous-looking American battleships you could ever hope to see. In Flags Of Our Fathers this was a spectacular sight, but watching here through the eyes of this terrified young foot soldier, it is absolutely frightening. In fact, throughout Eastwood's movie there is an impending sense of doom. We all know how Iwo Jima went, so becoming attached to these characters is all the more heart-rendering. From the very opening of the film we are aware that they are not going to win, and listening to General Kuribayashi receive a radio telegram informing him that there will be no reinforcements sent to Iwo Jima, and that the nominal level of forces they have left will have to fight to the death against an almost impossibly over-sized American driving force. These are soldiers who were instructed to fight to the death; even though winning was no longer an option. At no point does it become preachy, nor does it portray any extreme form of bias from either side of the conflict. I do not think it will strike people as harshly as something like Saving Private Ryan did, but the aura of doom that accompanies the film manages to make Letters From Iwo Jima escape the familiar trappings of war movie déj? vu, and even makes Flags Of Our Fathers feel like a more complete piece of work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Second Look at Iwo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's companion piece to Flags of Our Fathers is the view from the Japanese side regarding the bloody battle for the Island of Iwo Jima. Where Flags is expansive and its protagonists anxious but confident, Letters is claustrophobic and even more desperate in that the Japanese soldiers are clearly expected to die in the island's defense. They are all "dead enders" and what little joy remains in their lives is to be found in brief flashbacks as an overpowering sense of dread permeates the darkened caves in which they take refuge. They are buried before they are dead. Ken Watanabe as Col.Kuribashi, the commander of the island evokes the classic Samurai warrior; stoic, brave, loyal. His entire military career has prepared him for this moment. His sense of duty is impeccable yet he is not void of his humanity. At the other end of the spectrum is the draftee who doesn't see the point. It's clear to him the war is lost and like Yossarian in Catch 22 he is very conscious of the fact he is dealing with two enemies: the Americans and his own fanatical superior officers, martinets girding the troops for one last suicidal Banzai charge. Kazunari Ninomiya plays Saigo with a perplexed resignation. He is truly a universal soldier. Eastwood's direction as always is steady and controlled throughout. A conspicuous lack of self indulgence in so many of his films has made him one of cinemas finest American directors. He is similar to Huston in form and content; a Hemingway of American Film in style and theme. In Letters as in Flags he divides humanity and atrocity, heroism and cowardice evenly in powerfully and convincingly presenting the chaos, futility and horror of war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>somber, thoughtful, excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Letters from Iwo Jima" is a thoughtful portrayal of this horrific battle in which resulted in 26,000 American casualties and 6,000 dead; on the Japanese side, 22,000 died and unbelievably &amp; tragically, only 216 survived (surrendered). "Letters" is told from the Japanese point of view, with the letters sent and received between Japanese troops and commanders and their families, being a central thread throughout.I found the film to be very fair to both sides of the conflict. There were soldiers on both sides who acted brutally and compassionately toward the enemy; soldiers on both sides brave and scared; soldiers on both sides who were fanatics and those who saw no point in the war and just wanted to go home to their loved ones.It is also fairly accurate (aside from some parts obviously dramatized for film)... for example the captain named "Ito", sick of waiting in caves to die, really did spend 2 days lying in a heap of stinking bodies waiting for a chance to blow up an American tank.Overall, excellent, sensitive and thoughtful. Performances were all great, including Ken Wanatabe from The Last Samurai. Almost more drama than war - not for those who want the action of a "Saving Private Ryan" war movie.My only criticism is the film portrays the soldiers on Iwo Jima as being untrained and kind of "second rate".. after reading a bit on this subject I don't believe this was the case generally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My son is obsessed with Battlefield 2142 and though he's only 13, I think he should watch this movie because it shows exactly what happens to people during war. Through the video game he's been in extreme simulated combat situations but he doesn't know the consequences of all this killing. I've heard a lot of criticism directed towards Paul Haggis for his Crash (too obvious). I think here it's tempered because of his Japanese scriptwriter. Though Eastwood is directing, the movie is quite Japanese and whether its attitude is Japanese or Western, it's a wonderful story. It's certainly made me interested in watching Flags of our Fathers, which people describe as the weaker companion piece, but I'm willing to give it a fair shake on the strength of this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an intimate look at war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the closing credits didn't identify Clint Eastwood as the director of "Letters from Iwo Jima," you might be forgiven for believing you were watching an actual Japanese film - not merely because the dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles but because the movie has a starkness of vision and an intimacy of scope uncharacteristic of mainstream American movie-making. This is Eastwood's flip-side companion piece to the earlier "Flags of Our Fathers," which told the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the American point of view. For this film, Eastwood has shrunk his canvas considerably, populating it with fewer familiar faces and restricting the action almost entirely to the island itself. Indeed, it is this very air of claustrophobia that makes "Letters from Iwo Jima" a more cohesive, personal and meaningful work than the earlier fine film.As the movie begins, the Japanese army is preparing for an American assault on the island. The film focuses on two main characters, one from the upper echelons of the military and one from the grunt class. The former is Tadamichi Kuribayashi, a Lieutenant General who is sent to the site to take command of the forces for the battle to come. Kuribayashi is a compassionate pragmatist who has to deal not only with the enemy battering away at the island with the relentless fury of heavy artillery but the suicidal tendencies of his own men, many of whom subscribe to the belief that it is more honorable to commit hara-kiri than to endure the ignominy of defeat or surrender. The common soldier's eye view is provided by Saigo, a private reluctantly drafted into the army, who would much rather be back at home with his wife and baby daughter than digging trenches on some godforsaken rock in the middle of nowhere, and who feels less eager than his compatriots to sacrifice his life in service of his country.By limiting their scope, Eastwood and screenwriter Iris Yamashita - working from the actual letters Kuribayashi and others sent home from the island - show us the horrors of war on a more personal scale than we generally find in films of this type. We come to identify with the desperation felt by 20,000 soldiers trying to fend off a force of 100,000 without benefit of naval or air support, virtually assured that none of them would ever make it off the island alive. The superb actor Ken Watanabe invests Kuribayashi with a confidence and compassion that makes us understand why the men under his command respect and follow him, and Kazunari Ninomiya perfectly embodies the contradictory nature of the everyman soldier. Torn between duty to self and duty to country, Saigo does what is asked of him yet evinces a much stronger commitment to self-preservation than do many of his buddies who seem all too eager to fall on the sword (or, the modern equivalent, a grenade) to avoid humiliation at the hands of the enemy. Ninomiya, with his openhearted demeanor and impish expression of boyish innocence, provides the emotional center the film needs to connect with the audience.As with "Flags of Our Fathers," cinematographer Tom Stern has bled so much of the color out of the picture that we seem almost to be watching a black-and-white movie, a technique that greatly enhances the bleakness of both the setting and the situation."Letters from Iwo Jima" is not a film designed to appeal to the yahoos in the audience; it is, rather, a stripped-down, thoughtful and artful consideration of the horrors of war as seen through the eyes of "the enemy."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To film Iwo Jima from two perspectives - US and Japan. What a simple idea, and brilliant. What's more, it works! The combined work is not only one of the most effective anti-war films ever shot (except perhaps "The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly"), but also serene &amp; magisterial storytelling on par with The Iliad.The sad-sack Japanese soldier Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) represents all that is good, and lost, in war. As The Man With No Name said in GBU, "I've never seen so many good men wasted."Try to see this film on the big screen. The shot of the flag, tiny in the distance, may be lost on DVD.My father served on Iwo Jima as a Marine Corps tank machinist.

		<shortDescription>Impressive and mature war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the turning of the war, the island of Iwo Jima becomes of key significance for both sides. As the US forces approach the island, General Kuribayashi rearranges the tactics to hold them off. Predicting the point of attack for the US, the Japanese forces forgo the usual beach trenches and instead bed down within caves and tunnels to draw the enemy in and engage in such a way to reduce the advantage they have in numbers and fire power. The men prepare for attack and, as they are pushed back, become increasingly desperate.Along with Flags of Our Fathers, I had intended to watch this in the cinema but missed it due to the speed it passed through. This is perhaps understandable due to the lack of awareness of Iwo Jima in the UK but perhaps it was also the same factors that saw it struggle in the US ? having subtitles, being a war movie and being from the point of view of "them". I suspect it is simply the lack of taste for any film that would not "support the troops" or a public that has enough war on its news without having more in its cinemas. Either way, it is a shame because this is a quality film and in many ways is stronger that its companion because it jumps around a lot less and focuses more on the conflict and less on the wider issues.It is not an easy watch because it doesn't race along ? there is action but it is not exciting so much as it is numbing. Without a lot of emotional hoo-ha, Eastwood simply shows us men dying for what appears to be very little but yet he does this without portraying the losses pointless or worthless. The characters are as well developed as one could expect given the scale and they do provide a personal hook to draw the viewer in. Eastwood directs with respect and a refreshing lack of bias, the slow pace was not a real problem for me as the material was more than able to hold it up. The cast react well to this as well ? Watanabe enjoys his character a lot more than his other recent Hollywood outing in Last Samurai. The ensemble cast around him sees solid performances from Ninomiya, Ihara, Kase, Matsuzaki, Nakamura and pretty much everyone else.Understandably not the film that the Saturday night crowd flocked to but it is an impressive and engaging film. In the material, performances and direction it is roundly solid and lacking needless flair or spectacle and the film is better for it emotionally even if it does contribute to the slow pace. An engaging war film then and yet another impressive directorial outing from Clint Eastwood who just seems to have gotten better with age.</fullReview>

It's really interesting to see how the Japanese side was during the war in an actual movie. The actors are simply amazing and the music is melodic and adds in to the emotion of the movie rather than cheap background music effects. The action is breathtaking in that it's really realistic and doesn't show typical Hollywood action. Loved it!! Too bad this had limited showing in the USA. Buy/rent the DVD, folks!

		<shortDescription>A powerful film driven by brilliant acting and subtle direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst "Flags of our Fathers" was fairly dull, ponderous and uninspiring, Eastwood has made a far better piece of cinema with "Letters From Iwo Jima". The film is a heartfelt and beautiful portrayal of some of the individuals in the battle of Iwo Jima as they fight a hellish conflict towards an almost certain death. It is spectacular, though a little long, and certainly another considerable feat from Eastwood. Where "Flags" was simply rewarding, "Letters" is not just rewarding but also essential.The power of this film is in its performances. Two actors in particular are superb. Ken Watanabe delivers another beautiful, moving and skillful performance as General Kuribayashi. He really is one of the premier actors of our age and should be used more, and given more respect. However, there is a pleasing surprise with the performance of Kazunari Ninomiya who carries a lot of the film. He is brilliant and manages to manipulate the audience into investing an awful amount in his character with what is a very simple performance. The rest of the ensemble fill the film out and there is not a single weak link in what can be seen as a magnificent cast.Eastwood, himself now one of the most influential and important directors in modern film, is strangely anonymous in the film. His direction is subtle and there is no sense of this film being about anything more than the characters. This is quite a considerable achievement and it is one that owes a lot to Paul Haggis and Iris Yamashita whose collaboration on the script produced a wonderful piece of work. The film is also beautifully shot and possesses a haunting and beautiful score and is an all round achievement of some quality.It is not a masterpiece and it should not be seen as anything more than an exceptional and beautiful film. It is a little too long for its own good but ultimately the film's quality transcends any small problems that it has. It is certainly superior to "Flags" and is the one out of the two that should be seen. However it is also a good companion piece to "Flags" and if you have seen the first film of the two than should watch this film as they work well together.Beautiful, haunting, poignant and a great example of what film can achieve, this film is highly recommended and shows what Eastwood, who may well be the finest director of our time, can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See Flags of Our Fathers first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is very well crafted in its own right, but it is as a diptych with Flags of Our Fathers that it achieves a true masterpiece.Both films are compelling in the themes they explore, and perhaps even more so in the larger issues that these historical events influenced. In the back of my mind as I watched this was the thought that these brave / foolhardy men, in their relentless fanaticism, were setting the stage making the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki not only possible, but inevitable. The American soldiers, their families, and government wanted neither to let the Japanese militarists off the hook, nor to continue walking into the meat grinder.How accurately does the story portray actual historical individuals (in the case of "Flags", obviously very much so)? Baron Nishi for one was quite a colorful real person, and the movie rings mostly true regarding him (although it's said that he and Kuribayashi really didn't get along very well). See: aafla.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv11n2/johv11n2o.pdf.I'm disappointed that Kazunari Ninomiya did not win an Oscar for "Best Supporting Actor" -- the range and depth of his Saigo is simply astonishing.A while back I made some donations to the World War II Veterans' Committee, which was deploring how crucial battles like Iwo Jima were being forgotten by the younger generation. It is thus ironic (gratifyingly so) that this one has been turned into such well-directed and well-acted art as two major motion pictures.I would give "Letters" 9.5 but have rounded it to 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima is about the war of Japan and America in which the Japanese Army attempted to save the island of Iwo Jima. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi is the leader of this mission and seems to be suited for this position due to the fact that he had studied in America - thus having a basic understanding of the "enemy" country. The other main character of the story is Saigo, a young soldier who has recently been enlisted and torn away from his wife. Naive but at the same time loyal, Saigo slowly finds his life to be intertwined with that of General Kuribayashi's. There are simply too many amazing aspects of this movie that deserve to be mentioned. The music is fitting to the morose theme of the movie, the cinematography has been done consummately, and the war scenes are quite realistic and thrilling. There is a good balance between the grotesque and the humane part of war. The movie gave off, to me, the same effect as Saving Private Ryan, if not more. The actors are all very suited to their soldierly roles, and there will be some heart-wrenching moments when you'll feel their pain of being away from their families and fighting for a lost cause. However, the Japanese' loyalty to their country definitely shone through in the movie and will gain the respect of the viewers.This is, by no means, a simple war movie. The morale behind this historical recount is that a lost cause is not synonymous with a lost hope. A story of determination and humanity, Letters from Iwo Jima is simply stunning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a beautifully written letter...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Veteran Director Clint Eastwood, comes the second film in his Iwo Jima tales, Letters from Iwo Jima based on the book, "Picture Letters from Commander and Chief." Eastwood joins writers Iris Yamashita and Academy Award winner Paul Haggis to bring this breathtaking film to the silver screen.The film stars Ken Watanabe as "General Tadamichi Kuribayashi" the man who led the Iwo Jima battle on the Japan side. Eastwood brings us stunning imagery of soldiers looking for reasons and redemption. More than its powerful story that film itself is a piece of sheer artistry brought to us by cinematographer, Tom Stern. Eastwood paints the film like his own Sistine Chapel and creates moments that will go down as some of the most humanly moving images of foreign cinema history. His daughter, Kyle Eastwood as well as Michael Stevens create a beautiful score that adds the scenes.The revelation of the picture comes from Kazunari Ninomaya in his breakout role that will likely be remembered as one of the most ignored and beautiful performances of movie history. Time will tell on that, I assure you. Don't believe me? Think about Michael Keaton in My Life, Robert Sean Leonard in Dead Poet's Society or even Kirsten Dunst for Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles. His gorgeous performance very reminiscent of Jeremy Davies in Saving Private Ryan is so real and so effective. He plays "Saigo" a young soldier thrust into battle who thinks more for himself than follows his traditions. He shatters the viewers with his one liners and on-screen chemistry, he bleeds from the screen and onto your lap.The film is surpasses its other half-brother Flags of our Fathers with sympathy, compassion and just all-around artistry. This is Clint Eastwood's most beautiful film to date as an artist and filmmaker. With minor flaws in pacing and other ensemble actors performances, the film soars on many levels.Grade: ***?/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poignant and heart-wrenching - Eastwood's real film about the battle of Iwo Jima</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really do not like Clint Eastwood all that much. Outside of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, I have never cared for his acting or his directing. I can see why he is good at what he does, but that spark that breaks apart the good from the very best, has always seemed to be missing from Eastwood's repertoire. Despite my consistent disappointment, I went and saw Flags of Our Fathers anyway last fall. While it had amazing battle sequences, the movie was just a horribly edited and boring mess. At the time, the rumour was that the companion piece, Letters from Iwo Jima, was infinitely better. Well, it seems I was not the only one who disliked Flags, as the studios moved Letters right up, and now its a Best Picture nominee at the Oscars. But is it deserved? Surprisingly, yes.While Flags spoke about the American point-of-view of the battle in Iwo Jima and the after effects for three soldiers, Letters is about the Japanese side of the battle. Starting with the arrival of General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), the film progresses through the soldiers digging caves right up to the Americans landing on the island. Frequently, it cuts to asides by key characters writing letters to their loved ones, either going into narration, or cutting to a small sequence taking place in the past.Minutes into watching the film, the audience can tell two things. One: its in Japanese with subtitles. Two: the film is edited and flows so much better than Flags. Gone are the confusing and useless flashback sequences of Flags, and in their place, we get a cohesive and focused storyline. Flags wanted to sympathize, condemn and do all sorts of other things while still trying to tell the core story. Letters just wants to try and make sense out of a culture that fought so valiantly, yet have never really had their story told. The subtitles help make the story both feel foreign at first, but gradually feel familiar. It was a great choice to include them. And even though some of the flashback scenes are a little superfluous, they add a great depth to the film, and make it stronger. As well, they feel worthwhile and interesting. They do not just feel like filler material.The most excellent part of Flags were the washed out, drab colours from the battle sequences. Thankfully, they are all back for a second round here. Even before the fight starts, the colours are predicting how much of a ghastly relic Iwo Jima will inevitably become. The visuals are all toned down, and even with the sun, everything still seems to have a darkish hew to it. It gives the picture and background life, and also makes for some excellent continuity between the two films. When the battle starts, the clouds and atmosphere surrounding the island only become darker and stronger. Everything just looks beautifully (in the gritty sense) captured and authentic. Once Eastwood gets right into the handicam motion during the particularly fast-paced running sequences, it only complements the background. I was impressed greatly by some of the effects and the look of Iwo Jima when I watched Flags. In fact, it is what kept me awake. Eastwood excellently made the choice to stay consistent, and Letters benefits greatly from it (albeit with a few blatantly repeating sequences).The script however, could have done with a bit of work. I enjoyed the narratives for the most part, but after a while, they began to slow the film down. I can appreciate the emotions they are trying to evoke, but they could have shortened a little bit and kept the film stronger for longer. The film also goes on for a bit longer than necessary, and probably could have done with less material in the third act. In other extremely rare cases, some scenes just did not feel totally complete. Luckily, the film does not fall into the trap of the propagandist Flags, so these incomplete scenes are nowhere near as bad as they could have been. I did like how the script captured the genuine emotion and heartbreak the men face as they contemplate suicide as an honourable measure. The rawness of these sequences, and just the reactions the actors give are simply magnificent.The acting is very strong. Watanabe, although not in the film as much as I wanted, is astonishing as the all-knowing General. He plays him with a wonderful edge, and a distinct humanity. His confliction over whether to honour his American friends or the Japanese empire is a great method of character study, and is leaps and bounds above any character exposition from Flags. Another standout is Kazunari Ninomiya as the young and impressionable Saigo. We are introduced to him fairly quickly, and the film seems to follow his character and his reactions. He does extremely well for himself, and breathes a fresh life into an otherwise not so interesting character. Having never been to war myself, I would be hard set to not identify with a character like this, and having him portrayed so well only complements it. The majority of the other soldiers have no overly amazing parts, but they all do very well for themselves anyway.On the whole, it has detractors, but the film is all-around so much better than Flags of Our Fathers. This is the picture that Eastwood was meant to make, and probably could have been even stronger if it was a standalone film, and not just a companion piece. It is not perfect by any measure, but it is fairly close to where it needs to be.I was actually impressed.8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be difficult to "spoil" the film: anyone with any grasp of history knows how it ended-with a 95% mortality rate on the Japanese side. Letters from Iwo Jima is good. I need say no more, since you will probably be hearing plenty about it for the next two months. I was very impressed with Flags of Our Fathers, but "Letters" is actually better. Together, they probably constitute the single most painstakingly researched WWII film ever made-at 4.5 hours long. I mean, I can't imagine watching John Wayne in Sands of Iwo Jima now without howls of derisive laughter. Eastwood has managed to make Japanese soldiers sympathetic figures. He did it without invoking the A-bomb, without excessive reference to puppies &amp; kittens (there is one dog), in spite of the unsympathetic personalities of some of the characters, and with a fair amount of detail regarding the Japanese' idealistic attitude toward war, death, themselves, the Emperor, etc. They are painted as having ideals so strong and different from ours (America's) as to make them barely recognizable as a society, in western terms. Still, taken one at a time, they are recognizable as human beings. Ironic.Someone in one of the previous posts here made the very good point that Clint Eastwood has made a film that the Japanese SHOULD HAVE MADE THEMSELVES a long time ago, but haven't. I agree. This film is the most balanced and evenhanded presentation of Japan's actions in WWII that I have seen on screen, and it was made in Japanese, by round-eye gaijin, for American consumption. I hope that it galvanizes some of Japan's excellent directors to do the same for their fellow-countrymen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not having seen Flags of Our Fathers, I'll be unable to make any comparison to its companion-movie. Even on its own Letter to Iwo Jima could be seen as representing the new tendency to "humanise" what were until recently the traditional WW2 villains from an Anglosaxon point of view. History tends to be written by those on the winning side - hence, we have had decades of inhuman German war machines, cowardly Italians and unspeakably cruel Japanese. Now, over 60 years since WW2, it has become acceptable - nay, the done thing if you have a conscience, to humanise the losers and show even the winners as fallible and even individually despicable (***SPOILER:*** see the American soldier who shoots the two Japanese prisoners who've deliberately given themselves over. ***END OF SPOILER***). Letters to Iwo Jima clearly has its heart in the right place: it wants to be objective, above and beyond anything else. And it is. Japanese soldiers have mothers, adorable young pregnant wives in pretty kimonos and sons they write loving letters to. We empathise with them no less than we have with all those American soldiers in an endless string of war movies. Technically, Letters is a well-made movie. It's also genuinely moving in parts - you do end up caring for most of the main players. For my personal taste, though, it spells things out too much and too often. Still, for something produced by Mr Manipulative Spielberg and co-written by Paul "Crash" Haggis, I was impressed.</fullReview>

This movie tells the story of the Japanese men who were on the island, waiting for the inevitable attack. We know it came, we know the outcome, as history tells.The movie depicts the Japanese soldiers as not very different from the American soldiers. In the slow character development we learn that some were bakers, others store owners. One was exiled from an elite branch because he refused to shoot a family's dog that was barking too much back on the mainland.We see that the men preparing for the invasion by the American troops were under-supplied in food, water, ammunition, and air support. Disintery was so bad that some died of it. Most of them knew that they would never go home again.While most of the movie is told in 1944, in Japanese with English subtitles, short scenes in present day, 2005, begin and end the movie. We see Japanese exploring one of the caves that had been used for refuge 50 years earlier during the American bombardment. A buried sack is found, and in it a large number of "letters from Iwo Jima", never having been sent home. Presumably the contents of these letters formed the basis for the story in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing achievement.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters From Iwo Jima is nothing short of a remarkable film. It takes the Japanese perspective in the legendary battle for Iwo Jima, that island that was so critically important to both sides of the conflict. It's not for a second ham-handed or preachy in the way it does it. It shows the humanity and flaws of both sides. One side might have had a more righteous cause, but that doesn't mean the other side is any less human.All the scenes on the island shot in an a very faded greenish-gray hue. It seem very appropriate and gives an emphasize of the darkness, fear, and hell of war. More than anything the contrast gives certain power to flashbacks not shot that way. On all technical levels this film is superb. It has some of the best battle scenes I've seen in a movie since Saving Private Ryan, but it's not the guns and bombs, it's the cinematography and the island itself, that gives the film the biggest visual lift. There's not a poorly shot scene nor an unnecessary one.Top down Letters has many very good performances. I think appropriately there are four characters that are zeroed in on and humanized. Ken Wantanabe is great as the lead General who is loyal to Japan but also questions his commitment and the way things are done in battle. The major characters are all portrayed with some mixed emotions, and varying levels of fear and determination. It's refreshing to see the Japanese in a World War 2 film not universally portrayed as all out fearless kamikaze soldiers, though obviously there's some of that. It doesn't make a claim the two sides were the same, but does well to emphasize the ways they are alike.In all I think Letter From Iwo Jima ranks as one of the 10 best war films I have ever seen. Is it perfect history? Well try to find a war movie that is because I don't think it exists. It is a near perfect movie. An emotional, historical, and technical triumph. A movie everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard of 'Letters From Iwo Jima' I was interested in seeing it and so were my parents. I could not see it in cinemas so I waited till it came on DVD. I saw and it was magnificent!When I saw Flags Of Our Fathers I gave it 9/10, not 10/10 which I am glad I did, because on my birthday a few days ago, I was given this movie as a present and I watched it. Afterwards I could hardly speak. This movie was so breathtaking. This could probably be the best war movie ever. Its direction by Clint Eastwood was unbelievable. Perfect lighting and cinematography and music. This movie makes you feel as though you are part of it, even on a small TV screen. It does you a favour, this movie. If you watched Flags Of Our Fathers and hated the Japanese in that movie, then watch this film and you will hate the Americans even more. This thing happened to me when I watched Flags then Letters.This film tries to teach you that there is no good or bad in battle. Everyone has the same feelings as one another. If I could I would rate this 11/10. I never seen such a powerful film. For me, it is possibly even better than the 'Godfather' (which is/was my number one film). Of course, they are different genres, but Letters has so much more power and emotion, I would say.When I heard that some people despised the film because of an American executing two Japanese prisoners, I was really surprised. Then when I checked that those commenters were American, I was no longer surprised and felt disgusted instead. Do they honestly think that Americans are the most innocent people in the world? I think its time to stop believing stereotypical Hollywood action films and understand that every side had faults (even though the bad definitely had more). In World War 2, both sides committed atrocities. That scene portrays reality; what most of the marines would have been like. A lot of civilians in Iraq are killed because of US soldiers so why does that mean that ALL Americans in World War 2 are good? Anyway, this film shows both sides as neutral when you see what the Japanese do to the Americans and what the Americans do to the Japanese.People pay most attention to Eastwood's Directing. I do think he deserved an Oscar instead of Scorcese definitely, but what really surprised me the most was the script. Not only is it very moving, but it has a clever story too. I was shocked that it got little attention. I felt more shock hearing it's nominations at the 79 Annual Academy Awards after watching this movie than I did before. It won one Oscar, yes but only for sound editing. It was nominated also for best picture, best director and best original screenplay. The movie deserved Oscars for all three of them. I was also shocked after watching this that Little Miss Sunshine won the Oscar for best original screenplay. I have seen it and I think it is well written, but Letters has a far more intelligent and meaningful story. I have never seen such screen writing for a movie. This is possibly one of the best written movies scripts I have ever seen. Not to mention one of the best direction in movie history.For me, this is not only one of the best war films, but possibly one of the GREATEST FILMS Ever made, and deserves a rating above 8.5. Watch it! It is a movie for everyone to see. It will teach you something. But watch Flags Of Our Fathers as well. That one is also pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was good enough that I didn't notice its faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie produced and directed by Americans, but starring Japanese and in Japanese about the Japanese, bridged by a Japanese American screenwriter. There are a whole lot of links here that makes my inner movie-geek gleeful. First of all, this film is directed by Clint Eastwood, who himself starred in a series of Italian directed and produced Western films, but with an English soundtrack and Clint himself. So Eastwood is now in the place of Sergio Leone, directing a Japanese cast. Incidentally, Sergio and Clint's collaboration A Fistful of Dollars is actually a remake of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's film, Yojimbo. Whew, so we've come full circle.Movie nerding aside, Letters from Iwo Jima is a remarkable war film. I can't say that I'd seen Flags of Our Fathers yet, but Letters is the companion piece to the latter film. However, it does not need to be seen with Flags in order to be appreciated for its human look at the sacrifice and tragedy of war.The film has two major story lines, that of General Kuribayashi, the commander of the doomed Japanese forces committed to the island and of Saigo, a baker and reluctant draftee into the combat.This film does something that a film like Pearl Harbor chooses not to: it acknowledges the humanity, flawed and beautiful, of all the combatants, not bedeviling either side, but recognizing that all people are wholly people and dying for reasons that are often beyond their comprehension. This is best told in a scene where Baron Nishi, a Japanese Lt. Colonel who was a former Olympian and Hollywood partier, reads a letter to the discouraged Japanese soldiers from one US Marine's mother to the dying Marine.But the film isn't fully an anti-war film either--Kuribayashi's story shows that the troops on Iwo Jima had a reason for defending an island, even if they don't have a reason for the entire war. Furthermore, the film doesn't sympathize with the Japanese warrior culture that the army was a part of, but does critique it.Still, despite Watanabe's commanding performance (pun intended), the story actually lies at heart with Kazunari Ninomiya's Saigo. The baker who only wants to make it off the doomed island alive to get back to his wife at daughter. Some of the most poignant moments of the film lie in the flashbacks and vocal narration of the letters written from Iwo Jima. The letters are quite simple, but often show just how much the soldiers miss their families and look forward to returning home. And the flashbacks also serve strongly to create empathy for the characters therein.If there are problems with the film, I was too wrapped up in the film to notice them. The film even manages to wrap up moments of humor amidst the terrible future of the island. A potent film about the human costs of war and about the humanity and horror present on both sides of the war. It shows that even one side has many voices. Recommended. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Perspective of the Same Battle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had previously watched the violent battle of Iwo Jima in two good movies: 1949 "Sands of Iwo Jima" and more recently in "Flags of Our Fathers". In both features, we see very well-choreographed battle scenes disclosed from the North American point of view, with the "heroism" of the American troops and the personal drama of a couple of soldiers and families, in the usual unilateral formula to reach great box offices in USA. Further, in these two movies, the enemy is nothing but evil and threatening one dimension shadows, using weapons to kill the brave marines.However, "Letters from Iwo Jima" gives a totally different approach of war, unusual in Hollywood: it shows the human side of the enemies. In this film, the Japanese are also human beings, with different culture where they are prepared to die with honor, but people that love and are loved by someone, have families, wives and children, and fear and suffer with the insanities of war. In this aspect, I liked very much the pacifist perspective given by Clint Eastwood for the same battle, opening the eyes and hearts of viewers that probably were not able to understand this side of the Japanese (and other people) in a war. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Cartas de Iwo Jima" ("Letters From Iwo Jima")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>all war is the same</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prior to seeing Clint Eastwood's "Letters from Iwo Jima", I had only loosely heard of that island, maybe in reference to the Americans raising the flag there. But never did I imagine that I would see a so great a movie about the fight for the island, especially one told from the Japanese point of view (I as yet have not seen "Flags of Our Fathers"). The main thing that we come to understand from the movie is that these men are not really evil thugs fighting in the name of imperialism: they're just regular men following orders.Ken Watanabe is particularly chilling as Adm. Kuribayashi. Like his men, he's been led to believe that he has a noble cause, and he would like to carry it out, though he retains misgivings about his army's capabilities. But the movie's most important aspect is it's grim portrayal of the war itself. Even though we only get to see this one battle, we can feel the bullets hitting us as the American planes attack. As in "Das Boot", "LFIJ" creates a sense of being in the middle of it like you can't begin to imagine.As for the issue of whether or not this was Clint Eastwood's best movie ever, that's debatable (I mean, he has also directed "Mystic River" and "Million Dollar Baby"). But I will say that the movie definitely merited its Oscar nominations, although I am glad that "The Departed" won Best Picture; Martin Scorsese had deserved an Oscar for years. But anyway, it's certainly a movie that I recommend. I am now quite eager to see "Flags of Our Fathers".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other side of the story of the battle for Iwo Jima ,the untold story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing and spectacular. the other side of the story telling us the grim story of Iwo Jima's Defenders and the burden placed on them. fight until you die,you must kill at least ten Americans before you are allowed to die. The Japanese are fanatical to the point of death dying for their emperor is everything it's the highest honor one can ever have. We meet Iwo's new commander before the battle and he quickly takes charge changing things digging tunnels and coming up with new radical ways to fight the enemy. He is of course met with skeptics who believe the old ways are better. This he tells them will allow them to fight longer after spending time in America he understands the American Cowboy way of doing things and because of that he introduces a new way of fighting that could have conceivably won the battle. Clint Eastwood surprised me because he reinvented himself with Flags of our fathers. Here He reinvents the entire war genre and comes up with a incredible heartbreaking story that will not leave you for several days. I never wanted to see letters from Iwo Jima until after I saw Flags of our Fathers I saw a preview on that DVD and said it looks good I'll try it. Boy am I glad I did. My only problem now is this I can't figure out which one between the two of them is my favorite. Highly recommended. It's not The same old war story you've seen before it's something decidedly different and fresh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint's best since Unforgiven, a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After being disappointed by the admirable, functional but surprisingly uninspiring Flags Of Our Fathers I didn't know whether its companion piece would be for me. But I like Clint Eastwood as a filmmaker. Ever since I saw Play Misty For Me I've considered him one of the truly gifted director/actors so I knew i'd give Letters From Iwo Jima a chance.And wow! Am I glad I did. Like Flags it has stunning cinematography, unobtrusive special effects, a strong ensemble and a beautiful, yet understated score but Letters From Iwo Jima is more than just the sum of its flawless parts. Capturing the emotion, the heartache, the hardship, the friendships, the innocence, the anger, the horror and the futility of war like no other American-made war film i can recall it is, quite simply, Eastwood's first true masterpiece since Unforgiven.Now, I love A Perfect World, Bridges Of Madison County, Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby, I even enjoy Absolute Power and Midnight In the Garden of Good &amp; Evil, but no matter how good or bad any of these films are none are masterpieces. I believe sincerely that with Letters From Iwo Jima Eastwood has delivered for the war film what he did for the western in Unforgiven - a believable, emotional, beautiful piece of art that is also entertainment. Where Flags seemed overlong Letters drifts expertly through its running time, drawing you into the lives of the characters, investing the audience. It gives a sense of what it must have been like, not just for those on the other side of a conflict where we usually only see our side, but just the general impression of being in a war.It also doesn't fall into the trap of trying too hard to make us see the other side. The beauty of this film is it's not about sides, it's about war and people.Expertly played, smartly produced, beautiful and heartrending to watch. I only wish I could shake Mr Eastwood by the hand, I have finally seen a movie this decade that I know will stay with me through my lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Letters from Iwo Jima</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood continues his WWII war drama with Letters from Iwo Jima, the companion film to last year's Flags of our Fathers. Shot back to back, this version shows the same battle from the viewpoint of the Japanese, and if compared to Flags, this is a somewhat more heartfelt, personal story about the pride and honour of the defenders of Iwo Jima.Flags had its focus on the troops who participated in that iconic planting of the American flag atop a captured hill in Iwo Jima, and having the narrative actually leaving the battleground for a different battle - that for funds - back in US soil. Letters on the other hand, seldom leave the field, only for moments of flashback to build its characters' backstories. And surprisingly, it doesn't mar the flow of the narrative, but rather helped to enhance your appreciation of the characters who are on that island, defending it for most parts because of faith and allegiance. Face it, not everyone wants to be dumped into a forsaken land with limited resource, to fend off attackers throwing all their might at you. And for these soldiers forming the last bastion to defend a piece of land that would be used by the enemy as a launchpad to attack their homeland, it's their Alamo to fight to the last man in order to do so. And culture, face and pride ensures that this would be done, and watching events unfold, you can't help but feel sorry at times, at their inability to comprehend surrender when all else fails, and salute their honour and spirit in standing their ground.Letters is played out through the eyes of the commanding officer General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), and lowly footsoldier Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya). It's interesting to note that the far ends of the spectrum are represented to flesh out the narrative, given their different backgrounds, one a career military man, while the other, a conscripted baker. On Iwo Jima their lives get intertwined, and their hearts, clearly elsewhere with their respective loved ones.Ken Watanabe exudes a magnetic appeal as General Kuribayashi. Being appointed to the much shunted role in leading the Japanese Imperial Army in its defense of the island, he sets out to overhaul the entire defence mechanism, much to the disgust of the commanders on site. If you'd watch Flags, you'll understand what those tactics were, and nod in agreement that well, they do work, and the idea stemmed from being brave enough to break conventions. In fact, his daring out of the box ideas were actually what kept them holding the fort for a longer time than expected, though by breaking out of the comfort zone of his subordinates, it doesn't earn him much support. It's a battle of ideals as culture and tradition go up against being pragmatic. Kuribayashi walks the walk and talks the talk, and it is this kind of commanders that soldiers usually respect.But amongst the detractors who think that General Kuribayashi's methods are weak, is Lieutenant Ito, played by Shido Nakamura. Movie fans will find him familiar, as the Japanese fighter who went up against Jet Li's Huo Yuanjia in Fearless, and starred in one of my favourite movies of 2005 - Be With You. Here, he embodies the traditional ideals of the Japanese soldier in offense mode, who cannot fathom the idea of defense, and is quick to apply ideals without putting things into perspective. He's not a bad hat per se, but one who represents soldiers who are misguided. As with war movies, there are moments where the brutal fighting takes a backseat in order to ponder over the commonalities between soldiers at either end, that each is a son, brother, or father, and deep down inside if given a choice, neither would have wanted to leave their loved ones to end up being killed, or to kill. While the character backgrounds help to evoke sympathy for their predicament, it doesn't get too soppy or sentimental, just a tinge to think about, before it moves on.I like the fact that there are attempts to portray the bad hats, and that they exist on both sides, the Americans and the Japanese, even though this is a movie shown from the Japanese viewpoint. And the score worked wonders to the movie. Simple chords, and with probably just one identifiable theme, it managed to enhance each scene it was played. I thought in this instance, there is beauty in its simplicity, and somehow brought about a sense of calm amidst the chaotic environment.Clocking at 141 minutes, you hardly feel its length as you'll get engrossed with the narrative. I've always been in a fan of Clint Eastwood's movies, and it's no doubt that Letters of Iwo Jima is yet another quality work from the director. If asked to decide which of his latest two movies is the better one, my vote will go to Letters for the fact that it brought out its themes rather well, and for the cast's ability in making you feel very much for them. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood Fills the Screen With Accuracy and Honor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg have proved to be two of Hollywood's best (ie Million Dollar Baby, mystic River, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan.) Their new movie adds to the list, and came as part of a 2-movie Iwo Jima saga. First out was Flags of Our Fathers, and I was slightly disappointed, although it is still an excellent movie. The sister movie, Letters From Iwo Jima proved to be much more satisfying. The storyline is much easier to follow (Flags tends to jump around from one part of the story to the next, and rather abruptly,) and the acting is slightly more true from the Asian actors playing Japanese soldiers. (Let me get my complaints about the movie out of the way first) The graphics were mediocre. There were some parts of Letters where I felt like I was watching a video game. There was not a lot of combat shown. Now, of course, the point of a movie like this is not to entertain; I see these movies so they open up my mind to new ideas and make me appreciate my own life better, and make me more grateful for what I have; thanks in part to the events of World War 2. That being said, it would have been nice if there was just a little more "action." And my final complaint (and these are only SMALL complaints, mind you) was the scene where the American was captured and the Japanese soldier talked to him (I think it's pretty self-explanatory, so I won't say anymore *cough!* Hollywood!) Why I consider this film is one of the best to date: Let's start with the little things. Music. It created the IDEAL mood for this type of movie. It had many aspects of classic "war" music (with trumpet solos and brass lines throughout, drums, etc.) but it also had this feeling of sorrow to it. It represented what I think of war as itself. There were parts of the music that instilled this sense of honor in you; it gave you the sense that what you were watching on the screen was true honor coming from the soldiers. And then there were other parts that really hit you with this feeling of sorrow, and it made the same kind of scene like one of the ones that felt honorable seem depressing and morbid; making you realize how horrible war actually is. Ken Watanabe was especially convincing in his portrayal of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, who ultimately decided how the Japanese would go about defending the 5-mile long island of Iwo Jima. He plays a character who was honorable, tough, and at the same time compassionate. One that was willing to give his life for defending the island (like many of the other soldiers.) His character possessed a sense of wisdom, of always knowing what to do at any given time (now, how close these qualities are to the actual general, I do not know) but he sure was brought back to life through Watanabe, and this movie is a wonderful tribute to him. Each actor portraying a soldier in this film did a remarkable job of letting the horrors of war show through their performance, very naturally and convincingly. Getting to how this movie was set up, I agreed with almost everything about it. The flashbacks that happened periodically throughout the movie gave a great insight to the history of each character, and where they were coming from, both physically and emotionally. There was a lot of time in the movie spent (about an hour) before any actually combat took place, and this did an excellent job of getting the audience acquainted with the characters, which allowed them to actually care what happened to each and every one of them throughout the movie. The fact that this movie was completely in Japanese turned off a lot of people. I know that when I went to see it, I, being 18 years old, was the only one under about 30 in the theater (besides my roommate who went with me) It disappoints me that not a lot of people (especially my age) go to movies for anything but entertainment. A lot of people will not see this because they have to read subtitles. And I think that that is a sad thing. I cannot even imagine this movie being in English; it would have defeated the entire purpose. Letters From Iwo Jima takes a rare glimpse of the side opposite of America in WW2, and portrays them as being ordinary people, just like the ones who fought for America. There is one point in this movie where the American that I referred to before passes and the Japanese soldier who can speak and read English reads a letter found in his pocket, from his mother. This is what I consider the pivotal point of the movie. All of the soldiers (and maybe the audience too?) realize that both side are equally innocent. There are no bad and good guys in this battle. Just innocent young men trying to survive what their countries are each putting them through, each doing what they believe is the right thing to do, out of respect and gratitude to their country. This movie serves as an excellent reminder of that fact, and makes this concept crystal clear throughout the movie, especially at this particular part. All-in-all this movie is a very moving 2 and a half hours of film. It definitely ranks up there with the all time greats about World War 2 such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, and Schindler's List. This just puts another piece into the puzzle of War. I am grateful for people like Eastwood and Spielberg who can bring us such accurate and historical masterpieces, decade after decade. This movie is truly an incredible experience and should be viewed by audiences across the world. Certainly one of the year's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Defies Comparisons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is true with all films that transcend categorization, Letters will be compared with other war films. All Quiet on the Western Front comes to mind, and perhaps Letters does for the World War II generation what Remarque's novel did for the World War I generation. Letters will be compared with Flags of Our Fathers, and that's natural, too. I think Letters is a much better film than Flags, which in my opinion lacks a clear focus or purpose, but that may be beside the point. It may be fair to say that Flags was made with commercial success in mind, perhaps even ahead of artistic considerations. If that's true, then Eastwood and Spielberg were brilliant to release it ahead of Letters. No one can accuse him of anti-Americanism, since he told that story first.The operative word, though, is "transcend." Letters is what it is, categories notwithstanding. It is brilliant, beautiful, heartbreaking, moving, disgusting, inspiring. Other movies have held these features, but to find them in such a strong combination is rare. Letters will be remembered for a long time. For me, the most important difference between Flags and Letters is that I genuinely cared about what happened to the characters. Flags was so disjointed that I lost interest and simply waited for the end. Letters kept me hoping against hope that the principal characters would come out all right--even though I knew the odds were stacked against all of them. They didn't, save for Saigo. When he is placed on the beach, on a stretcher, he gazes out at the sea, and it is one of the most hopeful moments in moviedom.Don't miss this one. It's a gem from beginning to end.</fullReview>

This film was as moving and intense as anything that could be made about a war and it's real impact and it's futility.Clnt Eastwood was absolutely outstanding in his direction and there was not a wasted minute in this film. The stress of fighting a war with limited resources and leading men who would never return home was superbly demonstrated by Ken Watanabe, who gave a performance that will be worth watching over and over.Iris Yamashita's screenplay was so touching as we shared the pain of the soldiers who worried about their families back home, and the families that did not know what they were going to do as they never saw any soldiers return.When you want to know about war, this is the film to turn to for your answers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superb Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare to see a "war film" that does more than merely glorify war and turn otherwise typical soldiers into larger-then-life icons. "Letters from Iwo Jima" is one of those.Shot entirely from the Japanese perspective, "Letters," avoids the over-reaching and ambitious confusion of the commendable, but flawed "Flags of our Fathers," and instead delivers an honest, compassionate portrait of simple soldiers being called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice for a nation on the verge of defeat. It strips away the propagandaist portrayal of Japanese soldiers as mindless fanatics or subhuman monsters and replaces it with everyday men who fight and die not for honor or patriotism, but for home, family and love. In short, little different from the American soldiers who fought against them.As a teacher of History, and a specialist on Warfare studies, "Letters" is well worth incorporating into any Military History or WW II class. Like any great epic, it addresses the human condition and compels the viewer to past the stereotypical "enemy" and discover that we are all human. While at best a long shot for an Oscar for Best Picture or Director, it is certainly worth considering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Clint Eastwood Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie recently, and I thought IT WAS GREAT. Clint Eastwood made another GREAT film.While the movie, FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, deals with the Americans role, this film, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, deals with the Japanese side. Although defeat is near for the empire of Japan, Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi(Ken Watanabe)is sent to Iwo Jima to defend the island from the Americans. Should they take Iwo Jima (sulfur island), the Americans would be able to launch bombers into Japan and be able to land any damaged plans without loosing pilots. To be able to takeout the Americans without being seen, the Japanese build underground tunnels and gun positions on the ground and on Mount Suribachi. Going by a bushido code, "death before dishonor". They are to kill at least 10 Americans before they are allowed to die.When word gets back that Mount Suribachi is taken by the Americans,a few Japanese soldiers use grenades to blow themselves up. In the end, of the 22,000 Japanese defenders, only 1,083 are captured. The body of Gen. Kuribayashi was never found.When the movie was finish, I started to think, "who would be crazy to blow themselves up? who would be crazy to defend a lost cause?" But for the Japanese, it was what was expected of them. It was what they were told to do at a Young age.I think that every one should see this film. Clint Eastwood SHOULD WIN THE ACADEMY AWARD, and THE FILM SHOULD WIN AS WELL. Both FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA are great films, and if you put them together, that would be one hell of a movie. Also, what makes LETTERS great, is that you see the viewpoint from the enemy (a very rare thing these days). Also, it doesn't show them as cold-blooded killers (as what films of the past use to do), but it show them as human beings who were sent to a small island, to defend a lost cause. These men had families, and loved ones back at home who didn't know if they would ever see them again.It is one of THE BEST MOVIE OF 2007 (and one of the best films of all time). A big-time MUST SEE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell Is Full of Sadness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood should win the Oscar again for his formidable and sensitive exploration of the darkness of war. The film takes its time developing a storyline that directly presents links to every man in the world... Here is a collection of types that are put together in the middle of a hopeless and catastrophic situation: People who must either serve or die, willingly or unwillingly, with no way out or opportunity to discuss alternatives.Through the eyes of the baker, we see how the Japanese troops prepared themselves for the arrival of the Americans. We learn that their options were limited, and that for them the entire experience was as hellish as it was for most of the Americans. Their convictions and their level of commitment is different, but in the end, the results are pretty much the same: the death of a person's soul.What is barely hinted at in "Flags of Our Fathers" explodes here. The battle scenes are among some of the best ever put together in a movie, the claustrophobia and horror of the cave experience eats away at whatever little hope we have for anything even remotely close to a good ending. The spirit of these men face horrors no one should ever have to witness, and their choices are all tainted by the greed and the evils of others.There are scenes of magnificent dignity as Watanabe's officer shows us the dilemma of being in his position, as he tries to satisfy the demands placed on him by his country, and his respect for human life. There is the figure of the baker, as the man who just happens to be in the middle of a place he can't understand.The film is powerful, sensitive, and non judgmental, a tribute to both sides of the conflict, a time in history that should have never happened, and should never happen again... It's full of monumental sadness and inspiration for us to change things for the better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood Has Directed an Oscar-Worthy Film This Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Letters from Iwo Jima" should go down as an all-time classic ? like "The Seven Samurai" and "Tora Tora Tora," as well as the best war films not involving Japanese, such as "Paths of Glory." It is an Oscar-worthy effort by director Clint Eastwood, far surpassing "Unforgiven" in artistry and scope. (Whether you agree with Newt Gingrich and put "Sands of Iwo Jima" near the top of your list, who knows ? I thought "Sands" was good but not great, with hats off to John Wayne.)As a three-year resident of Tokyo, I know more about Japan/Japanese than most, and I can relate to the humanization of the Japanese soldiers here. "Letters" is highly evocative all the way, but what also makes it great is that it is well-edited. In 2 hours and 20 minutes, it provides little in wasted scenes and self-absorption. Although I thought it dragged a bit while watching it, I later realized virtually all the scenes had meaning. Even the masterpiece "Lawrence of Arabia" (yes, much longer, but "Letters" is also longer than average) had, arguably, a little excess. As for self-absorbed, I won't even get into "Borat."By lack of self-absorption, I mean that while "Letters" continued to dwell on the emotional makeup of the Japanese military personnel and civilians, it did so in a steady way, showing various aspects of their character, without monotony or pomposity. It brought out certain themes and variations, highlighting differences in chemistry among Japanese. Indeed, the most striking memory from "Letters" is how the individuals (including civilians and women) were so human and so different, in contrast to the machine-like image of the Japanese military. I would not have killed that dog, either.The film presents a chronological story of the battle, with flashbacks and flash-ins to areas other than the battlefield. It treats Japan's feeling of hopelessness in 1945 and what was left of the rationale for defending to the last man. The knowledge of the Japanese soldier that to fight on means likely death contrasts with the realistic feelings of American marines that their chances of returning home are good. The film portrays the overwhelming material superiority of the Americans, what this looked like to the Japanese (including the bombing preceding the battle), and how it was manifested in the American success as the battle progressed (and as the Japanese ran out of food). It also shows the elaborate tunnel system the Japanese defenders created after realizing a stand on the beaches was impracticable.Ken Watanabe plays the lead character, General Kuribayashi. He has a thoughtful, independent-thinking defensive strategy, but also feels the conflicts of duty and reality. Kazunari Ninomiya is Saigo, the film's most prominent ordinary soldier, who is not a fanatical samurai type. He is a person with some fear who questions the hard-core military spirit, is concerned about his pregnant wife, and hopes to be home someday. As warranted, the hard-core military spirit was present too, in the persona of Lieutenant Ito (Shido Nakamura).Basic to the film is how the soldiers' plights ? and destinies ? affected their feelings and in turn those of Japanese spouses and other civilians (reference the title, based on the poignant letters from the Japanese soldiers to home). Their letters are balanced by a scene in which a wounded U.S. marine is captured and later dies. "Sam" converses with Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), gold medal winner in equestrian competition at the 1932 Olympics, after the Baron orders his wounds treated. (A flashback had shown Baron Nishi with American officers and their wives at an elegant gathering before the war.) As Nishi relates to Sam his experiences with Americans, and after he reads a letter from Sam's mother, also poignant, found on Sam following his death, we are reminded not to generalize about atrocities on either side in a war. Some Japanese in the film had thought Americans were savages but discovered we weren't, and this was juxtaposed with the realization of some Japanese that U.S. marines at Iwo Jima were not cowards but had displayed bravery and military skill. There is a scene in which some marines have two captured Japanese POWs on their hands who are expected to hurt the marines' logistics on the mountainous terrain, making the Americans sitting ducks, and the prisoners are therefore executed by one of the soldiers. Is this an attempt at being "politically correct"? I cannot read Eastwood's mind, but one could see it partially as excess in a movie made from the Japanese perspective and partially as an emphasis on the horrors of war and what can result when survival is thought to be at stake.The Japanese soldier was a tough foe his U.S. counterpart. "Letters" focuses on different perspectives of the willingness to fight to the death in a losing cause. The film suggests some Japanese thought fighting on would add time value to Japan's situation, while others carried on as a point of honor. "Letters" also raises the issue of whether running away in a hopeless situation but being willing to fight on in another area of the battlefield should be seen as cowardice or simply good strategy.Clint Eastwood directed "Unforgiven," and it won an Oscar as the Best Picture, perhaps on passage-of-time sympathy, for many think it was not Oscar material. (I have not seen "Flags of Our Fathers," so cannot comment on it.) Letters from Iwo Jima is Oscar material, and I hope it wins Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinematography reinforces audience response</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one thing that stood out to me about this movie was the way that it was nearly shot in black in white given the dullness of the color. The setting was an island in the Pacific, yet the only time that only vibrant or dazzling color is present is during the battle scenes. This was useful because it intensified the violence of the air raids and made the moment more spectacular in terms of the fear it was able to create. The sheer power of the bombs was done in a realistic manner that reflected American military dominance without glorifying them into a fictional state.In terms of the dullness of the colors throughout the movie, I feel that they more powerfully control the interpretations that the audience gets from the movie itself. The despair and hopelessness of the Japanese on that island was brilliantly displayed with the lack of warm and comforting vibrant colors. The only time that the audience really gets a beautifully use of color is at the end when they show the sunset in the background of the dark island. The symbolism here is powerful and inspiring as it leaves the audience with a sense of hope in the possibilities available, yet with a real depiction of the reality of the situation represented by the dark and dreary island.All in all I felt the cinematography really made this movie a lot more powerful than it would have been with another cinematographer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see the Pacific War against Japan in Movies from an American perspective, you see an enemy that is determined, ruthless, savage, mostly invisible and with great zeal. You see Monsters.Strangely, growing up with mostly American Movies I never thought what it would be like, looking from the other side.Clint made it possible and I was more than surprised.I was surprised because I saw basically the same thing, a savage, ruthless enemy that moved in like a steamroller, breaking every resistance in its way. I saw Demons.This is the greatest accomplishment of this Movie in my opinion. By showing you that Evil is only a matter of perspective, it shows how perverted and twisted War can be.Some might say that this Movie is anti-American. I don't know about that but I do know, that this Movie is anti-War and pro Humanity. That is all I need to know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not very often that you get to experience war from a different side like in letters to iwo jima, we're usually drafted into seeing the American side of things, which in most cases is quite over the top and stereotypical making out every other nation to be the bad guys. So to see a story from the Japanese side was a breath of fresh air film wise, i myself am a fan of Japanese cinema and culture so something like this was just up my alley.If you want to see an uncompromising, honest war story watch letters to iwo jima and you'll get to see what war was like from the Japanese bunks, detailing from suicide, to Honor, to disobeying orders and in the end the major struggle that every soldier had to the death in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine addition to Flags of Our Fathers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood goes above and beyond what he accomplished with Flags of Our Fathers. That was a compelling and powerful piece of work about the effect war had on America, but to see the same situation occur to another country goes to another level. Here, Eastwood takes everything the average American knows or has pre-conceived notions about in terms of World War II and turns them to show us the "enemy's" side. The acting here is very strong, especially from Ken Watanabe, who shows a fierce and yet gentle side to the character of the Japanese general who is just like any American general; he simply follows orders. This is a hard film to watch at times, especially in two specific flashback sequences when seeing how certain soldiers arrived on the island of Iwo Jima. All this is to show how the Japanese soldiers each had their own job, career, and family to worry about and take the chance that they would not ever see them again. Powerful film making aside, this is simply a great story about humans and the effects of war on all involved. This is almost certainly the best war film since Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The companion piece, "Flags of our Fathers" ran the risk of demonizing the Japanese simply for not showing them in any capacity other than the attacking force (see Kokoda - release in 2006, which portrays the Japanese in the same way - mythical beings who materialize out of no were). Letters from Iwo Jima finally puts a human face on the whole world war two confrontation and it was good to see. Each person had his own life, much like the US, and many missed their family.Excellent stuff Clint Eastwood. Two movies that show an alternate view and helping us to empathize with each side.

		<shortDescription>unforgettable dramatic experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the great film that its companion piece, "Flags of our Fathyers", is; yet it remains more haunting than the other, more troublesome, more open to comment.Let me begin with an important point: of the several films (Last Samurai, Memoirs of a Geisha) that Hollywood has recently produced concerning Japanese history and culture, this is the only one that shows ANY sensitivity to Japanese culture at all; if Japanese viewers find it untrue to any degree, I ask them to remember the Hollywood gunk that preceded it. This film at least admits that there is something about historic Japanese culture - especially the cult of 'heroic suicide' - that it does not understand - and admits also that Japanese claims against American soldiers - e.g., the casual execution of prisoners - are not without foundation. It is therefore an ethically complex and difficult film, that allows that there may be more than one perspective to any military conflict. That this was suggested by executive producer Spielberg says more about his ethos than even "Schindler's List" or "The Color Purple"; that this was made by Clint Eastwood remains a final slam to all who pretend he is just a B-movie cowboy with production clout. Despite certain flaws, this is a film Akira Kurosawa would certainly have respected - perhaps even admired.The Japanese who defended Okinawa were betrayed by their government - they were basically left to their own devices, with no support, to fight the first major battle of WWII on Japanese soil. Since the government was already contemplating surrender, this defense was doubly betrayal, since their stand was clearly intended as a jockeying for position for a conditional surrender - which, of course, they were not told.In fact, no one was clearly told this until it was too late, and Truman decided to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.If no one had been hurt, this would be a comedy of errors. But everyone was hurt. The tragedy remains with us still.Any fault with the film lies in its episodic plotting, which was probably unavoidable, given the original material the film draw upon. Everything else about it (dialog, photography, etc.) is deeply moving - and deeply troublesome. This is no movie to see if you want your questions answered in neat little boxes.Also, kudos to Ken Watanabe - His other American appearances have been appallingly banal, but here he realizes the promise that Hollywood made Bringing him to the US in the first place.A powerful, unforgettable dramatic experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saddening War Story/look into humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the good things about Letters from Iwo Jima is that it's not trying to glorify the horrors of war - Rather it's trying to show that despite all the propaganda and the like, both sides of war are human beings, not savages or beasts. The movie does a pretty good job(although I'm not sure how authentically) at giving us a perspective of a common Japanese conscript fighting for his life against American Forces at Iwo Jima. One of the central themes for the Imperial Japanese Forces it seems was to die with honor. This presents a paradox between basic self-preservation and group social pressures. It's easy to relate to the main character's drive for survival while harder to see the reason for dying with honor and dignity in suicide. But then, war doesn't seem to be an honorable, reasonable, or dignified situation in any case - and maybe that's part of the point. This was a sad movie perhaps meant to emphasize the human costs of war relevant just as much now as it was in the time it depicted. Especially good was Kazunari Ninomiya as the main character whose frightful expressions of pain, surprise, horror, and sadness were believable. Pretty good, but definitely leaves you disquieted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more gut-wrenching movies of '06 but in a good way...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming into this movie I already knew the history of Iwo Jima and knew how brutal the fighting was and also how hard the Japanese fought. Personally I think it is important that films like this are made so that people can honestly look past the stereotypes of many of the propaganda films of the '40's. The movie grabs you from the beginning and you are drawn into the characters because you realize that other than looks or language they are a lot like you. Eastwood definitely knows how to bring emotion into a film with his previous works but here you are almost driven to tears watching how these men defend their homeland. To be honest this situation if it had been for a group of American soldiers would be as riveting as the story of the battle of Thermopolyae but since it has bylines and is about a former enemy a lot of people view it differently. If you know your history you know that the Japanese were willing to die before surrendering on their home soil even if it meant taking their own lives. Many of the scenes still haunt me afterward and I last viewed this film over a month ago. I believe this movie is a must see just for that fact that people need to realize that the carnage of war is experienced by both sides not just one side. As a side note I would say that if you're looking for some patriotic war movie then this film is not for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie with some concerns (I am by habit, not a large fan of sub-titled movies as I am a lazy reader), however I was both moved and engrossed from the first scene. As a military member, I always enjoy war related content, and this movie does not disappoint on the action sequences. The character development is well paced and the cut scenes to pre-war memories seem better integrated into the movie than Flags of our Fathers attempts. In the end, I found the ending a bit of a flat moment, but the imagery and emotion of the movie more than compensated. I would recommend this movie as an excellent counterpoint and followup watch to Flags of our Fathers, and would give the tip of the hat to this movie over the latter due to its more engrossing story arc, pace, and character development.If someone had told me I would enjoy this movie from the enemy perspective more than one showing the Marine experience on the island, I would have laughed. I now say that this movie should have been better distributed and screened in the states, it truly brings home the fact that there are good and evil to be found on both sides of the battle, and both sides have a human face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How fair and balanced Clint Eastwood made himself with two of 2006's most talked about films. First there was 'Flags of Our Fathers' about the American perspective regarding the World War II battle in the Pacific against Japan known as Iwo Jima. That film dealt with a lot of the aftermath and the politics of selling the victory of the battle that helped increase the sale of war bonds in America. And then Eastwood made this film as a perspective of the same battle told entirely on the front lines from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers with the Americans made out to be the enemy. A relentless classic film from a man proving himself to be the most relevant of film makers in the twilight of his career.</fullReview>

I have not seen a movie in a long time that has pulled such a quantity and variety of emotions out of me throughout the entire movie. It is impossible not to get attached to this movie while watching it. Do not let the Oscar snubs mislead you. The acting in this movie was absolutely amazing. The cast is very dominantly Japanese, so their are very few familiar names outside of Ken Wantanabe. This to me made the movie feel very real, as if I was watching the war first hand. I recommend seeing flags of our fathers before Iwo Jima if you can, but make sure you see Letters from Iwo Jima it is a must see this year. I will be very surprised if it does not win best picture and best director. An easy 4 star movie.GO SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

His presentation shows that japs were also facing an extremely grim situation.They too had families waiting in their homes. Like there American rivals they were also missing their children's , parents, siblings and spouse at war front. From there most of them even their general wrote letters to their families which never reached home. Japanese too were human beings who also had to go through the horrors of war and face the pain and anguish a soldier at the front experiences. They were under the strict orders never to surrender and prefer death by suicide instead of facing humiliation of being p.o.w. Although some of them believed in their hearts that this war is not justified. The thing which i most liked bout the movie is that Eastwood completely focused on the plight and conditions Japanese defending their island , in previous movies it was mostly ignored.

		<fullReview>Arguably Clint Eastwood's best directing job (and that is saying a lot when you consider a list of credits which includes "Unforgiven", "Mystic River" and "Million Dollar Baby") as his 2006 companion piece to the slightly inferior "Flags of Our Fathers" is a heartbreaking and emotionally difficult study of World War II from the eyes of Japanese soldiers who are attempting to protect Iwo Jima during the most vicious time of the international conflict. Told in flashbacks after a parcel of letters are found on the titled location, we get to see viewpoints from the enemy. Ken Watanabe is the soft-spoken, caring general who realizes early the fact victory and survival are almost nil. Youngster Kazunari Ninomiya is totally out of place as a fleeting infantryman who yearns for home and a reunion with his wife and their new baby. In a smaller, but critical role, Tsuyoshi Ihara shines as a former Olympic horse-riding gold medalist who was treated as royalty following the 1932 Games in Los Angeles. Shades of Lewis Milestone's "All Quiet on the Western Front" and Terrence Malick's ethereal "The Thin Red Line" as Eastwood paints a chaotically beautiful film from the worst situations history has to offer. Co-written, as was "Flags of Our Fathers", by master screenwriter Paul Haggis, "Letters From Iwo Jima" is a thinking person's production which not only stands tall with other films of the difficult genre but also with the truly moving cinematic pictures of all time. Primarily in Japanese with English subtitles. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

The fact of the matter is, the film is a true masterpiece of artistic cinema. Many people seem to forget the notion that film = art. "Letters" is NOT a documentary film; it is a filmic portrait of a generally unknown/misunderstood piece of modern history.

		<fullReview>Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in. "Letters From Iwo Jima" is one of the top five best films of the year 2006. It's a powerful, heart-breaking, and stirring tale of the famous (or infamous) Battle of Iwo Jima, and is of course shown through the eyes of the brave Japanese soldiers that fought there."Letters From Iwo Jima" is in Japanese, subtitled in English, but don't let this turn you away. Not only do you forget about them after a short while, but you come to endorse them and understand their importance. "Iwo Jima" is a war movie, but it's not stuck in battle overdrive like some other modern war films. We get to delve into the lives of some of the soldiers fighting there through flash-backs, but also through the letters sent and received by them rather early in the film. Their stories are very compelling because of the contrast to the stories of American soldiers before the war that we often hear of. In some ways, the cultures are very different, which is both interesting and disturbing at times. In other ways, the men are, as one Japanese soldier points out, not so different. Now, on to the fighting.Clint Eastwood proves yet again to be a master of every genre of film. The battle shots are all either completely epic and awe-inspiring or close-in and intense. The fighting seems real because Eastwood is not afraid to show the brutal fights for what they are. He doesn't shield us from the battles, rather showing us the terror and magnitude of them. They're some of the best battle scenes that I've ever seen.The cinematography of "Iwo Jima" is the best of any Clint Eastwood film. Very earthen tones are used, giving the true feel of grittiness and beauty in contrast. A good variety of shots are used, so as to avoid feelings of boredom. It greatly compliments the acting, which is in turn also phenomenal. Ken Wantanabe is especially good as a courteous and loyal leading officer.What makes "Letters From Iwo Jima" a truly great film is that it combines all of these great elements together and still stays real. It's powerful, emotionally draining, and beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot from the Japanese perspective this shows their side of the last days of Iwo Jima and the futile nature of combat.The narrative is taken from letters written by the Japanese soldiers and shows their war.Many who know nothing about Japanese culture, Bushido, their ideas about honour will struggle to understand many of the things the Japanese soldiers do in this film. Why they choose to fight to the death, why they choose to commit suicide rather than die, why they disobey their most senior officers orders to retreat.Westerners and most certainly Americans will struggle to understand the ideas behind these concepts as their culture does not promote giving your life. It promotes the idea that you live to fight another day.The Japanese soldiers of that time would also struggle to understand this concept, it would be as equally alien to them as the ideas behind Bushido were to the West.This film is well shot and looks amazing, many of its sequences are re-used in "Flags Of Our Fathers". This film is better than "Flags" as it is easy to follow and flashbacks of people to their home lives before the war are easy to pick out and not constantly referred back to.The film has a much more linear nature than "Flags" making it easier to watch, follow and understand.To those who asked "Who were you rooting for when the battle started" clearly totally missed the point of this movie. It's not about who you are supporting, the whole point was to make you understand wars have 2 sides and both sides are equally justified and no-one is in the right.My only complaint against the film is we never get to find out what happened to the baker who survived. Did he go home to see his wife and baby? Did he go back into business again after the war ended? Knowing he survived is not enough.All in all this is a most excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable. Excellent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Clint Eastwood. Story and screenplay by Iris Yamashita. Absolutely impressive with a totally different outlook on the battle between the United States forces and the Imperial Japanese on the volcanic rock of Iwo Jima. World War II is raging and the Japanese must defend their homeland by keeping the Americans from seizing the strategic island. The story is told from the viewpoint of two good friends serving in the Japanese forces that see a predicted swift defeat turn into heroic combat; watching the sacrifices and courage of the struggling Japanese Army face their impending doom. With no reinforcements available their war is all but over. It is surrender or suicide. This is probably the best subtitled movie I've ever seen. Impressive acting by: Ken Watanabe, Kazunari Ninomiya, Shidou Nakamura, Ryo Kase, Hiroshi Watanabe and Nobumasa Sakagami.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest war movies I have ever seen. This is definitely the work of an academy award winning director. This movie is a powerful one because unlike other war movies dealing with the war in the Pcaific it shows the war from the other side. It proves that the men on the Japanese side were human beings like the Americans and not just some crazy lunatics who come out shouting with a bayonet rifle and get mowed down by machine gun fire. It shows this in a way which makes you feel sorry for the men. The scene that really gripped me was the one where nearly a whole squad of men committed suicide one by one, most not wanting to do it. It also shows that like us, they had family back at home. This is a defiant must see film and with Flages of Our Fathers you have the ultimate movie set about the battle of Iwo Jima and I promise you that you will be touched by both of these films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sparse but Effective War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At times deathly quiet, almost completely drained of color in the cinematography, and never reaching that emotional crescendo present in most modern day war movies, Clint Eastwood's "Letters from Iwo Jima" is sparse and effectively haunting. A slow and thoughtful build-up to the fighting and leisurely flashbacks allow the viewer to connect intimately with various characters who represent a broad cross-sections of Japanese society. Using voice-overs from actual soldiers' letters to their families and hyper-realistic interplay between the men and their commanders, the film pensively explores the psychological make-up of the Japanese people who were often painfully loyal and deferent to authority and frequently placed honor and dignity above common sense and effective battle tactics. This complex internal struggle can be seen in the many suicides vs. retreating/regrouping that sank their chances to hold ground against the Americans invading the island.The film provides much to think about without ever stooping to preaching an overtly anti-war message. As ponderous and meandering as it seems at times, the film still leaves some lasting images: the first glimpse of the American infantry landing on the shores of Iwo Jima as seen through the eyes of a Japanese foot soldier emerging from a cave, the stark shot of a gray sky through dead branches from the vantage point of a soldier lying amongst fresh cadavers anxiously planning a suicide attack on an American tank, and a faithful captain desperately dragging his dying general down a sand dune to a secluded cove after a failed last charge. Though not as emotionally resonant as "Saving Private Ryan," compelling acting and top-notch production values make "Letters from Iwo Jima" stand proudly amongst the canon of classic World War II films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm surprised Flags of Our Fathers got such mixed reviews and Letters from Iwo Jima only got raves</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Clint Eastwood's American version of the Iwo Jima story, Flags of Our Fathers, premiered, it was met with surprisingly indifferent reviews. A lot of Eastwood lovers and WWII buffs were gravely disappointed. The followup, Letters from Iwo Jima, was due in February, but Eastwood bumped it back so it would come out in 2006. It, on the contrary, got rave reviews. I'm at a loss. I thought they were both of about the same quality: they are respectable but unremarkable WWII films. Letters is notable, I suppose, because it tells the Japanese side of the story, and humanizes an American enemy to a pretty much unheard of degree. But that's not enough to win me over by itself. It's been a long enough time where I don't think anyone would think the Japanese were all inhuman monsters. The story follows a young soldier, Saigo (well portrayed by Kazunari Ninomiya, a relative newcomer), who begins the battle inside Suribachi Hill. In Flags of Our Fathers, the vast majority of the war story took place on this hill, on top of which the American soldiers raised the titular flags. Letters covers the entire battle, which, if I remember right, lasted over a month. Much to Saigo's commanders' dismay, Saigo doesn't quite feel like sacrificing himself in this impossible battle, and he narrowly escapes death several times. Another prominent character is General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, played by Ken Watanabe. Unlike most of the commanding officers under him, he is completely sympathetic with the underlings' anxieties, and he also acknowledges his enemies as human beings. It sure is frightening to experience the losing side of a battle (though I don't see much difference either way if you die, or even if you witness dozens of your friends die), but I didn't really think Letters from Iwo Jima broke new ground. There are plenty of Japanese movies about the war that are far more powerful, especially Kobayashi's The Human Condition, which I think is probably the best WWII film (or series of films) ever made. Frankly, I was frequently bored by Letters from Iwo Jima. It does have some great moments, but I don't at all feel it's essential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First-rate drama from a unique point of view</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"War is a beastly business, it is true, but one proof we are human is our ability to learn, even from it, how better to exist." M.F.K. FisherGeneral Tommy Franks could not withstand the biographical scrutiny Clint Eastwood gives to General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), the commander of the 20,000 Japanese soldiers who perished defending Iwo Jima against the invading Allies, who lost some 6000. The ill-conceived preparations for the Iraq War pale next to the care the Japanese general took at Iwo. He used his understanding of America from his visit here and his love of his men to hold off the Americans for 36 days, in a fight that was supposed to last five. Factor in the Japanese tradition of honor at all costs and Letters from Iwo Jima has the ingredients for first-rate drama from a unique point of view: the enemy's.Eastwood has always excelled at telling the small story to explain larger issues, for example in Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River. Letters is far superior to its companion, Flags of Our Fathers (the American point of view), because Eastwood scaled it back to a few soldiers we get to know well. In Flags the parade of heroes leaves a blur that takes an entire film to sort out; in Letters the lives of the few soldiers are carefully laid out so that when they are defeated, sorrow and pride are fitting for the characters Eastwood has developed, especially the general.The stark black and white serves both the dark sand of the beaches and the shadowy world of caves the Japanese ingeniously dug. Though the outcome of the battle was preordained (by February of 1945 the Japanese war machine was pretty much depleted), Eastwood suffuses the network of 5000 caves with a light that symbolizes the Japanese soldiers' essential love of country and belief in its destiny.At 140 minutes, Letters is longer than it needs to be, a statement I could make about many films up for Oscar consideration. (These directors are out of control.) Yet Letters' slow pace does accentuate the impending doom for those somberly writing their last letters from Iwo Jima. It may not be the Oscar winner for this year, but it is another first-rate film the director has slipped in at the end of the year in an apparent strategy to get us to notice his film. He had my attention at Mystic River.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very moving, must-see film from a Japanese perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film is in Japanese, don't let that put you off! It is subtitled and when you are watching it, you don't even realise this because you are so interested in what is going on. I think that this film is an excellent portrayal of the battle on Iwo Jima between the Americans and Japanese during WWII. It gives an insight into the intense preparations the Japanese made to ready themselves for the attack by US Marines, and it also shows how they held out inside a complex system of caves and tunnels built inside Mount Suribachi itself. Nearer the end, the film does contain some very good action scenes, and also an excellent view of the struggle the Japanese faced from the advancing US Forces during the battle. On top of this, it also shows the determination and willingness of a Japanese soldier to lay down his life for his country, and also the honour that they fought with in doing so. A must-see film if you want to see a Japanese perspective during WWII.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iwo Jima From The Japanese Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not one of those who was really taken with "Flags Of Our Fathers." I thought the story was rather lacklustre and lacking to be honest, and so had little interest in "Letters From Iwo Jima." This is the sort of sequel to "Flags" - or it might be better called a companion to "Flags." Both were directed by Clint Eastwood and "Letters" shows the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective - and much to my surprise I liked this movie very much. It was, I thought, by far superior to "Flags."Most American movies dealing with World War II in the Pacific do so from a specifically American perspective that portrays the Japanese in an unflattering light. That's understandable. In the context of World War II, after all, Japan was the enemy. But "Letters" takes a very personal and human look at the Japanese soldiers assigned to Iwo Jima's defence. To me, the point that was being made was how much alike the Japanese and the Americans were. Both were fighting for their countries; both had little knowledge of the other, and therefore had distorted views of the other; both were doing their duties as they understood it. And, of course, the movie is based on letters supposedly written by Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima - addressed to wives and mothers and other family. This is a surprisingly sympathetic look at the Japanese, something I really wasn't expecting from Clint Eastwood.The story focuses on Japanese General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, who commanded the Japanese defence of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi was a man well acquainted with the United States, having lived there for two years on a military exchange, and he had no illusions about Japan's ability to win the war, largely seeing Iwo Jima as a suicide mission from which he wouldn't return. He's portrayed very well here by veteran Japanese actor Ken Watanabe. The movie is almost entirely in Japanese (except for some brief scenes that feature American soldiers) with subtitles, but - although I'm usually not big on subtitles - this didn't really distract me. They were appropriate to this movie and provided a sense of authenticity.This isn't a "war movie" in the normal sense of the war. Although there are battle scenes (and some of it is mildly graphic) it is for the most part the personal stories of the Japanese soldiers that dominate. It's extremely well done, and deserves a lot of credit for showing a side of the Japanese soldier in World War II that's rarely shown. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim, heart-breaking, but great war film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My preconceptions of the Imperial Japanese army are grounded very much in Western propaganda, actual historical accounts and the brutality my uncle attested to in a POW camp in Burma. There's no doubt that there was an extremely strong sense of honour in Japanese society and this inevitably carried over into the armed forces. They were brainwashed into thinking the Western soldiers were dishonourable and evil by an extremely effective propaganda machine back home(if anyone's seen the footage of women leaping to their deaths off a cliff in Saipan to avoid capture, it demonstrates this point pretty powerfully). I've read that brutality and cruelty were rife throughout the Japanese military, so this was reflected all the more so in their treatment of the despised enemy soldiers. Moreover they were taught to associate surrender with dishonour and cowardice, so they had an extremely dim view of enemy soldiers who surrendered; often in droves at the start of the war. So I think this combination of factors explains much of the horrors we hear about. However, these are very general ideas and we only usually hear the one side which is just too naive. This film reminds us that people are people, no matter what amount of conditioning they are subjected to, and that there will always be exceptions, and acts of good and bad on both sides. It shows how some young Japanese soldiers knew full well what was expected of them but that they questioned it because they knew it would make no difference to the end result of the war and just amounted to suicide for nothing. It shows how the honour system can result in absolute insanity. It also demonstrates that both sides committed very questionable acts which, lets face it, always happens in war. It's a very grim watch. If these men didn't realise they weren't going home when they set foot on the island it must have dawned on them pretty quickly after that. What an utterly wretched place and situation to end out your life in: your county's losing the war; you're told you're the only thing standing between the vicious enemy and your homeland and if you don't fight them off they will do horrible things to your loved ones; you're on a barren, dead black rock; short on food, water and ammunition; surrounded by staggeringly overwhelming forces; you're expected to repel a fierce sustained attack; and you absolutely will end up dead one way or another; and your last letter will never even make it home. Hard for the hardest-hearted person not to see the tragedy in that. I think they do a tremendous job here, reconstructing the build up, the battle and interleaving it with excerpts from letters home. Always so upsetting hearing the last words of someone who knew they were going to die to a loved one. I don't know how they shot some of the scenes, probably just a lot of CGI, but I felt like I was there on that rock, in those caves, as much as a movie could make you feel that anyway. The dulled colours works particularly well in that setting as volcanic ash and dust must have covered just about everything after a time, let alone the shroud that would have descended after the shells started exploding. Also I think it was a stroke of genius to tell the story from 2 angles, though I do think this is the better movie of the 2 as the plight of the Japanese is so completely hopeless. I think the subjects it deals with are very interesting. It makes you question your ideas of honour, bravery and cowardice. If applicable, it makes you thank God you weren't involved in anything like that in your life. I think it was a very brave choice to use Japanese instead of English. It will have lost a lot of box office sales as a result but it makes the film so much more convincing. Definitely one of the best war films and quite possibly the best Clint Eastwood film. If you enjoyed this film I'd also recommend The Thin Red Line by Terrence Mallick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After the telling of the raising of the flag, comes the tail of the falling of the island; Eastwood delivers within the war genre, once again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under a watchful eye of grim, bleak cinematography as soldiers initially sit; dig; bicker and wait, Clint Eastwood delivers his-then second war film in as many years in Letters From Iwo Jima, 2007's follow up to the equally as bleak, but more-so by way of the results of warfare from a propagandist driven viewpoint, Flags of Our Fathers. In providing a dim, looming and cloudy feel about things, something that balances that sense of dread and prolonged fear born out of the potential of warfare, Eastwood has given us something common-place but easy to be affected by. This, as well as tapping into both some pretty familiar and basic character archetypes plus respective point-in-life situations, but presenting them in a way that'll see us come to care about them.The film begins in a similar manner to the 2005 South Korean war film Brotherhood, in the sense an archaeological dig at a site, this time on the island of Iwo Jima located in the area of the Pacific, leads those partaking to uncover an item that might lead to answers from war-torn days of old. From this brief contemporary day setting, the film shoots back to the very island of Iwo Jima in latter-day World War Two as Japanese soldiers wait and do their best to set up able defences of the island to halt the Americans, whom are due an attempt to try and invade it. While the films are not be linked in any form of physicality, such as the case of a bother on one side and a brother on the other in Brotherhood, the American-perspective-Pacific-theatre-set Flags of Our Fathers was produced in such close proximity to Letters From Iwo Jima that it links the two pieces by way of taking something ugly and getting two different viewpoints of it, just without the immediate blood bond. These soldiers are all linked to one another by way of fear, raw human emotion and the victimisation they must suffer through instigated by hierarchy.Most of Eastwood's films have an odd, nostalgic aura to them ? perhaps born out of the fact most of them take place in the past. They don't revel in obligatory scenes nor pour on sentiment, rather, Eastwood is able to deliver dramatic films by way of the studies he makes of his characters and their arcs. Rather a few of his films revolve around the victim of whatever piece, usually a character or collection of characters whose lifestyle has been so dominantly one thing up until a point in which the conditions of their living and the very world around them dramatically changes; thus rendering them an outsider on their own turf.Examples of this would include Gran Torino, Changeling and the first part of this World War II double-header Flags of Our Fathers; powerful stories were delivered about an elderly man; a middle aged woman and a group of everyday American soldiers, respectively, whose place in the world around them changes when the world itself undertakes a strange transition. Changeling's lead dominated single parenthood and the working life they lead, but their world took a turn for the worse once their son was kidnapped. Flags of Our Fathers sees a group of American troops taken to a propaganda-strewn dystopia in the time it takes to capture a photographic image, while in Gran Torino, the transition of the lead's surroundings has been all of around thirty years in the making, before this equally wired and wonderful world opens up all sorts of new social dangers and delights.Letters From Iwo Jima sees Eastwood rather impressively transfer this technique he has of delivering these somewhat basic, somewhat generic conventions plus familiar character arcs into this film; here rendering certain front-line individuals in the Japanese Army, circa 1944, the central focus. In avoiding a deliberate stone wall protagonist, but opting for the sort of content that might be perceived as otherwise melodramatic, what with the situation back home for a specific private in which he has a happy marriage; his own business and a first-born on the way, Eastwood projects a somewhat overly familiar heart-tugging character devise onto a character, but it sort of works. This, as we observe what are essentially victims we know are in a win-less and desperate situation play out whatever anger-infused and futile actions they partake in.Most of the opening hour is dedicated to soldiers sitting around, bantering with one another; digging trenches and generally getting ready for what they'll estimate to be a long, bloody battle. The realities of war in the treating of fellow human beings by those of a higher rank is put across by way of a drill Sergeant who punishes those for stepping out of line. The privates write back to their wives and relatives; they feast on whatever small rice meals exist; they talk to the ones they entrust most about how much they hate doing menial tasks and that general feeling that moral is low is got across. Most of the opening is all non-eventing and foreboding, as a general arrives and points out numerous flaws in the present soldiers' defence strategies, this before a higher-up is relieved of his command thus placing the platoon into an array of disruption; whilst systematically foreshadowing the disarray and chaos that'll unravel on the battlefield within the Japanese ranks.When the first glance of the Americans within general proximity of the island occurs, the instance is cruelly juxtaposed by a private charged with emptying a makeshift toilet over a cliff edge; with promise of wrath if he looses the crude tin pot. There are scenes of warfare, sure; and Eastwood provides us with some harrowing instances of death and despair, more disturbing than most in the form of Japanese suicides and Japanese-on-Japanese killings. Eastwood additionally makes the rarefied presence of the American troops throughout the film a frightening presence, which I wound perturbing. The film is quite the little war genre achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Story that Needed Desperately to be Told</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a movie that throws away all propaganda and every bit of the "glory" of war. A battle that is everything but glorious for the men on the other side. That movie is "Letters From Iwo Jima."A World War II veteran who fought in the Pacific Front recently told me that this is the best war movie he has ever seen. The idea that the Japanese are not animals, merciless objects that are to be slaughtered without mercy, is portrayed perfectly for the first time, he said.From my view, this movie is very close to perfect in what it tries to do. The two main characters, especially the general, are masterfully portrayed by Ken Watanabe (the general) and Kazunari Ninomiya (the baker, Saigo). The general is almost a tragic character, rightfully commanding his troops yet questioned at every turn by his inferior officers who believe his orders do not follow the honorable Japanese code. He knows he has no chance from the beginning, with no air support, no fleet, no reinforcements, yet he still puts into action the plan that lengthens and makes the battle as difficult as possible for the invading Americans. Yet his plans are still questioned by his officers, because they involve retreating, they involve saving yourself and regrouping with the rest of the soldiers. This stands apart from the code, you do not retreat but die with honor, fighting insurmountable odds taking as much of the opposition away as possible. You do not prolong the battle, you stand and fight and die. The baker Saigo is someone who doesn't know what he's doing in Iwo. This is not his life, he is a baker with his new wife and soon-to-be child. He was dragged from the life he should be leading into a war and a battle his country has little chance of winning. Dragged away to defend the glory of the Emperor, to defend and give his life with honor for Japan. His life is now little more than a sacrifice, symbolizing the battle that cannot be won, he exists to kill as many Americans as possible and then finally to die with honor and glory. He realizes that there is very little glory to be found there and knows that he will die alone on the island, far from his true home.The greatest element of this movie is as the veteran said, it humanizes the Japanese soldiers. It describes war as not a glorious and noble pursuit but as something very tragic that overall serves very little purpose for many people, especially those on the losing side. You see that many Japanese soldiers are not very different at all from the Americans, young boys, fighting to survive, to continue living, to return home to their mothers, wives, and children.</fullReview>

War is one place where insubordination is unacceptable. - How both sides fighting the war are after all human and vicious by the same proportion.. - The extreme irony and hopelessness in war. In those times, people being drafted in against their will due to social / patriotic pressures. How they sacrifice themselves for their family that they have to forsake...Recently there were a bunch of morons rioting in Bombay, India because a leader of a fading upstart party set them off with a speech against a section of migrant people from another state IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY!!! I would personally pay for each one of those idiots to watch this and appreciate true freedom.. and respect the other person for what he is ... a human being! People fought for India's freedom... only to now hand it off to a new bunch of leaders who are waging wars behind their own security cordons by inciting mobs against their own brethren. Innocent people are killed/injured for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sickens me to no end..The movie also highlights the signs of a good leader.. compassion, intelligence and 'I will always be in front of you!'All in all, thank you Clint Eastwood and everyone involved in making this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good movie. Realistic, passionate and beautifully filmed as well as well directed. The Academy's nominations are all well deserved. There is only a little something missing to make this an excellent motion picture, a little something which is very difficult to define. All great films have that "something" others simply don't. It's a pity because one can see that this is a work of love on Eastwood's part, something he probably felt he had to do for some reason. It is also much better than "Flags of our fathers", the film that Eastwood made prior to this, on the same subject but from the 'American perspective'.It was about time that somebody made a (anti) war movie looking through the eyes of the losers rather than the usual stereotype where "winners write the history books". It was about time for a little more objectivity after all these years, a different prospective that brings us that little bit closer to the truth. The truth we should all be striving to learn, always.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That is the word that came to mind as I emerged from the soothing cool comfort of the cinema into the glaring harsh reality of a world warming in alarming acceleration. No, that wasn't "An inconvenient truth" that I watched, but I guess there are some similarity in the feeling of helplessness, and, heavens forbid, despair, at the follies of humanity. Purportedly, "Letters" was almost Clint Eastwood's afterthought from making "Flags of our father". A month and a half after the release of the former (in North America), everybody knows that the two movies represent Eastwood's master stroke of examining the Battle of Iwo Jima from both sides, something unattempted hitherto on the cinematic front. Less apparent, however, is how DIFFERENT these two movies are, the "both sides" aspect aside.While "Flags" attempts to address a number of different things (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418689/usercomments-244), "Letters" wisely steers clear of political controversies, or moral judgments. It is a much simpler movie, with a single agenda ? the horror and hell of war, regardless of which side you are on. This is accomplished through the stories, characters and visual images.The stories and characters are handled at an extremely micro plain, again wisely keeping the historical backdrop of Japan's atrocious aggression at a blurred distance. The immensely successful result is the audience's empathy with the protagonists ? a humane commander who has been educated in the US, a young baker with a pregnant wife and a MP who is thrown out because he didn't have the heart to shoot a dog as commanded ? all thrown into the death roll of Iwo Jima. And death roll this unmistakably is, as there will be no relief, no reinforcement and not even supplies. There is only one inescapable destiny ? die for the motherland.The images are therefore images of dying, in many different ways, in addition to being killed in the battlefield. Most disturbing (and gory) is of course the suicides of soldiers exploding hand grenades hugged close to their chests, echoing the devastating images first saw in "Flags". While visually not as gruesome, even more disturbing is a dead soldier, hugging a white flag in an almost fetus position, shot dead AFTER surrendering and being accepted as a prisoner-of-war. Shot in near black and white, "Letters" is a meticulously crafted piece of work that demonstrates that Clint Eastwood is nowhere near running out of steam, deserving our admiration and salute. The cast headed by Ken Watanabe is uniformly excellent.</fullReview>

They're practically a tradition here, as the national trauma left by the wars during WW2 has been repeatedly processed in several movies like "The Unknown Soldier" and "The Winter War". But enough of that."Letter's From Iwo Jima", was and is, something very different from what I've ever seen before. And I doubt that I will see for some time to come. I must commend Clint Eastwood's decision to make not one "fair and balanced" movie but two separate movies that look at the same conflict from two different perspectives. This makes the message strong, and especially engaging.What I particularly liked in "Letter's From Iwo Jima's" approach, was the sad undertone that was achieved by bringing the Japanese soldiers and officers forward as more or less ordinary people with their quite ordinary stories, fears, sorrows and joys.This movie is a "must", for anyone interested in history. A couple of words of warning, though. "Letters From Iwo Jima" is not a fun, nor is it an entertaining movie. It isn't meant to be. What it is, is educating, and thought provoking. The story is told in a brutal and realistic way that leaves little room for guesswork. This is not a movie for the weak-hearted, and the strong-hearted should heed caution too. I felt raw for a week after I've seen the movie, and still feel haunted when I think of it. I recommend that you see the movie with a couple of good friends, so you have someone to discuss it with when you've done watching it. Or just sit silently together and think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever been experiencing a war before to see what these scenes really mean?The window through which one looks at events is so important that you find some comments criticizing the characters, plots, crafts and so on while some appreciate the brilliant aspects. As an individual who has experienced a war, I should say the way they have created the characters, with all their loyalty, stupidity, genius, emotion, fear, courage, faithfulness and bravery, feels so genuine to me that reminds me of the war I had partially experienced in my childhood. The sequence of events are so impressing that regardless of goofs, it is capable of influencing the audience with its very intention that HOW UNIMAGINABLY DESTRUCTIVE A WAR COULD BE. Those who have been fortunate enough not having been touched by any war may not benefit from the real emotional situations like "when Saigo is summoned for war," or how miserable and fearful his wife feels afterward, or how bravery and patriotism is ended to death under the name of valorous suicide.The people are dying and so are along with them all the supreme humane values. Children are born without their father parenting them. The most valuable resources of a country, the human resources, are being lost unworthily. Highly educated genii (in this film military genii) are being lost for nothing and all the potential brutality that human kind bears -without manifesting it in its regular daily life- is emerged, and they are all happening under the name of WAR. I believe, through "my window" that this film has been created with the mere intention to touch the emotions so that it show "WHY A WAR IS BAD." It has tried its best to depict the brutality and homicide a war could create. No matter what a war is lit for, it inevitably kills people through the most unimaginable violence.Although those who have died in this film are actors, they represent the real individuals at the time of war. It means there have certainly been soldiers, in fact human beings, being killed the way shown. Be sure, wherever there is a war, the incidents are not much different from what shown here. The scenes of this film are currently happening in all ongoing wars throughout the world, and would happen in future ones also. By watching this film, through the splendid talent they spend to render the scenes genuine, you had the chance to perceive what a real war would taste. What you can do now is just preventing any war. Try your best for peace and prevent any war with whatever means available to you; for THE WAR KILLS THROUGH THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE VIOLENCE AVAILABLE TO MAN.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave new perspective, an anti-militarist masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo-Jima offers a new perspective since it is a movie that does not deny that "the enemy" may have humanly feelings as well. Most of the films based on World Wars I and II present "the enemy" deprived of all humanly feelings but allocate much time to present the friendships, love-affairs and the past family relations of "the heroes". The enemy, on the other hand, are presented as robots "programmed to kill" who do not hesitate when a soldier (a comrade) dies next to them in the front, as if they have no friendships, no feelings and all the other qualities bestowed to "the heroes". This has always been the product of a "one-sided" perspective to the war and its consequences. Moreover, apart from this brave new perspective, Eastwood also has much to say about the beast called war and its irrationality.A master-piece, a must-see in many aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood is like a fine wine in that he improves with age. A couple of years ago I found myself crying as I watched Million Dollar Baby, the last thing I expected from a Clint Eastwood movie and now he has equalled if not surpassed MDB with Letters From Iwo Jima. It's not exactly a novel idea to portray war from the enemy's perspective; arguably it was done first in All Quiet On The Western Front, I never saw that one but from what I know about it American actors portrayed Germans, apparently very well, and later, in The Young Lions and None But The Brave we were given both points of view in one movie but here we concentrate solely on the Japanese perspective and Eastwood uses bona fide Japanese for all the roles with apparently several non-actors which adds an extra authenticity given that real wars are fought by non-actors in the main. There is, of course, one superb actor involved in the shape of Ken Watanabe who deserves to win every honor for which he is nominated. Perhaps the most remarkable thing of all is that the film says something that has been said a thousand times before, most famously by General Sherman in The War Between The States, namely War Is Hell, and Eastwood not only reiterates this cliché but does so over two and a half hours and, wonder of wonders, he makes this hackneyed sentiment seem new-minted.The smart money says that Eastwood won't win a Third Best Picture Oscar if only because he's already won two whilst Scorcese - who in my opinion is vastly overrated - has yet to win one, but if there really IS any justice Eastwood will be honored yet again and deservedly so for bringing honor to the Art of film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When his mother's words are the same as my mother's . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima chronicles a WWII battle on a small island off Japan. The Letters of the title relate to letters home written and buried by the Japanese soldiers before they died (The letters really exist.) The film is told exclusively from the viewpoint of greatly outnumbered Japanese forces and is a companion piece to Eastwood's movie, Flags of Our Fathers, which told the same story from the Allies' point of view. Nearly all the dialogue is in Japanese, subtitled.Cinema has a long history of war films and it is perhaps important to look at what makes this one different. Being one of a twin immediately stands out. It was shot back-to-back with the 'Allies' version at the same location and details the exact same battle. Although in Japanese, with Japanese actors, it is a recognisably American film. It carries the usual war-genre psychological themes with which we can identify - courage, comradeship, and so on. The familiar iconography of an island that is defended at all costs is the theme, and combat is on a grand scale but personalised in the lives of individual servicemen.Letters from Iwo Jima goes further than films like Black Book or The Pianist which also suggested there are good and bad soldiers on both sides. Firstly because we are immersed in the Japanese point of view for the whole film. But the other major difference, which sets it apart from previous efforts, is that by making Japanese soldiers the focus of our sympathies it opens the possibility of a far more complex moral scenario than a war between the Allies and Hitler.This is a facet that is however sadly undeveloped. We get no insights into the background of the conflict (The main cause of war, at least for the Japanese, was oil for survival, and an ideological war against the West and its colonies.) Pearl Harbour isn't mentioned, nor the US embargo that preceded it. Although the attitude to the Japanese soldiers is quite intimate, we are given little clue as to why they are fighting. Faced with almost certain death, one justification is, "If our children can live safely for one more day . . ."This slightly patronising approach means that it stops short of any controversy or criticism of the US beyond a general horror and condemnation of war. It is only comparatively recently, in the wake of Vietnam, that American cinema has allowed itself to be critical of its own nation. Vanquishing nations tend not to question the ambiguities of war, and in the fight against Hitler there was little to doubt. Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line showed the gory awfulness of war alongside individual heroism against an unspeakable evil. Letters from Iwo Jima shows that awfulness but without a simplistic moral righteousness to fall back on.This is a twofold achievement. The evil of war is no longer a justification for further brutality in the name of valour. Secondly it is dreadful whether or not we want ultimately to side with the victim. We are in a Japanese pill box. The machine gun has been destroyed. We have only rifles to defend ourselves. Just then we see an advancing flamethrower, worse even than anything imagined. We are hemmed in, facing certain death. And whether we are on the 'good' or the 'bad' side is pretty secondary.At the start of the movie, washed out colours add to a sense of desolation. It is only when we see the red of flame (or of blood) that the screen really erupts in colour. Yet why is there maudlin Western-style background music? Strong leadership gets the Japanese soldiers digging fortified tunnels instead of beach trenches. The island will be used as a US base to attack mainland Japan (fairly obvious perhaps, but it wasn't that clear in Flags of our Fathers). The Japanese troops, facing massive numerical and technical superiority, are told they are not allowed to die until they have killed at least ten enemy soldiers. Bombers barrage the island relentlessly. It seems like slow torture - why can't they just fight, die if necessary, and get it over with?Flashbacks and letters let us into the personal lives of the soldiers. They are all human beings, whatever the moral arguments. Towards the end of the battle, many of them do not even have water to drink. It is a heartbreaking tale. We experience the horror of war as one of the enemy: this is the accomplishment of Letters from Iwo Jima. If it had been made as a left-wing polemic it would have alienated half the audience or diverted us into an intellectualisation. In spite of any biases and shortcomings it seems remarkably balanced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here is my Meeza letter to Director Clint Eastwood on his war film "Letters from Iwo Jima": Dear Clint: Hey, it's been a while! How's the family? (Ok, I know what you are thinking! "Give it up, nobody!"). Please keep reading, Mr. Eastwood. Because I do want to commend you for crafting such as enthralling war film that is "Letters From Iwo Jima". Mr. Eastwood, now I have a deeper keen understanding on the bravery that the Japanese had to go through against all odds in the infamous Iwo Jima war. Your "Flag of our Fathers" did visually demonstrate the American war persona and heroism effectively, but "Iwo Jima" reaches the heartstrings of fighting an insurmountable war to an even more profound ground. Clint, (can I call you Clint? Or are we not there yet?) you sketched the human psyche of the Japanese in a losing war with bull's-eye auteur precision. Your leading actor Ken Watanabe was commanding as General Kuribayashi, a commander stifled in dictatorship but resounding in headship. Mr. Eastwood, with no disrespect to Mr. Watanabe, my favorite performance of "Iwo Jima" was that of Kazunari Ninomiya who plays the timorous soldier Saigo. Your narrative is displayed through his eyes. He is inserted in so many near-death situations, that I felt that is was going to be "Goodbye Saigo" at any second for him. What was endearing about Saigo's story was that he represented the plight of any soldier in any country that has to leave a family behind to fight in a war that most of the time is fought for futile reasons. Two-time Academy-Award Winner Mr. Eastwood, (does that count for brownie points?) , I did think the rest of your Japanese ensemble was a class Japanese act. The cinematography, art direction, and sound editing/mixing of "Letters from Iwo Jima" was a technical triumph. Well, my friend Clint (are we friends yet?); I finish this letter to you by wishing you the best and letting you know that with your "Letters From Iwo Jima", you had me "Turning Japanese" you had me "Turning Japanese" I really think so! **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This brilliant film has an almost hypnotic cumulative affect on me. It shows people whose nationalism is visceral, in spite of personal doubts and an understanding of reality. The script impressively tells us about other cultural realities, while the characters draw us closer to them in their hopeless task. The almost black and white cinematography seems to want to emphasize the hopelessness of these outnumbered soldiers and leaders. It contrasts the darkness with the vivid red of the flows of blood.It is important to emphasize Eastwood's fealty to the source material. In Flags of Our Fathers he impeccably recreates important elements of the book. A lot of what seems on the surface to be Hollywood contrivance turns out to be a rendering of well-researched testimony of interviewed participants and the public record. He keeps to his promise to give us a riveting film that reflects the work of the author.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's best film as a director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant U.S. produced war film from the Japanese perspective. I have been aching to see this film for a long time (Even had dreams about it), and am proud to say it lives up to my expectations. The film offers great performances from an almost entirely Japanese cast (Watanabe and Ninomiya deserve Oscars for this). It was also fun given I've been studying the Japanese language for around five years, and was able to understand a lot of the dialog without reading the subtitles (I even believe I noticed a historical inaccuracy in one of the lines). There are a few Japanese terms used in the film's subtitles which most moviegoers would not understand. Terms such as Yamato (An old name for Japan) and kempeitai (The Japanese equivalent of the Gestapo) are a few of those terms. The meaning of kempeitai is somewhat obvious later on, but most would not get it right away.Action scenes in the film are quite good. Current action movie trends such as shaky camera and CGI are present, but can be somewhat forgiven as they are not used too poorly. The film is unbiased as it portrays both sides in an equal light, and the storyline is absolutely brilliant. All the characters are very interesting, and are complimented by nicely done flashbacks Unlike ('Flags'). Overall an excellent film and quite possibly the best of 2006. 'Flags of Our Fathers' does not even compare to this masterpiece.Easily one of the best WWII films from the Japanese perspective ranking up there with 'Story of a Prostitute', 'Nobi', 'Under the Flag of the Rising Sun', and 'Red Angel'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravery is not without fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film on DVD and it still haunts me. I wish that I had seen it in the theater. It is truly outstanding and deserves to be on the American Film Institute's new top 100 list.While the film has been thoroughly and excellently reviewed by other users, I will add my own perspective in response to some of the negative reviews regrading the Japanese soldiers being depicted as "cowardly".My perspective comes from my own background in having served in the military for 26 years in Combat Service Support and having been involved in Operations DESERT STORM and IRAQI FREEDOM. In this capacity I have seen and experienced fear, bravery, and cowardice. Also, I recently read "Gates of Fire" about the Spartan battle at Thermopylae, wherein one of the characters discusses the Spartan's study of fear, called phobologos.Bravery is a quality of character that is displayed in action under conditions of extreme duress when fear is or should be the predominant emotion. The Spartans recognized that fear was a natural human reaction to extreme duress with an attendant physiological response, i.e. "fight or flight". Fear becomes more difficult to deal with when compounded by fatigue, hunger, thirst, pain, loneliness, time, or an overwhelming sense of impending loss. Instead of denying that a brave person experiences fear, they encouraged their soldiers to acknowledge that they will have this emotion and to prepare themselves to deal with it. ******************Minor Spoiler****************************************I was brought up in the era of the war movies of the 40's and 50's where Japanese soldiers were depicted in racial stereotypes as fanatical sociopaths, devoid of fear and prone to atrocities. This film does an excellent job of showing how men under stress attempt to adhere to the warrior code of bushido. Some resort to blind anger and ferocity. Others cannot master their fear and want to give up. I would submit that the central character of Saigo is the bravest of the bunch. He represents the everyman, the poor soul caught up in events who really doesn't want to be there, but who has to somehow reconcile the expectation to do one's duty with the natural instinct for preservation. We see "stronger" men fail or resort to suicide because they cannot deal with defeat, while the "weaker" character of Saigo is able to adapt, improvise, and overcome. Saigo is afraid, but he is not a coward. Because he is able to function despite almost overwhelming fear, he displays a mastery of phobologos that the Spartans would have approved of.IMHO, the Japanese soldiers in this film are not cowards, they are people, like any other people, who experience fear when threatened and have to deal with it, with varying outcomes. This film transcends the genre of war film and speaks to the very essence of the human condition. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An audacious and unsavoury portrait of war and mortality about us, in our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood's audacious telling of the other side's story proves how human we all are in the face of horror. In what is possibly the most ambitious film piece about war and definitely the boldest film of the year, Clint Eastwood has once again demonstrated his dexterity and integrity in challenging us viewers about the political world around us. But Eastwood never admits to being a political filmmaker; in fact his films never come across as extrovert right wing patristic propaganda. While the film suggests shades of the American involvement in the Iraq war, it distances itself from preaching a specific message and simply presents us with characters that demonstrate the fallacies and force of the human condition. And as humans, they are similar to us in more ways than we like to believe. Since Unforgiven in 1992, what Eastwood has done in each of his films is taking a hackneyed theme and challenging us to look through fresh eyes at our morality and ourselves. People despite race and beliefs, can be violent, tragic, determined, disillusioned and misled. In Letters, he shows how we can all be human.This companion piece to Flags Of Fathers is smaller in scope and more intimate in approach. It centres around Lieutenant General Kuribayashi and his brethren of commanders and soldiers as they prepare against the incoming attack on the island of Iwo Jima, 1945. Once the first shots are taken upon the island, the Japanese soldiers realise that the American's supreme military strategy and economy renders the battle in vain as their heavy air and naval artillery bombard the camp. Most of the soldiers come to realise the war is approaching an unfavourable end and so they struggle to grasp the idea of their mortality and honour.The pace is unusually differently solemn and patient, and even compared to Flags, there is simplicity and integrity to the way the story is told. The film, shot in desaturated hues to emphasise the volcanic barren landscape of Iwo Jima, compliments the complexions of the Japanese soldiers, contrasting their frugal battle style and simple lifestyles to that of the Americans. The script by Yamashita and Haggis is sparse and thoughtful and carries the story well with Eastwood's direction without being self-conscious or political.During the second half the film, the soldiers realise that the battle is futile in some very solemn and touching moments. I found that pace lagged a little during this time and the events moved at times, tediously slow. But perhaps this is a suggestion of how these soldiers were feeling while they were trapped underneath all that time, uncertain of whether they would be captured and killed as prisoners of war, whether they would ever end up seeing their family again and whether their commanders had in fact forsaken them? Once again, Eastwood's direction is exceptional. Even with his invisible and heartfelt directing style, Letters remains less extravagant and self-aware than it's companion piece, Flags. In the first half, he mainly sets up the theme with little fuss while demonstrating he can tell a story with integrity and respect to the characters. His skill in composing scenes is elegantly displayed in the underground tunnels of pitch-black misery. His practical style illuminates the cavernous caves with beams of sunlight and showcases picturesque frames in their simplicity. Eastwood's greatest skill in telling this story is remaining honest, sincere and poignant to these soldiers while turning the idea of the opposing side as the brutal, faceless enemy on it's head. Some of the film's most shocking scenes remain boldly uncompromising in their candidness including the martyr suicide of several Japanese in a cave, the American landing from the Japanese point of view, and the rescue and treatment of a captured American soldier. In the hands of any other director, these scenes could be seen as patronising, distasteful, manipulative and plain unbelievable. But Eastwood's handling made me feel not even an inch of disgust or shame for these soldiers who are trying to live as humanly as possible.I expect that like Flags, this will we end up under appreciated and under watched by the general public. Most likely because it paints an unseemly and unsavoury portrait of war in our times. Furthermore, the general public do not wish to see a fully subtitled film that sympathsises with the Japanese empire while embroiling the U.S in disagreeable actions of war. No one else could have made a film like this, so boldly and honestly, and most astonishingly during this particular time when the country is at war. Probably unintentional, the realisation that Letters makes about war is hauntingly applicable to what is taking place in Iraq today. But at its heart, this is not a defamation of America or endorsement for fanatical regimes. This is simply a human story told forthrightly and sincerely. This is a challenging film and its existence on our screens today is already significant in this time of instability in our world. Letters proves to us that while war continues to exist today and in the future, the range of emotions experienced by it's participants will always remain the same. See this while you can and understand more about ourselves from other people's history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie and I read a couple comments on here. It was a movie to show the other side of the war and it felt like an authentic experience with the all Japanese cast and the Japanese communication. However, I was not very impressed. I didn't feel very inspired or motivated or felt deep emotions watching this movie. Now, I haven't seen Flags of Our Fathers, so I don't know if that should really affect my opinion.I've seen many old school WWII films from the Japanese perspective. They are heartwrenching. And I can feel the pressure and intensity. In Letters of Iwo Jima, I felt they started many stories about the individuals and they were not really resolved or they were prematurely finished. I was not sure of the focus either. Since it's called Letters of Iwo Jima, I thought it was their story told through letters. But not really. I see the reality that there's no possible way it could be expressed like that, but then it was told by Saigo, then Kuribayashi, then characters who seemed to have an important role but not really (Shimizu, Nishi) and then Kuribayashi and Saigo again.I'm a second generation Japanese person and I watched it with my dad who is a definite WWII fanatic. But both of us were not very impressed. It seems it missed a lot of cultural aspects that should've been included. I felt like it was mostly a movie to show that not all Japanese soldiers were gung-ho about committing suicide for the sake of the country.Anyway, I don't recommend this movie. Watch The Burmese Harp instead. That movie is worth your time and tears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films About the Battle of Iwo Jima - And About the Pacific War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a field crowded with Hollywood films about Iwo Jima and other battles in the Pacific War, "Letters from Iwo Jima" stands out as one of the best. Unlike many other films about World War II, "Letters" does not descend into clichés about the war or its politics. And unlike "Flags of Our Fathers" (the companion film to "Letters" that focuses on the American side of the Battle for Iwo), "Letters" remains tightly focused around the actual battle for Iwo Jima. At its most basic level, it is the story of the 20,000 Japanese soldiers who fought and died there. There are no good guys or bad guys in this film, just Japanese (and American) soldiers caught up in one of the bloodiest battles of the Pacific War. Several of the Japanese performances stand out in "Letters." Ken Watanabe's portrayal of General Kuribayashi (the Japanese commander at Iwo Jima) is particularly memorable, as is the portrayal of Baron Nishi (another senior Japanese officer at Iwo). Saigo (a conscripted baker and the fictional main character in "Letters") serves more as an eyewitness to the chaos and brutality during the Battle for Iwo Jima rather than an actual participant. Shimizu (a former Kempeitai policeman and Saigo's companion during much of the Battle for Iwo) eventually loses his dogmatic hatred of the Americans and even tries to surrender to them (his Marine captors end up shooting him out of fear and/or malice towards their Japanese POWs). There are many intense (and in a couple cases even controversial) scenes in "Letters." The film for example shows the defenders of Mount Suribachi blowing themselves up with hand grenades after running out of ammunition rather than going through the shame (and possible danger) of surrendering to the American forces. It would be hard to imagine the reaction of a Japanese audience to seeing such tragically graphic scene, but like much else that goes on in this film, "Letters" tells the story in a painfully honest but straightforward manner. Although the U.S. Marines make a couple appearances in "Letters," for the most part they remain in the background rather than forefront of the story. And far from being the Battle's "heroes" or "good guys," they are portrayed in several scenes as callous and even brutal towards the Japanese. Despite these scenes, "Letters From Iwo Jima" manages to capture the common humanity that exists in the midst of the tragedy of war. The Japanese soldier in "Letters" shares the same love of family and devotion to country as his American opponent. And it is this love and devotion that makes "Letters From Iwo Jima" an especially profound film about war.In one of the film's most moving scenes, Baron Nishi reads a letter from the Mom of a captured U.S. Marine to the Japanese soldiers under his command. Shimizu's reaction to this letter in many ways sums up the nuanced yet powerful message contained in "Letters From Iwo Jima." "That letter," he exclaims to Saigo, "could have been written by MY mother!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is told from the Japanese side (subtitles) and the sister film of Flags of our Fathers and while the latter is a very good film, Letters from Iwo Jima is brilliant. That it is based on letters, that it is based on true life characters, and a tragic battle in a tragic war between two imperial powers, with one fighting to the death with no hope of winning against a vastly superior force with more ships planes tanks and equipment. While we know the story of this famous battle, Eastwoods direction and telling of the story from some of the Japanese soldiers is excellent, heart- warming and ultimately sad in that they know their fate is already sealed.Brilliant story telling of what is an anti War film when you see the tragedy unfold. How it didn't win the Oscar for the best film over the Infernal Affairs remake(Departed) is surprising but then Goodfellas lost out previously to some other lesser affair, so all is fair in Oscar war, if not real war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story tries well in retelling the iconic tale of World War II's Pacific theater of Iwo Jima, from the less popular perspective of the Japanese defense. Yet in using the 'story inside a story' story-telling style, the movie's screenplay puts a lot more of subplots as per new characters coming into the screen. I have to say though that only some of those reminiscing subplots hit the mark of making the movie into something more emotional. As the matter of fact, the movie's move in this only makes it's point on the second half when the imminent attack is going on. The acting overall is quite nice. Ken Watanabe and Kazunori Ninomiya both nicely depict their respective characters in portraying the polar difference characters can have in the battlefield. One thing that is most noticeable for me is how Clint Eastwood is successful in directing the all Japanese cast and creating quite a good feel of Japanese movie authenticity.</fullReview>

So goes Saigo, our young Japanese baker, plucked from his home leaving pregnant wife and dropped onto the black sandy island called Iwo Jima. We swim in the soldiers' moral dilemma as the end nears.Whom do we honor? Old legends, our country, our families? The human spirit gets the nod of approval by director Clint Eastwood who does more with less than his over-reaching Flags Of Our Fathers, limiting personal stories and his scope to the moral dilemma. Das Boot showed the Germans as humans thrown into the horrors of war and now American audiences can somewhat sympathize with the Japanese soldiers due to the incredibly strong performances by the Japanese cast. A slow grind to the end we all know, but with stories we may not have known.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Requiem of Iwo Jima</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is it like to know you are going to die in war? To know you are digging a trench that will act as your grave? I believe this movie gave a very vivid and emotional feeling of how it feels to believe you are going to die in war while having no other choice to face it.Also, I liked that this film was told from the Japanese side as we see all too much events from the side of America.What was done masterfully, was the showing of both kindness and atrocities on both sides of the war. All too often, we are shown opposing forces, whether they are German, Korean, Vietnamese, Chinese, or Russians, as all evil while Americans are always portrayed as heroic saviors who do no evil. This movie helped balance the sides and show war for what it really is: Just madness.The survival of the main character at the end was a surprise and a twist in and of itself, as I thought he was going to die due to the manner in which letters were written throughout the movie.Overall a poignant and underrated movie that rivals the top war films while having more depth and character than almost all of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wouldn't say that this film is as simple as being a showcase of the brutality of war or the tried-and-tested Man Vs. Man/Self/etc formula. There are so many scenes which attest to the emotional grandeur of this film- the motif of letters, and the relationship between Kobayashi and his army- which show that there is something greater about this film than the plain fact that it masquerades under a war film.It has all the ingredients of a war film intact, and quite beautifully contained in monochromatic cinematography and a great scene. Battle scenes are gritty, military concepts are didactically inserted in the script, and history is once again debated in the script. I don't profess to know war films very well, but as far as the war films I have seen, I think that Letters from Iwo Jima is just as, if not more, comparable.Yet what makes this film stand out from the rest is the time dedicated to developing the story of the Japanese troop itself, and the ideology that so fascinates and intrigues everyone- "Honour", "Death for the Country,". My favourite part of the film is seeing each and everyone's relationship to this "honour". Is it an imperial undertaking? A nation's philosophy? A personal principle? A facade? And if so, do we die for it? Do we stay alive for it? Or do we merely ignore it until the circumstances to die "honorably" enforce itself upon us? It's a war film that is so fascinating because it examines the rules of engagement with oneself.Maybe it's only fascinating because we're so attuned to the philosophy of Western war films that it only logically seems refreshing. However, it's hard to envision an American director helming this production, and what a pleasant gem that turned out to be.Near the end of the film though, I found myself slightly disturbed: Is the song recording that plays on the radio based on fact? In history lessons we look back at past propagandic material as being surreal, sometimes amusing. Yet as such a likely song plays near the end, it only served to pull at my heartstrings- at least for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A companion film to Flags of our fathers,this movie tells the story of the invasion of the island of Iwo Jima from the Japanese viewpoint. It shows brutality on both sides that would normally occur in a pivotal battle such as this. The first film centered mainly on the story of the flag raising at Iwo and the after effects on the men involved. Letters concerns itself with the battle itself. The film shows the humanities of both sided with gritty realism. Ken Wantanibe is perfectly cast in the starring role of the commanding general torn between the duties of defending the island and the desire to return home to his family.The supporting cast comprised of Japanese actors is excellent. Kyle Eastwood composed the haunting score heard throughout the film. Superbly lensed in a combination of gray tones,black and white and color add a semi documentary effect.At a running time 0f 141 minutes, the film never drags and hold the viewers interest from start to finish.I rate this excellent movie 9 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally satisfying if that was ever possible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the most emotionally satisfying film that I have ever viewed that hasn't then delved into melodrama. The film is quiet in it's simplistic beauty which is my greatest admiration of Clint Eastwood as a director. He has had his ups and downs but here he shines in a story that seems like he was born to tell. The film has a heart because we can feel that Eastwood's heart is in the production of the film. Films like Saving Private Ryan and the Thin Red Line are considered to be the greats of war films but in my opinion, Letters from Iwo Jima is undoubtedly the greatest war film of all time. Ken Watanabe is brilliant as General Kuribayashi in his best performance on film. All supporting characters in the film are given there own individual arks and are all unique and memorable. The film is as tragic as it is uplifting as it depicts the bravery of the Japanese soldiers as they fought the Americans desperately in a bid to maintain control of the island of Iwo Jima. The film isn't dumbed down for English audiences as the film is spoken in Japanese which gives the audience a far more gratifying sense of authenticity despite the western men who are actually working behind the camera. The film is bold and moving and I adore it for that simple reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>View from the Japanese side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second panel of the diptych about the Iwo Jima battle in the Pacific War during WWII, the first being "The Flags of Our Fathers". This time the same battle is seen from the Japanese side. This movie is masterly made in terms of direction, acting, sceneries and cut. And the script is also great. We are used to watch war movies focused almost exclusively on the winners side and standpoint showing the enemies on very low moral grounds. This time we can see a war episode from the side and standpoint of the defeated. Japanese soldiers are shown here not as the usual cruel monsters but as normal human beings dragged on to a war which, like all wars, has nothing to do with their personal interests and where they are forced to kill people who never did them any personal harm and could even be their friends. Particularly moving is the friendly meeting between the captured American marine and the Japanese colonel who had been an Olympic champion at the Los Angeles Olympica Games in 1932 followed by this same colonel reading to his soldiers a letter written by the American prisoner's mother advising her son to do only what is correct and right which leads a Japanese soldier to say that that letter says the same things his own mother told him on her letters. Those Japanese soldiers have families like any other nationals, who care for them and for whom they care and for whom they are always longing. The other important feature of the movie is to show the conflict that sometimes arise between fanatic suicidal officers and a few more liberal and humane ones although all of them being patriotic. Anyway the atmosphere of the movie shows us in a very realistic way the well known particular moral values of the Japanese people at least on those times, so different from ours. But in terms of feelings they appear as human as we are. An excellent and unlosable movie in short.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Side To Iwo Jima</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a poignant 'Flags of Our Fathers', this time Eastwood tells the story of the other side, the story of the Japanese soldiers. While it is indeed very refreshing to see an American director tell the story from the point of view of the Japanese (something that I think has never been attempted before), Eastwood does it beautifully. The execution is as good as 'Flags of Our Fathers' and the pace is steadier. Iris Yamashita's screenplay is much stronger and I really liked how the characters were defined. The performances, especially by Ken Watanabe, Kazunari Ninomiya, Tsuyoshi Ihara and Ryo Kase, are outstanding. Eastwood further captures the Japanese culture with an intriguing precision, as though he has lived in Japan for years. I also loved how he choose the shoot the film in Japanese instead of opting for the English language like most Hollywood directors would have done. Moreover, his attention to detail is fascinating. He portrays the island as a once beautiful now tragic figure. 'Letters from Iwo Jima' is an authentic and sincere portrayal of the horror that happened to the Japanese soldiers in that island and it is one of the strongest and most effective war movies to come from Hollywood and perhaps this movie is best watched after 'Flags of Our Father'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"It's strange, I promised myself to fight until death for my family.... but the thought of my family makes it difficult to keep that promise...." -Lt. Gen. Kuribayashi Letters from Iwo Jima is about Japan's defense of the eponymous island from the invading Americans during WWII. With Iwo Jima's strategic position, its capture would spell doom for the defense of Mainland Japan.Outnumbered 5 soldiers to 1, inferior in sea and air support, and virtually waiting for death, Japan was able to hold-off the inevitable for 35 days through unspeakable horrors and insanities of war. But the inhumanity of war itself doesn't hold a candle to the conflict deep inside each and every soldier intoxicated with the false promise of "honor." Saigo, a young Japanese soldier who was drafted against his will, is forced to leave behind his beautiful devastated wife and his unborn child to fight in the war for the promise of "honor." He is torn between his very natural tendency for self-preservation and the heavy responsibility to his country.In a scene that rivals the Russian Roulette in "The Deer Hunter," facing imminent defeat, Saigo's commander orders "death with honor".. one by one, each soldier takes out a grenade, pulls out the pin, strikes it against his helmet and puts it against the chest...a few seconds later flesh and blood splatter. Some soldiers did it unflinchingly -with honor, some did it in tears.. but Saigo didn't do it. Instead he fled with another soldier and journeyed to rendezvous with the others on the other side of the island to continue fighting....that Saigo cowered in the face of death is a valid interpretation......that Saigo found no "personal" reason to die "for nothing" and found instead a "personal" reason to live in hopes of reuniting with his family is perfectly as valid as the first interpretation...Saigo's story is but the skin to a multi-layered message that Eastwood had managed to extend through this movie in a way that is not "This-Is-Right-AND-That-is-Wrong"-- a bias that pretentious film-makers can't seem to free themselves from. Eastwood's humanistic portrayal of war and its delusions is top-notch, comparable only to other greats like "All Quiet On the Western Front" and "La Grande Illusion." This is a war film that will not bore...They should have given two Best Picture Awards in 2006... "The Departed" and "Letters from Iwo Jima"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one of the best. It deserved the Best Picture Academy Award. Like Flags of Our Fathers, The Letters from Iwo Jima talks about Iwo Jima. Unlike Flags, Jima talks about the Japanese side of the war. I was lucky enough to see this. I only had to travel 15 minutes to see this film. The story is about the preparation leading up to the battle and the unlucky times the Japanese had during the war. The two main actors did such a great job. I always liked Ken Watanabe and he had a notable performance. The guy who played Saigo did excellent as a Japanese peasant who just wants to be home. The music in this film makes the picture even more stunning. The theme will always be stuck in my head. The war action is unbelievable. It's sad what most of the Japanese eventually does. Overall, this is stunning and powerful film. Good Job, Clint Eastwood! I rate this movie 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courage and horror war with a Japanese point of sight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film concerns about General Kuribayashi(Ken Watanabe)who takes command of the troops on the island of Iwo Jima, he's responsible for the defense of the island from the US army , one of the most difficult campaigns of the Pacific theater. While a young soldier named Saigo(Ninomiya) faces the war horror. When the battle starts , both Kuribayashi and Saigo encounter courage, bravery, and honor.The picture is magnificently directed by Clint Eastwood(Flag of our fathers), and his son Kyle Eastwood realized an atmospheric musical score. Appropriate and colorful cinematography by Tom Stern. Spectacular production design by Henry Bumstead in his last film , he usually worked for Alfred Hitchcock and Clint Eastwood. Splendid screenplay by Paul Haggis(also producer along with Steven Spielberg). Rating : Above average, well worth watching.Adding more details over the largely described on the movie, the events happened of the following manner: Iwo Jima is a tiny island of volcanic rock and black sand. It has no natural water supply and covers just 8 square miles. Its capture was vital to the US war effort , however. It was one of the inner ring of islands protecting mainland Japan. It also lay almost halfway between the Japanese home island and the Marianas which had been occupied by US forces in mid-1944. The island was defended by 21.000 Japanese. The commander , Major General Kuribayashi had worked hard to add to the natural defenses , especially around Mount Suribachi and in the North. He had built one of the most formidable defensive complexes of the war. It had miles of tunnels and trenches , hundred of underground emplacements, antitank ditches and mini-fields. Kuribayashi knew that the garrison had no hope of any outside help and could not withdraw from the island. He ordered his men to fight and die in their trenches. They should kill as many enemy as possible, using the network of tunnels to get destruction squads, joining a squad meant almost certain death. Kuribayashi chose not to oppose the initial landings on the beaches. He would lure the US troops inland into the web of defensive positions in the interior. The US invasion was code-named operation detachment. When US bombers began attacking was bombed every day in what was the longest and heaviest aerial bombardment of the whole Pacific war. The landings involved 800 warships, manned by a total of 220.000 crew. About 110.000 troops were to take part in the initial assault of follow-on landings. The landings themselves were responsibility of three Marine Divisions under the command of Major General Harry Schmidt. US Marines took cover from Japanese fire on a beach of volcanic sand, March 5,1945 and Mount Suribachi rises behind them. The island was declared secure on March 26, the 36 days of fighting had taken a terrible toll on both sides. Some 5.931 Marines had been killed and 17.372 wounded. There were also about 2.800 naval casualties. The precise number of Japanese dead is not known. Only 216 men surrendered during the fighting, although another 900 or so surrendered later. The rest of the 21.000 troops died. The intensity of the fighting for Iwo Jima worried US commanders and politicians. The Japanese had been willing to die almost to a man to protect a tiny part of their homeland. They had inflicted severe losses on the US forces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do they</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Instead of a proper review I'd just like to emphasize that Flags Of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima are good films on their own but that they're really meant to be seen together, over a short period of time. It's kind of the same thing with nitro and glycerin, they're jolly nice chemical compounds on their own, but when you mix them they're ever so much nicer. On their own both movies are very solid, gritty war flicks, but the greatest special effect of them all is when you start watching the other movie and all of those congenial, nice soldier buddies all of a sudden look like the enemy. This very effectively offsets the bane of all "antiwar" movies, that war always looks better on the silver screen than it feels to actually have your limbs torn off by a grenade.That said, I also liked that both films tell you a lot about the historical context. (You should never rely on a fiction movie for historical facts, though: since I knew that oil in Saudi Arabia was only discovered in the 1930ies, I was somewhat astonished to hear Truman comment on how the US needs to sell more war bonds "because our Arab friends only take bullion" -- as it turns out this seems to have been a historical brainfart on part of the script writers as the US-American dependency on Middle Eastern oil only kicked in after the war).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the extraordinary recent film Flags of our fathers,director Clint Eastwood offered a magnificent interpretation about the battle of Iwo Jima(little island of a lot of importance in World War 2).And now,Eastwood brings Letters from Iwo Jima,the same battle seen through the eyes of the Japanese soldiers.Letters from Iwo Jima is a good film but I expected a lot more from it,so I think the film is a little disappointing.I think Flags of our fathers is totally better than this film.First of all I'll mention the good elements Letters from Iwo Jima has:this film has some fresh and innovative elements and it does not have the North American ideology of easy heroes and villains and the film shows that the Japanese and the North American soldiers are victims of ambitions and intentions they do not share.But,now,I have to mention the negative things:the script is slow and repetitive.I respect and I admire Eastwood's intention but the message the film brings is too simple.Also,this film feels tired sometimes with solemnity of the dialogs and things that repeat always the same thing:the war is horrible.The performances are very well and they have a lot of histrionic quality.The great Ken Watanabe brings a fantastic performance and he steals the show.Letters from Iwo Jima is a good film but I expected a lot more from it and it left me a little disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THis companion piece to Flags of Our FAthers,Letters from Iwo Jima offers the Japanese perspective of the same battle. While this movie has generated some controversy(primarily among those who view,either first-hand or second-hand accounting,the brutalities of the Japanese soldiers during the war),and the topic material will create at least a little bit of a cultural disconnect between international audiences and American,this film is still is an incredible work of film-making. While I must confess that I probably LIKED and got Flags better,I still found this movie strong.Filmed almost entirely in Japanese and augmented with subtitles,this story is kicked off with the discovery of remnants long thought lost while a Japanese geological group unearths stuff from Iwo. This begins the story of the preparation for and ensuing battle between the fleets of Naval and Marine fighting units from the States against Japanese soldiers who've been deployed to protect the land. Among the many young(And not-so-young)Japanese fighting men on the island are Saigo(Kazunari Ninomiya),a one-time baker and store owner who only wants to survive the war and go home to his distraught and pregnant wife,and the General Kuribayashi(Ken Watanabe,both fierce-looking and yet oh-so human and vulnerable),an American-trained solider whose strategies and demeanors at times seem to fly in the face of the ways of the Emperor's Army. As the battle draws closer during prep,it becomes increasingly evident to the general,his lieutenants,captains and even the privates that this battle may be an effort of which there is no survival and barely any chance of victory,which then in turn becomes a test of each soldier's mettle. As they get closer to the enemy,the reasoning for war blurs for a number of the troops,and bravery in the name of fighting for each other as well as for honor of country,flag and Emperor.Clint Eastwood's attempt to make a film that conveys what might not be a particularly well-recounted perspective of WWII is,by sheer effort alone,worthy of praise. Adapting a story and script(with the help of trusty scribe Paul Haggis)from Iris Yamashita,this film's strengths can't entirely make you overlook its weaknesses(or at least they FELT like weaknesses to me),such as the fact that the characters,outside of the General and Saigo sometimes are just indistinguishable enough that you confuse who is doing what. Also,the dark,mostly two-tone coloring of the film(namely:charcoal black and a sort of cream lighting),while appropriate for the filming of a battle movie,seems to almost deadens one's senses of the movie as it preses on. Also,there is a problem with delving into the lives of ANY of the characters when there is a wide number of lives to go into,causing an inevitable problem of shorting some story lines in favor of others,and in the end not really giving much shrift to anyone there. It should be noted that this movie is maybe EVEN LESS of a battle film than was Flags,in that there is at least as much time spent inside the many caves and tunnels inside the island as there is at the surface,where much of the gunfire,bombs,grenades and bayonets are being discharged.As I said before,while I wouldn't say I loved this film(or even passionately LIKED it),I WAS impressed with it. Any time a war movie is made with any intention of creating a brutal,acrid sense of inhumanity,then there is plenty of attention necessary to the lack of romanticism and plethora of carnage and despair involved. Armed with an ace film crew,solid writing and a cast of thousands of (mostly)obscure but dedicated actors,Mr.EAstwood is able to make a suitable companion to his previous effort.</fullReview>

It is the complementary story to Clint Eastwood's other film about Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers.I wasn't going to write a review of this film at all, because there's not a whole lot to say about it. It's good. But it's also the most haunting film I've seen in a long time. The lunacy of war and aggression will stick with you long after you've left the theatre. You've been warned! Yes, there are a few historically inaccurate details (two G.I.'s lighting up cigarettes at night -- and then complaining that they'd be sitting ducks for Japanese snipers!) but overall this is a thorough film both in terms of the history of the conflict, and in the psychology of the Japanese people and military. Like the last Nazis waiting out the end in Hitler's bunker, these people can only come to the realisation that they've been duped into a war that they will not win.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing war film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a wonderful film. Eastwood captures the universal truth that war is hell, regardless of where you come from. The soldiers whine about conditions, about leadership, they take care of soldiers who are injured, regardless of where those soldiers are from.Eastwood just gets better with age and I'd say this is, along with "Unforgiven", his best film. It is a bold choice to tell a story completely from the Japanese point-of-view, complete with Japanese actors and fully in Japanese. It is a mark of the man that this was the film he chose to direct. He could do simpler things but his choices of films have dealt with so many interesting topics, from racism to euthanasia to famous love stories in recent years that it's clear he is aging gracefully and remaining open to the world.I found the acting in this movie to be very good, in particular from Kazunari Ninomiya as baker Saigo and also from Ken Watanabe as Gen. Kuribayashi. Saigo is the ubiquitous everyman - the grunt who takes orders from everyone. Ninomiya imbues him with humor, some courage, and respect for his country. Watanabe makes Kuribayashi a generous man, one beholden to none and protective of his men and loyal to his country simultaneously. The film is about the Japanese' last stand to hold Iwo Jima toward the end of the second World War, and as it becomes clear that their fate is clear, different men react differently. The General is questioned over some of his military tactics but they prove wise over time. Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) won an Olympic gold in the States in the 1932 Olympics and serves his country honorably. Most soldiers serve honorably. One American soldier doesn't. However, when Saigo is finally captured, he loses his mind and flails around with a shovel, surrounded by about 10 US troops. One asks if he should shoot him but is ordered not to do so. I found this to be a nice counterpoint to the increasingly permissive laws that seem to govern American troops.The score is lovely and understated, Eastwood's direction is typically light but unmistakable, and the screenplay by Iris Yamashita is perfect. This movie does not promote war or discourage it explicitly, but if this movie makes you want to go to war, you might need some counseling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 2006, master actor and director Clint Eastwood made 2 complimentary war films. They where 2 movies based on one battle- The battle of Iwo Jima. However the 2 films show how the battle took place in the perspective of each side. The other complimentary film, Flag of our Fathers, is from an American solder's point of view. This film, which I find a whole lot better than FOOF, places you in the Japanese side.Onto the movie. Did I like it.I LOVED IT! This is probably the best War film of the modern era. A lot better than Movies like the Windtalkers and even flag of our fathers.The plot goes like this; Japan recognises that the Alies will be trying to take the island Iwo Jima. In response to this, the Japanese set up strong fortifications to fight off this foreign invader. Lots of the troops are scared and would rather commit suicide than fight what seems to be a invincible army.The film's storyline is somewhat emotional and if you are Japanese you might find this film emotional. Unlike lots of films based on the war with Japan in World War II, the film sympathises with the Japanese solders and makes you feel every pain they are feeling at the moment. You don't really find out much about the character apart from the fact they hate the war, they want to go home and that they may not ever see there loved ones again. Before the battle starts, the troops get really anxious and start to have flashbacks on how they entered the war by conscription. There are some really sad scenes and, I'm not the one for crying in movies, sometime it might trigger a tear or two. You probably wont even remember the main characters names, but you certainly will feel what they are going through.The action scenes are first class. There is something to supplements everyones taste for action. To start off the battle the Allies send in bombers and blow up lots of the camps. There is also constant barrages from battleships throughout the battle and as soon as the battle starts, you don't hear them stop until the rest of the movie. When the troops land there is a huge battle on the beach. They use flamethrowers to exterminate Japanese bunkers. More planes swoop down and rattle the beach with machine-gun bullets. If you are an action fan and you are not satisfied by the end of this battle, then nothing will satisfy you.This film is, at times, rather gory and it is definitely not for younger viewers or squeamish folk. Some soldiers lose the will to live and kill themselves and it is quite disturbing.The cinematography was fantastic. They filmed the battles at brilliant angle and you never miss a gunshot. Sometimes, to set the tone, it's really grey and black. If your looking for colour, this won't be you movie. since the mood of the film is meant to be sad, they make the film look as dark as possible. sometimes it looks as if your watching an old black and white film.Also, If you have a problem with reading subtitles through a movie, you might want to give this a miss because there is only about 2 scenes where there people are specking English.All in all, fantastic film. A real modern classic. If you want a all out, ear popping, eye exploding action extravaganza and don't mind a few tears, then you'll definitely want to see this very soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While this is not the best war film around, time will surely tell that this is one of the most important war pictures ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Letters From Iwo Jima, Oscar-winning director Clint Eastwood has completed something that no filmmaker has achieved before - making two pictures that depict the same war battle, but from the perspective of the two sides. Letters From Iwo Jima is slightly better than its companion piece, Flags Of Our Fathers, for two reasons.Firstly, Letters uses a more direct approach in telling the story, which allows viewers to anticipate the battle. Flags, on the other hand, rely mostly on flashbacks to drive the story, which may confuse and irritate viewers. While both are solid films, Letters is more satisfying, and emotional, and better acted. Ken Watanabe has been overlooked for Oscar selection.The other reason is that the Japanese are rarely shown as the 'good guys' in war flicks. So it's a bold attempt by Eastwood to capture the 'humanity' of these soldiers. While it needs no reminder that war does not benefit any side (George Bush, are you listening?!), this film goes the extra step to hint that soldiers are just mere pawns whom are manipulated by non-thinking politicians.Letters is less gory, but there are disturbing themes that are explored (like the suicide missions of the Japs). While this is not the best war film around, time will surely tell that this is one of the most important war pictures ever made. A strong contender for the Best Picture Oscar, though it's unlikely to win.GRADE: A- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A terrific war movie, directed by Clint Eastwood, that narrates the story of the battle that took part in the island of Iwo Jima in 1945 between an overwhelming American Army and a reduced group of Japanese bunkered soldiers, with low military supplies, drinkable water and food. This is the counterpart to "Flags of our Fathers" another movie by Eastwood on the same battle but focusing on the American side.A war movie is never my fav subject of interest, but if the movie presents the events in a humanly way and is historically accurate, it certainly gets my attention. That's the case of "Letters from Iwo Jima". What makes this movie to stand out from others lately produced on WW II battles is 1/ that focuses on the enemy and the losers, to show that not only the victors were human beings with a heart and a family. 2/ It also shows that not everybody belonging to the same country sees things the same, has the same morals, principles and would act the same under the same circumstances. 3/ All the stereotypes and prejudices about the Japanese, presented in so many American movies, which depict the Japanese as barbarians and fanatics are not here.Although we know what is going to happen to the group of Japanese defending the island from the beginning, the story line, the script, the dialogs and the war scenes are thrilling and engaging. It is the human part of the story to what the viewer feels drown, and what gives relevance to the story and keep the spectator interested and moved.On the other hand, the script is good enough to depict the different military principles and beliefs that Japan was facing at the time, in which modern and old values were being redefined, especially the concept of dying with honor. This is perhaps the aspect that captivated me the most, as we are presented with two different ways of understanding Japanese honor: 1/ the old one, blind and very medieval, in which when the end approaches and there is not positive result the soldier decides to commit suicide not to surrender to the enemy and be mistreated. 2/ The new form of honor is that of doing your best, fighting as much as you can, even if you know you are going to loose, against the circumstances, because it is your duty and shows that you really do your best until the last moment. At the same time, we see that honor is not only on how you behave yourself in the battlefield, but how you treat prisoners. In that regard, the Japanese are shown to be more honorable than their American opponents.I especially loved the glimpses we have about the personal life of some of the soldiers and officials through their letters. Those glimpses help us to understand why they acted in a certain way during the war, what motivated them to fight, to commit desertion or to commit suicide. I missed more letters and glimpses on the lives of the more traditional soldiers, those whose concept of honor and fighting was old-fashioned, as we could have understood better their motivations instead of seeing them as silly fanatics. I think that a little bit of chopping of fighting scenes would have allowed the viewer to have more empathy towards "the bad guys".Very moving, and really relevant for the story, is the reading of the letter by the American prisoner's mother. It shows that, in war, all mothers are the same, all soldiers, even the most despicable and savage ones, have a heart and a family, and their fighting is in all cases not their wish but the correct thing to do.Although I liked the end, I thought it does not offer emotional closure to the viewer, as we do not see the main Japanese character going back home or meeting his family.All the actors, especially the main roles, are terrific in their respective roles, playing with emotion, sensitivity and empathy their respective roles. The only exception was Takumi Bando as Captain Tanida, who I thought overacted all the time.The fact that the movie is shot mostly in Japanese really makes is believable from the beginning to the end. In fact, it is the only decent and respectful way to approach the Japanese point of view. Otherwise, the director would be bending to the needs of the movie mainstream market and viewer for the sake of nothing.A modern classic. Terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Defence of Iwo Jima, seen through Japanese eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters From Iwo Jima is dark. It is claustrophobic. It is gritty and painful and full of rocking explosions and the clatter of machine guns. It tells the story of Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima fighting for honor and to return home.The characterizations were moving and original. The people in the film truly were human and showed the impact that war takes on the spirit. The atmosphere communicates completely the desperation and hopelessness of the soldiers and the numbing feeling of being so long in battle.The script and the acting were both excellent and believable. I applaud the casting of Ninomiya Kazunari as Saigo, one of the main characters, a young soldier who just wants to return home to his wife and unborn child. Though the blurb on the back of the DVD case doesn't even mention Saigo, his story is part of the main focus of the story. I am very proud of Nino for being cast in this role. He is one of the reasons I saw this movie and I was not disappointed.All in all, Letters is not a fun movie to watch. It's dark and bleak but it's a movie that most people, at least in the U.S. and Japan, should see. In the end, it is heart-wrenching and I was very glad that I'd seen it. It humanizes the war and makes you face the reality that our enemies of the time suffered as much as we did. As many have said, it tells the "other side of the story," and it's a story that we need to hear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tearful and Genuine War Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from the artful direction of Clint Eastwood, I wasn't surprised to see this film was indeed amazing.but after decades of war films, I'm sure it can be hard to make any real impact on the long history of them. Obviously, in the light of the masterpieces created by Kubrick, Spielberg and Stone. As such, "Flags of our Fathers" just didn't do it for me. It was a story that was too easy too follow, dare I say predictable? but then came this marvelous film, and with a very different perspective brung along with it. the view point being that of our 'enemy'. As far as i know, such a thing has rarely been done, if ever. I'm so elated Eastwood actually directed such a production. It will be a truly vivid, terrifying yet symbolic piece of film experience for anyone who sees it.The cast was extraordinarily put together, with one of my favorite actors doing his role beautifully; Ken Watanabe as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi. Kazunari Ninomiya was excellent as Private Saigo, as was Tsuyoshi Ihara (Lt. Colonel/Baron Takeichi Nishi). The cast was just so great and Eastwood portrayed the many sides of war, a single battle, excellently. The conflict is clear, a clear cut decision between patriotism and human nature.Human nature of fight or flight; to either die with 'honor' or give into human tendencies, to flee. The necessity and wanting of life. That is where Ninomiya does so damn well, showing us that any sane human, whether we view them as good or evil, still fears death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New and compelling perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In October of 2006, Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, Mystic River) released Flags of Our Fathers. It told the story of the American attack of the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. In January of 2007 he released the companion piece, Letters from Iwo Jima. It told the same story, only from a different perspective. This time we saw the horrendous battle at Iwo Jima from the Japanese point of view. It is a story that captivates through its use of courage, honor, nobility, and fear.During World War II the Japanese mentality was to kill or be killed and never to surrender. The idea of dying honorably rather than as a coward to Japan was the driving force of the Japanese integrity. Eastwood explores this mentality in a new and more personal light. The film follows many different people at the battle ranging from the highest commanding officer on the island, to a nobody soldier trying to cope with the horrors around him. These perspectives offer a very deep insight into how the Japanese fought the battle at Iwo Jima, and all of World War II in general. Eastwood handles the subject matter with such care and respect and breathes new life into the war genre. Letters from Iwo Jima is a complex look into the minds of the Japanese soldiers and challenges the stereotypes that they were all ruthless killing machines, bred for war, who would stop at nothing until every American was dead.A strong central group of characters holds this film together and allows it to excel on many integral layers. There are many conflicts of ideas and authorities that give the film a very personalized feel, despite being watched through my American eyes. The Japanese mindset was the biggest difference between the fighting in the European and Pacific theaters. Through this film we are given a much deeper insight into this mindset of the Japanese soldiers and how each thought about the importance of honor and integrity. Some soldiers see dying in the face of war is the only honorable way to die, and they act accordingly. Others will put themselves before their country and will choose many other options before suicide. These conflicts of interests serve to create an emotionally moving story rich with character interactions and beautifully constructed relationships.Eastwood's direction is nothing short of superb here, and you will find yourself enthralled in this story that raises so many complex moral issues that you can't help but find yourself so attached to this film. It is a war movie that brings war to an impressive new scale that reaches deep within the human mind. Letters from Iwo Jima is an excellently constructed and emotionally compelling film that you will not want to miss.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than "Flags .."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been a massive fan of Clint Eastwood's directorial talents ever since "Play Misty For Me" (1971), so the arrival in 2006 of a diptych on the Battle of Iwo Jiwa - the American viewpoint in "Flags Of Our Fathers" and the Japanese perspective in "Letters From Iwo Jiwa" - was genuinely exciting.There are some similarities. Both are based on books - this one on "Picture Letters from Commander in Chief" by Tadamichi Kuribayashi, the Japanese commander on Iwo Jima. Both depict the scenes on the island in bleached-out colours. For English-speaking viewers, "Letters .." will be less accessible than "Flags .." since the whole thing is spoken in Japanese and 141 minutes of subtitles will be an effort for some, but the Japanese viewpoint is the better film with a much clearer narrative and an unusually humanistic view of Japanese soldiers. Ken Watanabe - who was introduced to western audiences in "The Last Samurai" - is assured as Kuribayashi in a nuanced performance.Even today, the bare facts of the battle are astonishing: on the American side, almost 7,000 dead and over 19,000 wounded and, for the Japanese, around 18,000 dead and a mere 200 or so captured alive. This was a revolting taste of what would have happened if the Americans had attempted to take mainland Japan with conventional forces rather than by dropping two atomic bombs. Eastwood is to be commended for giving us two thoughtful views on this seminal battle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A character-sketch of two personalities...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe that Letters from Iwo Jima is not a war movie. It is a dual character-sketch of two personalities - a general who has lived in the US before the war, &amp; a baker dragged into the war due to conscription. The director has taken a conscious decision to not show the actual battle along with tactics. Instead, he concentrates on the mindset of the Japanese soldiers, their life and the state in which they struggle to protect the island. It also provides one important insight into the imperial Japanese society, pushing its subjects into desperate situations beyond its own control. The social fabric which hails patriotism above all else overlooks the discomfort and breaking morale of the commoners. That, I believe is the most important lesson of the movie. The letters that the baker hides at the end of the battle talk about a general's thoughts of US to his children, the baker's continued longing for his wife in the backdrop of an impending suicidal battle. Important dialogues show how the Japanese army discounts American technological prowess &amp; ends up losing its infantry to arrogance, ignorance and misguided sense of patriotism. The very idea of committing harakiri instead of retreating to one's base &amp; providing much needed manpower seems untactful - a strong statement about a medieval army facing a modern battle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably the Greatest Ant-War Film ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took a second viewing for me to fully appreciate the message of this film. War is futile, a waste of time and life, and those at the bottom suffer most. The common GI, the innocent civilians, the cities and towns where battles are fought, the families of GIs and even the animals and wildlife suffer most from War. There is NOTHING worth the waste of life in War; I repeat NOTHING. Let Governments fight the battles. "Letters from Iwo Jima" shows the waste of life on both sides, especially of the Japanese. We are all human beings and often the 'Powers that be' manipulate us like chess pieces. Iwo Jima shows that no one wins a war. Clint Eastwood has done a brilliant job of proving this using a magnificent all Japanese cast, mostly unknowns, save for Ken Watanabe. Through his character Gen. Kuribayashi and the characters of Saigo (played brilliantly by newcomer Kazunari Ninomiya) and Shimizu (Ryo Kase) we experience the horrors of war, but we also see in these characters, ourselves. They have wives, children, mothers and fathers, jobs, and interests similar to ours. We feel for them, we want them to survive, but this film is based on letters to their loved ones, some never delivered; and thus the reality of War. The realism here rivals "Saving Private Ryan" and indeed Steven Spielberg was a co-producer. I can't add much to what others have said of this film, except to say it deserves the highest praises. I'd just like to add a postscript to my comments. During the Cold War from 1945-1989 there were threats of War in the air often, but cool heads and patience prevailed and it paid off with great results, but more importantly, far fewer casualties and damage. I hope we, as a civilization, learned from this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World War II on an island not far from the Homeland of Japan is under attack by Americans, with slim chances of survival the movie follows a number of the Japanese soldiers who each have their own stories to tell.Immediately what hits you is how the tone of the visual work draws you in and doesn't let go, the grit and dirt from the tunnels and the look of starvation on the faces of the men wont leave my mind for a while. Very little colour throughout but not black and white, this really evokes the harsh inevitabilities that are set in the plot. A very subtle score leaving the visuals to communicate entirely and it works well.I've been really into Clint Eastwood's directing efforts as of late and looking back, this does not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic masterpiece that will be etched in the annals of war film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima is the story of a group of Japanese soldiers fueled by the love for their country, who attempt to defend a key strategic defense point of their country at all possible costs. The movie also focuses on the stories of some of the major characters.One thing is for certain-- Letters from Iwo Jima is one of the greatest war movies ever made. It is also quite cool that this time, the Japanese are made protagonists, which breaks the banality of World War II-based films. It is also outstanding that Clint Eastwood was able to direct characters who speak a language different from his. It's just astounding.It is inevitable that war films like Letters from Iwo Jima have the highly-pumped action scenes and sequences. However, Iwo Jima does not rely on this to make it through to the end. Iwo Jima pushed each and every actor to the best of their acting abilities, and definitely had the viewers empathizing. Every line in the film has emotion-- and it is no hyperbole whatsoever.Another thing that makes watching Letters from Iwo Jima worthwhile is that the stories of the characters are introduced with faded flashbacks. I found the move intelligent and enriching to the movie.I cried a little because the deaths of the soldiers were just heart-wrenching. Unlike other war movies, where the soldier dies and the viewer goes "OK. Like, who's that guy who died?", Iwo Jima gives a reason that every soldier who is killed is remembered by the viewers. From Saigo's friend who committed grenade hara-kiri up to General Kuribayashi's dramatic pistol-in-the-chest death-- all of them are characters worth remembering. Even Uranus the Horse's death seemed a little tear-jerking. A little confession (whisper) I cried the most when Baron Nishi killed himself.Letters from Iwo Jima is like any war film- there's the action-packed scenes and sequences, there's the death of several soldiers by brutal and unspeakable ways, and there's the usual friendship between the soldiers and the drama that comes when one is killed. However, Iwo Jima exceeds the usual war film by 200%, and these usual factors are magnified by Letters by Iwo Jima by the number of times it needs for the individual epithelial cells of the intestinal serosa to be seen.Outstanding directing, outstanding acting, outstanding story-- all of these sum up to an outstanding movie. This is a war film that is so full of emotion that Pearl Harbor would have to make a run for its money! Final say? Letters from Iwo Jima is an outstanding cinematic masterpiece that will have viewers' eyes glued to the screen. Every second is breathtaking, momentous, thrilling and emotional-- and this is no hyperbole. In my opinion, this is the greatest war movie ever made, and I stand by this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not expect to return home alive.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>General Kuribayashi is sent to Iwo Jima to lead Japanese troops against an American invasion. The General soon realises that this is a futile task, but he wants to ensure that his men do their utmost to defend the island without a needless waste of life.Recently, I experience a certain amount of trepidation when watching a Clint Eastwood film. I admit that Eastwood has made some great movies; however, I get really annoyed when movies like his Million Dollar Baby are mistaken for great cinema. Movies whose sole purpose is to show how cruel life can be and that let their characters wallow in self- pity from one devastating event to the next are depressing, mediocre cinema? and, I might add, blatant Oscar hunting! But now I will get down off my soap box and consider his latest effort, Letters from Iwo Jima, without prejudice.Letters from Iwo Jima is great cinema: it provides an unflinching depiction of war, does not glorify one side or the other, and implies there are no heroes, just soldiers. In fact, at times it portrays the Americans as cruel invaders with no regard for the rules of war. This movie also hammers home what an unnecessary waste of life war actually is, and how absurd it seems that, after thousands of years of human evolution, governments are still settling their differences with violence.Apart from its moral message, there is much more to be admired in this film. The images of Iwo Jima are stark and colourless, which helps depict the bleak atmosphere that surrounds the soldiers. The use of colour does not stop there: when the soldiers are remembering happier times in their lives, the colours are vibrant and enriching. This technique has been used many times before, but not always with such great affect. The performances are also tremendous. Ken Watanabe is outstanding as the tormented and forward-thinking General, and Kazunari Ninomiya is sublime as the baker whom fate and circumstance made a soldier.Letters from Iwo Jima will no doubt come to be considered a classic war film, and deservedly so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eastwood compiles with "Flags of our Fathers" a marvelous transcription of the Iwo Jima battle from the two sides of the battle. The verisimilitude which with the film is presented, almost as a documentary, shows Clint's sincere intentions without any egocentric whim.He chooses a grayish overtone, to resemble the memories or the photographs that captured the time being. With deeply poetical establishing shots, he also plays with the camera, always acting like an eye showing what characters see. In technical spots, the sound and sound editing are furious and perfect, clear and breathtaking.The story roams around the lives of some warriors and how war capriciously destroys their lives. It's hard to connect to them knowing who wins the war and who most probably dies. But what Eastwood did better, without any doubt, is the portray of the psychological await for war, as seen in "Jarhead". The anxiety, the tension is so heavy we can almost cut it with a knife. We unite in their nervousness, excitement, suffering waiting in that steep and dusty Purgatory.The Japanese logic and war moral is fantastically presented, simple and fresh. The war is entertaining and greatly directed. The movie also has a heavy emotional stroke. "Letters of Iwo Jima" doesn't seem like it is directed by Eastwood, and that shows his powerful talent.Very Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What novel paths filmmakers are traveling down, on their journeys to advance the medium. After 100 years, we are still working out the wrinkles in defining what movies are in the first place. For one thing, it's obvious at this point that they aren't merely 90-minute one-time events. What we used to consider a movie in these terms is today quite possibly just a small part of the big picture, the series or franchise. 'Fellowship of the Ring' isn't as much a movie as it is a part of a trilogy.This film (and it's counterpart 'Flags') combine to instantiate a new (to me) form. That is, a two-piece 5 hour film, each half a narrative yin/yang reflection of the other, and both tell basically the same tale, which is about the propaganda war waged by any government against its own people.It reads as un-Hollywood as any major film I've seen in years in the depiction of good and evil as myths. Remember, the Hollywood machine has relied on the lazy notions of clear-cut conflict between good and evil for many decades.This easily bests Tarantino's similarly-structured, yet simple episodic 'Kill Bill' of a couple years prior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The History of World War II begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's said that history can only commence when all the characters involved have passed away. It's been 60 years since Iwo Jima events marked the start of the end of the WWII Pacific War, so it may sound good to revisit this turning point from our modern perspective.Modern perspective means Japan has become a world economic power. Japanese mega corporations owns much of the American entertainment industry and they slowly seem more open to discuss their recent history. So it took Clint Eastwood to dare to take this project along an extreme thin wire hanging high over hate and revenge, pain and honor, sentiments and memories. For Hollywood has stuck to patriotic propaganda as long as the American message was the only thing needed to market films worldwide. Growing Anti-Americanism has forced not just a more critical approach, already present in so many films, but also a less American-centered vision.Keeping this in mind, 'Letters from Iwo Jima' succeeded in getting me involved into the doomed fate of thousands of Japanese soldiers, mostly recruited by force to die for his Emperor defending a small volcanic island thought to be the most distant part of the 'sacred land of Japan', as one of its most irreverent fellow soldiers buries all their comrades unsent letters for their beloved ones to get them sometime in the future.The message behind is not that war is bad, yet it can be understood. The message behind this movie is that war is fought between sons of the same mother. Honor, patriotism, blinded those men into killing and making themselves to be killed by a piece of volcanic rock lost in the ocean, defending a war already lost.To explain that, Eastwood could get an impressive script, acting, a dim cinematography that remarks the sense of anticipating tragedy, and a hypnotic piano tune that slowly runs into climax with the school Japanese song that plays in the radio for the final farewell.A bit of flash back, lots of the usual brutality, boring crossfire battlefield scenes, and very emotional, very intense depictions of human beings trapped in the nonsense web of war that help the viewer to endure the toughness of many scenes, the deafening gunshots and explosions, the yelling language of the Japanese military and over all, the anguish of knowing each wound is cut twice in a war: once in your own flesh, another in your beloved ones heart, and the opposite. We see a 'home front' devised to keep the men supply for war going, even if they start to get too young or too old to serve, using everything from propaganda, threatening families, children praising, extortion and all kind of brutal methods.I liked very much each of the characterizations, and never fell back because of a verbose all-Japanese script because its easy flow. Regarding connection with its companion movie, 'Flags of Our Fathers', we can link a couple of specific events in both films, enough to create a sense of parallel worlds that even clashing one into another are still universes apart.Technically humble, yet taking advantage of some of the more ambitious 'Flags of Our Fathers' footage and scenery, 'Letters from Iwo Jima' has been devised as a serious, successful effort to create a masterwork that I would recommend to view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World War II from a different eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The companion film to Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers. This is the better film. It's good to see the US as the bad guy, to see a war film told from the viewpoint of the other guy.The film looks at the Japanese with a dispassionate eye. We see men who are all honorable and brave, even though some follow the path of the warrior unquestioningly (e.g., Lieutenants Tanida and Ito, who, contrary to orders, decide that they -- and their men -- must suicide rather than retreat, even though their commanding general needs them in his battle (I'll never understand Bushido completely).Watanabe and Ihara are wonderful as the General and Captain who have lived with Americans and respect them; who would rather party with their counterparts than kill them. When Kuribayashi and Nishi die, I felt sorrow and respect, for they were good men placed into an impossible, untenable situation. Ninomiya Kazunari, as Saigo, the "everyman" is sympathetic as he is placed in critical situations which he faces with no understanding of the circumstances which cause them. All he wants, just like the American soldiers, is to live through the war and go home to his wife.I think that people who see this film will come away with, not only new ideas about World War II, but perhaps with a better understanding of the ideas that still drive the Japanese world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Combine with FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS for the best 2 films of 2006</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>YES, my summary is correct, This magnificent film of Clint Eastward must be seen in conjunction with FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS.Clint Eastward shows the story of IWO JIMA from both perspectives.In Flags we saw it in relation to the raising of the flag on top of Mount Suribachi &amp; the effect it had on 3 surviving members who raised the flag.In Letters we see the Japanese perspective from a group of soldiers &amp; officers &amp; there reactions to the conditions they have to endure trying to survive.There are harrowing scenes in both films showing the horrors of war &amp; the effects it has on those taking part.Letters is in Japanese with ample subtitles helping us understand what the other side was like.Ken Watanabe is the only familiar name in the cast, The acting by all is pitch perfect. In fact everything is just about perfect in both films.The running time is a well paced 140 fast minutes.Both films rank as the best films of 2006.Ratings: **** (out of 4) 99 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Know thy enemy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I did not care to much for Flags of our fathers, partly because it did not add much to the war movie genre. You know, your side is the good side and even though war is a grisly affair the butchering of young men is somehow still worth it. And I just wasn't taken in by it. Letters from Iwo Jima is something else, though. It portrays "the enemy" as humans with virtues and flaws, with children and friends, with doubts and convictions. No side is the good side. No side is the bad side. War is just sad and, at best, the indiscriminate killing of fathers, brothers, sons, boyfriends and husbands. Eastwood should be commended for making a passionate and inquisitive film about the enemy. I can only hope that it won't take 62 years to make a similar film about the enemies of today.

		<shortDescription>I could want to do this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not fond of war films. That said, the war film "Letters From Iwo Jima" is not, I believe, one that will stay with you for the rest of your life. It is more a movie of an immediate impact on the viewer, one of those pieces that make you want to make cinema. I cannot pay enough compliments to the inspiration the picture is filled with, but I'll just say that if I were a director, I'd never had thought about making a war movie before watching "Letters From Iwo Jima".I went for a coffee after watching the movie and the queue was incredibly long, and I told a friend of mine: "The coffee is better when the place is full because they make it with an incentive". I know it sounds senseless, but the point I want to make is the following: Clint Eastwood's urgency in making this right after "Flags of Our Fathers" is more than understood and justified by the movie itself.From the opening shot of the deserted shore of the island of Iwo Jima, you sense one thing in the camera: affection. I could also say compassion, but it would be rather strong; what Eastwood has is a deep concern about his characters, made clearer and more powerful as the film approaches the final scenes.When I said that "Letters From Iwo Jima" was inspiring, I said meaning the only two things it can: that it inspires the viewer, and that it is made by an inspired filmmaker. The remarkable thing about Eastwood's direction, apart from the fact that the movie is completely spoken in Japanese and that impressive sea full of ships and the action scenes, shockingly real and merciless; is that he presents the relationships between the soldiers far away from every sentimentalism and full of harsh frankness, even when he cares for them.I've seen other films (with titles not worth mentioning now) of personal relationships between soldiers in times of war, but they couldn't help what Eastwood's movie avoids: untrue sensibility. Yes, the characters in "Letters From Iwo Jima" have emotions: towards their friends, the family they left behind and towards their country. However, this is all within and Eastwood characteristic: the lack of manipulation.Things are the way they are, so why should we change them? Asking questions about the resolution of the film would seem pointless, because it is something that happened in real life and everyone knows its outcome. But as I say this, I also assure you that Eastwood's craft makes room for a surprise element; once you become involved with these soldiers' lives and start drawing conclusions about what's going on on screen; as you can't take your eyes off it.How could you, when there's such a beautiful composition there? In a color between black and white and brown that I would normally call 'sepia', Tom Stern's cinematography is an instant and easy highlight throughout the film; as he gives, a times, images that seem like 'out of a dream'. And Joel Cox and Gary Roach's editing, with the cuts in black that are more powerful here than in "Million Dollar Baby", or at least work better, as they intensify the crucial moments because of their repetition.I don't need to talk about the performances, never bad in an Eastwood picture. If the genius will amaze everyone again, I don't know. But I don't care if he doesn't, because he's already 'done it' for me: he's made think, but really think about making movies once more; and he did it with a war film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another year, another World War II film just in time for the Oscars. What makes this one any different when we know the outcome? And why watch this when the same director had one out not that long ago? The difference with knowing the end of this film however, is that it's not a happy ending. You know the Japanese are going to lose and the Americans are going to raise that flag for that iconic shot. But for that go see Flags of our Fathers. Clint Eastwood does great in showing that the enemy are also human. Like the Americans they have wives waiting at home, dreams to pursue. There is also a hapless humour to main protagonist Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) with General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) as the honourable general with controversial tactics. And Eastwood isn't afraid to show the Americans as potential villains here, as they shoot prisoners in contrast to the opposition's hospitality. Though not an action epic, the war scenes are beautifully shot, as Eastwood shows how picturesque the island regardless of the destruction wrought upon it. There's nothing much wrong with the movie, it drags in places though pays off in the end. An enjoyable war film that's told from a different perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I don't blame the dog."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent, complex, and wrenching film. This film was filled with ironies and points of comparison with subsequent armed conflicts. For example, the Japanese soldiers repeated over and over the idea that they continued to fight in order that wives and children would be safe at home. If protection of the homeland was their motivation, then Pearl Harbor would have been a "pre-emptive strike"? There was the further idea that surrender rather than a fight-to-the-death would jeopardize the safety of families back home. Tragically, it was this stay-the-course mentality and this refusal to face facts which directly prompted the atomic bombing of the homeland, whereas surrender would arguably have led to a less devastating result.Some commentators have complained that not enough is said of the reasons underlying the war. I don't think that reasons are necessary, when the screenwriter's premise is to illustrate the ultimate futility of armed conflict in a modern world. The foot soldiers on both sides seemed very unconcerned about the geopolitical reasons (if they even knew what those reasons were). They were placed in a position of having to make the ultimate sacrifice, and they knew very little about why, other than the usual slogans.There is a small scene which illustrates how one soldier came to be on Iwo Jima, and that scene is filled with ironies about the notion of soldiers fighting to see that wives and children were safe in their homes. I won't tell you any more about this magnificent scene, other than to say it ends with a heartbreaking line: "I don't blame the dog."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifyingly Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters From Iwo Jima (2006)Terrifyingly BeautifulA war film straight and narrow, laced with the irony of fighting a lost cause, and facing death a hundred different ways, but filmed with such devastating beauty it rises to some other kind of aesthetic. This is a special film, a daring American attempt to see the Japanese side of a legendary and horrible battle. Clint Eastwood is certainly a director with grand ideas and completely solid abilities. Shot with Japanese actors and with subtitles throughout, there is an uneasy believability to all the pain and angst.There are times, now and then, more than once, where we feel that maybe Eastwood's ideas are a little sentimentalized. He zeroes in on parallels and sympathies between the two sides, and this makes for natural entry points for the viewer, or at least for the American viewer. But this seems to simplify and even water down the actual sentiments of the Japanese fighters. War can be filmed in a beautiful way, but in the end it is still really really awful. I don't mean just sad--this movie makes the sadness so palpable it's draining--but I mean awful, with hatred and filth and irrational violence. All of that is here, but in a way that doesn't always puncture the moody, dramatic aura of the filming.It sounds like I want it both ways, gorgeous and ugly at the same time. But no, I like this movie as it is. But I think in watching it we have to remind ourselves that it's a pageantry, a artistic rendering of war. To make it so layered with real emotional conflicts, from devotion to self-preservation, and still keep the overall trajectory on target, is admirable. The weakest points might be the way the flashbacks are worked in, as smooth as the attempt to be, they appear here and there like patches. The other conspicuous aspect to question is the length of the movie, well over two hours, and here I have to say, if the feeling of the movie works for you, you won't notice its length, and you might even be sad to see it end.Oddly, maybe as an act of pure nepotism, the soundtrack sounds like simplistic Hollywood film music. The good thing is that means it fills in and isn't conspicuous. But why not use music that a Japanese film might use, or actual music from the period, or just anything with a Japanese aspect. It reminds us that the film is made by a Californian, and I guess that's okay, since it's true, but once you notice it you'll keep noticing it. Like Gran Torino, this movie reveals a little bit of Eastwood's social views and the movies as a result suffer, this one less than the more recent one set in Michigan, from stereotypes and over simplification. Easy to overlook, but it shouldn't be overlooked, especially when its crucial to understanding the meat of the themes.Surely, one of the remarkable things about the movie, beyond the astonishing visuals (photography, editing, overall staging and lighting, on and on) is the acting. There are great performances by a whole range of characters, including the main two, the general and the young soldier. In fact, when the American soldiers appear and speak near the end, they seem far less intense and realistic.I don't know if it helps to link this movie to Flags of Our Fathers because it operates rather differently, and without any real interweaving of significance. The mere notion that the two films were made simultaneously (almost) is great stuff, but Flags takes the idea back to the States and we see suffering of a different sort. Letters is a movie about war, straight, no chaser. And as such, leaving out the more peripheral masterpieces like Deer Hunter, it's one of the best war movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Letters arrive first class.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's companion piece to "Flags Of Our Fathers" shows the famous WWII battle from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers involved and, it has to be said, easily joins it's cinematic brother as an example of Eastwood's finest directorial work outside of the western genre.This was never going to be an easy sell to mainstream cinema audiences thanks to three main stumbling blocks. 1) It's subtitled and that, sad as it may seem, STILL puts off a proportion of moviegoers. 2) Many ignorant Westernised folk (and I am ashamed to include myself in this group) may find it difficult at times to differentiate between many of the secondary Japanese characters. 3) The obvious streak of anti-American sentiment harboured by the Japanese at the time (although Eastwood does try to maintain a balanced view most of the time and he also, to his credit, does not portray either side as simplistically all good or all bad). But look past these things (I refuse to call them flaws simply because they affect the viewing experience for some people) and you will find quite an incredible, and quietly powerful, movie.The key word here is "restraint" as we are once again provided with a war movie that often keeps us away from the more obvious war movie moments. However, unlike "Flags Of Our Fathers", which intertwined it's war scenes with a storyline physically far removed from the battlefield, this movie never lets us get away from the fight but instead has us hiding in the tunnels and caves right alongside the Japanese contingent.We get to experience the frequent trials and terrors of the soldiers but, more than just re-enacting key moments from a historical event, Eastwood uses this particular battle this time around to explore ideas about honour, nobility, cowardice, survival, courage and blindly following orders. I suppose you could argue that, thematically linking it to "Flags Of Our Fathers" above and beyond the shared battle itself, this film is also about heroism and what individuals think makes for a hero but that's only one perspective and I personally felt that the other topics mentioned above took obvious precedence.Do see both movies if you are even remotely interested in one of them as they make for quite a double whammy. I don't think that this is Eastwood's bravest work (directorially I would still opt for "Play Misty For Me" and acting wise he has yet to surpass "The Beguiled") but it IS a fantastic achievement and one huge gamble from an individual who's been in the game so long that he definitely knows how to stack the odds in his favour.See this if you like: Flags Of Our Fathers, Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>He's done it again. Clint Eastwood has managed to create his fourth masterpiece in a row. 'Letters From Iwo Jima' might not be the best war film ever made, but it's certainly one of the most interesting and original. 'Letters From Iwo Jima' like 'Flags of Our Fathers' is about the battle of Iwo Jima, only in 'Letters' the film shows the battle from the Japanese perspective with the Americans as the "enemy." 'Letters From Iwo Jima' is beautifully made film on every level. First off, Eastwood's directing and Tom Stern's cinematography are nothing short of masterful. The screenplay is more adequate than most war films and there is not a weak link in the acting chain. Ken Watanabe gives a subtle yet commanding performance as the Japanese general that is in my opinion his finest work to date. Why Watanabe was snubbed for an Oscar nod, I'll never know. The story is powerful and the viewer will learn a lot of facts about the Japanese perspective of the battle they wouldn't have learned in a subjective American History text book.

		<fullReview>Hi...Can we talk? Let me say I am not a big Eastwood fan and have never ever seen one of the movies he has directed. As an actor he is just OK. Today I got a chance to see Letter from Iwo. All 2hr and 20min of it. I didn't think the movie was going to be that good but I can honestly say the movie captivated me. It ran me through the gammit in emotions. I sometimes I got a lump in my throat like I wanted to cry because I felt like I was right there experiencing what the troops were experiencing. At other times I felt the horror that the japs felt, particularly during the mass suicides when some of them were pulling the pins out of the grenades and putting them to there chest when they new they had no other out. It also showed the human side by letting us know that they were not all fanatics but just got drafted into war because they had no choice and like Dick Cheney would say they had much better things they would be doing than fighting a war. The cinematography was excellent and the acting was quite excellent indeed. There was not a lot over acting and dramatizations like a lot of American actors do. These guys just acted and made it as believable as if I were talking to them face to face joking and bs'ing. So I have no choice but to give it 10 stars because it was the best most believable movies I have seen in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine movie -- but not the 'other side' of Flags of Our Fathers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent movie, as widely and correctly advertised, tells the story of the battle of Iwo Jima as seen from the Japanese side. Except in a few scenes, the dialog is in Japanese and the perspective, increasingly so as the situation becomes more desperate, is that of soldiers expecting to die in a fight to the "last man." Although there are a small number of soldiers who want to surrender and live, most are prepared to commit suicide rather than be captured.Because they were from the same director (Clint Eastwood) and released almost simultaneously, "Letters from Iwo Jima" has been regarded by most critics as the other side of "Flags of Our Fathers," but that is incorrect in my opinion. "Flags of Our Fathers" is less about the battle for Iwo Jima as seen from the American side than it is about the attempt to exploit the famous photograph of the raising of the American Flag over Mt. Surabachi when it was captured by the Marines. It is focused on the men who toured the country selling war bonds and, in particular, on Ira Hayes, the American Indian tortured by this appeal to patriotism, believing he is NOT the hero that he is ordered to portray.Movie fans seeking the "other side" of "Letters from Iwo Jima" ought to find "Sands of Iwo Jima," the John Wayne movie, made more than 50 years ago. To be sure "Sands..." is an exaggerated tale of American heroism in the face of a fierce and suicidal enemy, but it is about the battle, not about the home front and not about what became of Ira Hayes."Letters..." is a much better movie than "Flags..." or "Sands..." However, because it plainly sympathizes with the handful of Japanese on whom the camera and the script focus most attention, "Letters..." could not have been made in the immediate aftermath of World War II. (Nor, for that matter, could "Flags..." have made then because it adopts a cynical view of the way Joe Rosenthal's famous photograph was exploited.) For me, however, the most interesting thing about the pairing of the two films -- i.e., "Flags..." and "Letters..." -- is what it tells us about the still evolving ambitions of Clint Eastwood as a serious film director. These films, though they are not as good as "Mystic River" or "Million Dollar Baby", stretch Eastwood's intentions and challenge his skills in a way that the other two splendid films did not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Letters From Iwo Jima was without a doubt the most powerful movie of 2006. The acting was terrific, and the battle sequences rival those of producer Steven Spielbergs' "Saving Private Ryan". Even though Mr. Eastwood is well along in his years, he still has what it takes to make a movie that will make you realize why movies were made in the first place. When i heard that Mr. Eastwood was making another film about Iwo Jima, i was excited and yet scared, Would it be anything close to "Flags of Our Fathers". but i didn't have to worry, "Letters From Iwo Jima" "Letters" came out and destroyed it's sister movie. this is one of my top five movies of all time. I was really mad when it didn't win Best Picture. but of course Clint Eastwood will come back with something else in a couple of years and reclaim his Oscar. If you have not seen this movie, watch it, it will blow you away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another masterpiece by Mr. Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many other people I know, I was disappointed with Eastwood's "Flags of our Fathers". It was no more than another cliché and dull WWII film. Because of this "Eastwood mess up", I did not even bother to see "Letters from Iwo Jima" in theaters, and anyway, it was hardly in the theaters from where I live. However, after hearing many outstanding critic reviews of this film, I waited for rental to see it for myself. If you did not care for "Flags of our Fathers", you should definitely see this! Doing a film based on the non-American side of WWII was not only interesting, but was quite compelling. This war film is unusual than most war films, for there isn't a boat load of blood-soaking war action, but nonetheless it didn't feel like a two and a half hour film.Instead, what Mr. Eastwood focused on was the characters and men who faced impossible odds and stood together as one with dignity and honor, facing their inevitable doom. Each character's struggle and story is way more interesting than facing the popcorn loving "graphic war violence". In fact, I didn't look forward to any of the violence in the film, for each character was so believable and human, that watching them die was at most heart-wrenching.This film also defies the stereotype that most war films carry of showing the Americans as "good guys" and the axis soldiers and Japanese as "bad guys". There was no good or evil, only men fighting in a war they don't want to be a part of. The cast was far by excellent, especially Ken Watanbe. I honestly felt Ken was once again snubbed by the Oscars, like his performance for "The Last Samurai." The other Japanese actors were also phenomenal in their roles.And once again, Mr. Eastwood proves to be among the best of Hollywood directors, despite his age. The camera angles in the film pursue the characters from the fighting in the trenches to the underground tunnels and the hills of where they hideout and talk about memories of home. I felt inside the film with them. I don't need to mention the rest of the film, because it all receives high marks. I was totally engrossed by it from start to finish.10/10 If "The Departed" wasn't released in 2006, this should have won picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorial Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decoration Day or Memorial Day as it is now called is a day set aside to honor those who fought in all of the wars since the Civil War, wars in defense of country and citizens. While we languish over the misbegotten war on Iraq it is helpful to view the Clint Eastwood film LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA and visit the mindset of the 'enemy' - the soldiers pointing weapons our way - in an attempt to understand the global effect of war on the battlefield.Eastwood wisely pairs his disappointing 'Flags of our Fathers', which addressed the political 'war games' simultaneously with the combat on a small Japanese island in World War II, with a 'look at the other side' viewpoint. The same type of militarism, blind faith in the war machine, brutality, fear of dying, bonding among friends, the spectrum of 'good officers versus cruel inflexible officers, and the spectrum of humanity is equalized and the result is a moving drama that sheds needed light on how 'war' is a universal beast no matter one's stance.The telling of the story with occasional letter contents is sound if somewhat over long. The screenplay by Iris Yamashita and Paul Haggis is based on Tadamichi Kuribayashi's "Picture Letters from Commander in Chief" - Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) being the film's chief character. Watanabe is excellent in his well-rounded approach to the role of the 'good commander' in both his wise military judgment and his kindness bestowed on the simplest of soldiers such as Saigo (the sensitive Kazunari Ninomiya). For many of us this is the first encounter with the vantage that the Japanese were minimally supplied and supported in defending their sacred Iwo Jima against the American aggressors: the battle was a doomed last stand for the Japanese despite all the casualties suffered by both sides. Eastwood does away with the 'kamikazi' stereotype of the Japanese soldier and allows us to see them as human beings, away form home, fighting to defend their country and their honor.No one is right in war: circumstances and places vary from Europe, the Far East, the Middle East and here but horrors remain the same. It is good to be reminded of this, as in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, especially on Memorial Day. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Eastwood's darkest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood's second film about Iwo Jima is by far darker than Flags of our Fathers, allusive, graphically violent and wise in his depictions of the Showa era in all its contradictions (blind heroism and the lack of judgment of some of the Japanese generals due to an old and belliquous code of honour) as much as it is brilliant in the classical narrative and characters-mixed storytelling of a few Japanese soldiers facing the unspeakable : a certain death from an invader they know nothing about -but by means of propaganda-. Patriotism is described here with all its shapes, from the undeviated trust of some to the shaken or even unpatriotic choices (but did they chose it?) of others. All its tragedy, delusion and stupidity in each human destiny seen in the film is just as unexpected as it is realistic. The despair felt at the first minutes of the American attack, attack shot by Eastwood with the idea of avoiding any contact with the American troops(Americans in the film only have a few supporting roles), gives an impression of isolation, and injects feelings of solitude and madness in each Japanese soldier. The ruthlessness of the fighting scenes is perfectly combined to the flashbacks from their past lives. Letters from Iwo Jima is probably one of Eastwood's darkest film with Unforgiven and Pale Rider, giving no (or only few) reasons to hope for his characters doomed to fail miserably or to die despite their beautiful and poetic ability to understand the world around them and the vanity and nonsense to lose one's life at war.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a Masterpiece!! Try to Catch It While It's Still in Your Nearest Multiplex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima is the companion movie of Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers, it is about the people behind the Battle Of Iwo Jima, a key battleground between the Japanese and the American soldiers during World War 2. Wherein, Flags was about the battle from the Americans point of view, Letters from Iwo Jima tackles the battle from the Japanese perspective. We are already familiar with World War II movies from the US side. Films such as Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, and The Great Raid comes to mind. Letters however showed a side that we are not familiar of. Like the Yanks, some Japanese men are also hesitant to leave their loved ones at home to fight a war that they did not start. They are also human beings: getting scared, nervous and jittery when they hear the sound of gunfire, bombs and approaching aircraft. However, the film does not glorify both sides. It simply puts that the lessons of war whoever side are you from should not be forgotten and it should never happen again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best engaging, moving and thought-provoking movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie first came to my country, I caught the sneaks 2 times, and a third on its opening day. I have never watched a movie 3 times in a cinema before, and this movie has provoked so much in me that i kept going to the cinemas for another 2 times. Words are not enough to express what this movie is about, and how much this movie is going to make you think.This movie manages to convey so much, with so little, it shows you how we are all very much the same, that the murderous trait in the Japanese are not just inherent to a race or a nation.Most of the Japanese were themselves not very connected with the outside world, and Imperial Japan made use of this to spread propaganda about the Chinese, Americans etc. The film manages to show this by contrasting Baron Nishi, Gen. Kuri, who have seen the outside world and normal soldiers who have been thrust from their simple secluded life in Japan into a war with the US. The scenes of normal Japanese soldiers bearing their hatred towards the Americans and Baron Nish being humane towards his fellow human being, an American soldier... It makes you think why this is so, it provokes your thoughts, it carries you outside the theatre it is overwhelming how good this film is.This is just a simple example from this film and it is only just 2 scenes! This movie does not just entertain like any other shallow movie a la The Departed, it moves you, it makes you think.However, it is with great regret that this film has lost to The Departed, perhaps because the voters didn't like how it shows the enemy their boys were fighting were as humane as them, just as anyone else, but this is true...we are all humans.P.S. If you only like movies that entertain you for as long as your are in the theatre, or movies that do not require much thought, please do not watch this film. This is not a film for "Norbit" lovers.10/10 definitely, the best film I have ever watched and I believe, for a long time to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the saying goes, "to the victors goes the spoils." When Americans make films about war, they more times than not come out on top. It invariably show the fighting perpetual undying spirit of a nation of heroes fighting through adversity to win a war that others think they should fail at. There are exceptions of course, but never, that I can recall, has their been an American film that shows the other side, with an honest and unbiased approach. Clint Eastwood's Letter From Iwo Jima does just that. The Americans still win the battle of Iwo Jima of course, but this film goes to great lengths to show the human side to their enemy. War is hell, no doubt, but there are still real people on both ends of the gun. Real people have to make real decisions and those decisions affect the balance of the war. While I doubt some of the humanity prevalent in the film, I don't doubt the emotion and the realism of how each and every soldier feels.The anchor of the film is the great Japanese actor Ken Watanabe, who should have won an Oscar for his excellent work in The Last Saumurai. He plays the historical figure General Kuribayashi, the genius behind the defense of the island. This film shows his wits and his tenacity as he arrives on the island and immediately tells his soldiers that the defense they are planning is futile and he has them digging tunnels in the rocky mountainous terrain. This is burdensome for the soldiers but most of them believe in the General and they do it without question. It also shows the aggressive nature of some of the other captains as they make them men work long hours in the blazing sunshine, beat them when they tire and deprive them of food and water for long periods of time. This all changes when Kuribayashi lands on the island. His approach to things is a complete dichotomy from what we have been taught about the Japanese. He is a humanitarian. He believes in treating each soldier humanely. He is dedicated, smart and loyal to Japan first and foremost, but he is not abusive to the point of excess. If you look at other films that show the ugly side the the Japanese like Men Behind the Sun, this is refreshing in that there is a much more human side to people of the nationality. Not only was the General kind and generous, but the soldiers, based on the letters discovered, were very much like their American counterparts. These were all nervous and scared young men just hoping they would make it back home to see their wives and young children. This is conveyed beautifully by Eastwood.The war scenes are a true wonder as well. Some of the film was done with CGI so they could show the massive assault the Americans launched on the island. This must have been done to keep the cost to a minimum. But the bombs, the blasts, the gunfire and the fighting are all images and sounds that will stay with you long after you leave the theater. It's interesting to see how the ideologies are different between the Americans and the Japanese. The Japanese epitomize the phrase "death before dishonour" as some of them literally blow their own heads off than get captured and disgrace the motherland. There are some indelible scenes in the film that will stay with you as the Japanese men imbue each other with a fighting spirit that is usually reserved for American jingoism. But Eastwood goes to great lengths to paint each side with the same brush, the same stroke and the same humanity. As I said earlier, I find it hard to believe that it happened exactly like this because war can be hell and this was definitely the sugar coated version of what men can be capable of, but at the same time, the letters written by the young boys in film would certainly have an effect even on the most grizzled man.Clint Eastwood has made a film that is good enough to be nominated for best picture and director. He will lose this year to Scorcese, and deservedly so, but this is undoubtedly one of the years best. Perhaps in a different year, like last year, this might have won. But this year, it will have to settle for the runner up prize.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Letters strikes a home run.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How does one think of Clint Eastwood?If you're over 60, you probably think of him as the TV star of RAWHIDE. If you're in your 40's you think of him as the ultra cool movie actor from the Dirty Harry series. In your 20's, he's known as the multi Oscar wining director of around 30, that's right THIRTY Films! He's usually cast himself in them (often a studio proviso for the money to come forth) but as he's gotten more proficient and garnered Oscar nominations, so he's been let looser. And he doesn't fly much freer than in this film. Letters is based on letters sent home by the man assigned with defending the island; General Kuribayashi. He held the Americans off, with no aerial or ship support for over 30 days. Naturally, the story focuses on other soldiers and what got them to this point as well; emphasizing their basic humanity. See, the Japanese also love horses (but not quite the same way as the Belgians..)It's filmed in the same basic washed out technique that was used for so much of Band Of Brothers and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (8/10). Which is no, great surprise, knowing that Steven Spielberg and Dreamworks studios were involved with the other two as well as this one.Eastwood filmed this one directly after FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, using similar locations but with only one cast member in both. And entirely in Japanese!(Well, except for a couple of flash backs et al). You sort of hope that they weren't just giving out Geisha's phone numbers when supposed to be high emoting.... He's had a close, respectful connection with Japan; with three of his previous films winning best foreign movie awards in Japan. And I have no idea whether this one will be nominated under best foreign movie or not?Ken Watanabe as Kuribayashi is the best known actor in the film; having previously been seen in THE LAST SAMURAI (6/10) and MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA (9/10). But the entire cast work well and show individual competent flair.The script, like FLAGS, has been helped along by script god Paul Haggis(who worked with Eastwood on Million Dollar Baby) and is credited in the Oscar nominations with original writer Iris Yamashita. This film can be many things to many people; An anti-war film about the futility of a fight when it's known to be lost with disagreements within the chain of command or even a pro-war film about duty, heroism and the men who bravely fight in it despite virtually insurmountable odds. It was released after FLAGS; probably as the studios didn't want to be seen as un-patriotic, releasing this one first, though I believe that this one is chronologically better first.I'm sure as we speak, travel agents are taking desperate calls from people wanting to go battle site hunting, but to no avail. It's off limits, except on special commemorative occasions and is an active army base.It works well as a film in creating the sense of isolation and at times almost hopeless desperation of the Japanese, not least by the incredibly evocative soundtrack. I actually stayed specifically to see who wrote the music and was very pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful reminder of our common humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During World War II, Japanese were characterized in the media as sneaky and fanatical, almost sub-human and many had a hard time adjusting to our being allies after the war. Clint Eastwood's Letters From Iwo Jima seeks to balance the equation. Adapted from a book of letters from Japanese soldiers found on Iwo Jima, the film takes place in 1944 during the fight for the island that was deemed strategic for both sides, a fight that ended with 21,000 Japanese and 6,000 American casualties. Spoken in Japanese with English subtitles, the film, a companion piece to Flags Of Our Fathers, dramatizes the battle from the Japanese point of view. Eastwood asks us to suspend our judgments and our knowledge of Japanese atrocities in China and the Philippines and look at the bravery and nobility of Japanese soldiers fighting against insurmountable odds.They are depicted as soldiers who loved their families but were victims of Japanese militarism, forced to adhere to the Bushido code of serving the Emperor by dying honorably rather than preserving one's life. Throughout the film, the Japanese soldiers write letters home, most of which they know will never reach their destination. The hero of the film is Commander Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), an American trained Japanese General who was outnumbered by a ratio of five-to-one yet fought off the US invasion for over a month without air or naval support. He is portrayed as a warrior with dignity and courage who was called an American sympathizer by some officers but who only wanted to give his men a fighting chance.Assisting in the preparations for an expected American invasion, are Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) and Lieutenant Ito (Shido Nakamur). Ito is a fanatical warrior who wears land mines around his shoulders and vows to destroy an American tank by pretending to be a corpse. Kuribayashi, countermanding the order to build trenches on the beach to resist the invasion, orders the soldiers to build underground tunnels in the hard rocks. While knowing the battle is a lost cause because of the American advantage in technology and numbers, he hopes to inflict enough casualties on the American troops that they will lose the will to go on.We get to know Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a Japanese soldier who left his job as a baker and his pregnant wife to join the military. In a flashback, Saigo learns that he is called to serve and is unwilling to leave his wife and their unborn child, but, encouraged by his neighbors, is forced to surrender to the idea of it being a privilege to fight. He stands out as a soldier who values life more than an outmoded code of honor. After a day of shoveling trenches, he writes to his wife, "Am I digging my own grave?" and wonders why he should die trying to kill Americans.Shown in a faded color palette that is almost black and white, Letters From Iwo Jima is a beautifully executed film, though I did find it a bit overlong and the battle scenes repetitious. Additionally, the film may go a bit too far in its attempt to show fairness to both sides, idealizing Kuribayashi and Nishi and inventing an incident in which American soldiers left in charge of two Japanese soldiers who surrendered, ruthlessly shoot them to death rather than stand guard all night. Despite its flaws, however, Letters From Iwo Jima serves as a powerful reminder of our common humanity and makes clear the insanity of war and how it corrupts everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should not be compared with Flags of Our Fathers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After waiting to see this movie for almost a month - was in very limited distribution in the US - I saw it today. It is an outstanding movie, Iwo Jima as shown from the Japanese (both high and low ranks) perspective.I must say that having read James Bradley's sequel to Flags of our Fathers, Flyboys, it helped me understand and appreciate Letters all the more. Flyboys deals with the sister island, ChiChi Jima, 150 miles away. It had been the Japanese communications center for the Pacific and the Japanese thought that would be the next invasion stop. Author Bradley dealt with the Japanese militarist's version of the Samuri Code, called Bushido, (a perversion of the code) and the fate of 6 American POWs there.So what does this book have to do with this movie? It gave me a background to the Japanese conflict over Bushido - rather than give a spoiler I will simply say that both high and low ranks disagreed over this concept of honor. The movie deals with these issues without explaining to western audiences the background. Japanese audiences understand this implicitly. Most of the Japanese, like the Americans, just wanted to come home.Many have wanted to compare this movie to Eastwood's Flags of our Fathers, made in parallel on Iwo - but you are comparing apples and oranges.Flags followed the book 99% and dealt with the subsequent lives of the 3 surviving flag raisers - while Letters deals with the Japanese view of the battle - and how all ranks, both high and low, dealt with their concept of Bushido.I would certainly recommend this movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare look at war completely from the other side makes a point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How often we see the enemy in war portrayed only in snippets here and there. Once in a while half the movie takes place with the opposite side. Here the whole movie is from the Japanese point of view.Depressing this movie was, but no more depressing than "Saving private Ryan" or "Band of brothers". The feeling those soldiers must have felt when they saw the number of US ships and men coming at them was well conveyed. The doom and gloom of not enough men, not enough ammo, generals infighting, not being allowed to surrender, knowing that this island can not be taken by the US, all this is sinks well into your seat. These guys are not long for this world and they know it. The bombing scenes and gun fighting has that new "CGI" look that is pretty realistic. Blood and body parts fly as we follow the head general that takes a completely out numbered force and manages to hold on as long as they do. We see flashbacks to different peoples life before they were sent off to war. Wife's with babies, a secret policeman with conscience, another that lived in America before the war. For me it all points to one thing: War is a pointless waste of life. This movie puts life into these characters only to have them snuffed out. WWII sucked and it sucked big time. I laid in bed awake for hours after this movie thinking about what the world would be like if those 62 MILLION people had not died in that war. Whole generations wiped out. It's no wonder the 60s happened. Most of the people in their 20s and 30s didn't grow up with a dad. I think they were a little bitter about it.10/10 Best picture IMHO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint made a big deal in both films about Ralph Ignatowskis story, but when it came to giving any insight as to what happened has seemingly decided it was best not to create any bad feeling. According to this movie he was simply bayoneted. I don't know what I expected Clint to show but I was left totally ignorant of what actually happened by this movie-I had to Google it. Was the other US soldier who was treated for his wounds when captured by the Japanese but died of them anyway just a fictional character to "balance the books" for Ralphs inhuman treatment ? This kind of doctoring of true stories to fit the historical picture the director wants to paint is VERY annoying. For myself it ruins the film for watching again as although I know it's not a blow by blow account of what actually took place I know the director isn't interested in portraying events accurately. This also results in ignorance amongst anyone who doesn't look up actual events. Other than this doctoring this film would be a 7 or an 8 but as I don't want to watch it again as it winds me up it gets a 5. Stop censoring/modifying historical dramas Hollywood !!!! Clint stick to Dirty Harry or Unforgiven, you can make up what you like then ! Poor Iggy went through a nightmare that can't be imagined but Clint didn't think it was worth rocking the boat or upsetting anyone with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting look from the 'other' side.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There never have been many movies concentrating on the Japanese side of WW II. It makes every movie regarding this subject per definition and interesting one. "Letters from Iwo Jima" is also such a movie that tells just like "Flags of Our Fathers" to story of the battle of Iwo Jima, only this time told from the Japanese side.On a positive note; the movie this time almost entirely focuses just on the battle. It makes the story far more interesting and intriguing to follow. on a negative note, the battle looks just as confusing as was the case in "Flags of Our Fathers". Hours literally goes by in minutes and it's hard to understand who is fighting were at the moment. In some cases it just doesn't ever bother to show some important events but instead use small parts of dialog, concerning the progress of the battle. This is the sort of approach normally a cheaply made movie would make in order to save money. You just don't expect this is a multi-million production. Again it shows that Clint Eastwood is better off sticking to 'small' drama's, it's obvious that his most talent lays there. Although admittedly the budget ($15,000,000) was a lot lower than usually would be the case with such a large scale production.Strangely enough the characters are for more interesting and easy to relate with than was the case in "Flags of Our Fathers". It's also one of the reasons why "Letters from Iwo Jima" works better out as a movie. It's more involving, more tense and more shocking as a war movie. You get a better sense of the madness and scale of the battle and war in general. Interesting, since the movie concentrates on an Axis power of WW II.Yet again the movie is great looking, with nice cinematography and good looking battle sequences, though the budget looks significantly lower than "Flags of Our Fathers".The story isn't as fast going as "Flags of Our Fathers" and the movie takes its time to set up things. It makes the whole build up to the battle and the actual battle itself work out way better on the screen. The pace is definitely slower but yet works out more effective.And wow, how great is Ken Watanabe in this? Too bad that in the middle he gets pushed way too much to the background. I wouldn't had mind another Oscar nomination for him.A great, though in-perfect, 2006 must-see!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's greatest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's great war movie may be seen as an act of forgiveness or an act of atonement or simply as a great film-maker's tribute to the bravery of the men who, just over 50 years ago, would have been his sworn enemy. Indeed, I can think of no more moving a tribute by an artist from one culture to another in all of cinema. Clearly, "Letters from Iowa Jima" is a masterpiece.It is in its way a companion piece to "Flags of our Fathers", Eastwood's account of the Battle of Iowa Jima from the American perspective, only now seen through the eyes of the Japanese. But there are subtle differences. "Flags ..." was not so much a film about the battle as an account of how America used an image from it, (a photograph of the raising of the Stars and Stripes over the island, in itself subtley 'faked'), as a propaganda tool to rally support for the war effort and of the terrible cost this had on those involved. It was as much a film about media manipulation as it was a conventional war movie. When I first saw it I thought it as fine a film as anything Eastwood had given us, but it is not quite in the class of "Letters from Iowa Jima" which is undoubtedly Eastwood's greatest work.With the exception of a few sentences spoken in English and by an American soldier captured by the Japanese, (this scene is heart-breakingly moving and totally without sentimentality), the film is entirely in the Japanese language and with the exception of a few flashbacks it never really leaves the island where the truly horrific events that are unfolding are seen through the eyes of essentially four characters. (Eastwood depicts the horrors of war with a clear-eyed revulsion while still honouring those on both sides who are caught up in it). Whereas other American films have depicted the Japanese as cruel and barbaric, Eastwood, for the most part, shows them as humane and vulnerable. Crucially, one of the few 'atrocities' in the film is committed, not by the Japanese, but by the Americans.Fundamentally, two characters stand out; the brave, cultured General Kuribayashi and Saigo, a young soldier determined to stay alive and return to his wife and child. These roles are beautifully played by Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya, a Japanese boy-band singer displaying an extraordinarily empathic acting talent. But ultimately the film belongs to its director who, with the courage and artistry of an old master, has given us a film that honours both the living and the dead, emphasizing the evils of war while at the same time giving testament to those who laid down their lives for their fellowman. It is imperative that you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are times in the movie when you feel you are right there in the island. Taking orders, running errands amidst everything else. As the waves caress the evening sand, you see yourself walking after a hard day's toiling thinking about your wife and missing the warmth of having your loved ones around you. Wondering how were you as a kid and did you ever dream of such an end. What did YOU do wrong? I have been a great fan of Mr. Eastwood (as a director) and Ken Watanabe, and they have only strengthened my faith in their abilities as craftsmen. I did not have any expectations before I opted for the movie. Now it has been quite some time that I have. And every time I think about what I saw, the subtle intensity leaves me spellbound.

		<shortDescription>Eastwood Out-does himself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Letters from Iwo Jima", which observes the lives and deaths of Japanese soldiers in the battle for Iwo Jima, similarly adheres to some of the conventions of the genre even as it quietly dismantles them. It is, superlatively and even humbly, true to the durable traditions of the war-movie tradition, but it is also utterly unpredictable in its own minor details.Ken Wantanabe stars and undoubtedly gives an astonishing performance as Tadamichi Kuribayashi, a new and sympathetic Lt. General who has barely made his way to Iwo Jima. He is a simple and courageous man, the type of person most of us can connect to. After a quick inspection of the island, the inspired General now devises a war plan. In the viewer's mind their is already an ending planned and predicted, though not through previous war movie endings, but through the gritty history of this event. Eastwood cleverly manages to build confidence and sympathy only to shatter it with masterful action scenes in which they all, obviously, die. Also clever is the usage of a character even more of us can connect to, especially parents of a son. This character is Kazunari Ninomiya, a simple baker who deals in his mind about the philosophy of nationalism contra martyrdom. There is a great flashback while he talks to a fellow soldier, about whom and when he was recruited for the army. In this flashback, we see his wife, and we learn of his soon to be born baby. The film quickly transitions back into reality, and thoroughly creates a dream-like ideology for these flashbacks. Of course, throughout the film, there are more important ones, such as the Lt. General's dinner in America with several American commanders. Eastwood also proves his cinematography again; the frame sparkles at the sight of such beautifully pictured mountains and, ironically, the fire of the war.It's hard to call this film a superlative masterpiece, even after Eastwood left us with high expectations from "Million Dollar Baby". Although barely evident and highly uncared for, there were some definite continuity errors, such as different clothing and quick changes from day to night. But regardless of political and family backgrounds, in the end the viewer sympathizes more with the Japanese than with the Americans. Eastwood manages to convince us about the two sides of the war through an unforgettable and wondrous diptych. The grace of the film is impeccable, and it is a stark reminder that neither a great director nor a great screenwriter has lost their visceral touches through expository reiteration.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The more in vain the better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a European perspective, watching a film about the Pacific theatre of World War II is really weird. The character of the fighting 'over there' looks as though it was taking place on another planet, even in retrospect, after more than six decades. With saying Americans come from another planet having become such fashionable talk 'over here', that feeling is reinforced. Americans and Japanese sent those gigantic aircraft carriers of theirs around that immensely huge Pacific thing, and there's just no need to continue, that's already weird. Logistics-wise, strategy-wise, the challenges they had to face were just so different and so much on another scale.So, Clint Eastwood gives to us a story from this 'extraterrestrial' war. Japanese holding out on Iwo Jima prepare for a last stand. War is dreadful anyway, and it has already been showed both about WWII and other wars as well, so what's the point, one might ask. Moreover, the Japanese know they will lose and you know also, so what's the point. Well, that's exactly the point, or one of the points: the more the whole film looks to have been made in vain, the better. And not only to send home the message that war is bad, once again. It can be interpreted to have a more universal meaning. You see humans whose situations we may in our own way share in the future. Ending up there where death is near inevitable. You can ponder what your 'exit strategy' will then be. The bad news is, and the film deals with this, even though you may want to go with the kind of dignity that matches your concept, there'll be a lot of obstacles. Yourself and other people potentially part of those.Iwo Jima is like a proverbial Titanic headed towards the iceberg, but we don't get tears in our eyes, just silent desperation mostly. In fact what we see is mostly not extraordinarily moving, but still I know a lot of the images will stay with me.As to the concept of giving the audience a chance to see the 'other side' from a 'humane' perspective, well, seemingly, but only seemingly, we're back in this case to the rather problematic distinction between good and bad Japanese (and Germans, for that matter) on the basis of which front they were fighting on. Who would make a movie showing the 'humane' side of Japanese occupiers in China? And who would make the same kind of movie about Germans on the Eastern front, with all the havoc they wrought in Eastern Europe? Yes, some German movies did try to solve the problem - e.g. 'Stalingrad', by focusing on a morally correct bunch of regular soldiers vs. the mean average and the evil SS. Still, I don't expect a Polish movie to be made any time soon, showing e.g. the demolition of Warsaw from the German point of view, you know. So am I attacking Eastwood here? Well, no. This film's not about a Japanese band of brothers. It's not about the transpolation of clichés known from old war movies to 'the enemy' for a change. The portrayal of Japanese soldiers is way more complex than that, and that legitimizes the whole venture, because 'a humane look at the other side' in this way comes to mean a different thing. And for its silent power, it does deserve 10/10.Just one remark added. Ironic that while in the US the movie was played by a relatively small number of theatres, here in Hungary it premiered two weeks before 'Flags of our Fathers'. Why the eagerness to show the 'other side' first here? Anyway, I don't mind, I'll see both films no matter what.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War from the point of view of the 'Bad Guys'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima begins on modern day Iwo Jima. The island is completely abandoned except for a group of archaeologists searching for remains and valuables from the battle of Iwo Jima. It must have been a somber mission, for out of the 20,000 Japanese who fought on Iwo Jima, under 600 survived. They are digging in a man-made cave, one of the many the Japanese dug, when one of them finds a bag. Then the movie then cuts back to 1944, where Saigo, played by Kazunari Niromiya, is complaining to his friend Nozaki, (Yuki Matsuzaki), about the conditions of their labor. "Why don't we just let the Americans have the island?" he asks. "Then we can go home." Unfortunately, his "honorable" captain hears him and asks him what he said. "I said that... if we beat the Americans, then we could go home," stammers Saigo, obviously afraid. Meanwhile, the new General, Tadamichi Kuribashi, arrives on Iwo Jima and sets off on a tour of the island. He finds the captain beating Saigo and his friend for "un-patriotic thoughts". He stops him and suggests he take away their lunches instead. They are very grateful as the food them "sick" anyway. As the movie progresses, we find that General Kuribashi is not a traditional general. Although he loves his country and will die for it, he thinks that things like suicide in the face of defeat is a silly and wasteful idea. He goes about his duties in a less organized way; at one point commanding his assistant to "pretend to be an American", as he finds the best place to shoot at him with his cane. The soldiers up higher on the beach laugh, see his gun and notice it is American. They conclude that he took it off the body of a dead soldier. The movie explains later that he got it as a gift from and American officer while on a diplomatic mission. The movie is reasonably peaceful until the first attack by the Americans, an air raid. As they are cleaning up, Saigo spots a figure sitting with his back to the camp, as if he was asleep. "Hey, lazy, come and help," Saigo says, annoyed, and walks around him to find that he is dead. Saigo eye's widen, then shut quickly, and he turns away. From the start of the movie, it has been evident that he doesn't want to be in a war. He wishes he was back in his bakery. And as the movie progresses, everyone he knows is killed. He watches them all die, every single one, and has to keep on going. As luck would have it, Saigo is the last one alive at the end. He fired his rifle only once. Some people might think that Clint Eastwood is a 'Japanese sympathizer', or too much of a message giver. But I can see, this being the first Eastwood film I've seen, why he's won two directing Oscars. Even though he looked older than I remembered at the Oscars, his age apparently hasn't changed the way he makes film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Letters From Iwo Jima" tells the story of the Japanese soldiers who fought on that island against the Americans. The story is told from multiple perspectives of the soldiers, all writing letters to their loved ones.In my review of Flags of Our fathers I claimed it was too formulaic and unfocused. Letters is Eastwoods second time around with the same story, but from the opposite side. This gives us the result of a courageous film that is beautiful and bold, heart-wrenching and honest, and finally an Oscar worthy picture.Letters out does Flags in every way possible. Not once in flags did I have any emotional connection with anyone, or did I care who lived or died. With Letters I connected with everyone, in their own unique way. The soldier who only wanted to go home to see his wife and baby, the general who wishes he could have washed the kitchen floor before he left, even the Kemeptai soldier who was so desperate3 to go home that he surrendered to the Americans. On that day these soldiers were the enemy, in this film we see who they really are. This film honours the men who fought in that war and not the government of Japan, who was the real enemy.Truth be told, they were as much the victims of war as we were. Eastwood depicts this perfectly, in one scene the soldiers in one mountain cave were ordered to kill themselves. Imagine being he one to have to do that. In what was probably the most intense scene (of many) the remaining soldiers blow themselves up with their hand grenades as they cry in fear, remembering their loved ones before they die. In letters the Americans are the enemy and the language barrier is evident. After one soldier surrenders to the Americans, who is shot, along side a prisoner, simply because the two soldiers believe they will be sitting ducks with these two beside them. If a soldier was considered a coward, then they would be executed by the sword. The true horror of war is depicted in Letters and not Flags.The film flows more smoothly then in Flags, where we would have random flashback sequences coming out of nowhere and serving no purpose. Here you can tell when they will flashback and the importance behind each one. Flags had beautiful cinematography and colours, Eastwood brings the exact same feel to Letters and it's just as beautiful. These colours connect the two films and the two opposing sides, they both fought on the same ground. With Eastwoods hand held camera movements in Flags I had no idea what was going on and my head felt like a top, again in Letters he betters himself and let's us actually see the action, while still containing the feel that it's crazy in there.The film is in Japanese with one or two scenes spoken in English. As with Passion of the Christ, it adds to the experience of the film and puts you there. In films like Enemy At The Gates, where the Russians and Germans all spoke English, you feel like you're watching a movie. In the one of two scenes were English is spoken, a Japanese General reads a letter written by the mother of one of the American soldiers. The Japanese soldiers listen and understand that the Americans are not the ruthless monsters they were told, but in fact human. Just like them and they don't want to be on the battlefield just as much as they do. Everyone in the cast deliver honest and powerful performances. Watanbe, who is more comfortable in his native language; captures the screen in every scene he is in, playing both a strong minded general and a soft hearted human at the same time. He doesn't want to fight, but he wants to honour Japan at the same time.The film does fault itself though. It is a very long film that kind of dragged itself to the finish line. I did find myself thinking that it was a long movie and when you start thinking that, it takes away from the overall enjoyable experience. Eastwood could have easily cut out one or two moments when the character are "writing their letters" to keep the film at a good running time. The second thing is something I would have liked to have seen added myself. I would have liked to have seen more connection between the two films. Sure in Flags we see that the Japanese in pieces all over the caves and we finally see why, but other then that and a few battle scenes that are used directly in both films there is not much else. Where was that one scene in Flags where the kid disappears from underneath the ground? That would have connected the two films better, to see one of the Japanese solders crawling up a tunnel and kidnapping a soldier. Hearing Phillippe's voice above ground crying out where the other soldier is, this would have connected the two better.Letters is an excellent film with the message that no matter what side you're on in war, it's hell. That's exactly what I got from this film, and yes even Flags. Letters out does Flags in every way possible and betters its chances for that Oscar gold. It's one of the best war films ever made. It's not a perfect film, but it is the one that Eastwood wanted to make and it is exactly what the title says, it's actually Letter From Iwo Jima.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally and physically graphic war pic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's "Letters From Iwo Jima" is an emotionally and physically graphic war pic. It is "Flags Of Our Fathers" from the Nippon point of view. Based on the found writings of the General who presided over Japan's defense of the strategically important island, it focuses on both the heroism of the soldiers and the in-fighting amongst them. The decision to concentrate much screen time on the miraculous journey of a reluctant soldier is a good one for it allows us to see the folly of so-called "heroic" combat. The battle scenes are bloody and straightforward. A sequence in which several soldiers commit suicide with grenades is the visceral stand-out and is deeply disturbing. Women only appear in a handful of flashbacks and the American forces are kept at an emotional distance (with one exception). A sweeping shot of the sea suddenly filled with American warships is haunting and powerful. All performances are exceptional and Eastwood's direction is, as usual, uncluttered and spare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is proof that war resonates the same regardless of what country, culture or rational you come from. Eastwood's film about the Japanese perspective of the battle of Iwo Jima isn't going to be your bloody, action-packed typical war film, rather it humanizes an event that so often loses value as each year passes. I've read numerous books on the war in the Pacific, including Flags of Our Father's, so I went in to this film with a basic understanding of Japan's side of the war. But, one doesn't have to be a war or history buff to fully appreciate what this film brings. If you've seen every war movie ever made or have never seen one, you'll come out with the same new appreciation for the "Greatest Generation." I saw Flags of Our Fathers when it came out, and while I consider that to be one of my favorite films of the year, I put Letters on a level above it. Eastwood did a fantastic job, the acting was superb and it was the best way possible to close out the battle that wasn't completed in Flags of Our Fathers (people need to remember that Flags focused on the flag raisers and their aftermath, once they left the island, we left the island).If this movie isn't considered for Best Film of the Year at the Oscar's, that would be an injustice, because it's rare to have a film that takes a key part of history and brings it alive 62 years later not only for the generation that lived it, but for the generations that need to understand that its importance can't be lost with loss of the veterans.See it for yourself, and you'll understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Oscar worthy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the sister movie of "Flags of our Fathers", this epic picture made with Japanese actors speaking their native tongue and we English speaking viewers quickly reading subtitles and learning every step of the way! Clint Eastwood has made a complete masterpiece about the horrors of war from both sides of the aisle and we find ourselves feeling empty about our past. Unlike the current war we're embroiled in at the present time, Eastwood shows us that both sides of the Pacific war in WWII were following orders and their own convictions and sense of patriotism during this epic battle for a smelly island so prominent for strategic purposes in the war.I've seen all of the movies nominated for this year's Oscar and Letters is by far the most impressive. The main characters on the Japanese side were visitors to America at on time in their lives and they had friends that were Americans. They didn't hate us, they were just simply patriots and were doing their duty. Not unlike us in that sense. I've always enjoyed Mr. Eastwood's movies, but this is the first time I've been so moved by his effort.He wrote the haunting musical score that helps tell the story and the empty sadness that accompanies these soldiers as they find out that they are essentially doomed in their struggle and are just sacrificed for their empire.Impressive story and moving... it will be with me for a long time!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's Powerfully Evocative Look at Men Facing Insurmountable Odds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is quite amazing how a director as classically American as Clint Eastwood can make such an emotionally audacious film about the Japanese defense of Iwo Jima during the last year of WWII and manage to do it purely from the Japanese perspective. The idea of showing the adversarial side of the war is not new (1970's "Tora! Tora! Tora!" comes to mind), but what makes Eastwood's historical epic unique is the intense infusion of humanism that courses through the story and the lack of personal judgment on the suicidal Japanese military strategy at the time. There are neither heroes nor villains on either side. The result is an empathic study of a group of men caught in an inevitably fatalistic situation. Leading the effort is Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, an honorable, aristocratic man who has a biding respect for Americans based on his travels there during the late 1920's. With neither air nor naval support forthcoming, Kuribayashi concludes that his troops will need to fight to the death.The central figure among the soldiers is an obstreperous young private named Saigo, who has left a wife and infant daughter back home. Along with the rest of his troop, he spends weeks excavating tunnels and trenches on the higher grounds of the island. The scope of the incoming U.S. fleet exceeds their worst fears, and the rest of the film focuses on how they face the depletion of ammunitions and rations while realizing defeat and death are at hand. We see brief flashbacks of defining moments in their lives back home, just enough to give their reasons for being there but not to the point where we get fully realized characters. I believe this was an intentional move by the filmmakers to focus on the more immediate emotional responses to sacrificing themselves for a greater good, which came down to buying more time for the empire to win the overall war.Similar to "Saving Private Ryan", the film is dramatically shot by Tom Stern in desaturated, monochromatic tones that give it a black-and-white, documentary-like feel with the bomb explosions primarily in vivid color. The cast is headed by the only recognizable actor to American audiences, the charismatic Ken Watanabe, who effectively plays Kuribayashi with economic authority. As Saigo, J-Pop star Kazunari Ninomiya really holds the film together through his character's serendipitous circumstances, while effective turns are provided by Tsuyoshi Ihara as the erudite Baron Nishi (the former Olympic equestrian champion); Shido Nakamura as the belligerent and increasingly desperate Lt. Ito; Ryo Kase as the stoically vulnerable Shimizu; and Yuki Matsuzaki as Saigo's smiling comrade Nozaki.Japanese American writer Iris Yamashita penned the forceful screenplay based on a story by her and Paul Haggis based on a book of the picture letters Kuribayashi sent to his family and depicted in the film. While the technical aspects of this historical reenactment are superlative, not to mention the linguistic barriers between the Japanese cast and American crew that must have been daunting, this masterful work really shows how the autumnal Eastwood knows like no other how to convey the gravitas of impending death without sacrificing the propulsive drama and human heart at the core of the story. Be forewarned that some scenes are invariably graphic and that a few of the subtitles have been obscured by the white background.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Letters From Iwo Jima" ? First Class Mail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was just about perfect. It easily conquered in all aspects that film is critiqued on and I recommend it for everybody. What a shame it was that it didn't get released into a theater near me until way over a month after its initial release. I'd also like to address the commotion about the historical inaccuracy of how the Japanese are portrayed, because it doesn't seem as if they really were. Granted they were extremely ruthless and hostile, especially towards POWs, but that is implied. Americans really have to realize that some of us can act just as inappropriately brutal at times. We're not perfect either. The main represented point is that not every single Japanese soldier felt the same way about this conflict. There's always the good and bad on both sides?even though the comparative ratio can be heavily leaned towards one side. Unfortunately, it appears that the good more often than not hold a position farther down the line and their opinions don't count for nearly as much. Or when a good leader is in charge in times of war, apparently the bad veer off and do what they want to anyway.Accusations of Clint being unpatriotic for making this film are outrageous as another message was that both sides see the enemy as the monsters, when in fact despite minor differences, we're all basically the same. This is because we're all human. Due to cultural variation, we have different ideals that we're taught but deep down everyone has very similar needs and wants no matter what part of the globe they're from.The final issue that was great to display was how fighting rationally was much more effective than following guidelines due to a nation's code of honor system as it would really inhibit their soldiers. Whether the restrictive conventions were put in place due to religion or just by laws, the opposing force could walk all over them. In this case the Japanese were limited by rules their emperor set forth and only a few of them were able to realize how dumb the sacrificial rite was as doing so screwed over their comrades who were vastly outnumbered on other parts of the island in need of support.All aesthetic aspects can be shortly summed up: the acting was flawless and no one put in an unbelievable performance, the cinematography was beautiful and tense which was very fitting, and the script was incredible but at the same time being very tear-inducing. The screenplay is extremely dialogue based and is in subtitles, plus the action sequences are limited so to those that hate history movies or ones not in English then it's safe to say you won't like it at all. The runtime is long and the pacing slow when compared to regular American cinema but it goes by really fast and upon viewing it makes you feel as if you're right there alongside these men.Clint Eastwood is such a masterful director and it'll be interesting to see where this ranks come Oscar time. Personally I think it stands a tremendous chance of winning, however since he's won before so recently that might be held against him. What really made me think is the striking similarities of this battle to what's going on now in our whole mentality. It's as if we're fighting the same enemy just with different faces this time around. This definitely brought truth to that old saying, "history repeats itself, if we don't learn from it." Apparently we're not learning from it. The average Joe gets stuck fighting a war that is not his nor does he understand for reasons he'll never get to enjoy. All the more reason to realize how wrong and pointless the declaration of war certainly is in the first place?and in the end, the sad truth is that no one really wins.</fullReview>

I never really enjoyed "Saving Private Ryan" or anything else along that line, but "Letters From Iwo Jima" is just too marvelous.

I hope this movie does well at the Oscars because I'd love to see this movie appreciated like it truly should be (although it seems like "Letters From Iwo Jima" is the underdog). I highly recommend this film to all "history-buffs" and anyone who's just interested in wars and Japanese history.

		<shortDescription>The Devil wears Red, White and Blue.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kurosawa could not have done it better.Promethean director Clint Eastwood's *Letters from Iwo Jima*, followup to his daring *Flags of Our Fathers*, is culturally, philosophically and artistically one of the great Japanese films.Made In America.Unlike *Flags*, this Iwo Jima tale has nothing to do with Joe Rosenthal's photograph, instead told from the perspective of Japanese troops who bled to keep the White Devil from their children's shores.Entirely in Japanese (with English subtitles), *Letters* finds the heart of its three main characters through the written medium: Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) ? a young baker, conscripted during his wife's pregnancy, writes to her of his trench tribulations, while trying to make good on his promise to stay alive and return home to his new daughter; General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) ? assigned to pull Iwo Jima from the jaws of defeat, writes to his wife of his American travels before the war, his fears in facing that superior enemy, and laments that he found no time to fix the kitchen floor; Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) - Kuribayashi's fellow officer and friend, a 1932 Los Angeles Olympian equestrian who once entertained Douglas Fairbanks, rescues a U.S. soldier from the battlefield, chats with him in halting English and reads a letter from the soldier's mother ("do what is right because you know it is right"), planting an ache in the hearts of his squad indoctrinated to believe in spiritually-bankrupt enemies.Congruent with real-world Iraq media now focusing on the soldiers instead of the battles, *Letters* focuses on individual warriors, which leaves an impact more intense than any bone-rattling explosion. Like *Flags*, it takes us intimately into humanity where propaganda fears to tread.Never has an American war movie been so frank in depicting American troops as invasive, illegal aliens, as faceless an Enemy as the Germans, Russians, Vietnamese and the Japanese themselves have been so cursorily portrayed in countless other war movies. Conversely, the Japanese are not the efficient killing automatons they are always portrayed as; rather, humanized as only Americans were allowed to be humanized for decades (try and get that past John Wayne or Richard Widmark in the 1950s), possessing all the charisma, fears, insecurities, heroism and insubordination of any given American son.When U.S troops appear, speaking that lowbrow tongue we call English, our Pavlovian response goes awry: conditioned to accept English as the tongue of liberators, at first we feel a sense of security, then are jolted with the ugly realization that these "liberators" are out to kill our Japanese pals.Battle scenes, leached and stark as the color of unnecessary death and butchery, are like nothing you will ever see outside of a real war: shells launched in fiery clusters from battleships, the searing ricocheting of individual bullets, flames engulfing machine-gunners' nests, bombs silently dropping and wreaking their destruction; the thump of each artillery round and every shrapnel shard resounding in your chest? Despite Truffaut's famous anti-war dictum - that any movie portraying war only glamorizes it - the livid suffering of the Japanese troops trapped in the senseless politics of the Iwo Jima fracas makes each American soldier (in the movie and in real life) look like a heel just for being enlisted. And just as *Tora! Tora! Tora!* (1970) attempted objectivity in showing us both sides of Pearl Harbor, Clint Eastwood succeeds in illuminating both sides of Iwo Jima in creating two of the greatest anti-war movies ever made, *Flags* and *Letters* ranking alongside *Paths of Glory*, *All Quiet On the Western Front*, or *Gallipoli* - a towering diptych that should stand, like *The Lord of The Rings*, as one grand movie split into manageable segments.Creating anti-war media these days is as faddish as vagina-hugging jeans and butt tattoos, so it comes as sweet irony that (as Kenneth Turan, *Los Angeles Times*, notes) "Individually and as a unit, these films are a cry against the awful, horrifying futility of war, a cry made all the more poignant because it is made by a man who has been an avatar of on-screen mayhem." Explicit in *Flags* is, "Heroes are something WE create," while *Letters* gives us implicitly, "Enemies are something we create." Kuribayashi laments, "If our children can live safely for one more day, it will be worth another day on this island." The same sentiments, the same freedoms, the same blood and bones.In a culture where suicide is NOT looked upon as a coward's way out, but rather the only honorable alternative to defeat, Saigo - the younger generation - sees its folly: "There is no use for a dead soldier." And Kuribayashi, having assimilated Western ways, also realizes that *seppuku* would serve no honorable purpose if his men were going to fight to the death anyway.Not even surrender was a solution during the disorder of combat, as Eastwood does not sidestep the cruelty exhibited by U.S. good ole boys, who remorselessly execute two unarmed, surrendered Japanese prisoners at point blank range.The low-ranked Saigo finds himself inadvertently crossing paths with General Kuribayashi throughout the story, the General first saving Saigo from having to dig unnecessary trenches, his eccentric new strategy calling for excavating subterranean networks to ambush the American beach landing forces. Kuribayashi then saves Saigo's life from a traditionalist commander trying to execute him for desertion. At film's end, Saigo digs to preserve history, burying letters from Kuribayashi - then burying Kuribayashi himself in a final act of selflessness.Surviving until the fall of the sulfur-sanded island, Saigo is commended by Kuribayashi, "You are quite a soldier." Saigo replies, "No, just a simple baker." The final shots recall the film's original working title (*Red Sun, Black Sand*): from an American stretcher, Saigo watches the red sun set over what was once Japan; a final shot of Suribachi from the black sand of Iwo Jima.From his grave, Kurosawa can't stop smiling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. This is director Clint Eastwood's own Japanese counterpoint to his American version, "Flags of our Fathers". While "Flags" was a technical marvel, "Letters" ironically is much more humanistic in its story telling. We really get to know the men under the helmets who were continually told they were going to die for their country.The even more interesting aspect of this one is the confusion and conflict within the Japanese ranks both in preparation for and during the actual battle over this desolate, yet vital, island of rock. The leaders knew they were doomed without support and never really concealed the fact from the troops. Watching the debate of "suicide mission" vs. continued fighting was very difficult to watch.Ken Watanabe is terrific as General Kuribayashi, who's letters were the inspiration for the film. Two other key roles were Kazunari Ninomiya as the energetic, reluctant soldier Saigo; and the very charismatic Tsuyoshi Ihara as Nishi, a Japanese hero and real leader of men.As with "Flags", the war scenes are among the best ever filmed. The tight scenes inside the caves, really give us the feeling of what life must have been like for the Japanese soldiers as they fought towards their pending demise.Eastwood continues to prove what a fine filmmaker he is and although his next project has not yet been announced, I look forward to the addition to his legacy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just seen the Letters from Iwo Jima directed by Clint Eastwood. All I have to say is to give credit to Clint Eastwood and the honesty that he treated this movie with. He will be known was one of the most honest and finest directors and one of the finest actors.The movie breaks down the barrier of the "evil", "unhuman", "robot" "Japanese" propaganda/perspective and let you see the real human sides of these soldiers and their leaders. They might've killed American soldiers and bombed Pearl Harbor, this movie will take you home whether you are in one side or the other and makes you sympathize with these soldiers in one way or another. This movie is similar to "Saving Private Ryan" in terms of substance, simplicity and practicality of the soldiers. This movie doesn't try to say who is good and who is bad, but gives it like it is and the result is one of the finest and most honest.Highly recommended if you want to know and understand the once widely considered "enemy," "evil" and "unhuman" Japanese. Highly recommended and above all we are all humans trying to get through the day is what I think Clint wanted to send across. The pain, anxiety, hope, war are all presented with simplicity, substance and practicality.Kudos to Clint Eastwood for his honesty and for his bravery to make one of the most affecting (near to shocking) and honest war movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make no mistake: This movie stars Japanese actors and it's spoken in Japanese, but it's still an American movie. A Clint Eastwood movie. You can see that in the pace, the way the characters are laid out and the story itself. Unlike war movies made by Americans, with American's point of view, there's an emotional detachment palpable in this movie. It's hard to understand, and I know soldier's both sides have similar values. It's just the values of the soldiers on this movie seemed to me... American. The straightforward thinking, the subtle cockiness, the lack of comfort with silence of these soldiers is something I've never seen in any Japanese film. Again, the pace it's pure Eastwood. The brutality we're used to see in war films since -this film's producer -Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan" is absent. It's less action, more character. Very Eastwood. But in the end, this is how I imagine a war movie, where the Americans are directed by a foreigner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without too much blah, blah- the movie is just another war movie (well it is obvious that the movie is done well, Eastwood is from Hollywood so he can throw away a lot of money)that doesn't say anything new, even almost missing all the new tactics the Japanese used there, almost without explaining the influence of the battle and its importance. Its just trying to be a good movie by showing that not all the Japanese soldiers were animals, and it's already known, many movies been done about that... Hello Eastwood, where have you been the last decades? Unfortunately that the only thing they teach in Hollywood- throw some money in the film so it will look good,put some "bad" guys but also show their point of view so some dumb housewives and teenagers will be "touched", and this spouse to be an "amazing", "astonishing"... My advise- next time spend less money and use more of that brain cells you spouse to have!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pseudo-liberal Revisionist Whitewashing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 'Letters from Iwo Jima', Clint Eastwood, and writers Paul Haggis and Iris Yamashita, becomes a kind of Japanese Leni Riefenstahl ? turning a blind eye to the horrors perpetrated by the Japanese Imperial regime to focus on the humanity and stoic pride of the individual soldiers.Several thousand Japanese were tried, convicted, and executed for war crimes following WW2. The Japanese army was responsible for the targeted killing of millions of civilians throughout South East Asia, appalling medical and surgical experimentation on prisoners, the use of chemical and biological weapons, the widespread use of torture and forced labor, institutionalized rape, and sex slavery. The Japanese perpetrated acts that equaled those of Nazi Germany in their cruelty and wanton disregard for international standards. Of course there were Japanese soldiers who were scared, just as there were those who acted courageously, but it should never be forgotten, when viewing these sympathetic characters, that in realty, they casually supported horrifying and truly outrageous abuses of basic human rights in the service of the Emperor. Yes, at Iwo Jima they were defending Japanese soil, but only after having invaded Korea, Taiwan, China, Singapore, and Indochina while launching unprovoked attacks on both Australia and the United States.'Letters from Iwo Jima' is a very well made movie. Its looks beautiful, being crafted with precision and real artistry, and the performances are universally excellent. But there is something decidedly unsettling about writers who, through ignorance or naivety, turn a blind eye to the atrocities carried out by the Japanese army and try to paint the Japanese military as the moral and ethical equals of the Americans. It's a dangerously inaccurate comparison. Despite the subsequent use of the atom bomb on Japan, and the resulting death toll, the United States military in WW2 never made it official policy to rape, torture and execute millions of innocent civilians.It's little wonder that the film has been so popular in Japan, who has long struggled to truly acknowledge their acts during the war, and in Eastwood and co, have found the one-time-enemy white-washing their culpability far more effectively, and to a far larger audience, than they themselves ever could. 'Letters from Iwo Jima' is an excellent movie, but the writers' pseudo-liberal revisionism makes the whole thing more than a little unpalatable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War films don't get much better than this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is more like it! The second of the two Clint Eastwood-directed films focusing on the battle for Iwo Jima, this is the one from the Japanese viewpoint and it's a bloody good bit of film-making. It also happens to be the darkest film I've ever watched, and that's a list that includes plenty of horror and serial killer movies. Set entirely on the island of Iwo Jima and focusing on the Japanese forces as they prepare for and then eventually fight the Americans, this is a lengthy bit of film-making that's simply spellbinding for every second it plays out. Eastwood strives for realism and achieves it; there are no gung-ho heroics on offer here, no flights of fancy or exciting battles for survival. Instead, the world of LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is dark, depressing and brutal, where friends die on a routine basis and hope gradually fades as time goes on.The cast is what really makes this film work. In a film focusing so much on characterisation, going so far as to give back stories in flashback to the principle folk involved, the quality of the acting is key and the actors don't disappoint. Ken Watanabe, recalling us of his former glory in THE LAST SAMURAI, presides over things with a subtle and nuanced turn as the unorthodox general; he's fantastic, as are all the rest. I especially loved the young men who prepare for war; we learn that these men are as brave and na?ve as the Americans fighting on the other side in FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS. Real emoting is involved and in the end you root for all these characters, which makes what happens so much more powerful.The cinematography is frequently breathtaking and the washed-out look of the film fits the action perfectly. This is an epic in which the quite, intimate moments of dialogue are just as strong as the effects-heavy battle scenes, and everything feels fresh and so alive. There are many moments of brilliance here, including the notorious grenade suicide scene (one of the most disturbing ever put on film), the final, hopeless charge, the fate of the deserter, and the gradual breakdown of communication and leadership within the labyrinthine tunnels of the island. Film-making at its best, and a movie that easily beats SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as one of the great WWII films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>well made war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1944 Iwo Jima. Private Saigo was a baker who left behind his pregnant wife. General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) arrives to take charge of the island's defense. He's familiar with the west and abandons the trenches on the beach. Lieutenant Colonel Nishi was a gold medal show jumper in the 1932 L.A. Olympics. He informs Kuribayashi of the massive losses at the Marianas. There is no hope of reinforcements and the coming battle is unwinnable.This is a Hollywood movie with the uniforms switched. The Americans are mostly nameless, faceless soldiers. This movie stays with the Japanese throughout. It's a little slow at the beginning as the characters are introduced. It tries to tie up the beginning and ending with the discovery of letters. It's not that compelling. It would much more compelling to present the letters to a surviving family member. The opening could also be the battle in the Marianas which could add some action. It's over forty minutes before the war action begins. The characters are well drawn and the acting is first rate. There are certain strictly delineated morality in the characters that are very much traditional Hollywood. This is a compelling war movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The other side of history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film recreates the Battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of Japanese soldiers who fought there. Directed by Clint Eastwood, the film has screenplay by Iris Yamashita and the participation of Ken Watanabe, Tsuyoshi Ihara and Kazunari Ninomiya.This film follows another, "Flags of our Fathers", and isn't just another war film focused on World War II. This film shows the crudeness of war, especially in its psychological and human aspect. It seeks to show that, in war, there are no winners or losers because everyone loses, there are no good guys or bad guys, but survivors. Japan, during this historical period, had a mentality focused on patriotism, honor and worship to victory. For them, losing was less dishonorable than escape, in a militaristic code very similar to what was adopted by the Spartans before. Another point raised by the film, although in a more subtle way, is the wartime advertising: for the Japanese, the enemy was always demonized for instigating soldiers to fight to the end, following the precepts of their militarist philosophy and honor code.The actors were up to the challenge, particularly Ken Watanabe, whose character, General Kuribayashi, represents the contradictions of war: after studying and living in the United States before the war, he was now fighting the Americans and taking advantage of his knowledge of their military tactics to anticipate their movements. The use of Japanese language in the film really helped to make it more genuine and also sounds nice. The photograph, heavy and gray, fits well in a film like this and there are certain scenes when it contributes greatly to its beauty. The costumes and weapons are historically accurate and the special, visual and sound effects have enormous quality. The sound is really good and gives great impact to combat scenes. The soundtrack, written by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens, is very interesting, especially the main theme, with a slightly oriental sounding, like a melancholic wail.I usually don't like a lot of Clint Eastwood movies, but I must say I was impressed with this. It deserves to be seen by all who like a good war movie, action or a movie linked to historical events. If it's true that all those who don't remember History are doomed to repeat it, this movie might help that this never happens again.</fullReview>

It's also a companion of Flags of Our Fathers also directed by Clint Eastwood as well.It was great as a foreign film as well as a war epic and Ken Watanabe was amazing in this. They basically knew they were going down but not without a fight. I hope I'm not spoiling it because that's history. They also talk about almost all of the soldiers stories. This move even got a gold globe for best picture foreign language and it shows.Haven't really watched Flags of our Fathers yet but I will when I can.

		<fullReview>Probably one of the best movies i have ever seen. This goes far beyond the genre of war-movies. I think it is important that the story of "the other side" is told, in the end, every soldier is someone's son, brother, loved one.. They all grew up with dreams and ambitions of their own, only to have their life cut short because of the war. This movie is not simply a story to entertain us, but hopefully also reminds us the true horrors of war and the futility in killing each- other.Seeing as Clint Eastwood was involved it does not really surprise me that this movie is among the best ever made. Would highly recommend, this probably comes pretty close to what played through the minds of soldiers in wartime, and hopefully a reminder that it is not all heroic tales of good guys vs bad guys.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>4 out of 4 stars.Clint Eastwood is a great filmmaker and his 2006 film "Letters From Iwo Jima" is, I think, one of his best films. It's a complex look at war with themes of honor, leadership, family, and patriotism. This film was paired with Eastwood's 2006 film "Flags of Our Fathers," which looks at the Battle of Iwo Jima from the American side."Letters From Iwo Jima" is a character drama that looks at the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese perspective. There are many characters in the film, but the two prominent characters are General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (played by the great Ken Watanabe) and Saigo (played by Kazunari Ninomiya). Through these characters, we see a clear eyed vision of the terrifying and hopeless battle of Iwo Jima. Eastwood shows us the gritty details of the battle and the horror that soldiers on both sides had to endure. The film can feel like a horror film instead of a war film at times. The first hour of the film focuses more on the preparation for the battle and establishes all the characters. Kuribayashi was a progressive general who was not respected by all of his comrades, because he wanted to keep soldiers alive longer instead of giving them quick and honorable deaths. Life and protecting his country are so important to Kuribayashi that he asks his soldiers to take the hard road. The old way of honor would have soldiers commit suicide in the face of defeat or banzai charge in order to have an honorable death. Kuribayashi has a different perspective on honor and thinks it is more honorable to die by fighting to the last man in order to buy Japan time in the war. Kuribayashi is a true leader and is willing suffer along with his men, like Saigo. The former baker Saigo is not a patriotic soldier and wishes to be back with his family, just like many other soldiers, including Kuribayashi and other American soldiers. We see this in the letters the soldiers write and receive, which serve as windows into the soldiers' souls. In war, it's easy to lose sight of who your enemy really is. Sometimes, it's tough to even know the person you're fighting next to. War can blind us to our enemies and to each other. It's important that we realize this, especially in a post-9/11 world. I think "Letters From Iwo Jima" is one of the best and most important war films. It forces us to look at both sides of a war and how battles are made up of simple men who all wish to go home. This film shows us the humanity of war. If you want to learn more about the Japanese side of the Battle of Iwo Jima, I would recommend Kumiko Kakehashi's book "So Sad to Fall in Battle."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever Happened to Iwo Jima? Stays in Iwo Jima.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima is not a sequel to Flags of Our Fathers. It serves more like a companion film. Clint Eastwood has carefully capture a breath-taking story as we watch from any other Japanese soldier's perspective towards the American invasion on Iwo Jima.They are very much alike. The difference is they serving for a different leader. Their task is to accomplish the campaign. The Japanese Imperial soldiers managed to defend Iwo Jima for 36 days after surrendering and signing a treaty with their counter-part.--In 2005, Japanese archaeologists team arrives in Iwo Jima. During their excavation, they found something buried under the grounds.It was 1944. Iwo Jima is greatly outnumbered despite requesting for more reinforcements from Tokyo's headquarters. Private First Class Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) curses the soil that the American can have this because of the humid weather and the trouble of digging through the trenches. He was heard and caught by Captain Tanida (Takumi Bando), who defines him unpatriotic.General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) arrives at Iwo Jima and the beatings of Tanida towards Saigo was halted when he took full command of the garrison. He orders Captain Tanida to stop the men from further digging.Being the new general in command, Kuribayashi scouts around the perimeter of Iwo Jima and Mount Suribachi as he measures and predicting attacks from the Americans. He then orders his subordinates to move heavy artilleries and mortars at Mount Suribachi; stating that high ground would be an advantage for the soldiers when the American arrives.Every Japanese men on the island are trained to shoot to kill. But Saigo failed to do so and Tanida finds fault in him and intends to kill him, only to be saved by Kuribayashi for the second time.Lieutenant Colonel Nishi Takeichi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) just landed in Iwo Jima. He is greeted with applause for he is a national hero because he earns a gold medal during 1932&#x2032;s Olympic show jumper.Soon, some soldiers falls ill due to dysentery problems caused by lack of food nutrition and unhealthy sanitation. One of Saigo's friend, Private First Class Kashiwara (Takashi Yamaguchi) falls sick and passes away a couple of days later.A new batch of soldiers also arrived in Iwo Jima stationing at Mount Suribachi. Private First Class Nozaki (Yuki Matsuzaki) finds the new soldier Superior Private Shimizu (Ry&#x14d; Kase) is a "kempetai" to keep his eye on Saigo's written letters which he has been criticising about Iwo Jima and his superiors to his wife. But Saigo could not care less about it.In 1945, the Americans arrives with a sneak attack from air as they bombed Iwo Jima from above just like how the Japanese ambushed Pearl Harbor in 1941. Iwo Jima is at war.A war outnumbered by the thousands of military fleet and ground infantries. An inevitable and impossible victory without any reinforcement from military aircraft support. Mount Suribachi suffers heavy casualties resulting several military division to use the "Banzai Charge", believing suicide as an honorable way to die to serve the Emperor of Japan.Saigo ran away from his regiment but was stopped by Shimizu for disrespecting his regiment who just commit suicide. Saigo dares him to kill himself of which he can not. Saigo decides to join forces with the regiment at the north.They reach the Air Force Lieutenant Oiso who finds them disrespectful as he grabs his katana and ready to slash Saigo. Kuribayashi saves Saigo again for the third time.Lieutenant Ito (Shido Nakamura) could stay hiding all along and decides to send his troops to a full frontal assault but Nishi ask his men to stand down because Kuribayashi's orders are not to risk the lives of men blindly. His men joins Nishi but he carries 3 land mines as he hope for American tanks to crawl over him.The next morning, Nishi wounded an American marine named Sam (Luke Eberl) but treated him with morphine to save him and have some little chats as they converse in English.The following day, a mortar shell blew up and Nishi's eye were permanently blind. His last order were to have his men fight alongside Kuribayashi till the end. He shot himself.Kuribayashi launches a final frontline attack. But mos the men are killed in action. With him and Lieutenant Fujita (Hiroshi Watanabe), his last orders to Fujita is to behead him. But the American shot Fujita.Saigo arrives in time after burning some military paperworks and strategies and burying some important stuffs underground to meet Kuribayashi, who is badly wounded. Before Kuribayashi shot himself, he ask Saigo for a favor to have him buried somewhere where his corpse can never be found.The American marines found Saigo and he was saved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Second &amp; Final Chapter of Clint Eastwood's Iwo Jima Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The companion piece to Flags of Our Fathers, Letters From Iwo Jima is the second &amp; final chapter of Clint Eastwood's Iwo Jima saga that's filmed almost entirely in Japanese, defies the stereotypical portrait of the Japanese in Hollywood features, and presents welcome improvements in various filmmaking aspects to succeed as the better film of the two.Set at Iwo Jima in 1944, the story of Letters From Iwo Jima covers the Battle of Iwo Jima between the United States &amp; Imperial Japan during the Second World War. While the first part of the saga presented the war from an American perspective, this chapter depicts the same battle from the Japanese viewpoint and follows the Japanese soldiers who were involved in it.Directed by Clint Eastwood, both films were shot back-to-back yet Letters From Iwo Jima feels like a better film for the story is more focused &amp; devoted to its content. But the best thing about Eastwood's direction is his handling of the subject matter for the veteran director treats the Japanese viewpoint with the same respect as its American counterpart and defies the conventional good vs evil approach.The technical aspects of this feature provide the same feel n tone of its predecessor and is brilliantly executed from start to finish. Set pieces &amp; locations have an authentic touch to it. Cinematography once again employs the monochromatic hue and the images are as sharp &amp; detailed as before. Editing is better than the last time yet there are static moments within this picture, and background score also compliments the narrative quite nicely.As far as performances go, Letters From Iwo Jima is Ken Watanabe's show all the way for the actor commands the screen with finesse, delivers his lines with precise control &amp; easily impresses with a moving performance. Plus, he's nicely aided by the supporting cast. The sequences of war are once again brutal, violent &amp; unflinching and happen to be the film's best moments. But just like the previous chapter, this one kind of overstays its welcome.On an overall scale, Letters From Iwo Jima is a solidly crafted drama that finishes the Iwo Jima saga on a satisfactory note and is laudable for its absence of stereotype as well as the balanced view of war it provides from both sides. Brimming with patriotism, this tale of strength, honour, courage &amp; brutal horrors of war further extends the artistic range of Eastwood's craftsmanship, is a definite improvement over the last film and is certainly worth a shot.P.S. While both Flags of Our Fathers &amp; Letters From Iwo Jima work very well as standalone films, it's recommended that you watch them back-to-back as a double feature for the experience is much more fulfilling that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood excels in all limits with this film. Proof that he can also do SPECTACULAR war movies. "Flag of our fathers" and "Letters from Iwo Jima" are both Clint Eastwood movies, tell the same battle of WWII, but with different views. I watched "Letters" first because always interested me see the vision of the Japanese, and thought it was well done, it was more than well done, almost perfect! The film simply arrested me for two hours and a half, and shouldn't be one minute shorter. The screenplay is fantastic, even this story very well told, and when I say the vision is that we can even put ourselves in the place of the Japanese soldiers in the film. And the whole movie is in Japanese, only the Americans speak English. The entire cast is phenomenal, everyone does their job perfectly, Ken Watanabe as always perfect! The story is very well told, the battle scenes are spectacular and "real", I simply prefer "Letters from Iwo Jima" over "Flags of our fathers", mainly because it was very confusing, an hour was in the battle, the other was with the 3 survivors the battle, another was the son of one of those survivors to tell the story from the interviews he get from the soldiers. The movie is not bad at all attention, I just think Letters is much more structured and more exciting. One of the best war movies ever made, and one of the best films of Clint Eatswood too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iris Hitomi Yamashita, who wrote story and script for this production, is certainly to be honored and not overlooked as we remember this great movie. This approach, an American movie from the point of view of the enemy, is not quite new. Erich Maria Remarque's semi-autobiographical novel drawn from his time as a German soldier in WWI (Im Westen nichts Neues), All Quiet at the Western Front, (1929) comes to mind. The American movie, directed by Lewis Milestone, released in 1930. It, too, was powerful and so much so that it changed the life direction of its star, Lew Ayres. What is new, however, the story and script are by an American (Yamashita was born in Missouri). Her two degrees are from American Universities in California. The Japanese language approach, in my opinion, now in the contemporary Hollywood milieu, would not have taken place without Mel Gibson's amazing The Passion of the Christ, (2004) which while written in Latin and Aramaic, two languages long dead, grossed in excess of $600 million. To Hollywood suits, that is serious business. Thus, many us of eagerly awaited an American film in contemporary Japanese language without any hesitation. Like many, I am a long time Clint Eastwood fan and watched his continuous growth on screen from the gritty little Rawhide TV show to the Spaghetti Westerns, and on to the Dirty Harry series. His first movie as a director, Play Misty for Me, which he made while still under the wing of Don Siegel, is actually one of my favorite Eastwood movies. However, Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) stands as his masterpiece. Chances are, even if Eastwood was half the age he is today, he would never again find the happy conjunction to create anything quite as powerful, memorable and spiritually triumphant. For me, this is one of the best Hollywood movies produced in the past half century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's film, "The Faith of Our Fathers," was about the Americans who raised the flag of Iwo Jima and their lives afterwords. In this film, Eastwood concentrates on the other side of the war through the Japanese experience. It's a great war film even though it's subtitled. The cast and crew are terrific. I am very impressed with Eastwood's attempt in displaying how the Japanese military forces handled their side of the Iwo Jima Battle. Eastwood is not afraid to show inhumanity and humanity on both sides of the fence. In a sad way, the film states that the men in war weren't much different than their enemies. Iwo Jima is not forgotten and there are scenes where your heart breaks a little knowing the possible outcome of the soldiers' lives if they surrender or keep fighting. The cast and crew did a terrific job in recreating the time period in Iwo Jima and the actors did a terrific job in playing the Japanese soldiers.</fullReview>

The fact that the entire film is spoken in Japansese with English subtitles is odd...but it draws you further into the plot, making it that much more believable. I don't know if the book upon which this movies is based was based on true events, but if not it is one the best war novels ever filmed. Clint Eastwood did a fantastic job directing this film, and the location filming on Iwo Jima, though short, made me remember that both sides paid tremendous tolls for that little island.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of "Letters From Iwo Jima"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's 2006 film "Letter From Iwo Jima" is a companion piece to his earlier film "Flags Of Our Fathers". It centers around the exact same events in "Flags", but the perspective is switched towards the Japanese army this time. One of the questions I had going into "Letters" was - is it better than "Flags". In short, yes. I found "Letters From Iwo Jima" to be an unbelievable piece of film that, I feel, every American should get a chance to watch. One of the greatest aspects of the film itself is the film's screenplay, which is written almost entirely in Japanese. When I initially found this movie to be almost entirely in a different language, I worried that this quality would impair my ability to sympathize with its characters. I was wrong. I found this film's characters perfectly written and easy to sympathize and care for. The acting also helps with character development in this film. Ken Watanabe plays General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, probably the greatest character in the film. Watanabe's portrayal of the General is so well-crafted that you just can't help but have an immense amount of compassion for him. In a visual sense, "Letters" utilizes the same sort of bleak and grainy style that was present in "Flags", and this (once again) really helps add to the underlying realistic and grim tone. Eastwood's expert directorial work also shines throughout this film. Overall, I found "Letters From Iwo Jima" to be an incredibly well-made and poignant war drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Happened At Iwo Jima According To The Japanese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were two films made by Clint Eastwood about the battle in Iwo Jima. One is Flag Of Our Fathers, the battle in Iwo Jima from the perspective of the American soldiers and this one, The Letters From Iwo Jima, the battle in the said place from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers. The island of Iwo Jima stands between the American military force and the home islands of Japan. Therefore the Imperial Japanese Army is desperate to prevent it from falling into American hands and providing a launching point for an invasion of Japan. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi is given command of the forces on the island and sets out to prepare for the imminent attack. General Kuribayashi, however, does not favor the rigid traditional approach recommended by his subordinates, and resentment and resistance fester among his staff. In the lower echelons, a young soldier, Saigo, a poor baker in civilian life, strives with his friends to survive the harsh regime of the Japanese army itself, all the while knowing that a fierce battle looms. When the American invasion begins, both Kuribayashi and Saigo find strength, honor, courage, and horrors beyond imagination.This film is a great war movie. Eastwood did a great job on depicting what the Japanese soldiers went through while defending the attack in their country against the American soldiers. The acting was exceptional as well. Ken Watanabe was great as the Japanese general and leader of the troops. It was clearly a classic epic about World War II particularly about Iwo Jima. Highly recommended!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Clint Eastwood's best films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima is one of director Clint Eastwood's best films. Eastwood directed Flags of our fathers, which focused on the Americans during WWII, and Letters from Iwo Jima focuses on the Japanese, our enemies. And to be honest, I found Letters from Iwo Jima to be far more intriguing.So, I already gave you the basic premise of it. The film is told through the eyes of the other side. But what I found endearing was that the film made us look like the bad guys. It also shows how some of the Japanese didn't want to fight and have their regrets.I loved Letters from Iwo Jima. It's a unique, powerful, and heart wrenching masterpiece that should go down among the many great war movies. Actually, its my favorite war movie, I even loved it more than Apocalypse now.Letters from Iwo Jima is a gritty movie, and also a well acted one too. Especially from the film's lead and probably only big star, Ken Watanabe. You sympathize for these characters, and I think that that is the best thing about this great movie.A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A War Film Unlike Any Other</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the battle of Iwo Jima between the United States and Imperial Japan during World War II, as told from the perspective of the Japanese who fought it.I am not sure what is more amazing about this film -- either that Clint Eastwood directed it (without knowing Japanese) or that it is an American film showing an American battle from the point of view of the enemy.And not just from that point of view, but sympathetic to it. These are soldiers who do not want to fight, some who want to defend their homeland. They are not seen as evil in any way, but just human. And I think that is the best way to present them -- few armies are as terrible as their adversaries make them out to be. (The Nazis are an obvious exception, but even there I suspect some of the German people were reluctant to fight for Hitler.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>10 stars all the way!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe because I am half Japanese, and knows Japanese, and lived in Japan for 11 years is the reason I rated this movie 10 stars. But I do not know how the F**k "stand by me" has a higher rating than this movie. For me this movie is much deeper than a bunch of 12 year olds roaming around places. This movie is really accurate I would say. It shows how some Japanese were brain washed with Patriotism and Imperialism. While others like Nishi who saved an American from being tortured. It really shows how in both sides there are good and evil. And in a human being there's a good side and a bad side, it's just depends on which one you decide to be at the moment. The cons of this movie are very few but doesn't really take away the 10 stars. The archaeologist just throwing the letters on the ground like they are throwing cash at the strippers was very careless. However when the letters were falling and voices of letter being read came out, it did show me how each person is valuable. Also I didn't like how they didn't play the whole main soundtrack at the end where the drum kicks in and it sounds heroic. But overall Beautiful Movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A letter to the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Severity is a success when cinema portrays it in the form of war epics, usually in the lines of more familiar and popular perspectives. The mere lack of gentleness when blended with a lot of poignant scenes works extremely well with the audience and gives them no less than patriotic embankments in their hearts. More or less, that's what the creators aim for and in most cases they achieve their goal. Moving out of the genre of action and adventure, war movies have carved out a place for themselves in cinema categories and each carries out its message or story in every different way than the other. Love, hatred, struggle, decisiveness and inexpressible sadness are some of the themes of the many battle stories exemplified on screen. It becomes a journey for the viewer while watching the epic and brings out emotions in its truest nature and leads the mind to reminisce the story again. Letters from Iwo Jima was indeed a long journey through war, sadness, love, anger and most importantly, kindness and forgiveness. Probably, a first time in Hollywood where a war involving America is not seen through the eyes of an American which when done tends to erase the picture of humanity on the enemies' side. Director Clint Eastwood, gracefully understood the need for change and tells us the story of the island Iwo Jima and how the Japanese army defended their home island from the American marines. The complete narrative is from the Japanese point of view and tells how they fought bravely, a losing war against the massive American force. The director has taken three different standoff's to state, that of the commanding general and two privates and the letters they write to home with the very little hope left inside them. But the most striking feature in the entire picture was magnifying the human touch among both sides of the conflict. Clint Eastwood has etched out the scenes so intricately with all the subtleties required and helps us in understanding that it is only humans who fight wars and not emotionless beasts. The scene where the American soldier is treated by the Japanese even with very little medicine left is extremely intriguing similar to the case where the Japanese patrol soldier is forced to shoot an innocent dog. The screenplay and editing is fascinatingly smooth as that of a spotless green pasture. Music though comparable to the lines of Thomas Newman, is neatly composed and sails along with the sequences. One another important fact of the movie was the use of the native Japanese language displaying the creative genuineness. As the soldier in the movie understands that they are the same as that of the enemies in their feelings and emotions, it enlightens him and us too that wars are in a way fought for nothing. This is even more firmly supported with the final scene where Saigo is rescued by the marines and he looks out with a smile. Letters from Iwo Jima is indeed a letter to the world which conveys in the most definite sense a message, a message that says everyone is human and that part of gentleness cannot be erased even during critical times of warfare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Clint Eastwood made one of the most quietly devastating war films of our time. It's an account of the pivotal World War II battle, from the viewpoint of Japanese troops.This gripping, rewarding story, almost totally spoken in Japanese, is a superior companion piece to Flags Of Our Fathers (2000). It shows Japanese troops ? outnumbered, outmanoeuvred and denied reinforcements from Tokyo, fighting a rearguard action against US forces. It brilliantly depicts the waste of life common to all wars. But it strives too hard to suggest that we are all the same regardless of nationality, an argument undermined by a scene of mass suicide. The film is a forceful document of a terrible, total defeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>5 word summaryJapanese perspective on legendary battleWhether its from Flags of Our Fathers, or Sands of Iwo Jima or even from a history class, we've all seen or heard the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima, or have we? All the stories up till now had been missing the Japanese view of the battle, and to understand the battle better its an important view to know.Unlike the Americans who were fighting for an island to help with their strategies against Japan, the Japanese were fighting to protect their land and their honor. The story follows Japanese soldiers preparing Iwo Jima for the fight they would soon face. We see a young scared husband who is writing to his wife, sharing his fears. We see a General who uses his experience to change the way the Japanese officers control their men and prepare for battle. we see a ruthless Lieutenant who's will do anything to protect the honor of himself, his men and his country.It's a strange new look, Interesting but strange. I knew that the Japanese were big into honor, and dying for their country but this shows it a lot different than I would have imagined. Its also strange to see the Americans as the "bad guys", not that they were shown in an unfairly evil way as the Japanese are shown in some films, but they were definitely shown in a different light, and that's very important to understand a war. The film was great. Not my favorite Eastwood film but it was near the top for sure. I personally prefer it to Flags of Our Fathers, and would say it's my favorite war film of the 00s even over the Hurt Locker. The acting and directing were fantastic. And cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. Didn't have the greatest effects in my opinion but it didn't take away too much. If you enjoy war films and enjoy Clint Eastwood films this is a must? let me rephrase, if you enjoy films than this is a must10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best subtitle film I have ever seen. What makes it so good is the script which tells a great story of the Japanese on Iwo Jima, and some terrific acting by the cast of the film. This is the movie too see versus FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS which is not as well put together.I am not sure why these 2 films are so different. This one starts with a group of modern Japanese Archelogists on Iwo Jima sifting through the remains on the island of the caves of their defenders. Then it brilliantly flashes back into the battle of the past.The story it tells of the defenders before the US landing &amp; then of their defeat is very well told. The battle sequences are well done &amp; even though you need to read the sub titles (unless you speak Japanese), the main characters pull you into caring about them.Particularly brilliantly played is the commanding Japanese General. While he is much different than the men in his command, he seems to rise above the battle in many ways. I'd award an Oscar to the man who plays him as he is brilliant in this role.There are also several other roles that are just as well done. The casting &amp; acting in this movie are excellent.This movie is the one to see, will write review of Flags of Our fathers &amp; describe it's shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meanwhile on Iwo Jima...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima(short Letters) is that other story, not only because it tells the Japanese side of the battle of Iwo Jima in contrast to Flag of our Fathers, but also because it approaches the subject in a more personal and focused way and therefore is the better story.The story follows two characters; the commanding general Kuribayashi, played by Ken Watanabe,and the reluctant soldier Saigo, played by Kazunari Ninomiya. The focus of the story remains on those two and unlike the previous movie it doesn't get lost by jumping to and fro in time, between a score of people and between scenes that are almost unrelated. Of course there are still a few scenes that reflect memories, but these are embedded in the story and do no distract and confuse. It is for this reason alone an nice example of staying on the ball. It is interesting that the movie actually tells the story of Japanese soldiers. There are movies that tell about Russian vs German(Enemy at the Gates for instance) or Germans vs Russians(Cross of Iron for instance) but Japanese only appear as enemies as far as I know and never as heroes or protagonists in Western movies. Despite all of the above movie feels unbalanced. For instance the character played by Watanabe is somewhat too good to be true. He is the one shining knight amidst the Bushido crazed homicidal and suicidal Japanese. The other protagonist Saigo, the only other one who isn't crazy, gets saved a few times by the honorable general from officers and fellow soldiers who have his death on their minds as this seems to be the standard way of dealing with anyone who isn't as homicidal and suicidal as they are. This begs the question: how do the two of them get to be there at all? If everyone is hellbent on killing and getting killed and kills anyone who isn't of the same mindset, than how come the noble general got to be their general at all? And how come the sensible Saigo escaped summary execution the first few days he was there? It makes me wonder and it doesn't get answered in the movie.Instead we are to belief that the noble general has the concerns of his men in mind. Not unsurprisingly because the general can be seen several times in scenes with Americans that show him to be as honorable as they are or at least as sensible. The benign influence of America, or at least the fact that the more sensible Japanese is automatically attracted to things American, is made clear in a small scene where Saigo is sitting together with a fellow soldier who tells him how he was mistaken about the American soldiers being cowards, but instead found them to be brave. It was beyond me why this particular scene was in there as it doesn't follow from what went before(the US marines hardly feature in the movie) and what follows only shows us marines shooting Japanese prisoners. It is as if someone said: we have to have something that mentions something positive about us soldiers for no reason at all and then have it proved wrong a few minutes later. Or something similar.Overall the movie is far too long and there are too many superfluous scenes in the movie that just repeat the same tale over and over again: that the Japanese were batshit crazy people with death on their minds who were as dangerous to their own people as they were to the enemy. Or actually, more dangerous to their own people.This concept seems wrong to me, but then I can't say anything about it because I do not know them very well. What I however do know is this: if they were as deranged as they are in the movie then it is unlikely that either the general or the soldier would have been there at all. The would have been killed before the Americans ever set foot on the Iwo Jima.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most poignant war movie yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that I well and truly love this movie. It is truly a work of art, and despite the length, remains enthralling till the very end.As an actor, Clint Eastwood may have played typically manly, bad-ass roles (such as the infamous Dirty Harry), but his run as a director so far has revealed his proclivity and knack for creating beautiful, resonant, deeply sensitive motion pictures. As for the movie itself, I was interested enough as it were, and watched keenly until I came upon that inevitable occurrence I have found in every Eastwood movie I have watched so far...the point where I begin to weep like a small child. In this movie, it would be the scene where the Kempeitai soldier reveals the truth about what happened to him. The way he had been portrayed up until that point, and the understanding we gain into his character is deeply touching in its immense, implicit simplicity.This is, personally, my favourite war movie of all time (I have seen quite a few, but none like it). Do try to give it a watch; it's definitely worth the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie whose greatness will grow over the decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hats off to writer Iris Yamashita and the fine cast of "Letters from Iwo Jima" for accomplishing what few war movies do: making you really care about the characters. There was depth to the key characters, and personal growth as the events unfolded. Even with the secondary characters, there was a clear sense of personality, not always nice. The result was a range of types of Japanese soldier, from authoritarian, to loyal to Japan, to grunt following orders more or less.The plot was exceptionally well constructed and unfolded so naturally that I wondered how much of it was based on historical research and how much came from Yamashita's imagination. I decided it didn't matter. About halfway in, with the battle clearly lost, you can't help wondering how she is going to fill the remaining hour. Yet that is when we begin to truly understand the characters. Most of all, "Letters" is memorable, both in the characters, the scenes and the story. There is clarity to the picture, yet it accomplishes many goals at the same time, effortlessly. By comparison, "Flags of our Fathers" did not create a lasting impression, with few memorable characters or images. But it does give you an understanding of the battle from outside the Japanese caves and so it is probably best to watch it first, before "Letters." This is not the first time a World War II battle was shown from both the Japanese and American perspectives, equally. In 1976, "Midway" did this, and even had the Japanese scenes filmed by Japanese film crews. Naturally, both sides were presented compassionately. And it did a wonderfully job of explaining the battle and its significance, but the attempt at creating a human interest love story sub-plot pales by comparison to the way characters are developed in "Letters."The companion stories of "Letters" and "Flags" provide only glancing references to atrocities, including an American soldier shooting two Japanese prisoners, against orders. And it shows acts of compassion to the enemy by both Japanese and Americans. But they are not fully symmetrical, with more brutality from the Japanese, both to the enemy and to themselves through suicides, which is historically accurate. I don't think "Letters" fully explains the techniques and sociological pressures at work to enforce obedience within the Japanese military, even to the point of committing horrible atrocities against enemy soldiers and civilians, though we do see some of the punishments used. But that was not the goal of "Letters," and we cannot expect any one movie to cover everything. It is more effective to maintain a focus, or the concept gets blurred, and "Letters" keeps that focus, while presenting a surprising amount of detail. The German movie "Stalingrad" was more brutally honest about German faults, but then it was made by Germans. Any movie exploring the social forces behind Japanese atrocities must be made by Japanese. I did see one movie like this, about a war widow trying to uncover the truth of the last days of her husband in battle, called "Gunki Hatameku Motoni," variously translated as "Under the Flag of the Rising Sun" or "Under the Fluttering Military Flag." "Letters" is closer to "Das Boot" in approach. To be frank, I think Japanese behavior during WWII, as a country, as a military and as individual soldiers, was generally deplorable. And I don't think the modern Japanese have been fully honest about this. People are people, regardless of nationality, but it was the country's culture that allowed this to happen, and far too many Japanese soldiers went along, not surprisingly, since they were prepared for war from their childhood. This does not come out clearly in "Letters." At the same time, I've always understood -- in theory, at least -- that soldiers, regardless of nationality, are human beings with feelings and lives and loves, and most are forced to fight by a system that is beyond their control. That's the side of the story we see in "Letters," which brings the Japanese as human beings to light in ways you just don't see in documentaries or history books. That's the mark of a great historical war movie, regardless of how much of the plot or characters are fiction. After watching a movie like "Letters" or "Das Boot" or "Stalingrad," you never see things the same again. You have a better understanding of people, and more compassion for people who were once your enemy. But, and this is a big but, you still need to learn more about the context of events depicted in these movies. To really understand the Battle of Iwo Jima, you need more historical background on the battle, the war in the Pacific, and WWII in general. They are complementary: the movie helps you understand the history, and history helps you appreciate the movie.One more thing: As I watched "Letters" I couldn't help thinking how the Japanese should just surrender and end the senseless slaughter. That's what any sensible commander or soldier would have done. General Kuribayashi was presented as a sensible fellow who even had American friends, yet he simply couldn't surrender because of the way the Japanese social and military system worked. This was actually explained more clearly in "Flags," and was more implied in "Letters." In the end, it all seemed so senseless.Watch these movies about Iwo Jima and you will begin to understand why Truman approved dropping atomic bombs on Japan. Japan was defeated, but the military rulers were willing to sacrifice every Japanese soldier and civilian rather than surrender, and the Japanese obeyed. The battles for these Pacific Islands demonstrated that. Americans saw the horrifying, needless deaths and suicides in the caves, of soldiers and civilians. The atomic bombs, by ending the war, saved millions of lives, Japanese and foreign.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that touched both sides of the war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be honest to tell that I've watched this movie on Youtube not knowing the background of its creation. I first thought that it was Japanese production as most of the dialog was done in perfect Japanese. But as I started watching, I've noticed how many Japanese have commented on this movie, and here seeing almost unanimous appraise from the American audience, I've come to understand that this movie touched the hearts of people on both sides.To give some background on how the war started, Japanese was an up and coming country after defeating the Russian navy in the 19th century, rushing to catch up with the greats of the west. Their model were the Great Britain, Dutch, and the French who've established colonies throughout southeast Asia. Japan understood from their example that colonization was the road to a great country. So in the name of "Great Asian co-prosperity region", they've started to colonize China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and other parts of Asia. In the process repelling the Dutch and Great Britain from Malaysia and Indonesia. This didn't sit well with Allied countries including the United States. Roosevelt, and Cordel Hull already knew that Japanese would not back down and war was the only solution to the problem. So they've put up economic embargo on Japan, and would not agree to negotiation vying for time to get the war machine in order. United States had a trump card that Japanese didn't know about. Few members of the Freemasonic order was in the top brass of Japanese imperial navy, namely minister of Naval affairs Yonai, and vice admiral Masami Inoue. So naval and imperial secret code "purple" was already deciphered before the war started, and all informations about Japanese movement was known to the US. The rest is history.Iwo was a turning point for Japanese moral. Until then, Japanese people were told that Japan was having successful campaign in the Pacific, but after Iwo there was no way to hide the truth. Most of the Japanese war budget were taken by the navy, and Japanese army always had supply problems. After the collapse of the Imperial navy, army had no legs to stand on, and Iwo became the symbol of Imperial army's courage, and tragedy.This movie probably most accurately depicts how the people at Iwo spent their last days. I say "people" because that's who they all were. Before they were soldiers, they were husbands, sons, and brothers who've left their family in Japan.From the comments I read, Japanese people feel that this tragic sacrifice people made at war should not be forgotten, and their spirit should be remembered to better the society. I'm rather surprised that similar sentiment although from a different perspective is also unanimous with the American audiences.Much ignorance and arrogance was the cause of the war, but it took this sacrifice to learn the mistake and the lesson should not be lost with time. Clint Eastwood did great service by accurately depicting the war, and the people who lived its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the greatest war movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iwo Jima is one of the most tragic fight's battlefields at World War II. The movie starts from Iwo Jima of 2006. Hundreds of letters were discovered from underground. They were written to families by Japanese men who fought on this island 61 years ago. The lieutenant general of the army, Tadamichi Kuribayashi, got off to Iwo Jima as a commander in June, 1944 when the progress of a battle kept deteriorating. The destiny of Iwo Jima that was the last fort of the homeland defense was entrusted to this man. As soon as his arrived, he changed a longtime claptrap strategy and unjust corporal punishment. Soldiers surprised. Kuribayashi was a new hope in soldiers as Saigo in despair at every day, because he was different from past commanders. But Many of lieutenant generals as Ito and senior officers who try to carry out dying against Kuribayashi's unusual plan. The story unfold angle of these men.I think this movie has some points. First, the casts are gorgeous, for example, Ken Watanabe, Kazunari Ninomiya, Shido Nakamura, Tsuyoshi Ihara, Ryo Kase etc. Second, the battle scene will be indifferently drawn by cruelty to convey a fact. Third, people who weren't pleased with the war. And it is drawn what they, American soldier and Japanese soldier, were frighten and surprised at an unexpected side. I think the foolish act of war happened because it didn't know well each other.A piano melody of music is the main. I want you to hear it paying attention because it won the Academy Award music sound effect section. This movie is dark as the war movie. But we will have to be thought the war. My favorite line is "Don't die." It is Kuribayashi's line. We find that values of life from it, and Saigo said too. I like this word. I recommend you this movie. If you have time, you watch "Flags of Our Fathers" too.</fullReview>

Its a great piece, expertly shot with some touching and often moving moments of human kindness and cruelty on th harshest of battlefields.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iwo Jima Stunning Simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers had ambition, and I admire it for that. Unfortunately, the script ended up becoming too tangential and muddled for its own good ? while it was trying to zero in on a message, it ended up loosing itself and searching for that message in the wrong places. Letters, however, hits the right marks. The result is an extremely well put together film, with deep humanistic and spiritual significance. It ponders the very nature of life itself and (like most unforgettable war movies ever made) it reaches a beautiful conclusion about life's "big questions" without beating us over the head. The film is so sensitive toward human life, yet it is not over the top. It dismisses dramatic grandeur for pure, undecorated truth. This very candid and frank approach pulls at the heartstrings not overtly, but like other films by Eastwood, possesses a more subtle quality. I've come to realize that the poetry and the drama in this movie are carefully disguised in the simplicity of the narrative. For these reasons, the film is affecting on an inner level, and sticks in the mind even after watching it just once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rewarding but slow-paced war movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably going to spark a whole heap of clicks on the "not useful" button but what the heck...Letters From Iwo Jima, despite being an interesting take on one of the most famous battles of the second World War is not as good as some would have you believe. The Japanese finally get their first balanced depiction in a war movie since the likes of Tora, Tora, Tora! and Midway presented both sides of the coin in the seventies, and the conflict between their human nature and their Samurai honour codes provides a fresh spin on a genre that usually succumbs to clichés. However, despite being unbelievably sad and violently harrowing, it still doesn't scale the giddy heights that classics like Platoon have managed. You can put that down to the slow-pace and unsatisfactory battle scenes.The film effectively revolves around three different soldiers; forward thinking General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), flashy celebrity officer Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara) and every-man Private Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya). Of the three, Saigo is the one most easy to identify with and consequently, his desperate bid to survive and return home to his wife is also the most rewarding. After all, in most war-movies he'd be easily interpreted as the cowardly stereotype, but his disillusionment with the Imperial war effort and abject refusal to commit Hari-Kari when all around him are fighting to the death makes him something of a reluctant anti-hero, an ordinary man in the most impossible situation. Ken Watanabe meanwhile shines as the man in charge of the defence. His initial plan for fighting the Americans jars the tradition-fixated officers under his command and throughout, his battle to maintain a semblance of order among his troops in the face of insurmountable odds is done very well. He is bound by honour to die in combat but doesn't believe in throwing his men away pointlessly and is another addition to Watanabe's "wise warrior" crammed CV.Ihara's Baron Nishi doesn't grip attention quite so much as the other two but nevertheless, his story arc results in one of the most humane scenes in the movie when he orders his troops to nurse an injured American soldier. Like Watanabe's General, he is another deeply human soldier and a far cry from the stereotypical fanatics of war-movies past...but here is where the film loses a star. Both of these men have visited America and while they glow with positive values, the majority of officers that crop up elsewhere are exactly the sort of violent lunatics that were perpetuated by WW2 propaganda campaigns, Eastwood seemingly reluctant to allow them to be sympathetic unless they've caught a whiff of apple pie cooling on Mama's windowsill at some point in the past.Furthermore, the film's presentation of the battle itself, one of the most apocalyptic nightmares of the Pacific campaign (over six thousand US Marines and almost all of the 21 000 Japanese involved died), the battle scenes are quite weak. This might seem like a shallow complaint in the face of all the nicely-layered emotional development, but in the aftermath of Saving Private Ryan's mechanised slaughter, it doesn't pack the hefty punch required. A lot of the sequences take place in darkness, days of prolonged cave battles flash by in seconds and the constant, abrupt scene changes aren't helped by the obvious indecision over whether to use the shaky-cam or not. Instead, Eastwood takes a more subtle approach (soldiers are already dropping dead from dysentery before the Marines turn up), layering the whole film with a suffocating layer of gloom and hopelessness. While this does suit the mood, it also has the knock-on effect of making war slow paced and surprisingly boring, the running time creeping past at a snail's pace. That said, it also gives us Iwo Jima's trump card; an utterly jaw-dropping mass suicide unlike anything ever seen in an American-made war film before.A refreshing take on an over-populated genre then, Letters From Iwo Jima sadly promises more than it delivers. At its heart is a very human story of men struggling with the impossible demands of honour placed upon them and bar the dog-shooting flashback, is utterly free of schmaltz. But on the flip side, it's overwhelmingly depressing and so slow it's painful. While it might be a strong contender in the race for "most boring war film" though, it's a sure-fire winner when it comes to being the saddest and the final shot is so beautiful that words cannot do it justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. The action scenes made some of my adrenaline run, made me even connect emotionally to the Japanese despair over the overwhelming American invasion. However, the movie is a bit too long. You know how it is about war movies that try/are emotional, too many scenes of soldiers dying like ducks and landscape shots that at first strike you as brutal but then just become repetitive. I don't mean they're unnecessary, but they were still prolonged a little too much.Then, the Japanese point of view is nice to see, but in my opinion seems a little too forced anyway. A Japanese sympathizer to the Americans as the main character (especially since he's seen as the smarter one there..).. you know how that sounds. Hollywood cheap "we are best" drama. But again, this does not feel like the case, but it leaves you with a bitter taste of doubt in your mouth. About a possible historical lesson, I was hoping to learn a little more.. not a bad point, just not a great point.Which leaves basically a pleasant movie to watch, but not great. The taste of doubt of too much "Americanism" in it, or forced drama or whatever is offset by the camera works that successfully make you feel for the Japanese and give you a definite idea of how that conflict went.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much like 'Flags', an enjoyable but flawed piece of cinema (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The point of Letters From Iwo Jima is a little obvious. It tells us that the Japanese were human beings too. Well, I'm sure any intelligent individual would have already known that. But does the film tell us anything more than this? I'm not sure that it does. Therefore I can't add myself to the list of people who hail Letters From Iwo Jima as a masterpiece. In fact, I think Flags of Our Fathers may well be the better film. It at least attempted to try and do something different with the traditional war flick. It tried to open it up and show some sort of historical perspective. And although Letters From Iwo Jima does this to a certain extent, it didn't do it enough for my liking.In Letters From Iwo Jima Eastwood seems so burdened by his desire to show the Japanese as human beings that the film often feels manipulative. For instance, there's a scene where two Japanese soldiers, tired of fighting, decide to surrender to the Americans. The very second that the prisoners were left alone with two Yanks I knew what was going to happen. But despite that, I kept on saying to myself, 'Don't shoot them'. But of course, the Americans do indeed shoot the Japanese soldiers. You can hear the film shouting at you: 'Look, we did bad things too! We're as bad as each other!' But although the Allies did indeed do terrible things, the film doesn't really show the other side of the coin. We see some of the Japanese officers mistreating their soldiers, but we don't see any of the terrible things that were done to American soldiers ? the only piece of up close violence is when some Japanese soldiers repeatedly bayonet an American, and that's mainly out of surprise and fear, which is perfectly understandable in a combat situation.However, unlike some people, I didn't find it particularly dubious that a couple of the 'good' Japanese characters had some sort of connection to America - The General and Baron Nishi both have spent time there. I think the point the film is trying to make here is that these individuals have the experience to know that the Americans are people just like them, that the government is lying is when it makes them out to be monsters and cowards. Therefore the ordinary person, who doesn't have the life experience of these characters and who is constantly bombarded by propaganda, believes the lies that are spat out. But the scene where an American soldier is captured by Baron Nishi and we find out that he isn't the scum the Japanese government has made him out to be fell a little flat for me. Again it felt a little laboured. I'm just not sure that it would be so easy for a large group of people to deprogram years of nonsense and lies.And it disappointed me that the film didn't investigate the motivations of the Japanese in any depth. We see that the ordinary man was forced into combat ? there's a good scene where the film's main character, a baker, is forced to look pleased when he's called up for duty ? but the motivations of the government itself are left unsaid. As a consequence you don't fully understand the crap the Japanese were fed. And I think it would be a lot easier to sympathise with the characters if we were given a fuller picture ? the snippets that we're given, like the baker being called up and the soldier who's forced to kill a woman's dog by a superior, help somewhat, but the 'bad' characters remain screaming stereotypes. What was their motivation? What works well, though, is the portrayal of the misery the Japanese soldiers had to go through. Living in caves like animals, they certainly didn't have an easy time of it. And then having hardly any ammunition, little water and virtually no food you wonder how they had the will to fight at all. And that's what makes their story tragic ? that so many lives were lost for nothing. And I couldn't help but feel anger when a large group of Japanese soldiers held grenades to their chest and blew themselves up. You want to be able to break them out of their spell, to tell them that their deaths are without reason. And I guess it's telling that it was in these sorts of scenes, ones were you feel like you're not being manipulated, that I felt the most sympathy for the Japanese. The film didn't need to try as hard as it did to communicate the waste of the conflict, you can feel it completely in moments like the one described.Another moment that I found powerful was when we see a Japanese pillbox get attacked by American soldiers ? they attack it with a flamethrower. We actually see this scene first in Flags of Our Fathers. Therefore, rather cleverly I think, Eastwood is asking us where our priorities lie. In the previous film we maybe cheered or smiled or were pleased that the enemy died, but here we're confronted with the reality ? it wasn't the enemy that were killed, it was a group of ordinary people from a different country who were unlucky enough to get caught up in the conflict. There's no joy in their deaths. It's simply a waste.Now if the entire film garnered this response from me, I would maybe join in with the chorus that is proclaiming it as a masterpiece. As it stands, though, it's merely a very good film. (I honestly think people are giving this film special dispensation because Eastwood filmed it entirely from the Japanese perspective and because he filmed it in their language. Yes that's very admirable, but it doesn't erase the film's shortcomings.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima is a movie that is a counterpoint to Saving Private Ryan. It is about Iwo Jima and the Japanese, about someone who doesn't want to be in a war and about a lot of people who get killed for no clear purpose. You should make your own mind up what this movie has with the here and now and maybe take into account that history general tends to be defined by the present. Eastwoord makes a statement without becoming overtly political, sentimental and without twisting the facts. The movie Saving Private Ryan put forth the idea that war could have a purpose: liberating peoples from their oppressors; or: saving one life at the cost of others. The movie was a highly American centered sentimental movie, for it was about Americans and aimed at Americans.If Saving Private Ryan poses the statement that war might have a purpose, Letters from Iwo Jima counters with the question: at what price? Letters is not of necessity a movie that tells us that war is futile, but it shows us what bloodshed war can cause and it also tells us that the guy on the other side of the hill isn't always a mindless killing machine. The movie is straightforward in this, without sentimentalism and as far as I can tell true to the facts. Of course Letters is remarkable because there is almost not role for the American soldier. The marines have that same vague role the Germans have in Saving Private Ryan. Yet despite this the movie is aimed at an American audience. Letters of Iwo Jima might therefore miss aspects of Japanese culture but this is because the purpose was not to be accurate in every detail. It was to show that there is another side to a tale. I think the movie it one of the better war movies made, despite the fact that is is somewhat to long in the middle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has been one of the greatest film out there that portrayed the history. But I would like to point out a trivia that Army Lt.General Tadamichi Kuribayashi did not use Benzai Charge attack in the last fight. The film showed the charge and it was incorrect. He gained a surprised attack to the US marines.Read the translation from Japan wiki -------------- Kuribayasi herself executed charge on March 26th vis-a-vis the US military and accomplished death in battle. Before the charging the lieutenant general (really you had been promoted to the leader with 17 dates but) to remove insignia, it fought with one soldier similarly and because you die in battle, it could not discover Kuribayasi's corpse even in the investigation by the US military after the battle concluding. As for this last charge, shape of generally known hurray charge was not taken, got near to the enemy's camp in the spy and because the strategy which is close to the guerrilla warfare which pierces the carelessness of enemy side is taken, succeeded in giving last shock vis-a-vis the US military which has not been expected. Furthermore, those where individual Commanding General of the Division charges are new thing as a military history of the Japanese military. -------------- Anywaym Good Job Mr. Clintwood!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Japanese living in the South, I expected a lot before watching this movie. I am a little disappointed, though the movie was still good.This is not a documentary, since it added many fictional stories (that of Saigo) and scenes (the way General Kuribayashi died, for example). As a fiction, this movie got to be entertaining with good story lines, etc. It is not. Some flashbacks were effective, but not powerful enough to become main stories. As a result, what I saw for over two hours was a very subdued description of a futile battle with many grim scenes. Some people comment that this was a human drama, rather than a war movie. It makes sense, since many logistic details necessary for war movies are missing; how long it took Japanese soldiers to build massive underground tunnels, how far away Mt. Suribachi is from the headquarters, how long it took US soldier to claim Iojima, etc. As a human drama, however, this movie has much to be desired. For one, the development of a relationship between Shimizu and Saigo was never well described. How did Ito feel when he was captured without completing his suicide mission? (The actor, Shido Nakamura, was gravely underused, by the way. His "mad" eyes can express as much as a thousand words as they did in many Japanese movies.) General Kuribayashi was nothing but an incompetent leader with a vaguely described personality in this movie. As human dramas utilizing war scenes, Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypse Now, and Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence were much more gripping. This is an anti-war movie, for sure. No one is a pure evil and no one is a pure angel during wars. Many soldiers are unwillingly at war. They are all true, but don't we have to watch this movie to learn this? Other more "entertaining" movies can tell us the same thing. The Last Samurai comes to my mind as an example related to Japan.I still recommend this movie, particularly to young people who know little about the futility of wars. When I went to a local theater, however, a group of four young viewers left with 20 minutes left in the movie. While sad, I couldn't blame them....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hadn't seen this for a few years. It gets better and betterAfter watching "The Pacific" with my daughter in March, (she was learning about WW2, so we watched Band Of Brothers and as well, so she could get a grasp of what war really is about), she asked were the Japanese really that horrific. I told her that we would watch a film from the Japanese point of view which would answer her question.She loved it The film cost a relative pittance, but looks 10x better than its companion piece, Flags Of Our Fathers, (which cost considerably more).Ken Wanatabe is a great actor. Very manly A pure 10/10 and one of the top 5 war films ever made.PS, Nothing sounds better than Japanese yelling at each other. Great sounding language if you are angry ha ha ha ha</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo JimaWhen I hard of this movie a long time ago, I thought it would be boring. But I was wrong because it had Clint Eastwood in the directors chair. I was moved by this movie, because 1) It shows Japanese people suffering from war as much as the Allies did and 2) Positive portrayal of the Japanese. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best WW2 flicks ever.The Positives: EVERYTHING!! The Minuses: None, except confused ending.Overall, Letters from Iwo Jima is a great movie for everybody. this shows that even the enemy deals with stress and trauma. The reason why I give it a 9 was because the ending was confusing. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the best war films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not yet seen the companion film to this movie, FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and when I do I will update this review if needed. LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is about the battle of Iwo Jima from February through March, 1945 and it is told from the Japanese perspective. FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS is also about this battle but is told from the American perspective. Both were written/produced by the same people.LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA is an exceptional film because it tried so hard to get the story about the battle correctly. While many of the characters are fictionalized, some are based upon real characters involved in the battle (such as the commanding general). It's obvious that the folks who made the film had a strong desire to get it right historically speaking. The only problems I noticed were that the battle only seemed to last a few days and involved a hundred or so Japanese men. However, the battle lasted about a month and involved about 10,000 Japanese. I really don't blame the film for this, as I am sure such a huge cast would have been prohibitively expensive. Plus, as the Japanese stayed in caves during much of the battle, it would be difficult to show the shear numbers of men waiting for the inevitable as well as the passage of time.But there also was a lot it got right. I appreciate how some actual letters written by these doomed soldiers were used in the film--this was a nice touch but one the film could have just skipped. Also, the very brave but often wasteful manner in which so many of the Japanese died was also well depicted. It was really sad (as well as a bit crazy with our modern sensibilities) to see men needlessly killing themselves in some very sad and hard to watch scenes. However, despite all the blood, the film did not seem gratuitous--often not showing closeups of the gore or cutting away when appropriate. Still, this is NOT a film for kids and I hope parents exercise caution in letting children see this film. It's rated R for a very good reason.Overall, the acting, direction, music, writing and production were all first rate and the film will definitely suck you into the lives of these sad but brave men. It's hard to imagine that over 10,000 Japanese men defended the island and only about 200 were taken prisoner.I'd say more,but there have already been some exceptional reviews of the movie and I doubt if I could add more to what they've already said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i watched this film because i was learning Japanese, and i figured it could help me gain more insight on Japanese history and language. Well, it not only taught me that, it also taught me about humanity. Japan was made out to be evil and ruthless, impaling babies and bombing pearl harbour and all. But not most of them, who are innocent, like the expelled Kempeitai, who can't bear to kill a dog. This movie shows the humane side of soldiers, and the brutality of war. The allies were shown to be noble and good, but in this film, they murdered the Japanese POW, so they are just pot calling the kettle black when the Japanese mistreated the British POW. Maybe there were some cruelty, but majority of Japanese soldiers are surely not like that. So, just remember, so there will NEVER AGAIN be another world war, like the dropping of atomic bombs and nuclear warfare. I hope this film reminds us of our humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In our darkest moments do we find the things worth fighting for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the greatest challenges we take on when we challenge ourselves to tell a story of wars is to tell the stories of our enemies. The challenge we face is twofold. We must face our own demons, and we must face the humanity of our enemies. When we demonise our enemy, we rob ourselves of our own humanity, yet if we excessively humanise our enemy, we magnify our own demons. This is the challenge that Spielberg and Eastwood took on when making Letters From Iwo Jima. It is the same challenge Petersen took on when making Das Boot, and whilst Eastwood does not triumph over the challenge as greatly as Petersen did twenty-six years ago, it certainly is not for lack of trying. The battle for Iwo Jima was, and still is, no different from the battle for the Atlantic, or the battle for Stalingrad, or the battle for Normandy. Two groups of nations sent massive groups of men to kill one another, and until recently, only one side's story was really told. Okay, pardon my hyperverbosity for a moment, I will dispense with it shortly.Looking at a war through your own eyes is hard enough, looking at a war through your enemy's eyes is probably the greatest challenge of all. That Eastwood dared to take on the latter challenge at all is a testament to his fortitude. That he does it so well is a testament to his maturity as a filmmaker and storyteller. If there is a weak link in this production, it would definitely be the manner in which the stories are being told. Letters attempts to fit stories of a legion into a hundred and forty minutes. That the story of only two men comes through clearly should surprise nobody. That it is the story of a nobody, a mere footsoldier (and I apologise in advance to those who might be offended to hear him described in such terms), that comes off the best is both a surprise and a disappointment. A surprise because a lowly Private called Saigo ends up the real hero of the story, and a disappointment because we long so much to enter the mind and heart of the real General Tadamichi Kuribayashi.Ken Watanabe puts in a performance as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi that stands in such fine company as Sir Ian McKellen as Magneto, Jürgen Prochnow as Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, or Ed Harris as Major König. The viewer is overwhelmed by the desire to hate or fear him, yet he comes across as so overwhelmingly human that these urges are soon overwhelmed by the respectful desire to sit down with the character for a beer. Both the script and the actor give the character such depth that it is unfortunate that the editing sabotages them in the middle act. Just as we are about to have a moment of clarity with Kuribayashi, the film degenerates into an action-fest with blazing guns, actors screaming at one another, and cameras shaking about. Unlike Flags Of Our Fathers, where the erratic and wild movement of the camera actually does succeed at creating the illusion of soldier's perspective, it only succeeds in throwing us out of the action at a critical moment. And it is the character of Kuribayashi that suffers the most for the lapses.Where the film does succeed is in the opening and final acts. As we are shown the Japanese soldiers making preparations, we are shown how very much in common they had with the young hopefuls the Allies threw into the battle. About all that differs is the methodology by which the leadership gets them to lay down their lives for a goal that seems so nonsensical with six degrees of detachment. Where the American soldiers are told that they will come home and see a brave, free future that stems directly from their efforts, the Japanese are told in no uncertain terms by their commanders that they will only win this war if they make some other idiot die for their country. If they come home under their own power, they can consider that a bonus. Both the similarities and the disparities between the two armies (assuming one has watched the companion piece, Flags Of Our Fathers) smack us right in the face. But what really got this viewer going was the General's whispered remarks about what should be done in place of what is being done.A friend of mine who once read through everything I had written at the time told me that what distinguishes a great critic from a good critic is his ability to dish out barbs equally between both sides. To point out the flaws in equal proportion, so to speak. Films about the inhumanity and flawed psychology of America's approach to war are a dime a dozen, so Letters' application of very American flaws to historical Japan's prosecution of the second World War is surprisingly refreshing. Like Flags, Letters demonstrates that the vast majority of a war effort takes place a great distance away from the battlefield. Granted, Letters is accurate neither in a historical or scientific sense for the most part, but by acknowledging this point in such brutally honest fashion, it transcends the need to be. Rather than bend over for the hobbyists who would pick apart every historical detail for their own pleasure, Eastwood keeps his sights firmly upon the proverbial big picture, and ends up with a film that, while not on the level of Unforgiven, does provide a whole new way of looking at a previously forgotten chapter of our history.I gave Letters From Iwo Jima an eight out of ten. Sure, it is not perfect, but I can think of far worse ways to spend a couple of hours. This is one film everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had great expectations for this movie. I dutifully watched "Flags of our Fathers" and was disappointed with that movie, and the ensuing hype was that Letters from Iwo Jima was way better. Its not. Its better, but not hugely so.I think the problem is Eastwood's directing style. By all accounts, he is not a director who gets fancy. He sets up the shot, does a couple of takes and thats it. Movie made, on time and on budget.Trouble is, that works if your story involves boxers or cowboys or people in a normal setting where you don't need to dislodge the viewers expectations and sense of reality. Not so good when dealing with the surreal situations that battles and wars create.His crews and actors all love Eastwood the director, at least according to a recent biography I watched on him, and thats great, but sometimes you need a psycho jerk director to get the right movie made.So the genius that can produce that feeling, as done by Spielberg in Private Ryan, Coppola in Apocalypse Now, Kubrick in Paths to Glory and Full Metal Jacket, Cimono in Deerhunter or even Malick in the Thin Red Line is absent here and so is that necessary element of horror and dreamlike shock.War movies are either action flicks, epics, moral dramas or occasionally comedies. This isn't really the first second or fourth, which means its a moral drama, but for that to work, you have to be engaged in the film and for some reason, that never happened for me.To be honest, eventually, during my watching, I found this film to be tedious. I got tired of reading subtitles, which detract from the experience of watching the movie, whats more, some of the English translations offered seemed lame and even occasionally silly.The other thing the film lacked, and maybe it was intentional, was a sense of the surrounding circumstances that gave rise to the battle for Iwo Jima. There are passing references in the conversations to the Japanese circumstances of the time (the war was lost and they knew it), but the film fails to frame that well.Now, all of that being said, because everyone else seems to think this film really rocks, and because I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood, I'm going to try and watch it again, just to make sure I didn't miss something.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good film, but not quite a classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's examination of the doomed Japanese defence of the strategically crucial island of Iwo Jima in WWII is certainly an involving, thought-provoking picture that leaves the viewer with no choice but to identify with the enemy in a way that most war films fail (or never try) to do. However, for all its earnest exploration of the pressures of war on men who know they are probably about to die, it falls short of being a classic in my eyes for two reasons. Firstly, its use of flashbacks doesn't really work: when they're not providing a melodramatic soap-opera angle to the plot, they tend to point a finger at aspects of the story Eastwood seems to feel our attention has to be expressly drawn to, rather than filtering it into the story through the actions and words of the characters as they restlessly wait for the battle to begin. Secondly, there seems to be a tacit criticism of the Japanese ideology regarding honour in battle. While it is easy to believe many Japanese soldiers, possibly recruited into the war effort against their wishes, would willingly retreat rather than die a hero's death, Eastwood almost seems to disparage the belief of those who would rather die. The way in which the defeated Japanese soldiers' suicides is depicted almost suggests that it is cowardly (where in fact it is actually considered a more acceptable fate than the ignominy of living in shame), and the one soldier who straps mines to himself in an effort to take a US tank with him is reduced to a figure of ridicule. While their views of death and honour may seem difficult to understand to western minds, those views should still be shown in an unbalanced way in a film such as this.Having said this, Eastwood's decision to show the battle from the Japanese point of view is a worthy and commendable one, especially as its subject matter and use of subtitles was sure to cost it at the box office. The film is long, but doesn't feel overlong, and has a large cast which sometimes calls for a level of concentration beyond that which is normally required in order to keep a handle on who is who. For the most part, apart from the last part of the film, the US soldiers are barely glimpsed and, when they are, Eastwood doesn't shy away from showing them in a bad light at times. It all contributes to the somewhat timeworn (and bloody violence and viewpoint aside, this story could easily have been lifted from a fifties war film) theory that at ground level there are no heroes or villains, just average men struggling to stay alive, and that war can bring out both the best and worst in all of us.The film begins where it ends: Japanese survivor Saigo on the picturesque beach of Iwo Jima. At first glance nothing looks different from the opening shot, but Saigo is lying wounded besides American soldiers and thousands more are dead. Eastwood is suggesting that we are destined to follow an inescapable cycle of war and death that, ultimately, will prove to be largely meaningless ? and of course, as we all know, he isn't wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) **** (out of 4) Clint Eastwood's depressing and thoughtful look at the battle of Iwo Jima told through the eyes of the Japanese soldiers. This companion piece to Flags of Our Fathers is one of the greatest war films ever made but it might be an insult to call this simply a war film because it's so much deeper. I hope I'm not putting too much hype on the film but I'd also call it one of the greatest Japanese films ever made and that's saying quite a bit since you've got an American director but I guess it shouldn't come as a shock since Eastwood has always been a fan of Japanese cinema and Kurosawa. I sat in the theater for 140-minutes just feeling complete sadness for the Japanese soldiers but something weird entered my mind during the first fight at Iwo Jima. As I sat there watching the Japanese soldiers get killed, it really didn't hit me the same as seeing an American soldier get killed. Later in the film there's a scene where the Japanese General (Ken Watanabe) reads an American letter to his troops. That scene really nails home what this movie was all about and it really made me feel differently about seeing the Japanese soldiers getting killed. On a technical level the film is downright beautiful to look at. The editing and visual style is quite remarkable but the key to the film is its heart. Most of the heart is gained from the brilliant performance by Watanabe. I haven't seen all of the Best Actor nominations yet but I find it rather shocking this guy didn't get a nom. His performance is right on the mark because he plays a human so well. Having to die for your country and handle it with grace yet understanding of the other side is pulled off extremely well by the actor. There's also some suicide scenes, which were extremely difficult and sad to watch and they reminded me of the Russian roulette scenes in The Deer Hunter and were equally disturbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting, Tragic, Memorable Account Of The Japanese Defeat At Iwo Jima</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1944, General Tadamichi Kuribayashi of the Imperial Japanese Army is ordered to defend the key Pacific island of Iwo Jima from the Americans. Horribly outnumbered, with only a small force and no air or sea support, the mission is doomed to fail. How can he and his men defend their country, do their duty and maintain their honour ?A companion piece to Eastwood's Flags Of Our Fathers, this is in several respects an even better film. It's a more intimate story, it's much more focused, and the tragic pathos of the Japanese defeat has tremendous emotional resonance. The other film is more about the complex after-effects of war, whereas this is a simpler, harrowing depiction of the horrors of combat. It explores the mindset of the Imperial Army with keen insight; an almost incredible national vow of death before surrender at any cost, but also a people of dignity and compassion - in one scene a Jap commander has his medics treat a wounded American, whilst in another the Marines indiscriminately shoot two prisoners, a shocking reversal of the standard stereotypes. The four main characters - Saigo, Kuribayashi, Nishi and Shimizu - are all trapped in an inescapable nightmare, struggling to understand how they came to this, and all four performances are excellent, particularly Ninomiya as the lowly Private Saigo and Kase as the humiliated former Kempeitai military policeman. As the film progresses and their position is lost, the grimy, desolate, dusty, igneous-hard tunnels and caves become a labyrinthine Gateway to Hades as the soldiers are driven to horrific lengths to survive. Beautifully scripted by Iris Yamashita, with many poignant moments; Shimizu confessing the story of the dog, Nishi - the only man with real vision - being blinded, the sudden immolation of a soldier through a tunnel roof, Saigo's heartbreaking promise to his unborn child. Shot almost entirely in Japanese, very rare for an American production (the only rival is Kill Bill: Vol 1), this is a terrific reflective comment on one of the bloodiest and most important battles of World War II, and an eloquent, moving and memorable picture. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie But Nothing New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is proof that the powers that be in Hollywood just love it when an actor decides to direct. They decide amongst themselves that they are the 2nd coming or something. I appreciated some of Mr. Eastwood's work. I loved "Million DOllar Baby" was moved by "Mystic RIver" and I wanted to dislike "Unforgiven" but ended up admitting that it was new take on the Western and was well directed. However this movie is nothing new, nothing earth shattering, nothing special, and certainly nothing worthy of a Best Director Oscar Nomination.I'm not saying it is not a good film. I'm not even saying that I wasted my money on the ticket. But the film has nothing special about it. It is your standard war film, the only twist is the guys you are suppose to find yourself caring about are the Japanese not the Americans. We are "taught" through Mr. Eastwoods highly praised eyes that the Japanese are just like our American soldiers, fighting for love of country and honor. A noble effort if it was 1957, not 2007. Sorry to tell you Mr. Eastwood but the enlightened few of your generation have become the enlightened many of a new generation.Would I recommend you go see this film, sure if you like war movies. Sure if you like Clint Eastwood and want to see his work. Sure if you like Ken Watanabe (He is excellently charismatic and stoic at the same time). But not if you want to see something new and different. Sorry Mr. Eastwood but we have seen the horrors of war through Mr. Spielberg's eyes, Mr. Stone's eyes and Mr. Cimino's eyes. So To your movie I say Nothing New and Nothing Taught. But good effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On par with Saving Private Ryan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima is a brilliant and far superior companion to Flags of Our Fathers. Exploring the defence of Iwo Jima from the perspective of the Japanese, the film synthesis is achieved through amazing performances by Watanabe and Ninomiya, brilliant writing and a poignant and dramatic soundtrack. The cinematography and effects are mesmerising, benefited by a brilliant and appropriate selection of setting (some aspects of the film were filmed on Iwo Jima). The film is also incredibly accurate, with less than ten historical inaccuracies. Now, to commence a rant which should encompass the remaining four lines, the fact that Ken Watanabe was not nominated for an Oscar is a travesty. He delivers a performances comparable to that in The Last Samurai, encapsulating the loyalty and almost medieval attitude towards to warfare that the Japanese adopted throughout the conflict. Despite this, Letters from Iwo Jima is the second most impressive war film that I have viewed, second only to the masterpiece that is Saving Private Ryan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Clint Eastwood's can make best War Movie of All time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, its really sad and frustrating at the same time. This movie had limited release in US, what a shame and second, Ken Watanabe didn't nominate for Best Actor for this movie. First of all, I would like to say Clint Eastwood added one more feather in his cap of excellent direction and when he choose Ken for the role then this movie become classic war movie, may be not in Hollywood, because unlike Saving Private Ryan, Flags of our father and many such movies it didn't show the American and European side which become so clichéd of late that watching War movies looks more like propaganda of some sort, because it always showed Germans and Japanese as beast and villains and Jews and other Europeans are victims and all. No one ever touch the subject of showing the brutal WWII from the other side and tried to understands that they were victim of War as much as Jews and West. This movie just showed the War from the point of view of Japanese and how they sacrifice under what circumstance they fought and died just like American and European soldier did for their own countries, its not about right or wrong its about sacrificing for the cause of your country. And hats off to Eastwood for showing that exact emotions in the most beautiful way and so shame on Hollywood that they gave best Movie and lots of other awards to Saving Private Ryan nominated Tom Hanks for best actor, then in now way this movie shot of Saving Private Ryan this movie should won Best movie, Eastwood should have won best Director and at least Ken Watanabe should have nominated for best actor, then again Hollywood lobbying wont allow such thing to happen. After watching this movie on video, I wished I could watch this on big screen and I wished Oscar would justify and people in West understands otherwise the rating of this movie should not be less than 8.5 or 9.0. I believe we don't have director and visionaries like Eastwood in Hollywood anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent And Inspiring Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Clint Eastwood decided to go into wartime genre, much was expected from him. 'Flags Of Our Fathers' seemed promising, an extended American wallow of winning a war, a much sought out subject, which several filmmakers have tried before. Considering Eastwood's past accolades, it was guaranteeing another tangible symbol of American patriotism, expecting a distinction. However, it turned out to be an uninspiring war time drama. Not because it didn't show American laurels of bravery, which most of the audiences like to see, but it had a substance which was over familiar through overuse. A cliché prejudice of the whites, to be more candid.They say great learners learn from their mistakes. With 'Letters From Iwo Jima', Clint Eastwood breaks the shackles and delivers an out and out masterpiece. He doesn't arrest his style into the boredom of flashback wartime drama or any chauvinistic propaganda. In-fact, he takes radical U-turns. In 'Flags Of Our Fathers', he shows that there is nothing more honorable than to die for a native land, and in 'Letters From Iwo Jima ', he shows the parallels in the misery of death. The movie has a content which many Hollywood movies have failed to exemplify: peace through war is a lie. War is a sarcasm towards God. That's the effect of 'Letters From Iwo Jima'. It avidly and vividly illustrates that war benefits none, and how it destroys nations, cultures, history and civilizations.'Letters from Iwo Jima' shows the Japanese perspective of the Asia Pacific War. It shows a weakening Japanese Empire against the Allied American forces. With most of its air and surface artillery pulverized, Japan seeks a strategical defense in the two islands of Iwo Jima. On the Island, the Japanese soldiers live in apathy. They dig holes all day, sleep in the caves, amidst rats, with rocks as their pillows. They collect rain water and eat boiled sea weeds as their supper. Many ail with diseases, and, are not looking forward for the final engagement.The movie revolves around two characters, General Tadamishi Kuribayachi (Ken Watanabe) and Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya). General Watanabe is a paternalistic leader, deeply rooted in his culture, also a witness of the Great Industrial Boom of the 1940, in America. At every defense point, on the island, he sees defeat. Every plan and strategy dismays him. He expects defeat but he doesn't want to accept it. He wants his brigades to die for their country, but as the giant American navy marches towards Iwo Jima, he witnesses plague in the caves and mass suicides. Saigo, a baker turned rifleman, is a witness to all this affliction. He is a witness to a remorseful death of his friend and finds pleasure in writing painful letters to his young expecting wife. He has developed enough compulsive fears and seen utmost pain and misery to give up his purpose of defending his native land. Amidst all this trauma and despair, he hopes a reunion with the woman he loves. As the war broods and invasion begins, out of nowhere, Watanabe and Saigo harness strength and bravery beyond imagination. Letters from Iwo Jima is revolutionary and an inspiring war-time cinema. It will blow you away. With this movie, Clint Eastwood dictates that he is not only a brilliant actor, but also an apt director, a skilled screen-writer and a masterful storyteller. He grips you with building anxiety, violence, heartbreaks and melancholia. Ken Watanabe and Kazunari Ninomiya, both, display a powerful performance. Their presence on the screen is devoid of any elaboration or diminution. It's bare and pure with a liberating feel. A somber, yet soulful piano tune carries embodiment of the movie's theme. The eloquence of Japanese language can be judged right there in the subtitles. The climax of the movie commands applauds.In a decade or so, this movie will generate the same cult following which resulted for Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket. It's right there with the greatest war movies of all times. Strongly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different, yet all too familiar.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film critic A.O. Scott once said that Clint Eastwood has a talent for doing new things in familiar genres, and that's what he set out to do in his World War II films, Flags of Our Fathers and Letters From Iwo Jima. Yet the latter is only "new" on a superficial level. People praise it for telling a story from the Japanese point of view, but the themes are all too familiar. Letters represents an important step in that it does not portray the Japanese as mindless villains, but other than that this movie has been made before. It is a by the book war film.Letters revolves around two Japanese characters during the Battle of Iwo Jima, General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and a low ranking soldier named Saigo. Their actions and behavior constitute a stinging indictment of the Japanese Military code, mainly the policy of sacrificing one's own life to evade capture or disrupt the enemy's plans. The army is cut off from all reinforcements and air support, and everybody knows defending Iwo Jima is a suicide mission. But General Kuribayashi is determined to hold out as long as possible. He gives orders that prove to be controversial among his staff. He orders machine guns placed on Mt. Suribachi instead of along the beach, where the men would have just been slaughtered. A subordinate General protested this order, arguing that the men will eventually all die anyway, and they might as well go out in a direct battle rather than hiding in caves on a mountain. During the battle, he forbids a colonel from committing suicide, and commands him to move his men to another position. After all, dead soldiers will not help Japan. The other officers question Kuribayashi's loyalty because he was educated in the United States, so they proceed to defy his orders. Many men commit suicide and some attempt to take back Mt. Suribachi even though they know it is futile. The film is a blatant condemnation of this barbarous and irrational practice.This leads us to Saigo and a few of his friends, who are not like most of their fellow soldiers. Saigo is basically Paul from All Quiet on the Western Front. He recognizes the pointlessness of war and values his life over the so called honor of Japan. Japanese soldiers capture a wounded American soldier in a scene reminiscent of the famous moment from All Quiet on the Western Front when Paul attempts to save a French soldier's life. Ultimately, the Japanese soldiers learn that both sides in war are essentially the same. This is often the greatest praise bestowed upon the film, but I am not sure if Saigo demonstrates an advancement in the portrayal of Japanese soldiers or just a cop out to our modern politically correct culture. The film seems to portray Japanese soldiers as white soldiers with yellow skin, a well intentioned but unsophisticated portrayal. The Japanese were thoroughly brainwashed to fight for Japan to the bitter end. I am sure there were soldiers who thought about surrendering, but they would have been too afraid to talk about it in the presence of other soldiers as Saigo does on many occasions. I think Eastwood sacrificed authenticity in order to execute the film's morals.My only other criticism is the pacing. Letters has a more linear structure than Flags of Our Fathers which makes it easier to follow, but it is still rather plodding. Flags didn't get too slow until the third act in my opinion, but Letters gets to be very tedious before the halfway mark. The same simple themes are reinforced repeatedly and it doesn't go anywhere fast.Letters is basically a retread of familiar anti-war movies. It is beautifully filmed in filtered color and Ken Watanabe gives an excellent performance, but it is also very tediously paced. Some scenes are particularly moving, such as when Saigo is drafted and he promises his unborn child he will come back alive. However, I can only recommend renting it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Other Side Of The Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sixty-one years ago, US and Japanese armies met on Iwo Jima. Decades later, several hundred letters are unearthed from that stark island?s soil. The letters give faces and voices to the men who fought there, as well as the extraordinary general who led them.The Japanese soldiers are sent to Iwo Jima knowing that in all probability they will not come back. Among them are Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a baker who wants only to live to see the face of his newborn daughter; Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), an Olympic equestrian champion known around the world for his skill and his honor; Shimizu (Ryo Kase), a young former military policeman whose idealism has not yet been tested by war; and Lieutenant Ito (Shidou Nakamura), a strict military man who would rather accept suicide than surrender.Leading the defense is Lt. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), whose travels in America have revealed to him the hopeless nature of the war but also given him strategic insight into how to take on the vast American armada streaming in from across the Pacific.With little defense other than sheer will and the volcanic rock of the island itself, Gen. Kuribayashi?s unprecedented tactics transform what was predicted to be a quick and bloody defeat into nearly 40 days of heroic and resourceful combat.Almost 7,000 American soldiers were killed on Iwo Jima; more than 20,000 Japanese troops perished. The black sands of Iwo Jima are stained with their blood, but their sacrifices, their struggles, their courage and their compassion live on in the letters they sent home. Letters From Iwo Jima 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bold attempt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood's Golden Boys, Clint Eastwood and Steven Spielberg bring us Part Two of the Battle of Iwo Jima in the Pacific in 1945, the companion piece to Flags of Our Fathers. Now the Japanese get their say, or do they? The 'story' follows General Tadamichi Kuribayashi as he arrives on the volcanic island, under instruction to defend to the last. He immediately upsets the garrison already stationed there who are preparing for the inevitable American assault with the radical notion of planning their defense from the hills rather than the black beaches. The Japanese know from the outset that they cannot win, but must hold the Americans back as long as possible before the expected invasion of the homeland, an invasion that would never take place. The film shows the misconceptions the Japanese had of their enemies, a feeling which was reciprocated and still exists in global conflicts.The screenplay was written by Iris Yamashita with story contributions by Paul Haggis (Crash) and is based on the book, 'Picture Letters from Commander in Chief' which consists of correspondence from the General himself.The writers face a difficult task here. They must find the right tone between being sympathetic to our main characters and yet realistically representing the military mindset of the time. The Japanese committed many atrocities in WW II and all troops were to fight to the death or commit suicide rather than surrender. At some point, their humanity must be revealed. This isn't an easy line to tread.The real battle went on for nearly six weeks but it seems to only last a couple of days here. However, what is illustrated accurately is the insanity of war. There is neither right nor wrong as both sides carry out appalling acts in order to reach their objectives. Such is the nature of combat.Eastwood and his team brilliantly stage the battles scenes with effective use of color throughout. The performances of Ken Wantanbe (The Last Samurai) as the General and Kazunari Ninomiya as the baker Saigo are standouts.Clint's son Kyle chips in with Michael Stevens for an impressive soundtrack.Iwo Jima is unsettling and punctuated with a number of tense scenes. Yet it is often slow, trying too hard to show the Japanese as human beings. Such scenes would not be necessary in an English language film showing western characters, so they should not exist here. No matter how valid the effort, this is still told through the eyes of the West. One wonders how the Japanese would fare with their version of events.With a substantial trim, this could have been much more powerful. As a war film, it is a customary but effective portrayal of humanity amongst the madness, more so than producer Spielberg's patchy Saving Private Ryan though not in the league of such emotionally captivating films as Platoon, Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket and The Thin Red Line. It's just a pity that we continue to ignore the lessons.A bold directorial achievement and a positive step forward for American filmmakers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Letters from Iwo JIma</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima My interest to see this movie was only because of its Oscar nomination in the category of "Best feature film". I had read this was a sequel of "Flags of our Fathers" about the horrific WWII ? told from the Japanese perspective. The movie is in Japanese language and because I saw this movie in Amsterdam ? it had Dutch sub-titles. I do not understand Dutch language and that was the biggest constraint I faced. There is a lot of talking and I missed out on the dialogues.Clint Eastwood has become a very good director, I think in the league of great directors. His style of story telling is a mix of art house cinema, lots of human drama and emotions presented with lots of sensitivity. His story always unfolds slowly and there is a presence of a different ? almost subtle feel in most of his movies.The story is about American invasion on Japanese Iwo Jima Island. It starts with a pre-text of Japanese arm forces buoyant in the prospects of winning the war by preparing to strategically defend the island. The story revolves around lives of main two protagonists - the Japanese force is lead by General Tadamichi played by Ken Watanable and a local youth Saigo - forced to be part of the mission to save Japan from enemy threats ? played by Kazunari Ninomiva.How the definition of war movies have changed with globalization and communications becoming an integral part of presenting histories. Once the war movies were inspiring and now it is presented as a mistake. Like all other recent war movies ? this movie too also depressing.The Japanese perspective is based on the buried letters found of General Tadamichi in 2005 and his re-capture of actual events that lead to capture of the Island Iwo Jima and his death. Like all Clint Eastwood movies there are very grave and touching moments in the movie ? the death of a favorite horse of a soldier in American bombing, the killing of the dog to stop it barking in the dark of the night, the gut wrenching suicides of Japanese soldiers ? on the eve of defeat - by blasting hand bombs on the chest. The fear of young soldiers is captured brilliantly that enact the tragedy that befalls people in war zones.The screen tone and color shown matches the war movie feel. The executions of war fights are brilliant. The fleet of American ships entering the Iwo Jima waters is astonishing ? compared to that the Japanese army seemed like an ocean in the drop. It was evident that the Japanese do not have any chance to fight this American numbers and might ? but the showcase of sheer courage in fear to fight American forces is captured beautifully by the director.My only problem with this movie is ? does it require an American director to make a WW 2 movie showing the Japanese perspective ? for it to be appreciated and nominated for Oscars?

		<shortDescription>Good but short of great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw it on a weeknight with only about 10 die-hard film-goers in the audience. A very good movie, handsomely filmed but not reaching the same level as "Saving Private Ryan" to which this movie is going to be compared to.I felt the first hour of the movie was too long---this is a long movie, 156 minutes. It is a bit confusing, too. The way the movie is depicted it makes it look like the Japanese only took a few days to prepare its fortifications at Iwo Jima when in fact it took many months.The acting is very good though and Ken Wantanabe as the doomed Japanese general was terrific. The actors playing the baker turned soldier and the former Olympic champion were also excellent.I know the thrust of the movie was to humanize the Japanese defenders of Iwo Jima and show that they were not terribly different from the American Marines who were attacking them. In fact, it appeared to me that the movie was almost portraying the Japanese and the innocents and the Americans as the extremely brutal and almost godlike attackers. I know that a crucial scene later humanizes the two sides when the Japanese have captured a wounded American, but if the Japanese soldiers wanted to blame anyone for their predicament, blame upon their fanatical leaders who had started the war to begin with and then would not surrender even in the face of overwhelming force.I was also struck by how unknowable really the Japanese warrior culture was from our own. Dying for the emperor, committing suicide rather than surrender. A failing of the movie is that it does not place the battle in context---by the time Iwo Jima was fought, the Japanese had invaded a host of Asian countries and had brutalized every nation that fell under their heel. Their treatment of Allied POWs was horrific. The poisonous culture that bred such barbarity had to be stopped and fortunately for mankind it was stopped. Modern Japanese are as far removed from their World War II ancestors as could be hoped.So I cannot give Eastwood's movie a top rating. Perhaps the common Japanese foot soldier had more in common with his American enemy than history tells us. But I have to take exception with too much sympathy being given a enemy who was one of the most dire threats to human freedom that history has seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's with the stuff about inaccuracy in the film? This is a good movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously! The people who call this movie inaccurate aren't watching it carefully. The thing is Iwo Jima is a Japanese island with no natives or any others there so if Clinton Eastwood showed scenes of Japanese torturing or raping innocents then that would be historically inaccurate. Since there aren't any natives to beat or rape there. Also if you think this movie doesn't show the cruelty and strictness of the Japanese during the war. The punishments the soldiers received for showing unpatriotic feelings toward the war or even disobeying orders is enough to prove cruelty especially with that one officer ordering the dog to be killed. Anyway this movie has to be once of the greatest war movies I've ever seen in my life. It's rare for film makers to make a movie showing the opposite side of the war. The sad storyline and dialogue is enough to make you cry. The acting is strong in the movie although I thought the actor who played Saigo's friend was a bit too Western than WWII. Clinton Eastwood does it again and I like the directing too. This is a lot better than "Flags for Our Fathers." Which I honestly thought with no harsh feelings to Mr. Eastwood was a bit lousy and kind of stupid. 10 stars all the way with Letters from Iwo Jima.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Purple Heart, the American flag, a letter from Iwo Jima written by a close Marine comrade to my mother describing the events that led to my father's death, are some of the only tangible memories I have of my father who was killed in action March 7, 1945, on Iwo Jima. I have lived my life knowing my father was a hero in giving his life for his country. The sentiments about War roll in and out like tidal waves in this country. Sometimes Americans are the heroes and the country is flooded with American flags. Now it seems with the movies "Flags of Our Fathers" and "Letters from Iwo Jima" the focus is on the latter. Yes, the movie has its attributes and Clint Eastwood is the hero for distracting us from the American heroes and focusing on War as seen through the eyes of the enemy. His portrayal of the Japanese and their families is poignant to say the least, but it leaves Americans feeling as though they were the perpetrators of the War.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Admired It, But Wasn't Overwhelmed By It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's "Letters from Iwo Jima" is a sober, haunting film, filled with striking images that I thought as I was watching the movie would stick with me longer than they did. I found myself admiring the movie very much, but not feeling greatly passionate about it one way or the other. It didn't resonate with me the way other films this year -- like "Children of Men," for instance, or "Little Children" -- have.I think much of my reaction is due to the fact that Eastwood wants so clearly to make "great" films. He's a modern day John Ford or George Stevens -- he works with traditionally American subjects and in American genres (even if, as in "Letters," the point of view is not American), but like those directors, his desire to make films that people will remember him by sometimes infuses them with a formality that's hard to warm to. So it is with this film.One must give Eastwood credit, though, for embarking upon such a daring venture. Only someone with his clout could make a major studio film in a foreign language that asks us to sympathize with America's enemies in one of the world's largest calamities. And he does so without any sentimentality or bombast; had Steven Spielberg made this movie, the results would likely have been unbearable. But Eastwood has a matter-of-fact quality to his storytelling, and mostly trusts his story to tell itself without forcing it on us with a heavy directorial hand. Even the film's visual pallet is subdued. Everything is a washed out brown and gray, and some scenes, notably the ones that take place deep in the caves in which the Japanese hide themselves, could be in black and white and look no different. The film is terribly sad -- the message that comes through more than any other is the hopeless waste of war. The Japanese don't stand a chance at beating the Americans on Iwo Jima, but they fight to the death, for dying is more noble than surrendering. The film reminds us that people don't fight wars; governments fight wars, and people get dragged along behind to do their government's dirty work."Letters from Iwo Jima" reminded me somewhat of "The Thin Red Line" in the way that it tells its story (though I think "Red Line" is a better movie). It's ruminative and deeply psychological. Eastwood avoids the tendency of many war films to present us with a batch of interchangeable "types." We understand what these men are thinking and feeling, and we understand what they've left behind, so that when they die, we care that they're gone. I have not seen "Flags of Our Fathers" yet, but wonder how that film will change my appreciation of this one. While I liked "Letters from Iwo Jima" very much, I wasn't overwhelmed by it. Perhaps the two films are better when taken together as a whole than either is by itself.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>solid - not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say first that this is not a bad movie. Clint Eastwood is a solid director and this movie has all the basic ingredients of a solid war movie - some scenes of compassion, some scenes of cruelty, tyranny, stupidity and all the other things we know from other good war movies.The problem is that it all feels as though one has seen it before in other war movies. It has a kind of generic feel to it as if you could apply the same recipe to making a movie about pretty much any arbitrary war. As a viewer you never develop real empathy with the protagonists and you are never quiet convinced that this movie actually reflects the "Japanese experience" of World War 2 - in the same way as "memoirs of a Geisha" or "Blood Diamond" are unconvincing.It seems that truly great movies about war or any kind of conflict have to be made by the people who were actually most directly impacted by it. "Stalingrad" is a great movie on the German Eastern Front because it was done by Germans, "City of God" is a great movie on Brazilian slums because it was shot by a Brazilian, "Tae Guk Gi" is a great movie on the Korean War because it was shot by Koreans. "The Thin Red Line," "Private Ryan" and "Platoon" are great movies because American directors understand the experience of American soldiers on foreign battlefields better than non-Americans."Letters from Iwo Shima" lacks the authenticity that would make it a great movie but it is still an honorable effort and might be better viewed as the other half of "flags of our fathers."</fullReview>

Characters weren't given importance, who don't even touch the viewer's mind with their actions. A little insight in to the background for the battle would have a bit useful. The screenplay should have been a bit faster. I think the importance of the battle could have be conveyed in a better way.

		<shortDescription>Does not live up to all of the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like the movie, but it did not hit home with me as much as I thought it would. Certain scenes were really intense, but I feel as the battle of Iwo Jima has a better story than this movie or Flags of our Fathers has told yet. I think there was some fundamental issues with the script and the pacing did not work for me. I loved the soundtrack and the acting was top notch, but I was hoping that these two movies would finally be able to pull off showing both sides of a war and what it means to be a human killing another human being. The criticism of this movie is unfortunately tied to Flag of our Father, but I was hoping for more connections and personal conflict among both sides. I think this movie has a surprising good cast and some scenes in another actors hands would not have been as good. In particular Ken's personal scenes with Kazunari Ninomiya at the end were particularly good. I know this will make me unpopular with a lot of people, but I just do not think that Eastwood makes good decisions a lot of the time. Certain camera angles were silly and some originality the use of the low or high shot would have been nice. The one scene when they first start getting bombed with a really shaky camera felt out of place and did not go with the rest of the movie. I do not know if this is was Eastwood's decision, but I would have like a slower paced movie with just really quick burst of action and really gotten a feel for what it felt like living in a hole with such a singular goal. It was not a bad movie, but just not great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima was for the most one of the best movies ever directed by Clint Eastwood. He does an exceptional job at portraying the opposing front during the Island battle of Iwo Jima. Its also great from the unique perspective it gives. Most war movies all just give that feeling of absolute hate towards the opposing side, though me being an American, it gave an entirely new way of thinking. It doesn't makes you think about what the other side has to go through as well.. When the Japanese general took in that American after being shot by his men and gave him shelter, food and water, and asked his men is this how you would like to be treated it makes you think. Common day war movies give this depressing visage of how one mans war turns out, and makes you hate the person who killed that mans son or father, I like how this movie shows that for the other side.Watch this movie and think about it after your done watching it, Some people might not want their children or veterans watching it due to various reasons. But the movie was very heartfelt and good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do what is right, because it is right.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty courageous movie. Eastwood has produced and directed the story of one of the most bitter conflicts of World War II -- which we get to see from the Japanese point of view. The Americans (OUR side) are the faceless enemies! And it's not done by the numbers either. The doomed Japanese are not handled with careless and facile sentimentality. Some are loyal and brave, but humane -- notably Ken Watanabe's officer. Others are stern with their own troops and savage towards the US troops. They all demonstrate emotions of one sort or another, recognizably human. It's a more concentrated version of the Japanese soldiers we saw in films like Cornell Wild's "Beach Red" and David Lean's "The Bridge on the River Kwai." If Eastwood's "Flags of Our Fathers" was heads, this is the tails side of the same coin.The same -- yet, not the same. "Flags of Our Fathers" is the better film for a number of reasons. One is that the earlier film had focus that this one lacks. Three Marines and a Navy corpsman touring the states on a trumped-up victory trip to raise money. We got to know the four guys and the tragic aftermath of their victory. The structure of "Letters From Iwo Jima" is more diffuse. With the exception of Watanabe, it's hard to tell one Japanese soldier from another, partly because the film is shot almost entirely in darkness, the color is desaturated to the point at which it is almost black and white, and because uniforms, as always, make it difficult to tell who's who. ("Band of Brothers" had a similar problem.) The "letters" in the title aren't often heard from in the film. Nothing easy. No, "I love you, darling, and I miss the cherry blossoms in the Spring." Rather, an officer reads a letter found on a dying Marine. It's from his mother, who advises him to "do what is right, because it's right." Later, before ordering his men on a suicidal attack, he preps them with the same words.Presumably the writer meant the parallel to be ironic, but she hit on a larger question. Exactly what does "right" mean? Even if you are able to step outside the box and examine your situation objectively, what ethic is available as a guide? In the case of Iwo Jima, "right" meant dying with honor to the Japanese. Pragmatically, it now seems foolish. The Japanese had built fifteen miles of tunnels under the little island, some of the tunnel walls were shellacked. It was like living in a hotel with no room service. Yet the American fleet consisted of 150 ships which, if they'd been in a line-astern formation, would have stretched for seventy miles. Theoretically, the battle was over the moment the fleet appeared. The hopeless resistance led to the spilling of blood by about all of the Japanese and an appalling number of Marines. Would we have done things differently? Probably. We surrendered in a nice pragmatic way on Wake Island. Ditto the British in Singapore. Ditto the American and Fillipino troops on Bataan, although there were undoubtedly those among them for whom "surrender is not an option" was a popular slogan.It's a sad movie and truly anti war. The final scene has Watanabe's brief case being dug up year later and its contents dumped unceremoniously out onto the dusty soil. The contents are nothing more than personal letters. Lots of letters. What seems like hundreds and hundreds of letters, leaving us with the impression that Watanabe, like the other casualties on both sides, would have had a lot more to say had he lived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me personally, Clint Eastwood's rise as a humanist master film maker/director after decades of disgusting cop and outlaw imagery and cruelty is a very welcome change. I can watch the drama/visceral violence in a war film like this after I recoil in utter despair from most DIRTY HARRY films. His 2007 image as a great film maker is certainly there and I applaud his constant promotion of humanist ideals in LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA and FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and MILLION DOLLAR BABY... three excellent films that certainly do not shy away from death and its various forms and sub topics, but are not presented as vulgar hatefilled cruelties previously presented as entertainment in 60s70s and 80s Eastwood films. I am pleased that aged 77 he is now to be so well acclaimed. Maybe in time the atrocities of DIRTY HARRY and OUTLAW JOSEY WALES and HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER etc will be completely replaced with the well observed craftsmanship of his films made in this clever new century. As for LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA and it's expert creativity and stance, I would also welcome the opportunity to see the1949 Republic film SANDS OF IWO JIMA, a very successful version of FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS and this film. Personally as good a film as it clearly is, I feel it is too long and part of a series of WW2 films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN that now needs to be a topic left alone for a long time. These films are re created history and a perfect template for students of the sadness of war to contemplate. These films are not entertaining; but are study topics, noble and worthy and excellent for 20 year olds to learn from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Japanese WW2 soldier has almost been portrayed as blindly following orders and routinely carrying out of terrible acts of barbarism.It was pleasing therefore to see Clint Eastwood make a companion piece to his interesting "Flags of Our Fathers". "Letters from Iwo Jima" sets out to show that the ordinary Japanese soldier loved his family, feared death and suspected the motives of his superiors. I suppose we knew this anyway but it is good to see it shown in a major movie.Beyond that the film is pretty simple and arguably simplistic. A new commander arrives on the island in advance of the US attack. He makes enemies in the officer corps by changing their defence plans. The film also focuses on some of the ordinary soldiers as they prepare for almost inevitable death. There are flashbacks from the major characters, showing their lives before the war.As always with Eastwood the film is technically very well made. However there are very few diversions off the expected story path and the ending, in particular, is very drawn out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I started watching and thought "wow...this is a nine." An hour later I was down to 8 and by the end it was a six. It's just too long. It seemed at times the movie was longer than the battle. Nor am I really sure why an American actor should be producing a film about Iwo Jima shot from a Japanese perspective. Having said that, it's an interesting and well done item. The soldiers really were no different than those in the trenches of the first war (All Quiet On The Western Front?) or on the beaches of Normandie (D Day?).Yet it was interesting to see a human face on the Japanese soldiers who too often are presented by Hollywood as squinty eyed fanatics. The flashbacks, keyed to the "letters" of the title were an effective device but there were not enough of them. The special effects were nothing we haven't seen in many other WW2 movies. But the use of very faint colour, almost black and white, was an interesting device that helped set the era. After all, most of us saw WW2 through black and white newsreels. I had a friend, now deceased, who was a veteran of Iwo Jima. Dave was a US Marine who married a Canadian and moved up here. He was the gentlest and kindest of men and, like many veterans who had seen real action, would never talk about it. I wonder what he might have thought of this film or if he even would or could have watched it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Letters from Iwo Jima</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In its entirety, Clint Eastwood's two films "Flags of Our Fathers" and "Letters from Iwo Jima" are certainly one of the most ambitiously crafted movie projects of the recent past. Paul Haggis and Iris Yamashita wrote the screenplay this time. In "Letters from Iwo Jima" the focus lies much more on the battle itself, the film tries to examine the dynamics of a nation and its soldiers at war. There is no individual, only the group, the country. Here it is also shown how some people actually want to die, because they think it might add meaning to their life subsequently. Again Eastwood finds strong images to underline the statements he wants to make. But this film also shares its weak spots with "Flags of Our Fathers". To make a mass appealing film, it is necessary that the audience has characters to identify with. On the other hand it is the duty of an art form to critically reflect its characters actions. It's a thin line and "Letters from Iwo Jima" does not always manage that balance act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just like Flags of our Fathers - only in Japanese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima, one of the most surprising films ever to receive a Best Picture nominee at the Academy Awards (basicly no one saw it at the theaters judging by it's box office results), tries to tackle the story revolving the battle of Iwo Jima during World War II from a Japanese perspective. In doing so, it's off to a troublesome start already, seeing how the West's default point of view will always judge Japan's imperialistic behavior during the time in question, a behavior that eventually built up to this battle.Now, while I might have some personal problems with the films' approach, I was more than willing to give it a chance at the cinema, and let it show me the more humane side of the Japanese people. However, after seeing the film, i'm sad to announce that it's just another version of Eastwood's other WWII picture, Flags of our Fathers - only in Japanese. While it does stand out for it's cinematography and some good acting (for instance: the suicide sequence), I didn't feel like it brought anything new to the screen in terms of visions and message or general feel.At the end, it was a mirror version of Flags, with some scenes practically the same and others barring the same ideas. While this may work as a cinematic gimmick of sorts, it doesn't tread water for being the Best Picture of the year. If anything, both Eastwood films should have been nominated as a combined piece and not as flawed masterpieces per film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I watched this movie I was immediately reminded of other war movies. It uses the same camera style, the same action sequences, and the same long, drawn out, tedious character introduction. However, We're supposed to feel sorry for everyone in this movie, and as such, I didn't care much for anyone. Unfortunately, when you're making a movie about a war, you can't feel sorry for both sides. One has to be clearly in the right, and the other has to be clearly in the wrong. The questionable morals on the part of the Japanese aren't enough to make them feel as though they deserve to lose, even though any history textbook can demonstrate this without a problem.The characters don't feel very real either. Everyone is simply too good at heart to be human. Almost no character jumps out as a fanatic, although fanaticism was required to fight as they do in this movie. The characters simply feel to innocent, and innocence doesn't make for much when fighting a war.Speaking of war, it's important to remind the viewer that this is a war movie. For all the combat we get to see, these troops could have been civilians on an occasionally bombed island and no one would be able to tell the difference. If you're going to show combat, don't hold back. We have to experience the same thrills and horrors in order to fully appreciate the situation. If you want to have a group of soldiers philosophically ramble, leave them in boot camp. And the pacing is very, very slow. The movie doesn't feel so much a fight as it does a clock winding down until the inevitable occurs. And it takes it's sweet time occurring.Additionally, the acting was not that great. While some of the older officers seemed to play their roles well, the main character did not. He constantly reminded me that I was just watching a movie, and when I'm supposed to empathize with the situation portrayed, having a bad actor doesn't help.Ultimately, this movie shot to pull on your heartstrings and show that no one is as bad as they seem. Unfortunately, it just doesn't have the necessary direction, acting, or even action to reach this lofty goal.</fullReview>

It is about soldiers preparing to fight who know they are going to die, they feel sad that they will be leaving their families and friends behind, and they write letters to their families. Then they die. What is the point of making a film about that? Did Clint Eastwood make the film because he believed most Americans are too stupid to realise that the Japanese who fought in World War Two are human beings as well and subject to normal human emotions? If not, then why on earth did he make it? For what it is, it is well made. The acting is good. But it makes the same basic point about human attachment and loss that has been made a billion times before. Eastwood seems to think that he can make the point better by showing lots of images of people crying to the backdrop of slow melancholy music. That is unimaginative and doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paired with companion piece Flags of Our Fathers, Clint Eastwood's labored study into the dynamics surrounding this very significant WW2 battle, Letters from Iwo Jima becomes the second half of one of modern cinema's most impressive war efforts. But on their own, each outing makes too many mistakes to achieve greatness. Largely thought to be the better of the two, Japanese perspectives alone might have garnered the overshadowing amount of praise. Letters may in fact be better then Flags, but it would only be slight.Whereas Eastwood's first American-sided piece suffered from narrative lapses, questionable pacing, and mediocre performances, his homage to the East feels overly stretched while leading to an inevitable conclusion, and most attempts at characterization feels just as weak, perhaps more, then it's predecessor. Make no mistake, Letters from Iwo Jima is still all about a dominating technical proficiency, matched with Eastwood's classy restraint to immerse viewers into the heat of battle like only few war movies can, but after much of the wow factor seemed exhausted with Flags of Our Fathers, the action feels a little less urgent and spectacular. Paired with the script's more nuanced, spiritual approach to relaying it's cast of characters, you've got a completely worthy counterpoint to the first film's tone, but also one that complements the original's inadequacies, only in different ways.Though Ken Watanabe simply elevates his character's motivations through his impassioned performance alone, it is not enough to make much of the background material stick, especially for those watching it over here. Authenticity is abound, but a certain driving sense of guesswork pervades as opposed to more easily accessed American perspectives prior. Eastwood puts more stock into the actual battle this time, admirably showcasing that last Japanese standoff in a more cohesive way then Flag's edited-in battles. That arc makes for a slightly more compelling, and interesting experience, but is still by no means a hands down superiority.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The letter from Iwo Jima-American movie in Japanese form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a Chinese. I watched quite many Japanese and American movies in the past years. I will call this film an American film instead of a Japanese one. First, during the war, Japanese showed a fanaticism of Bushido. And compared with the elders, younger tends to less cherish the life. So the individually surrender almost never happened in Pacific. Even if there had been someone who surrendered, the Japanese would consider it a great shame for the whole nation. And the Japanese way to face the shame is just to deny it.(In the Japanese culture, admitting the crime, shame etc. is much more degrading than denying it) So when I saw the surrender scene, I thought it must not be a Japanese movie.And, what made me thought this might not be a Japanese movie is the dog. In far ease, we consider dog as a regular domestic animal, same as cat and cow. So if a soldier is ordered to kill a dog(except his own dog), he will never hesitate. This scene is also very American.Still, there are other details. There are two characters in the Japanese army who did not obey the lieutenant general's instruction. If it happens in the army, Japanese army must be the last one. If Japaneses decide to suicide, they like knives much better than any other things. All these things told me this is not a Japanese movie. And I proved it on internet. Different cultures give people different thoughts. It can not be faked.</fullReview>

As it went on, though, I realized that this sympathy for three men trapped in a hell of others' choosing DID NOT extend to the Japanese forces or nation as a whole. The truth, at least in my world view is that Japan began the war for imperialistic reasons and that the Japanes occupations of the Philippines and China and other victim nations was an almost unbroken chronicle of brutality, inhumanity and horror. Their own massive casualties on almost every front as the Allies advanced was as much due to their own fanaticism as to the skills of their enemies - a fact the film conveys remarkably well.Along with the related but very much different Flags of Our Fathers, this film should be considered among the great works about WWII, and I think it will eventually be a classic of the Genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit More Cheap Revisionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood launched a two-prong attack upon the siege of Imo Jima. And for my mind he ran out of ammunition. Both movies were made in the same year as - what seemed to be - some kind of special project. They became available as a sort of twin DVD job-lot.I found the American perspective 'Flags Of Our Fathers' a pretty Luke-warm affair, and if I got heated over this Japanese standpoint it was for non-cinematic reasons. Both were hooked from Tesco's brantub for ?3 in a double-size presentation sleeve.It's not clear which was completed first. But looking at the cost estimates it would seem that Yanks stole the march. 'Flags' comes with an estimated $53m budget, whereas 'Letters' claims a modest $19m, just a third of the price. I watched 'Flags' first, and was later astonished by the amount of footage that 'Letters' had in common with it. Machine-gun shots, artillery bursts, Yanks being blown to bits, grand (and very brief) CGI vistas - watching them back-to-back was a very de-ja-vu experience. I suppose it ain't plagiarism to copy your own movies, especially if it saves bucks. But - my - did it look cheap and tacky.And this movie suffered from the same problem as 'Flags' in as much as the ongoing use of brief flashbacks simply broke-up the continuity rather than adding useful infill. Editing appeared even more heavy-handed second time around.But here is where I really get heated, because this was a piece of revisionism too far. Today, the Japanese are industrious, peaceable and cosmopolitan. I, at least, bear no grudges. But during their imperial adventures their conduct towards any other human being was atrocious. They behaved like some feral alien species. And more important; they have never acknowledged their wickedness, nor made amends for brutality that beggared belief. Indeed, there has never even been a formal apology. Quite the contrary; they have actively re-written and teach their domestic history, representing themselves as the victims of conflict.For these reasons I scorn any effort to represent those involved as an 'enemy with a human face'. They, like their Nazi counterparts, went beyond redemption. To me, movies of this kind simply serve to reinforce Japanese National Hypocrisy. Until they express full, frank and humble regret and compel those who come after to accept the burden of history, they should be shown as nothing other than the beasts as they behaved. To do otherwise is a betrayal of all their victims.Shame on you, Eastwood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As WW2 rages, the Japanese soldiers are defending the large rock that is Iwo Jima. But morale among the soldiers is very low, with many of them thinking the rock isn't worth defending. It's not helped by the tough regeime from the commanding officers, who beat them for the slightest sign of being unpatriotic. And worst of all, the odds are against them, and they are in desperate need of reinforcements. But things look like they might brighten up with the arrival of General Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe), the new man in charge, who sees the hard regeime in place and tries to enforce a more productive one. The film follows how the men serve under the command of this new man as the war rages on and they are forced to make a tough decision as to whether keep fighting for the rock...or surrender.The second part of Eastwood's war double-bill, this time told from the Japanese perspective, ironically it's rumoured to be better to see this first to get the most out of Flags of Our Fathers. The first thing you notice here is all the repressed homo-eroticism coming out in the Jap soldiers. On an island with no women, they let out such clangers as "...my stallion, uranus", "Look at the size of his gun!" and "...we shall erect the castle" (thankfully one guy keeps the side straight by talking about it being "hard on" a bloke's wife...) Seriously, though, although the pace drags a lot, Eastwood, possibly the most mature film-maker out there, has taken his time and crafted a labour of love with these two films. From the Japanese side, we see their traditions of loyalty, discipline and rather dying than being defeated conveyed in an absorbing and moody manner. The battle scenes when they do arrive aren't quite up to Saving Private Ryan standards but they are impressive enough, given they aren't the main focus of the story. The narrative flow could have had more of a structure to it, but the film does well enough.The slow pace and weary narrative flow ruined this a bit for me, but the strong performances, well explored themes and sheer professionalism of it more than made up. ***</fullReview>

'Letters' is well directed and the viewer does not notice the subtitles for he or she is entwined with the story. The director's development of continuity of the story with the acting creates a chemistry for entertainment, while the story unfolds. I like the idea that mercy is decided by the fate of the character who captures you. One ends up killing someone they may have liked in normal life shows the insanity of war. Some of the officers in your own army are more dangerous than the enemy. I wonder if they filmed 'Letters' at the same time as 'Flags' for being at the same location with all that gear? 7 out of 10 worth renting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there are a number of brilliant scenes of poignant resonance that emote a strong connection to an audience, the overall impact of the movie is chaotic confusion of the unintended sort. A classic movie is one where the audience is able to follow along with the storyline as if one were intended to as with the participants of the movie (unless there are directorial reasons not). The audience is exposed to a beginning and end that have a cute, but unnecessary twist like the Titanic or Dr. Zhivago, a twist that really doesn't connect well with the movie on a personally level. There are a number of personal story and strategic decision threads that are never explained even though the characters portrayed in the movie are likely to know much more of what is going on than the audience which is a source of unintended frustration. The flashbacks are a nice contribution and supply of good background story. Overally, this is an American attempt at politically correct revisionist thinking that while stating the obvious, isn't quite the indirect Japanese presentation that would be expected of the Japanese. This movie is a beautifully shot, but somewhat over-simplified attempt at Asian movie-making. Seven out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific in spots - spotty storytelling overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm all about this subject matter and I was very interested in seeing things from a Japanese perspective. War is hell and certainly the guys digging caves had very little to do with planning Pearl Harbor or torturing guys in the Phillipines.My biggest problem is the weird start/stop nature of the movie. I felt the beginning didn't show enough of the "building up" defenses part of the story. I wanted to see how arduous it was to dig those caves and I had little sense of how many soldiers dug those and how long it took. Eastwood alluded to the effort but it didn't seem grand and dramatic enough.Then, the actual attack just kinda "came" and there was not horrible sense of dread as the Americans approached. The best battle build up is in Glory and this one just kinda started. There was never a sense of the grand macro plan that went around to all the troops. IN fact, to the viewer, it seems like there's only about 100 Japanese soldiers on Iwo when I believe there were about 20,000. You never get a sense of the scale.The pacing of the movie is choppy once the battle begins. I know real war doesn't happen like in the movies, it's moments of boredom and quick moments of sheer pants-pooping terror, but after 45 minutes in, there is no great sense of thousands of Japanese soldiers dropping. We hear about it, but it isn't shown. I guess Eastwood tried to make the battle "personal", but I don't think he was successful at that either.As for the violence, I've never understood why it's perfectly acceptable to drop a bomb on the enemy, stab him with a bayonet, shoot him in the head but killing him on the battlefield when he's unarmed is suddenly immoral? I just don't get that. He's the enemy, he'll slow you down as a POW and you were just shooting at each other 3 minutes ago. The enemy solider lost, now shoot him in the head and be done with it. What's so immoral about that when you were just trying to kill him from 100 yards away? And I don't know how I would feel about revenge torture on an enemy if I was ever in combat, but I imagine it's a temptation.All in all, good movie, but not something I would want to watch again. I liked it much more than Flags of Our Fathers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that will never see the light of day (in the US)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it a sign of the times, and really disappointing as far as cultural diversity, free speech goes, that this fine film has garnered so little attention at the box office, since it hardly played anywhere.It is doubly strange that it should be nominated however for a few Oscar nods! I live up in Canada, and this movie was picked up by famous players, one of the two big cinema companies up here.This movie is no doubt 'uncomfortable' for some Americans, i can totally understand that, and i wouldn't blame anybody for not liking it, but i think during these times, when everything can be labelled "un-american" or "un-patriotic", it's important to look at things that make us squirm a bit.Sort of like the Borat movie, but in a more serious way.Overall i greatly enjoyed this movie, i thought it could have been an even deeper movie, if Mr.eastwood hadn't tried so hard to bring some sort of moral cohesion, moral balance to the story. In that sense, i thought it was a bit forced at times - maybe if the film was 30 mins longer. But overall, a great achievement in content, and delivery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exercise in selective memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Letters from Iwo Jima" might as well have been made in black and white, or sepia, like the opening and closing sequences of "The Wizard of Oz". In the Victor Fleming musical, the distinction between sepia and color served to demarcate the dreariness of Dorothy's Kansas from the fantasy of Oz.The Clint Eastwood epic has a washed-out look most of the time, during battle scenes. The only time it blooms into full color is when we are shown the more remote past (the 1920s, when the Ken Watanabe character lived in America) and the future postwar era, when the letters are dug up. The idea, it seems, is that the "present day", the war era, is a bleak and hopeless period when Japan suffered defeat at the hands of its enemy. Gee, what a concept -- I would never have got it if not for the color scheme! To be frank, I slept through much of the first hour because I found the film a mind-numbingly crashing bore, the way I slept through D-Day in "Saving Private Ryan". I felt like I was watching the ultimate guy movie (women are rarely seen), with things blowing up all over the place, like "World War II: The Video Game".Only in the last half did the film become more interesting. Even then, I had problems with it. The theme, repeated twice in case we didn't hear it the first time, is: "Do what is right because it is right." Yes, but right for whom? Are we talking about moral absolutes? Are we talking about "my country, right or wrong"? Or are we talking about right in the sense of honorable, where death is preferable to a life of defeat and shame? The other thing that bothered me about "Letters from Iwo Jima" is the suggestion that the Japanese and the Americans are, after all, human beings and more alike than they are different. One almost gets the idea that the Japanese are merely Americans with slanted eyes and high cheekbones.Yet the Japanese are portrayed in a very positive light, while the Americans are sometimes shown as brutal and ruthless. If you believe Eastwood's revisionist history, you could be forgiven for wondering if these were the same Japanese who orchestrated the death march of Bataan in the Philippines.The Japanese, at least, learn something about the Americans -- that they are neither as evil nor as cowardly as they have been led to believe. It is by no means clear that the Americans learn anything at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching movie, but skirts away from many issues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very slow paced movie that tries to touch on the aspects of humanity rather than the battle scenes, so don't expect many heart-pumping action scenes as you sit through this slightly over 2 hour film. Eastwood does a great job with the flashback scenes, and there were one or two scenes that really hit home for me and got my eyes wet.However, I cannot help but think to myself throughout the movie that Eastwood intentionally skipped away from many issues in order to maintain his point. "Letters from Iwo Jima" goes way overboard in making the Japanese soldiers look nicer and more human than they actually were. Now, I'm not anti-Japan, not at all, I'm just anti-Imperial Japan. Eastwood tries to depict the Japanese soldiers as confused and ignorant, but in reality, most of them were actually brainwashed in a similar way as the Nazis, to hate their enemies and brutally slaughter them without mercy. I'm sure there were a few good bunch amongst them, who would save the life of an American POW. But "Letters from Iwo Jima" decides to stay a romantic film instead, and skirts away from the dirty aspects of the war, and the Imperialist Japanese side. I suggest any viewer who might be thinking twice about how kind and human the Japanese soldiers were after watching this movie, to read up on the Nanking Massacre and other atrocities committed by the Imperialist Japanese army. There are much, much more than just shooting a captured POW. The Japanese soldiers simply did not treat their enemies as humans, rather, they saw them as pigs and beasts. That's how they are able to kill, maim, torture, and rape civilians without feeling remorse. The only reason these facts are left out of this movie could be the fact that the battle of Iwo Jima was already doomed for them, and they could do nothing but simply try to survive. But then "Letters from Iwo Jima" would depict the Japanese soldiers as victims, something they were far far far from.Which led me to think about another issue about this movie, why were the soldiers assigned to defend Iwo Jima, an island of such strategic importance to Japan (do a Google about how important it is), why were most of them peasants and cowards? Now I'm not knocking the protagonist, after all he's just a baker who got drafted into the army, even though he was sometimes fairly annoying when he always tried to stay behind and hide in the caves or try to run away. That is kind of disappointing because the only ounce of respect I had for the Imperialist Japanese army where their undying bravery, after all they were the ones who invented the Kamikaze (suicide attack). It was disappointing to see how disorganized and scared they were throughout the battle, it seemed that other than the higher ranking officers, everyone would rather go home and get on with their lives.But credit where credit's due, Eastwood is good at what he does, and I was especially impressed by the cinematography and musical score. I just wish he would depict the war more accurately without having to stay soft and completely avoid the nastier issues in order to "win as much of the audience as possible". The Pacific War was one of the most brutal and vicious conflict in the history of mankind, the Chinese and southeast Asian people faced a tragedy similar to genocide. Don't ever stop to think that "maybe America shouldn't have intervened...", or "maybe we shouldn't have dropped the bomb, after all they didn't want to fight either".In my closing statement, I would like to say that I really felt for Saigo in this movie, even though he was annoying at times. I just wish most Japanese soldiers were like him back in the day. Some people might point out that all I've written above might have nothing to do with "Letters from Iwo Jima", and I would say you are right. But Clint Eastwood directing a movie about Iwo Jima without depicting the other atrocities of the Japanese, would be like making a movie about a single battle in the Nazi's point of view without showing any atrocities committed from the German side, where the Nazi soldiers don't even speak about them or bring up the Holocaust. It gets the point of the movie across, but could easily misguide people about the war.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no need to go into the many superb qualities of Clint Eastwood's follow-up to Flags of Our Fathers. Generally every reviewer before has been uniformly raving about it, citing its humanizing of the Japanese, its potent anti-war message as the two greatest things.However, the movie attempts something awful, equivocating the Japanese with the American soldier. It's become a common refrain that "massacres happened on both sides". But the Japanese Imperial Army didn't just kill a few stray POWs, like was shown in this film (along with two Japanese POWs being shot by Marines who were afraid of having to watch them all night). This is the equivocation: they're just like us.But the Imperial Army wasn't just like the American Army. It's violent mistreatment of all non-Japanese, soldier and civilian alike is well documented. The Rape of Nanking, anyone? The American Armed Forces did the world a great service by defeating so utterly nations as sick with evil as Japan and Germany were at that time, nations that are now world leaders economically and socially.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointed in this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen it on Top 250 and knew that it was directed by Eastwood who had done well before. The film was billed as the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese side. It was supposed to counterpoint Flags of Our Fathers. It was more derivative than most of the 1950s and 1960s WWII films. I was sickened watching the Japanese being not portrayed as an honorable enemy, but as a bunch of cowards who were fighting each other to surrender while their commanders fought each other to issue more idiotic orders.This is about a battle where a vastly outnumbered unsupplied force held out for 35 days. Watching the movie it felt like 3-4 days and the Japanese soldiers were all calling it quits. There were almost no survivors on the Japanese side (200-600 depending upon who you are quoting). Eastwood suggests they all died from dysentery and over-zealous racist privates.Boo to you Clint Eastwood. A great film you could have made. The idea behind this film was spectacular, the actual portrayal would have made Ed Wood wince at a poorly made movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie; misleading message.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no question that Clint Eastwood's production "Letters from Iwo Jima" is an outstanding example of the art of movie making. There are many comments posted which outline this in detail. It is an edge of the seat movie, in spite of its length. And his portrayal of many Japanese soldiers in a sympathetic light is likely a realistic view of ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.My criticism is not of the production; it is instead directed at the message left with viewers. During the battle for Iwo Jima, in the story, we see a wounded lone American soldier captured by several Japanese soldiers. They wanted to kill him, without mercy, as they believed Americans would all do the same. They were ordered to give treatment, which they did, with great reluctance, and the soldier survived. In contrast, later in the story, two Japanese deserters were taken by the Amricans, and a soldier assigned to guard them violated orders, and killed them both. Later, Japanese soldiers who had been close to surrender were shown the bodies, and therefore convinced by a fanatical junior officer to fight to the death.The problem with these incidents is that the impression left with viewers is that these were typical occurrences. I am not naive, I understand the exigencies of fierce battles with insufficient resources; so, I know these things have occurred on both sides. But, it is misleading to present these incidents as they have been filmed, in that they were anomalous. As filmed, they unfairly reinforce negative stereotypes of fighting Americans, which are grossly misleading, and at a most inopportune time.We have come to expect such treatment from Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma, and others, whose political views are uncolored by facts, and whose creations do much to undermine America abroad, as well as at home. But, I expected better from Eastwood.Of course, there were, we assume, many Japanese, such as the baker, who were merely placed in situations beyond their control and even beyond their comprehension. That begs the question, "To what degree is an individual soldier responsible for his actions, when he has not even volunteered to perform military service in a great conflict?" In the United States military, we have, as I write, U.S. Marines on trial, not for summarily executing legitimate prisoners of war, but for killing civilians who were within houses from which terrorists ambushed and killed our troops. The hollowness of the charges, and apparent political forces at play, serve only to magnify the contrast between war as practiced by U.S. forces, and the atrocities committed during World War II by Imperial Japanese forces, in China, the Philippines, against American and Allied legitimate prisoners of war, and non-combatant civilians, as well.So, for me, the movie is outstanding; but, it will always cause an extra tinge of sadness, for its negative portrayal of American fighting men, who are, and have been, the most humane warriors in history. No examples of rare exceptions can negate that reality, unless viewed through the eyes of people who hate America, or those for whom our history is a mystery.~~Robert</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of Hollywood movie, because of small details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technically, this movie is well produced; it has good effects, good costumes. Also, the actors do a nice job. The characters display the same culture one finds in all serious WWII movies concerning Japanese philosophy. And the story is about an episode of the war that was very important, but not that widely know. But that's all I have to say in favor of this movie. And it's not that big a deal: good effects, good actors, etc is the least expected from a Hollywood film from a famous director.The fact is, I really didn't like this movie. Its storytelling is very confusing. The viewer has no notion of the time that passed in the story, between scenes. Sometimes, the story timeline leaps weeks, and you have no clue about it. You'll find it out minutes later, and the part of the movie where you didn't know that time had passed will remain in a blurry area of the timeline. Also, it appears rather incomplete. Some things are kept unexplained (or scarcely explained), adding to the confusion. I didn't watch Flags of our Fathers, and don't intend to, as I found this one very disappointing. If you want to see a good WWII movie, from the Japanese point of view, this is NOT the movie to watch. There are many others out there better than this one.The sad part of this movie is, it could have been great; it was spoiled by simple, small details that made a big difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Cronyism Rides Again {Horse Whinny!}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my review of FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, I mentioned that I wasn't sure if I'd be watching this flipside film based on the Japanese experience. My fears were twofold. First is that director Clint Eastwood lacks character development, and I was afraid he'd continue his trend with LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA. Second (and more recently noted within myself) is that I absolutely love TORA! TORA! TORA! Similarities between it and the new Eastwood additions cannot be denied. Although Tora focused on the Pearl Harbor attack and not Iwo Jima, it did look at both sides of the war (Japan and America.) I feared that Dirty Harry might muddy the film-waters of Tora! Tora! Tora! Thankfully the latter didn't happen, but the former trend continues.With the exception of Ken Watanabe's (MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA) portrayal of General Kuribayashi and Kazunari Ninomiya's Saigo, there were few characters with which the audience could identify. We care little for any of these doomed men simply because we don't know them well enough. The story itself is historically interesting, of course, and it's well told. But the lack of empathy viewers will have for any of the characters will likely plague this film to its bitter end.Where Tora! Tora! Tora! succeeded was not simply in its storytelling, but also in that we got in tight with everyone involved. From Martin Balsam's gruff Pacific Fleet Admiral to So Yamamura's demanding Vice-Admiral Yamamoto presence, all of the characters had some important measure within the film's scheme. Clint Eastwood seems to have had trouble doing this with two lengthy movies (Flags was 132 minutes long and Letters 141 minutes while Tora alone was just 144 minutes.) The thing I don't want to do here is disrespect (in any way) what happened on this little spit of land in the Pacific. The horrors were real and Mr. Eastwood does a fair job showing us some pretty abhorrent conditions the Japanese were subjected to. Clint Eastwood is a fine filmmaker, but he's not the finest. And this is also where I have a beef with the Oscar board members.This film is in a foreign language and yet it got nominated in the "Best Picture" category at last year's Oscars. I realize that the director is American, but that alone surely shouldn't dictate the category in which it's placed come awards time, should it? Almost all of the remaining awards ceremonies placed it in the "Foreign Language" category but not The Academy of Motion Picture Arts. A bit of cronyism going on? Banish the thought!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear Mr. Eastwood,I often cry in front of your movies. I usually never cry, but once in a while, when I come to think about the broken life of your characters, tears are sometimes about to come in my eyes. I remember Red Stoval, missing his appointment with his destiny, and dying alone like a Honkytonk Man, I remember the outlaw, Josey Whales, and his sad tale of beautiful loser, I remember Bird and his broken soul, I remember Tommy Lee Jones dying while realizing his dream at the sound of "Fly me to the moon", and of course, I remember the broken body of Maggie Fitzgerald and the pain of her coach in your last movie. Each time I think of one of this character, emotions always rise in me. But here, sitting in my theater seat in from of your last letter, nothing... I felt nothing except the feeling of watching a well documented movie about the battle of Iwo Jima, beautifully photographed in the gray tones of the island. The all characters are doomed from the start, but I never really feel emphatic for them, even thought the injustice of this war situation is palpable everywhere. I'm really sorry to say that, but, like in "Flags of our fathers", I was lost between the multiplicity of the characters, and never was able to be touched by them. I was so absorbed by the structure of the movie, the interconnection of time areas and point of views, that the destiny of Ira Hayes (the Indian of "Flags", which story might be saddest of the three...) or of Saigo (the unlucky soldier of this movie) never really interested me. There is no doubt that you made here an interesting style exercise, but still, I hope that after it, you'll turn yourself again toward individual destinies, for you're the only one to tell this American stories with such class, talent and emotion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood is not Kurosawa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, some basics. Cinema is the "Art of Movement". This is an accurate translation of "Moving Pictures". Before that, the only "moving art" was music, or the theater on a limited space. The other arts were "static" and whatever "movement" was intended it was to be recreated by the reader or spectator mind . In other words, not objective.Movement can be portrayed on a grand scale, or in small scale.. Provided that the emotion is there. The American Movies tradition was mostly on the grand scale. There are numerous exceptions to this, but the best were directed by Europeans such as Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, Fred Zinemann), The European tradition was on the small (except for some "monuments" as the English production of David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia. This had to do with financial issues, market dimension, unity of language,to name the major reasons. The English Language practice was very limited. France , Germany, Italy and Spain opted for "dubbing", which destroys the integrity of a work of art..Getting to the point. Clint Eastwood's Pictures as Director, are too slow to be American Movies.He learned his trade with Sergio Leone. A very slowly paced "Opera Director". That may, and does, work for intimate dramas. IT DOES NOT WORK FOR A WAR FILM.The Japanese characters are just too artificial..Mr. Eastwod, please retire...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Because The Film Is Anti-War, Doesn't Make It A Good Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this film has been getting praise from all kinds of critics. Personally, I am a fan of Clint Eastwood, less for his work as a director than as a producer and actor, but I truly don't understand what other people see in this film. It has all the depth of a bad "After School Special." It seems to me the praise is based on a logical fallacy. It goes like this, the film is about a laudable subject, therefore, it must be a good film. However, this is poppycock. You can make a dumb film about a good subject. The honors it is getting remind of all the anti-Nazi films that get praised for no other reason than they are anti-Nazi, like the morally reprehensible Life Is Beautiful.I can only see this film impressing the kind of idiots who are surprised to learn that some Japanese soldiers were actually honorable men who loved dogs and missed their families. If you firmly believe in the old style WWII movies which often portrayed the Japanese as buck-toothed, yellow men with thick eye-glasses who were forever mixing their R's and their L's, than Letters From Iwo Jima may be an eye opener, but anyone who knows anything about the history of WWII, or has even a smidgen of knowledge about Japan should really look at this film and just laugh. I thought I was going to choke to death from laughter when the one soldier, an elite from the highest ranks of the Japanese military (now busted down to a private) started crying when he heard the letter from the dead American boy's mother and it so touched his heart, he immediately wanted to surrender. Am I the only one who thought this was ridiculous?The only thing this movie showed that has been missing from most other films about WWII was the showing of American soldiers shooting unarmed POW's. That did come as a shock to some in the audience I saw the film with, but you have to remember, that was rare and it certainly isn't US policy. But lets be adults here; in wartime, things like that happen. It is true that the Japanese were consistently more brutal toward their POW's, than we were, but that is no excuse for us to be brutal in return. However, it might open some people's eyes to one of the real truths about war. Brutalities are committed by all sides.Another thing I disliked about this film was the odd washed out look. I don't mind a film shot in Black and White, but for God's sake, make it real Black and White, not some muted half assed color. I was thoroughly annoyed by the cheap and very false looking Flags Of Our Fathers and this companion piece is no better. I have seen DP Tom Stern's work before and I can't figure out what they were trying to achieve with the dingy look Letters had. At least the island of Iwo Jima looked a little more realistic in Letters than it did in Flags, which had so much digital process work in it, they might just as well have put up a painted backdrop. It's really hard to feel awe looking at the US flag on Mt. Suribachi when the special effects are so lame all I can think of is a bad video on You Tube.I don't doubt that some Japanese soldiers discovered upon actually meeting the Americans that everything that they were told to believe about us was mostly wrong and that this came as a shock to some of them. Likewise, many Americans discovered that Japanese culture was far more complex and wonderful than they had previously imagined. But to think that the reading of a boys letter from his mother was the key to get some tough Jap soldiers all weepy eyed while they are fighting on Iwo Jima just doesn't seem believable in movie terms. There are some things that can happen in real life that don't work in movies. If you want an explanation of that theory, check out William Goldman's book, Adventures In The Screen Trade for a description. Overall, Letters From Iwo Jima is long, tedious and rather lumpy in structure. It's not as annoying as its companion piece Flags Of Our Fathers which never got the flashback, flash-forward structure quite right. This film has minimal flashbacks and that works a bit better. Still, if you want to learn a lesson about how to portray an enemy as honorable without reducing them to a weepy stereotype, check out Das Boat. That was a film that truly made you feel for the German sailors without hammering any spurious emotions over your head. That film even managed to have the protagonists killed by the Americans at the end and made you feel sorry for them. Did anyone working on this film ever see Das Boat? Eastwood must have, he made In The Line Of Fire with the director Wolfgang Petersen. This film was a thoroughly obvious morality lesson which marred any real attempt at drama. The cast of unfamiliar Japanese actors was good though; I look forward to seeing some of them again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Letters from Iwo Jima</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The same year, 2006, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Clint Eastwood directed Flags of Our Fathers, same setting of World War II, only difference being was it being English language. This Japanese language film sees the Imperial Japanese Army on the island of Iwo Jima desperate to stop the country falling into the hands of the American army. Command is given to Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and prepares for the incoming attack, but all the soldiers pretty much know that the war is lost for them. Young soldier and baker Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya) is the protagonist of the film with a will to survive the army itself and going through the harsh battles. Also starring Tsuyoshi Ihara as Baron Nishi, Ryo Kase as Shimizu, Shidou Nakamura as Lieutenant Ito, Hiroshi Watanabe as Lieutenant Fujita, Takumi Bando as Captain Tanida and Yuki Matsuzaki as Nozaki. I will be honest, it is only the battles that are the big hook of the film, all the gun play, explosions and blood shed are what kept me watching, and that's not a bad thing. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Worth watching!</fullReview>

Upsetting the status quo he's more interested in preparing defenses that will slow the Americans down rather than give a glorious death (an absolute certainty anyway) to the men in his command. When the attack begins its a cruel nasty battle as both sides are forced to fight for survival.I have to confess I'm not in love with this movie. Certainly its a well made film with a stellar performance from Ken Watanabe, but for me it reminded me of other, and yes better, films. This isn't to say it isn't affecting and eye opening. The look at the fight to the death mentality that many Japanese had is full evidence, and I'm sure that for many Western viewers its very revealing, as was the "villain as hero" idea. However I didn't find it anything new since the Japanese themselves have been dealing with many of the same themes and issues in their own films. The 2005 film Yamato covered much of the same ground (the battleship is sent on a suicide mission to stop, or at least delay American forces) however while we see the Japanese fight to the end code in action, we also come to understand why the soldiers and sailors would follow it and why you don't leave your buddies. I was deeply moved by the earlier film, much more so than this film.I'm sure that much of the praise of this film came from its bookending with Flags of Our Fathers which shows the battle from the American point of view. I think the straight forwardness of the film (its the story of the battle with a few flashbacks) was a welcome relief to those who didn't like the narrative complexity of the earlier film. (To be honest this is pretty much a throw back to an old Hollywood war film but with Japanese as the heroes instead of the Americans) Without a doubt this is a really good film. And if you're so inclined you really should take a look at it, especially if you've seen Flags of Our Fathers. I don't think its as great as the numerous awards would indicate, but it is a damn fine way to spend two hours and twenty minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>shades of brown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have had color movies for an awful long time now, but still Hollywood insists in making "sepia" toned color for anything set more than 10 years ago. In an effort to achieve realism we have Japanese dialog, authentic uniforms, weapons, equipment etc, however real vivid color didn't exist prior to 1990 as far as Hollywood is concerned. Strong colors in the film are washed out and faded, uniforms and costumes become a boring brown, or muted grays and blues. Using brown and muted pastel shades to give an historical setting seems to have become an unfortunate cliché of the modern movie industry. It just makes everything look fake. When will movie makers wake up and realize that color needs to be authentic to?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, there was superb acting. Yes, the English subtitles were a novelty. Yes, the battlefields were haunting. Where were the soldiers? I agree that the film tried to dwell on the personal emotions of selected personalities, but having seen war footages of the actual battle for Iwo Jima, I kind of found the smallness of the focus disturbing.I would not have wanted anything of the scale of Saving Private Ryan, although even that would have helped satiate my need for realism, but there was just nothing in terms of the way the war was really fought, i.e. on a huge scale and, fierce, nay savage! This is not to say the film was bad. On the contrary, it was well-done in many ways. But overall it seemed pretty much like a "stage" version of the real thing, meaning it was just too scaled down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really quite disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I expected a lot from this. I got fine acting and cinematography, but, wow, I guess the directing just stunk. This tried to do too much and ended up not doing enough of any of it. Too many characters, too little development. Too many flashbacks, and really, only 1 or 2 made the point sufficiently. I guess I'd say "You cannot build (a dozen) characters in a war movie through flashbacks of back-home scenes." Somehow the reverse seemed to work well for Deer Hunter, but this just didn't' work here. For example, the Olympic equestrian champ ... was that character development? The "Oh, you better watch out for your insubordinate underlings" ... then no further development. Was the fact that they ordered their men to "die with honor" supposed to be fulfillment of that little subplot? I could go on, but hey, at least Clint tried.As for those that think every anti-war film is treasure, use your brain. I'm not exactly a pacifist, but I'd gladly wear an "Anti-War" t-shirt. But that doesn't mean I don't know the shades of gray. For example, IMDb chooses to use this little ditty as the #1 comment on this flick "Virtually all of the uber-patriotic tendencies that were rampant in Imperial Japan during WWII were also in Nazi Germany and, as both "Flags" and "Letters" demonstrate in the United States as well. People were used for the purpose of the government and were fed propaganda just the same. Maybe in a different form, but in the end it is all the same.""In the end it is all the same"?????????? Hello??? Anybody home up there?? That comes from one of the "cult of victimization" blockheads that cannot tell the difference between someone who attacks, who starts a war, and someone who defends them-self. Right now, this blockhead is out carrying a sign hoping we'll send big bucks to Gaza to buy Big Macs for the people who voted Hamas into office and then faced the (obvious) consequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's, "Letters From Iwo Jima," is a brilliantly made film that is up for Best Picture at the Academy Awards this Sunday. It has already won the Golden Globe for Best Picture. Nonetheless, it is a terribly misleading film.Most people today do not realize that there were really two Holocausts of World War II. There was the one perpetrated by the Germans against the Jews. The lesser known one was committed by the Japanese against the Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, and Vietnamese.In this second Asian Holocaust, 17 million humans, most of them noncombatants, were slaughtered in ways not used since medieval times. These victims were exterminated by imposed starvation, slave labor, and brutal executions by Japanese soldiers. It's these Japanese soldiers that are the focus of the film.Washed away with Mr. Eastwood's new vision is the fact that the Japanese were never attacked in this war but carried out their own war of unimaginable aggression across all of Asia. Washed clean is the fact that this was not a war committed by a small group of leaders, but a war that needed and received the unquestioning support of the entire Japanese society, which blindly followed its leaders. In Clint Eastwood's film, though, we see none of this.Instead, we see the battle of Iwo Jima through the eyes of benign Japanese soldiers who wait in fear of the enormous American invasion force in bunkers and caves. More to the point, we hear their thoughts from the letters they wrote as last testaments with the knowledge that they would never see their families again.Although there is great value in understanding the humanity of these Japanese soldiers, Mr. Eastwood misses the larger picture of what these men actually participated in. In an interview on National Public Radio's program "Fresh Air" with Terry Gross, Mr. Eastwood described these soldiers as conscripts not unlike the young Americans who fought against them. "They didn't want to be there," Mr. Eastwood said, "any more than the American Marines wanted to be there." No doubt many, if not most, Japanese defenders of the tiny island were loving husbands and sons who wanted nothing more than to be back home. We can imagine that within the large Japanese army there were saints and thugs ? as there are in every army, including our own.But any other similarities between the American military in World War II and the Japanese are very limited. Americans did not come from a death culture ? the idea of committing suicide for Franklin Roosevelt when all was lost seems as implausible today as it did back then. Yet, Japanese casualty rates ran between 97% in Saipan and 99.7% in Tarawa, meaning very few Japanese ever surrendered.As I look at a photo of Mr. Eastwood taken during the filming of "Letters from Iwo Jima," in which he dons a Japanese army hat from that era, I wonder if the director understands just what that hat represents to people throughout Asia above the age of 80? I also can't help but wonder if he would have worn a Nazi hat with a swastika if his film showed us D-Day from the German perspective. If that comparison sounds harsh, it only demonstrates an extreme lack of knowledge of the war.In any month in the first half of 1945, upwards of a quarter-of-a-million Asian men, women, and children were dying at the hands of the Japanese. Many women were gang raped by Japanese troops before they were butchered. That's really no longer war. It's genocide.But in September of 1945, the Asian death rate drops to zero ? and stays at zero. When Japan is finally forced to halt its ambitions of conquest and when its army goes home, the entire orgy of death stops. It's that simple.The end of this slaughter comes to a halt because of the 18- and 19-year-old Americans who stormed those awful beaches. Yes, there were teenagers on both sides. But they were not the same by any means. That is the ultimate lesson ? the one that, sadly, is not taught by anyone anymore, including Mr. Eastwood.BY WARREN KOZAK</fullReview>

(of course those who surrendered).What the Japanese invoke to justify their war ?: "defend their mother land". Well, apart from their unprovoked attack on the US, their motherland conquered most of Asia leaving 20 millions death (mostly civil).Ignorance is not an excuse for their murders.What war does Clint Eastwood describe in this movie ?</fullReview>

But aside from that it was no different than every other Hollywood war movie. Was I supposed to be moved by the conflicts and characters? There was no reason for this to go on for 2+ hours either. Some of the violence seemed to be gratuitous, just to show the war part. I feel like the stuff done in here was done for the sake of proving a point, not in the natural order of making the film. Like explaining the punchline of a joke without giving the listener a chance to get it on their own.This only furthered my reluctance to go see studio films -- they all follow the same format. I am a history teacher, one who has been studying the anti-American perspective of wars, yet this film was not moving at all.Boring and banal -- or in layman's terms, same old, same old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>seriously overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Letters from Iwo Jima' is a tired and predictable attempt at a war movie from a Japanese perspective. It looks and feels small scale and underwhelming. The actors struggle with the one-dimensional script - everything is so black and white, a recurring theme in Eastwood's films. It's difficult to believe the script was written by a Japanese writer: it feels like it has been churned out by a believer in all things stereotypically Japanese. There's no real sense of the scale of the conflict either and no discussion of why parties on all sides (including Japanese civilians also hiding in the caves - not shown in the film) feared and dehumanised the other side. The Japanese suicides (again, civilians were left out in the film: many took their own lives rather than be captured) was due as much to a substantiated belief that they would be executed once captured anyway than to the notion of dying with honour intact. The silly ending to the film only highlights this lack of realism, trying to neatly package something both Japanese and American audiences can feel comfortable taking home when what is actually required is a deeper and less settling discussion of the roots of why, particularly in the east, there is still distrust of Japan and Japanese culture due the atrocities its army committed leading up to and during WW2.</fullReview>

Someone, or some company, seems to want the the world to think the Japanese and Americans fought WWII the same way. Atrocities, of course, happened on both sides, but the Japanese history of mass killings (estimated at up to 30 million), chemical and biological warfare use, torture of POWs, cannibalism, forced labor, use of "comfort women", and looting during the 30s and 40s reflects a culture with a complete disregards for all who aren't Japanese.

		<fullReview>i have read quite a lot about ww II including the book, flags of our fathers. this movie was not very realistic if what i have read is true. these men were put on this island to die. they fought to the death and were particularly brutal when capturing an American soldier alive. u.s. soldiers were usually tortured and killed despite the fact that they were unarmed or disarmed when captured(this was only shown twice in the movie, once done by Japanese soldiers and once by American soldiers). in some passages i have read, the Japanese cut the u.s. soldier's genitals off and put them in the u.s. soldier's mouth as a humiliation tactic. the Japanese soldiers depicted in this movie were almost always reluctant to fight. some committed suicide instead of fighting (which i agree probably happened but not to the extent it was portrayed). there was not time frame with this movie. the battle took 36 days to complete but the movie made it seem like it was less than a week. the Japanese almost always stayed underground to fight. in this movie, they showed the Japanese coming out of their caves several times. there are more inconsistencies, go to iwojima.com for more details about the REAL battle.</fullReview>

Honestly though, Clint Eastwood directing war movies doesn't work. His two films were weak. I watch other movies like Saving Private Ryan and Windtalkers and those movies really do show the brutality of war. Flags and Letters didn't really do the same.Eastwood is a terrific actor.

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood frames Letters from Iwo Jima in much the same style as Flags of Our Fathers--with almost no color, not black and white but a sort of sepia gray. As such, it fits perfectly as a companion piece but leaves a bit to be desired stylistically. In other words, we've seen it already. Did the Japanese really look at Iwo Jima as blandly as the U.S. did? Also, the gore is absolutely excessive. After about the hundredth suicide by grenade, it no longer seems like the gore is making a point about the insanity of the old Japanese traditions. It was pretty much clear from the first self-induced explosion. The character moments, in foxholes or flashbacks, come across as typically sappy war movie pathos, as well. Everyone leaves family behind. Nobody wants to be under fire. War is hell, always has been, and movies will continue to confirm it for anyone who might doubt. In this case, though, Letters only shows that for all the different perspective the other side of a war could have, it's the same old movie clichés.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Imperial Japanese were many things, but they weren't stupid. Why would the Japanese General, who, as portrayed in this movie, knew full well that the Japanese Navy and air power had been decimated at Marianas and Truk Lagoon, bring his prize Olympic show horse to Iwo Jima? Iwo Jima is completely open to U.S. attack, and when the Americans carpet bomb the island and the horse gets killed, we are all supposed to go "awwwww".Before and during WWII, the Japanese military terrorized other Asian countries and murdered civilians and POWs. What they did was bad enough! Why portray something that they did NOT do? They did NOT terrorize average Japanese citizen/subjects or shoot their pets for failing to fly the flag. Maybe they harassed domestic dissidents. Portray that instead! After he killed the dog, the lines of the officer of the Japanese version of Gestapo or Soviet KGB/NKVD spoken to the junior officer went something like, "if you can't shoot a dog, how are you going to shoot the Reds?"Spielberg was involved with this movie. Would he ever have a Soviet KGB/NKVD agent in the same situation say, "if you can't shoot a dog, how are you going to shoot Christians?" The positive aspect of the movie is that the Japanese and American soldiers were portrayed as human beings, some with more good than bad qualities, and vice-versa. This is the human condition, good and bad in the same organization. Would Spielberg ever dare show the human qualities of soldiers who fought for the Nazis? Somehow I doubt it.Japanese defenders of Iwo Jima undoubtedly committed suicide when their situation became hopeless. But the way this is portrayed in the movie is hokey.Overall, a potentially meaningful movie that was ruined by hokeyness.</fullReview>

Until now, I've never seen a war movie whose main characters are incompetent pencil-pushing general, coward, and surrendering soldiers that could make the French army proud.I'm a first generation of East-Asian-American and am quite familiar with Japanese military culture and history. Simply put, this movie portrays perhaps the worst of Japanese soldiers. Sure, there were cowards in Japanese army, as in any army for that matter, but that had to be a tiny tiny minority. Why would you make a movie about that tiny minority of coward soldiers? You could show courage, sacrifice, and heroism of men and women in uniform and at the same time show casualty and inhumane nature of war, as in "Finding Private Ryan" and "We were Soldiers". This movie only shows what happens when a incompetent general and coward soldiers team up: disaster.</fullReview>

Maybe the technical aspects of this film are excellent but the way the Japanese are portrayed is absolute appeasement. The Japanese were cruel, monstrous enemies not just killing but torturing American prisoners in numerous ways. They cut the penises off U.S. Marines, stuffed them in their mouths and then proceeded to slowly kill them. They shot arrows into B-29 crewmen while forcing their fellow airman to watch. They used American servicemen for medical experiments which killed them. This film shows nothing of this. The U.S. did kill Japanese rather then take them prisoner and burn them out of caves with flame throwers but we never tortured them. This is just one of many Hollywood films that twists history. It didn't win the Oscar it was nominated for but I wonder if Mr. Eastwood received a new Toyota and a Sony flat screen plasma TV for his efforts. I would sure like to tell him my feelings face to face. He did a very good job with Flags of Our Fathers though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Letters from Iwo Jima Clint EastwoodI wanna be Ken Watanabe.True, I just like the way that rhymes ? but there is sincerity behind the quip. Gravitas, physical grace, a terrifically intimidating stare ? Mr. Watanabe saved The Last Samurai from silliness and I regret I don't know his full body of work. But I know enough to say he has great star power and I believe his best English speaking roles are still ahead of him. He anchors Letters from Iwo Jima as effectively as it can be anchored.Now, I will tell you that I know a smart and beautiful woman that seems to believe that any movie she can read, is surely a great film. But as lovely as she is- if she offered to sit through this with me again and read the English subtitles to this Japanese language film, I would not go. To appreciate how strong a statement I just made I will share with you that I was recently described as a fatheaded troglodyte who's calling may be professional bowling (despite having only bowled twice in the past 18 years ? I think the reference must be to the cultural milieu she sees me fitting in best).Needless to say, I don't pass up trips to the pictures with a beauty very lightly.The movie is simply neither fish nor fowl. Two Hours and twenty minutes gives it epic length, but it avoids the grandiose in nearly every other way. It is neither "we lucky band of brothers" nor "war is hell." The palette is so effectively army green that it nearly looks black and white. However, I was neither depressed nor uplifted by the end.So as cool as Ken Watanabe is and as a masterful director as Clint Eastwood is - I can't, in good conscience, (I suppose you could consider me a conscientious objector to this war movie) send you to either the theater or the video store for this one.MySpace.com/200WordCritic</fullReview>

Yes, it is true that war is not all ugly, and there can be some kindness in it, but how can you make a movie about a famous battle, and not include the most famous part of that battle? It's a part of history that the Japanese were cruel to some, not all, but definitely some of their POW's, so why show them as being totally human and merciful when they really weren't? Clint has always made excellent movies, Heartbreak Ridge, Million Dollar Baby, The Unforgiven, Mystic River, and I have to say, Letters from Iwo Jima isn't in that class because although the movie was beautifully made, it paints a half-truth of history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood makes dull movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood's adaptation of "Flags of Our Fathers" was a great disappointment to me. The book put the story in chronological order, but Eastwood decided to hop all over the place creating nothing but confusion as I watched the film, and I read the book! He didn't identify who was voicing-over most of the time. Were they actors or real survivors? He seemed to be following the style of "Band of Brothers" in that regard, but he failed miserably. It's like he couldn't decide on the central theme of the movie, so he tried to cover every angle.So I admit I went into "Letters from Iwo Jima" with low expectations. I found the movie to be very dull. The subject matter of World War II, and more specifically the Pacific war, is very interesting to me, and yet I could still not get into this movie. It was overly dramatic throughout most of the film, concluding with the shot when they find the letters buried in a cave, lift them out, and they flutter to the ground. There were no highs and lows to the storytelling, just melodrama with mood music behind it. Critics and the public seem to be lapping up Eastwood's directorial works because he's turned into such a "sensitive guy", different from his on screen persona. And he seems to have responded by giving them sappier and more politically correct works. Well, I'm not buying it.For the record, I didn't like "Unforgiven" either, and I never saw "Million Dollar Baby." At this point, you'd have to PAY ME a million dollars to go see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dismal direction and script equals flop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is supposed to be an account of the Japanese side during island warfare of World War II. It is told mostly through the eyes of a general and a lowly soldier. This should have been a great movie. Instead, horrible writing and directing make this a disaster. First, the directing. In a movie like "Unforgiven", Eastwood attempts to make the audience feel empathy for a "killer of women and children". It never worked for me, because I can't do it, but he made a valiant attempt. He dotted his "i"s and crossed his "t"s. He used guile and methods which shown ability as a director. He doesn't do it here. First, the subtitles are horrible. They work in very few movies. It is better to dub in words, unless you're dealing with an extremely good story, which this isn't. The subtitles aren't below the screen, but on the film itself, and may contrast well with a dark backdrop one second, and then blend in with a white one immediately after. The human eye cannot adjust in time. Anyone who says they can adjust and read that fast is lying. period. It only gives the viewer a headache. Eastwood tries very hard to emulate the classic Japanese directors, even going so far as using black and white. I don't think the "black and white" is a factor either way, good or bad. However, in a classic like "The Seven Samurai", we are given nonstop action, and characters we care deeply about, and engaging situations. Here, he plods through in a very tedious way, lumbering through a movie that seems 6 hours long. If you watch it, you'll see what I mean. It plods and plods, which is a negative, and a super negative for a war movie. Then there is the writing. It is a very contrived script. And poorly written in many ways. First, it follows the Hollywood precepts. Married men are treated with kid gloves and given the best facades. This is typical Hollywood since usually couples see movies-either married men or men with women who expect them to be married. Most everything is extremely predictable. The characters are paper thin, which isn't always bad in a war movie. However, this movie gives the pretense of depth, and fails to live up to it. It isn't horribly written, but does look like it was written by a high schooler. A lot of what are supposed to be "good character references", such as the officer using specific instances in speaking of his home life, actually come off as looking written instead of being natural. The writer tries, but is not gifted. Then there's the delicate subject of Humanity from the Japanese. We all like to believe they were humane, and certainly a number were, but what percentage? Even on a liberal scale, no one who knows History would consider more than a third of the Japanese as having humane feelings during that time. This may sound horrible, but unfortunately, some eye witnesses are still alive and can attest to the facts. You just have to rewrite too much of History. And a script claiming to having depth and historical accuracy should not rewrite History this much. A lot of people can't wait for all the witnesses to die, so they can rewrite History, but now we have the History Channel to record the accounts. Clearly, not all Japanese soldiers were monsters. However, almost all of the officers were. Just because they could hobnob with the rich in peace time, some people think they were humane. Were the lowly soldiers humane? They just followed instructions. Discipline was important to them. In any event, World War II was not a time of great introspect for anyone. We still think of life in modern terms, when we have time to be so introspective. In the 1940's the world was survival oriented. Clearly a gross misrepresentation of facts. The truth is there often is good and evil, black and white. World War II was one example. Of course there were instances of Americans killing Japanese prisoners, but it was always after they witnessed atrocities committed by the Japanese, not like the situation depicted in the movie, in which they are killed just because a grunt is bored. Very Hollywood, and extremely inaccurate. Eastwood doesn't even have the American soldiers acting out of revenge. Pitiful, Mister Eastwood. You can't act, and now you're trying to prove you can't direct. There are worse war movies, maybe most movies of recent years aside from Platoon (by recent, I mean since the drastic change at about 1975). However, if you want to see a good war movie, you probably still have to get one from before the modern era. This film is not a step in the write direction. In fact, it is not a step in any direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>War is so much simpler...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie isn't suppose to be a drama in this kind of proportion. Sure it should introduce us with the fate of the main protagonists of the movie, but to base the whole movie on this factor?! The result was, at least I got that impression, the ever increasing boredom which consumes the plot and distances us from the main storyline and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, from the fundamental element about this film should have been about- WAR. War is a simple thing- people who kill each other for the politic conducted by a small political elite - Period!!! I don't want to know about (cheesy and badly done) backgrounds of soldiers and generals (at least do it well and authentic if your filming it) which tore apart the plot and ontology of this movie. I was actually Fast-Forwarded or physically skipped those parts trying to catch the war-essence of this flick. Sadly, my efforts where in vain. The historical shortcomings I won't even bother to mention :) The only credit I have to give to this movie is the main idea of a story about 'the other side', too bad it will only stay as an idea (Maybe Spielberg will make a film about the German soldiers, not Nazis; very doubtful but still :) ) My advice to Clint: '' Go back filming intimate and individual dramas! Stay away from war movies ;)''</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so the point was???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the movie was supposed to be from the Japanese point of view, why did it have such an American flavor? Aside from the fact that they spoke Japanese and hailed the emperor every now and then (usually before their deaths) the soldiers (and by that I mean the 4 or 5 men that were the "main characters") had a very western (American even) attitude. All right general Kuribayashi spent some years in America, and was obviously quite impressed by their open-mindedness, thus becoming a sworn enemy of the "honorable death" (a.k.a. suicide), but "everything happens in threes"???? Oh please! This guy (I mean the real general Kuribayashi) committed a battalion of troops to defensive positions just off the beaches, to appease those in the Japanese High Command. American naval gunfire and intense air support would wipe out nearly all of these defenders before the first LVTs touched the volcanic ash of the Iwo shore. He sent a battalion of troops to suicide!!!...but he bothered to save the life of one soldier...twice....right....very touching. And what was the brilliant idea behind those cheesy flashbacks the general had? Yes America is the promised Land and all but could you please cut down on the happy faces, modern cars and fancy banquets?! I must say however that the best scene was the flashback of the former Kempeitai guy! It was so corny and fake I couldn't even laugh about it. I guess no animals were harmed during the making of the Letters...or were they...? All right so, "Letters from Iwo Jima" tells the story of the battle from the perspective of the Japanese, except they were Americans that looked and talked Japanese...very weird. So the lesson here would be...that the Japanese = Americans...was that the big metaphor? That the Japanese are also human...or the Americas are...or what? What was the metaphor behind the cowardly baker that (OBVIOUSLY) survived the battle? Was he too innocent...or clumsy to die? In my opinion the Japanese were put in a very bad light in this movie. Yes they were dedicated to their country/emperor, yes they all went there to die, but they acted like friggin' Lemmings! (over 80 % of the Japanese in this movie died very stupidly). All in all this movie was AWFUL! It started of great...good visual effects, creating a very Iwo Jiman atmosphere, the Japanese actually spoke Japanese, the narration is in the form of a letter adressed to a loved one...very good! Sadly it become very dry and pointless about 15 minutes into the movie. The ending also leaves you with a sense of emptiness...and one question burning inside your skull: What was the point of this movie??? Deriving from that question: What did Clint want to say with/in this movie? Was can we learn from it? Was it supposed to say anything at all?In my opinion, STAY AWAY FROM IT! ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not What I Would Call A "Great" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really wanted to rate this one higher out of respect for the material, but just couldn't. No story. No real "hook" that puts the viewer inside the minds of the characters. Too many clichés. When the historical facts are so vivid there needs to be less predictability in the story. The film is also too long, for no real reason. Nothing was gained by the additional footage (as far as story is concerned).Top notch technical work and acting all around. I give greatest marks to sound design, but the use of coloring in the battle scenes is extraordinary as well.Watanabe is a treasure, but he is woefully underused in the second half of the film and again, the underlying charm of the man is lost in the context, so why bother? I just didn't feel it, though the script was sure trying to make me. I blame the Haggis factor. He's just too damned PC for my taste.I'm not ignoring the underlying theme of sacrifice that Eastwood is working here. The film does resonate when looked at in light of our current troubles. Ultimately, I just wasn't moved by the plight of the Japanese soldiers (and that may well have been the intention)and found myself wondering why the US and the Japanese allowed their governments to slaughter so many hundreds of thousands of young men over a few islands when the Japanese were already defeated. Perhaps the film's fleeting insight into the indoctrination of the Japanese by their overlords will be valuable to some. It is hardly prominent, however. A real disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clumsy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has anyone connected with this film ever been to war? I doubt it. No matter what army he belongs to, I cannot imagine any officer saying within earshot of the men he commands, "They'll probably not get out of here alive." But in "Letters" that's what one Japanese officer tells another as he walks past his men digging tunnels. The Japanese force on Iwo Jima may have sensed defeat, but I doubt that its officers would treat honor and discipline so cavalierly. Has anyone connected with this film ever worked on a road gang? dug ditches? I doubt that too. The tunnels on Iwo Jima seem to get excavated overnight by unseen forces. We see maybe 20 seconds of a man picking away at the mountainside with a pick-ax, and hardly making a dent. Ironically, the digging of trenches, soon abandoned, is much more labor-intensive and gets longer visual treatment.Brief scenes showing U.S. marines also come off badly. How can a pair of them light up cigarettes a short distance from a tunnel occupied by the enemy and not be blown up by the enemy? When these marines talk among themselves, they sound like seminary graduates -- not a dirty swear word within miles.Director Eastwood is no realist when he maneuvers his actors in a scene; he's after the Big Meaning he wants the scene to convey. This tendency fuels the most embarrassing scene in the entire film, the one in which the Japanese soldiers in the cave listen to the reading of the letter from an American mother. As the words are translated into Japanese, the exhausted, downhearted recruits slowly rise, one by one, to their feet and stand in awe of the new message from America: "Do what you think is right". It's as if they've suddenly found Jesus at a revival meeting. Hogwash. The Japanese were educated to believe in and die for their Emperor. It would take the dropping of the A-bomb and the American occupation of their country before the Japanese would change the ethical basis life, honor and self-respect.The film has the peculiar flaw of leaving its characters in the dust and leaving us in the dark as to their fate. What happens to the Japanese soldier who ties anti-tank mines to his body but never encounters a U.S. tank? We see him take off the mines, and walk off in disgust. End of story? And what actually befalls the main character Saigo when the U.S. marine brings him down with his rifle butt? Is he just knocked out, or is he killed? I for one wanted to know the fate of this very important character.It's the roles of Saigo and General Kuribayashi that, along with the cinematography, make this film worth seeing. As portrayed by Kazunari Ninomiya and Ken Watanabe, respectively, they rise above the fuzzy military ambiance created by Eastwood and writers Yamashita and Haggis and pierce the heart with their performances. If only the music soundtrack had reinforced their emotional drive. In a huge miscalculation, Eastwood uses instead of Japanese music a soupy, John Williams-type score that constantly reminds us viewers what we're seeing: yet another Hollywood version of events.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moving, yet very dishonest film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supposedly the story of the Japanese in their tunnels, preparing for and withering the Allied assault on Iwo Jima, the closest island to mainland Japan and the perfect base for B29 and Mustang cover squadrons had full scale invasion not been forestalled by the success of the Trinity test.The Japanese actors are good. There's always the slight tendency of Japanese to overact, as seen in many films. Eastwood keeps them in control, here, and offers us a faded, almost sepia, tone to most of the film, both to suggest the antiquity of the events and the drabness of the soil of Iwo. There is a moving scene where an American is pointlessly shot by one of the Japanese in the caves. He is quickly retrieved and one of our many Japanese heroes makes nice. "How you feelin?" Yeah, I know, we just shot your . . But "how's the wife n kids?" And a letter is found before the American, Sam, dies of his pointless wound. In reading the letter aloud, translated for his men into Japanese, one finally sees it dawning on the mind-numbed Imperialist grunts that Americans are people, too. But it is profound.Apart from that, it's a low budget film that couldn't show much. Iwo Jima, means Sulpher Island. It was the site of a huge sulpher mine, which tunnels honeycombed Surabachi on the south, and worked all the way to the plateau 3-4 miles north. The Allies thought of Iwo as being basically hollow. The Japanese weren't on Iwo - they were in Iwo. And Eastwood does keep them in the tunnels, save that the tunnels and caverns in Eastwood's vision are - huge, cavernous, not at all like they really were, or like any mine would be. The Japanese added much more to the tunnels. But the film suggests that nothing substantial already existed - no mine shafts, etc. I don't know what Eastwood was trying to do with that omission. Perhaps as with so much of the actual history, Eastwood could have cared less.So the omissions continued. The island's commander is portrayed in a Saintly fashion in the film. But he was a fanatic, who wanted his soldiers to kill every American, not to win a battle - which he knew he'd never win (and which fact Eastwood lies about) - but to send a message that Americans would face such terrorism and fanaticism in any mainland invasion. So Japanese on the island would fake surrender, holding live hand grenades. Obviously, Eastwood found it inconvenient in portraying his Japanese 'Saints' to show this. Other Japanese strapped explosives to their bodies, and similarly walked out with white flags. Eastwood doesn't show this. He does show Americans taking care with a corpse. But nowhere in the movie is a corpse shown being booby-trapped. We're almost left to say to the screen - foolish Americans, why would you think heroic and Saintly Japanese would booby-trap dead bodies - foolish Americans.What we do see, however, is Eastwood's foolish attempt to find some equivalence between the behavior of forces under a flag of free nations and that of tyrannical Imperialism. Clearly, Japanese engaged in atrocities, and are shown mercilessly stabbing an unarmed American captive in their tunnels, even in the film. But then Eastwood invents a scene where two Japanese, healthy soldiers more or less, wave the white flag and peacefully offer themselves up. The American platoon moves on, but leave two to guard the captives. Instead, those left behind ruthlessly gun down the two unarmed Japanese. See - those foolish Americans. They're just as bad as the Imperialists. Don't you see? It's right there in the movie.But I have never heard of such happening on Iwo. Maybe at the liberation of a certain Nazi death camp. But not on Iwo.Indeed, the Japanese are portrayed as mostly helpless captives of the Japanese secret police and a few fanatical commanders. But the troops, while old men and boys, and peppered with new units, were eager to assault Allied troops just as ordered. It was said that most all those Japanese captured alive were too weak to pull a pin, or squeeze a trigger. No so in this film. Heck, most of the Japanese troops are looking for a way to run over the hill and surrender - at least in Eastwood's history.Because it is so dishonest, one has to recommend against the film. It looks good. The acting is believable. There is that one moving scene. But the story being told does a disservice to BOTH Japanese and Allies who fought for that island. The truth be told - Eastwood's film is simply a lie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an incomplete story **possible spoiler**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood left a crucial bit of evidence out of both this movie and flags of our fathers. from the flags of our fathers book, pp 344-36...john Bradley: "my buddy was a guy from Milwaukee. we were pinned down in one area. someone else fell injured and i ran to help out, and when i came back my buddy was gone. i couldn't figure out where he was. i could see all around, but he wasn't there. and nobody knew where he was. "a few days later someone yelled that they;d found him. they called me over because i was a corpsman. the Japanese had pulled him underground and tortured him. His fingernails...his tongue...it was terrible. I've tried so hard to forget this. "and then i visited his parents after the war and just lied to them. 'he didn't suffer at all' i told them. 'he didn't feel a thing, didn't know what hit him.' i just lied to them"cliff Langley: Langley told me it looked to him as though Ralph ignatowski had endured just about every variety of physical cruelty imaginable."both his arms were fractured...they just hung there like arms on a broken doll. he had been bayoneted repeatedly. the back of his head had been smashed in.John Bradley: "jim wants us to come visit him (in Tokyo). they tortured my buddy. the Japanese stuffed his penis in his mouth. i'm not too interested in going to japan."it might be understandable to leave this out of letters from Iwo Jima if you are trying to bring a Japanese perspective to the screen for the first time. but to leave it out of flags of our fathers and Letters from iwo jima is at best historically irresponsible and at worst a blatant sign of political purpose. leaving this passage in, in either movie, would have gone a long way towards portraying both sides more accurately.when eastwood leaves this out, it actually makes it less likely that people will respond to the Japanese side of the story. it will be seen as disrespectful to American suffering during the war, and make people more resistant to the multicutlural approach Eastwood is trying. rather than telling a story that hasn't been told, he is telling a story that never existed and dividing the races even further.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it screams: low budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all let me say that I have a thing for the epic pictures. They serve very basic intentions of the cinematography: to engrave the memory which is really noble. And especially when it goes far beyond glorifying one's own country and "the letters" is a good example.The angle Eastwood chose is remarkable considering his previous work - "Flags". You get to know the Japanese culture: pride, honesty, suicide, even "the water doesn't get along with me" etc. Some scenes shock you with the cruelty. But probably that's about the black-and-white background but I couldn't help feeling something phony. It's like attending the movie-making yard where one can hear the director, actually touch the fake decorations, veneer trenches. It's like fast food burger that looks but doesn't smell. The premeditated deep idea was buried under those shortcomings. I saw it in the art-house where one suppose to meet intellectual people. But even there were giggles after about an hour watching deaths when Kuribayashi talked in English with accent: and he seems enjoying a chance to talk to a PoW. That's a war, outburst literally above the heads; that's not an ESL class! Ridiculous. I don't know enough historical details to judge the plot. But anyway at least we can remind ourselves of the toughest. Hats off for the deceased</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie shows brilliantly the dumbness of war &amp; all its atrocities from the point of view of the basic BUT decisive link: the soldiers? If "Kings" decide to make war, it's always the "common people" who did it! And when they do it, they don't want to do it again, having lived so terrible events!This movie also underlines the heroism &amp; honor as conceived in Japan: You lose your battle, your become unworthy. Ken Watanabe knows how to play an admirable doomed leader, almost a repeat from his performance in "Last Samurai".But, this movie isn't however a total masterpiece. First, I hate those colored movies. Life is in Technicolor, so drama or comedy don't gain to have bleak or flashy ambiance. Then, the movie is so totally focused on those soldiers stuck in this Iwo Jima island that for somebody like me who sums up Pacific war only with Pearl Harbour &amp; Hiroshima, I really don't understand what was happens: How far the Japanese had victories in Pacific ? Where is Iwo Jima ? Maybe this is explained in the first opus "Flags of Our Fathers", but, here, the background was definitively missing. Yet this macro history facts are useful.At last, the evolution of American war movies is interesting but the last step is lacking: indeed, you have at first the glorious victory movies (ex: "D-Day"). With "Iwo Jima", you have an respectful acknowledgment of enemy. But it is always a victory for U-S. So, the last step of this non-patriotic &amp; philosophic path would be an Hollywood war movie about a celebration of an American defeat: maybe this movie already exists but I don't have seen it.To conclude, this movie marks the anniversary &amp; mirrors a similar but personal "honorable end of life": exactly, one year ago, I lived a tremendous "victory", and then, 365 days after, I undergo the most cruel &amp; senseless defeat. But as the Japanese pride, I offered all my honor to my "winning" adversary ?.. in a letter?. Not from Iwo Jiwa, but also from a stuck &amp; painful location without no way out?..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up during WWII. Without boring details the reason the US attacked Iwo Jima was Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, New Guinea, the Bataan death march and I could go on. Sure there was a human side to the Japanese defenders. But Eastwood gets lopsided when they (the Japanese) are nice to the wounded American and the Americans savagely murder two Japanese captives. My wife and I lost it there. Darn near turned if off at that point.The movie was very good up to that point. The tension of preparing for an invasion they knew was coming was palpable. I couldn't tell whether the caves were dug in the intervening period from when the decision was made to move up onto the mountain or whether they already existed. This was left unsaid. The caves were too labyrinthine to have been dug in what appeared to be a short period of time.The acting was superb. But the Americans as faceless and savage intruders left us hollow and angry.</fullReview>

While I get your theme of movies where there's no good guys or nations, is it too obvious or is it not Academy worthy to make a movie of the real sufferers of WWII? Were the people of Asia not too strong or too proud to be of any value for Hollywood? While I must admit this country of mine is not too proud or too economically strong for your notice, you must see that any Hollywood movie, especially with your name as the director, is a strong language to all other nations? Do we need a Gandhi or a Hannibal? Why is it that the Western world idolizes the "Samurai way? Do to understand what the samurai really stood for? Are there ideologies suited for your movie tastes? I really admire you. I really do. But if you really want to make a "serous" movie without the Japanese capital (I hope this is not true) please study Asian history before you make this kind of crappy movie again. Or get some kind of military training before you make a war movie. Thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much less than meets the eye</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film has been represented as an amazing view at the battle from the Japanese point of view, it had very little new to say and was clumsily plotted and directed.For example, the island comes under aerial bombardment. The next shot shows the troops huddling in the caves under what has obviously been continuous shelling, which must come from offshore ships. We never hear of the arrival of these ships, and soon afterwards the message comes that the American fleet is on its way from Saipan. So who's offshore firing at the island? There's little connection between the scenes in the caves, which seem too much like sets, and the larger tactical situation outside. If you don't already know much about the battle, you'll be a little confused at the end of this movie. No mention of made of how long the Japanese held out (30 days), how many troops died on either side, or as to why the island was a desirable target. Not much mention was made of the lessons the commander must have taken from previous island invasions and how he used them to his advantage. More wide view shots of the approaching Americans or the Japanese positions would have helped. Even if the point of view of the common soldier was limited, he would have been aware of his location on the island and where the enemy was.As for Mount Suribachi, I had heard that napalm was dropped from aircraft, covering the mountain and asphyxiating most of the Japanese in the caves. As a result, there was very little fighting on the mountain itself. This seems at great odds with the film's depiction.Other oddities - what happened to the blood on Saigo's face from his exploding comrades? It disappears very quickly. And where was the massive effort digging the miles of tunnels must have taken? We get 10 seconds of someone picking at the face of a cliff, and in the next shot the tunnels are all done. Swell, that was easy! However, we do learn that that both Americans and Japanese have loving families and caring mothers. Huh.</fullReview>

We deserve better than this. Theater operators say its the distributors fault and if that is true then I say boycott and just simply wait till these few good movies are out in video. We in the outlying areas seem to be treated as of lesser importance and are burdened with excessive trips just to see a select movie. Recently some stars even raised their ire over distributors failings as to getting a few select films out to the public. Come on Hollywood!
